 Have had and like the fitbit.  I have owned several of their devices in the past.  I have had them all fail at about 12-18 months for whatever reason.  Fitbit has always sent a replacement.  My Charge HR 2 failed at about 16 months.  No reason -- no abuse -- just stopped charging.  Customer service offered a replacement for 25% off.  Not worth it.  I can no longer support them.  The Charge HR2 was better than earlier devices -- but it too failed in about 16 months.  I can no longer say they are worth it.  For a device that you become dependent on -- it should last longer than this considering the price.  Buyer beware.
 As a Blaze and original Charge HR owner, figured I'd try my hand at the newest Fitbit Charge 2.  Preordered from Fitbit (as well as one from Amazon).  Fitbit direct order arrived yesterday, 9/6/16.<br/><br/>Breaking the review into two parts:<br/><br/>Part One:  If you've never owned a Fitbit<br/><br/>This is the mid tier product for Fitbit.  It replaces the original best selling Charge &amp; Charge HR.  Steps, Flights, Heart Rate, Calories Burned, Connected GPS (shows a little map post workout when tied to your phone, and yes, you need to bring your phone with you on walks/runs), and notifications (as of now, just texts, calendar alerts, and displays phone number of incoming calls).  Great intro watch/tracker to be your first Fitbit.  Does pretty much everything.  Yes there are other trackers out there, and some cheaper (in some you get what you pay for).  What separates Fitbit is the software and social functions.  You won't find a better app with ease of use, not to mention with the largest userbase of trackers it's much easier to find friends and families to participate in challenges.  Read on if you want to know some of the features.<br/><br/>Part Two:  If You've Owned A Charge/Charge HR, and should you upgrade?<br/><br/>The Charge watch has been the workhorse of the fitbit line.  Worth getting a Charge 2?  In a word: YES.  Since you're familiar with the Charge already, let's go over some of the issues you may have experienced and highlights/common questions answered:<br/><br/>1)  Build Quality:  The Charge 2 is a far far superior quality than the original Charge.  Right out of the box, you'll notice how much sturdier and thicker the band feels.<br/><br/>2)  Swapping out bands is relatively easy. Once you figure out how to press on the band on each side to release, it's fairly painless. I could see someone elderly struggling with it at first.  **If you had problems with your original Charge band bubbling, the ability to swap bands and how the tracker is connected to the bands should eliminate the issues you have experienced **  Obviously way too early to make a call on how the device will hold up, but given my experience with Blaze &amp; Alta, this feels similar in build quality, if not better, and neither of those devices have suffered from bands falling apart on a wide scale.<br/><br/>3)  Width of the device is nearly identical to the original Charge/HR. The button on the left side of the device is much more pronounced (good thing).  You can give it a nice firm click, and it doesn't feel loose or cheap as some of the Charge buttons were prone to.<br/><br/>4)  SIZING:  The band itself is much longer than the original. I have always worn small in fitbit products, and found myself almost on the last hole. Something to keep in mind if you think you are on the cusp of small/large. Small likely the way to go.<br/><br/>5)  Display is nice, 4x larger than the original Charge. The font is displayed crystal clear, and is very bright.  Can see it extremely well, even in bright sunlight.  It is NOT a color screen.  The font is a bright offwhite, as opposed to the original Charge that had a soft almost blue to it.  Texts when incoming scroll across the screen.<br/><br/>6)  Overall look is sharp. Much better looking than the original.  Very sleek and elegant.  Actually looks better than the Blaze given thinner profile.<br/><br/>7)  Has a breathing/relaxation function.  Have only dabbled with this.  It actually monitors as you inhale and exhale and prompts you when to take deep breaths, etc.  More of a gimmick to me, but some may find this useful.<br/><br/>8)  Navigation is relatively easy.  When selecting specific workouts (you can customize the list in app), you hit the button on the side to get to the workout screen, then tap to cycle through them (run, weights, treadmill, elliptical, etc).  Hold the button and your workout starts.  During the workout you can cycle through metrics specific to your activity such as calories burned, heart rate, etc.  Some activities will display steps, pace,calories burned, etc.<br/><br/>9)  Menu items start with your clock face, then by pressing the button will display Heart Rate, Exercise, Stopwatch, Relax, and Alarm.<br/><br/>10)  Clock Faces:  There are seven to choose from.  Some display day &amp; date, and most have option to where when you tap the display it will cycle through stats (may display heart rate, date, steps taken, how far you are in your goals, your hourly movement reminders, etc).  BUT DOES IT HAVE SECONDS?  Yes, two of the watch faces are digital (numbers display, not hands) and have seconds displayed.  There is only one "classic" watch face with the hands, and no that one does not display a second hand.<br/><br/>11)  Notifications:  You get basic texts (no pictures of course), both SMS &amp; iMessage.  Incoming calls will display the contact and/or phone number.  And you get calendar alerts.  There is no 3rd party support at this time such as facebook, instagram, etc (The Blaze watch will be offering these soon in next software upgrade, so I guess there is hope the Charge 2 will get those as well).<br/><br/>12)  Reminders to Move:  Sit on your butt too long and it will thump you with a vibe (250 steps per hour).<br/><br/>Today I put it through its first paces with a workout.  I use it mostly for light cardio and weights.  Heart rate was spot on as it usually was with original Charge HR &amp; my Blaze.  No issues with step counting on the elliptical I used to warm it up.  I have not used the watch for 24 hours yet, so have not been able to judge the VOX/Cardio Fitness Level rating new to this device.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>- It is worth upgrading alone from the Charge/HR simply due to build quality.  Pictures do not do it justice.  As another poster on a forum where we discuss fitbit devices said, it has that "Apple" quality feel to it.  It no longer feels like a cheap rubber tracker.  The ability to swap to leather, metal, or other colored bands means you can wear this unit for any occasion if style is your thing.  It really does look great.<br/>- Monitoring of heart rate using optical sensors has never been a problem for me, and this one seems to be no different.  Obviously some folks have trouble with them due to body hair and whatnot, but the sensors on Charge HR, Blaze, and now Charge 2 seem to be spot on.  An issue I had with the original Charge was it getting "lost" when I hit higher cardio levels.  This doesn't appear to be as much of an issue this time around.  That said, this isn't a medical device, so I expect it to not be 100% all of the time.  Use it as a tool in your overall fitness profile.<br/>- The charger itself is a new clip style (looks like a staple remover), and fits over the sides of the tracker.  Fits nice and snug and snaps in.  It won't fall out of the charge (actually think that's impossible given the design).  No more worrying about it not snapping on and falling off or getting it just right.  Big improvement.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>- vibration is notably weaker than the original Charge.  May be an issue for some using it as an alarm if you're a heavy sleeper.  That said, I wore it very tight to bed last night, and it was able to wake me this morning (something I've had problems with on the Blaze from time to time).<br/>- text notifications are neat if you've never had them.  However I have a Blaze, where you can see the whole message at once.  The Charge HR slowly scrolls texts and notifications to you, which can be annoying if you're used to the Blaze.  They serve their purpose well though, and I can't ding it for this as it's a step up from the original Charge.<br/><br/>VERDICT:<br/>I reviewed it as if I were upgrading from the Charge/HR to this device.  It is a no-brainer if you've held on to your Charge/HR and not upgraded yet to the Alta or Blaze for whatever reason.  I'd rank the Charge 2 ahead of the Alta.  If money is no object, spend the extra $50 to get the Blaze simply due to the color display and easier navigation (not to mention ability to see full texts as they come in).  Otherwise, for $150, you'll be very happy to have move up from other Fitbit products.  The Blaze is their high end product at the moment, but the Charge 2 is a very close second.<br/><br/>I'll happily answer questions as I did for when I originally reviewed the Blaze out of the gate, and edit this review to reflect common questions or any issues I face as I put the device through its paces in the coming days.
 Product died 1.5 years after I bought it. After reading online all the different troubleshooting options, I texted with Fitbit support. Sure enough, same as what many other customers warned, they offered me a 25% off coupon on a new Fitbit watch (40% off if I went with the more expensive Ionic watch). They do not offer any repair or service options, so I am left with an expensive broken watch. With their "throwaway" business model, they are NOT environmentally nor economically friendly. I agree with another reviewer who stated that the 25% off to buy another new watch that will just break right after warranty, is insulting. Do your research before you buy, and if you are comfortable with the watch only lasting just outside of warranty, then this might be for you. But, if, like me, you consider this an expensive luxury item that you can't purchase all the time, nor want to contribute to the waste stream with unrepairable items, you may want to pass. The Fitbit Community pages are full of people posting issues with these watches (just search for it, since posting guidelines do not allow external links).<br/><br/>Additionally, for comparison, prior to purchasing the Fitbit, I had been a Basis customer. Several times I had issues with the bands or the unit itself. Basis provided me with replacement parts, or a new unit, and covered the shipping of the old unit back to them. They had amazing customer service, however they had to decommission their product due to safety concerns, so I switched to Fitbit. The product quality (i.e.lasting just 1.5 years), pales in comparison to the Basis. I am now searching for a similar tracking watch, and based on the poor lifetime quality of the watch and lack of any sort of customer service to retain customers, I will not be going with Fitbit.
 I received my Fitbit in October and really loved it. It was easy to use and kept me aware of my activity level. It was something I was excited to have and liked the app and monitoring for heart rate and sleep. After about 6 weeks of having it, I woke up with a very large burn on the wrist where I wear my Fitbit. I will note that I was wearing and using the device according to the instructions and was taking breaks from wearing it - there was nothing I did to cause this injury. After receiving the burn I moved the Fitbit to my other wrist, and after less than an hour a burn was forming on that wrist! These burns are very painful and large. I contacted Fitbit and they were unsurprised and told me to stop wearing any of their devices permanently. They said they did know this happens, but they have no plans to issue a recall or warn consumers about the danger. Because of that, I felt it was my duty to make potential buyers aware of this danger. I’ve included a photo of my burn not to be gross, but to show how serious this really is.
 This was not a bad fitness monitor right up until the display became distorted.  I had only had it 6 months, so I contacted Fitbit to see if I could get it fixed or replaced.  That's is when I was put through hoops for hours trying to send videos of the display, which I did, but then it was too blurry, yeah, right, the display is blurry, that's why I need a replacement.  I asked for a Supervisor and she asked for more of the same.  I finally had enough and told them I had been a loyal Fitbit customer, they did not care.  Worst customer service I think I have ever experienced.  They even implied I did not know how to use the device I had been using for 6 months.  How insulting.  My advise, do not ever buy anything from this company.  I know I won't make that mistake again.
 After just 2 1/2 weeks, I am addicted to my Fitbit.  I have said good bye to my sedentary lifestyle and am now walking a minimum of 10k steps/day.  I also have increased my water intake to 50 oz/day.  I love participating in Daily Challenges and Workweek Hustles with my friends.  It pushes me to walk farther and farther.  I'm not crazy about the rubber wristband so I will be trading it in for leather.
 My original Charge 2HR quit counting stairs after a few months.  After a lengthy phone conversation with a very nice Fitbit person, it was determined to be defective and a new one was sent.  Fine,  EXCEPT this supposedly new one counts every move of your wrist as a step.  I have gotten over 40 miles a day! I have only had it for a couple of weeks, but have won badge after badge!  So after another lengthy phone call with another nice person, this one too has been determined to be defective. Got no conclusive answer regarding if a truly new one is being sent or if I will be inheriting someone else's problem in a poorly refurbished model.  She said "We consider them new.' Not sure what "consider" might mean. As much as I like wearing my Fitbit Charge HR, this has been a real pain.
 I bought my Fitbit Charge 2 in February. I enjoyed everything about it. The screen scratched easily, but I put that down to my learning curve as to how to get it to respond. Then recently, the device simply fell to the floor. The band had come undone on one side of the Fitbit. I tried to hook it back on. My husband tried to hook it back on. I went on to their website and read how to put on a new band. Nothing worked.<br/><br/>So I contacted Fitbit. This is where they earned a 1-star review. They told me to take a picture, include my case number, and someone would decide whether or not to help.<br/><br/>They've now had the photo for a week or more and I've heard nothing, but even that doesn't matter. It was their utter lack of any kind of desire to keep me happy about their product.<br/><br/>I guess they're selling so many they don't care.
 I originally loved my FitBit,  purchased last December.  The two features I wanted most was being able to receive texts on my wristband and to monitor my heart rate, trying to hit peak rates during exercise.  Neither feature works.  I get call notifications but not texts.  Check the boards and you will see that many, many people are having the same issue. Customer support is aware of the problem but has not been able to fix it. It's been months.  Further, it is a waste of time wearing the FitBit during hard workouts. Either it gives no heart rate at all or it gives me a rate around 50 which is far below even my resting heart rate.  And yes, I keep it dry and wear it higher on my wrist and all the other suggestions.  I spend the entire workout trying to adjust the thing.<br/><br/>It is unfortunate because the FitBit CHarge 2 has so much potential. But if you are looking for a fitness band that actually measures heart rate during exercise or that delivers texts as advertised, I would look elsewhere.
 I am conflicted on how many stars to give this product.  As a long time Fitbit user I am a huge fan of their app and their products.  Most walkers and joggers will really like it.  It has great features and works really well.<br/><br/>The reason for the low rating is that the Charge 2 has a fatal flaw.<br/><br/>If you are a cyclist and are considering using this device (with connected GPS) to replace your handlebar mounted GPS, I would advise you to look elsewhere.  The Cycling function is grossly inaccurate.  After 6 rides in the 20-30 mile range I found that the Charge 2 was off by between 20% and 60% on the mileage.  I compared the readings on the Charge 2 to a handlebar mounted Garmin GPS and to the Strava App on my iPhone SE.  The Strava app and the Garmin were both well within a reasonable tolerance.  However, the Charge 2 (using the exact same GPS data as the Strava App on the iPhone) would not accurately record any of my rides.  It would show the same track as the other two sources, but the data was wrong.<br/>So, don't think this can be a replacement for your Garmin don't buy it, it simply does not work with enough accuracy to be a reliable source of cycling data.<br/><br/>That being said, if you are a ride down the path with your kids type of bike rider, then you will be happy with this product.  The smart track feature for cycling works pretty well.  Much better than the other Fitbit products I have used.  They seem to have figured out how to detect when you are riding a bike.  My negative review was for manually starting and stopping the Charge 2 in the Cycling mode.  Smart track seems to work fine for short rides through the neighborhood.<br/><br/>Now, some of you may be asking if I contacted Fitbit for help.  Yes I did.  First, I would like to say that their customer response team was very responsive and pleasant.  We corresponded via e-mail multiple times.  Each time the responses were filled with links to the manual and help files and explanations that made it clear that it was not the product's fault, but user error.  Once they even asked me if I ever stopped when I was riding.  I told them I had to obey the law and stop at lights and street crossings.  They said that the stopping might be the problem.  I about fell out of my chair laughing at them over that dumb response.  After I sent them overwhelming evidence (screen shots and data) that the Charge 2 wasn't working they had a couple of quotable phrases that I think are worth sharing:<br/>  "Our engineers are aware of this situation and are working to resolve it as quickly as possible."<br/>  "Your case was forwarded to and reviewed by our highest tier of support here at Fitbit."<br/>They finally wore me out and I gave up on them.  They have no solution.  Reading between the lines they basically said it was not their fault so deal with it.<br/><br/>Other than this one flaw, I have been happy with the Charge 2.  If you are not a cyclist, you will probably be very happy with it as well.<br/><br/>Update: (23 May 17)<br/>I am taking this down to 2 stars. Here are the reasons:<br/>- It does not work well as a running watch.  The connected GPS mode is not reliable.  It will drop the signal in the running mode without any warning and when you get done you have no record of your run.<br/>- The text is so small in the running mode that if you have other than perfect eyesight, you won't be able to read the screen while you are running.  This is particularly difficult on a sunny day.<br/><br/>At this point I would not recommend this watch for either runners or cyclists.<br/><br/>If you just want to count your steps, I think it is just fine.
 This item has not lasted 1 year without the battery failing or the screen losing display pixels.<br/>I have had my unit replaced within the 1st year for failing to charge.<br/>Most recently it failed within the year of its first replacement with the display failing.<br/>FITBIT would not honor the replacement within the year after the first replacement.<br/>Do not trust a company that will not stand behind its own defective product.<br/><br/>For $149 FITBIT Charge-2 price, I could buy -5- Kingberwi Fitness Trackers that look better and have more functionality... Check it out: https://www.amazon.com/Kingberwi-Activity-Waterproof-Bluetooth-Wristband/dp/B07BMXBBZC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8<br/><br/>The poor customer service from FITBIT has led me to discover the vast landscape of more functional and better looking products for far less.
 The Fitbit Charge 2 does nothing right.  It fails miserably even as a basic, simple heartrate monitor and does nothing else well.<br/><br/>First, as a heartrate monitor, it's ridiculously inaccurate.  I wore it doing hill repeats on my bike and manually measured my heartrate after the first climb at 162.  My Fitbit showed 108. LOL.  My heartrate on this workout typically ranges from 90 to 175.  My Fitbit showed a range of 100 to 115.  And, yes, I followed the instructions to push it tight against my arm two fingers above my wrist bone.  Not even close.  Honestly, sending me a bunch of random numbers between my min and max HR would have been just as useful.  Epic Fail #1.<br/><br/>Second, it does NOT sync with other apps.  PERIOD.  Like most endurance athletes, I use Strava for tracking rides, PRs, Trophies, Segments, Challenges, etc.  Fitbit says it syncs with Strava but it does not.  What it does instead is sync ONLY with it's own app which can then be synced to Strava...but you lose all the great Strava features because you can't have Strava running at the same time. Other apps cannot read the HR straight from the Fitbit.  I have a $40 chest strap that flawless syncs with Strava but my $150 Fitbit can't.  Epic Fail #2.<br/><br/>Next, the display is always turned off.  It's supposed to turn on when you turn it to face you but it takes 3-4 tries before it finally turns on.  So you have a couple more options...you can tap (not touch...TAP...more on that later) the screen or hit the button.  Both of which take two hands.  so trying to look at your HR while riding a bike is a chore...and dangerous.  And impossible while climbing.  Stupid.  Epic Fail #3.<br/><br/>Next, the screen only stays on for about a second when it finally turns on.  It's very quick so you often need to tap the screen again to see everything.  touch...nothing.  tap...nothing.  Tap harder...nothing.  TAP HARD...finally turns on.  You have to smack the snot out of the thing to make it turn on. Why?  Because it's not a touch screen!  It's using the motion of the tap and not your finger touch so you have to hit it HARD.  Epic Fail #4.<br/><br/>Lastly, they couldn't even get the band sizing right.  My wrist measured right at 6.9", which indicated I should get a large.  But I read that they fit big so I sized down to a small.  Good thing, because with a wrist measurement at 6.9", my small fit comfortably in the middle of the 10 buckle slots!  I wore it in the 3rd smallest to get a tight fit for a workout...and this was a small. Fitbit recommended the large?  Epic Fail #5<br/><br/>Finally, the piece of junk isn't even waterproof.  Really Fitbit?  A fitness tracking device that isn't waterproof? My Polar heartrate monitor from 1990 was waterproof.  Epic Fail #6.<br/><br/>This device is on it's way back to Amazon as it is about as functional as a Livestrong bracelet.
 Well, I bought my wife one and she was really getting into it and wanted some company on her march to better fitness, so got one for myself. Well, I guess I am one of those people that needs someone else looking over my shoulder, because this thing is actually helping me get more fit and loose weight. Both of use are being very good tracking our food in and it does a reasonable job of tracking our calories out. The app is pretty straightforward, and I kept finding new sheets/windows and more info. They have a wealth of info, make it all more fun. Plus, the battery is pretty good on this thing. I charge mine every couple days and it is not even half way, but I am the kind of guy that hates to let my gas tank get under half... My wife lets her go for 5 or 6 days before a charge.<br/><br/>It tracks enough stuff, especially if you also add in readings from a modern scale that measures weight, fat%, water%, etc. If you are exercising and holding your intake of calories below the output of calories, you will see at least some numbers improving everyday, which is a great motivator. Too bad there is not a wifi tape measure and connection into the app to track some key dimensions too.  Yeah, I know, I just gave away a million dollar idea - please send me a free one when you make it!].<br/><br/>We have been irritated with it at times when it does not register a stairway climb. I have determined that if I am using the railing with the hand that has it, the stairway is generally not counted. It wants not only the air pressure change, but also the swinging arm. Just for grins, I tried swinging my arm fast when on the elevator and I got 5 flights of stairs for free one day... Yes, I told my wife that I cheated that time.<br/><br/>So net result, even for a couple of older people like us, it is easy to use and a lot cheaper than all those diet plans.<br/><br/>Get a Fitbit, a partner and get FIT!
 Wearable technology has come a long way!  We have fitness bands, smart watches and fitness bands that try to be smartwatches and vice versa. Which to buy - smart watch or fitness band?  The answer depends on what your primary use is going to be. First, the main reason I bought this was primarily for my wife to track her daily heart rate and sleep patterns.  She has significant sleep issues and wanted some way to measure how much restful sleep she was getting. For this purpose the Fitbit Charge 2 has been excellent. Somewhat crossing into smartwatch territory, the Fitbit shows calendar and text notifications, a handy plus.  She has been using this device for 6 months and is well-pleased. Here are our observations:<br/><br/>Fitness functions: For our purposes this was probably overkill in a good way. The Fitbit synchronizes via blue tooth with your android device's  app which is where you will go to view your health data. The app itself is robust, feature-rich, and well-designed.  There you will see graphs showing your workouts, daily heart rate trends, calorie usage, and step count.  For our purposes we focus on the sleep tracking.  You wear the Fitbit while you sleep and it estimates the length and quality of sleep you are getting based on your movement and heart rate.  You wind up with a chart showing the results over time, bands of restful vs REM and fitful sleep.  If you were tossing and turning from 2-4 AM it will definitely show up!  Another troublesome indicator will be if your pulse rate doesn't stay in the restful zone overnight. How does this compare to similar features offered by a typical smartwatch?  I have the Samsung Gear S3 which also features fitness tracking and sleep monitoring.  The sleep information gathered from the Fitbit and displayed on its corresponding app offers more detail and seems a bit more useful than what I can glean from the Samsung Health app / Gear.<br/><br/>Daily wear: The Fitbit display is geared to no-frills functionality.  There aren't any fancy (battery hogging) colors, but you can see it in the brightest sunlight.  Moving your wrist is usually enough to cause the time and/or your current heart rate to display. The device is just a little bit uncomfortable to wear due to its thickness. The battery lasts for several days of constant use and charges quickly, blowing any smartwatch out of the water.  To charge it, you have to clip it to a little charging cable, making sure that the button lines up with the correct slot on the side.  This is slightly awkward, but preferable to having to physically plug in a cord to a tiny, fragile slot..  A wireless charging cradle like the Samsung Gear would have been a nice touch.<br/><br/>Band issue: We had a problem with the band popping off and not staying attached as other users have also noted. A device of this quality and cost shouldn't have this problem. We solved this by buying a new one for around $10 online.  There are various sources available and you can get many different colors/patterns.<br/><br/>Overall: If you are a fitness guru and exercise freak you will obviously love this device and all its features.  If you are simply an average person looking to pay closer attention to your activity level and focus a bit more on exercise then this device is also for you. If you want something to help diagnose your sleeping patterns then I would highly recommend it.
 I noticed the Fitbit was either not tracking my steps at all or only recording about half of my steps. I conacted FitBit customer service twice. The first time they had me reset the device, and when that did not work they told me to reset it again later in the day and call back with any problems. The second reset did not work either. When I called back the second time I was placed on hold numerous times only to be told to return the product to Amazon and buy another one. Also, if you contact customer service be prepared for it to take at least 30 minutes and you will be asked to check your Fit Bit to ensure your demographics have not changed. My name, gender nor birthday have changed, thanks FitBit.
 Bought this for my wife for Valentine's Day (at her request).  She really likes it.  Price was good - I think it was cheaper than any big box stores.  She was surprised that it tracks her sleep too.  Connects to her iPhone via bluetooth and relays all the info so she can look at it.  Her mom's friend got an off-brand fitness tracker and my wife had to go help her connect it and download stuff - she said it was a pain in the butt.  This has very easy user interface and OK connectivity - I say only "OK" because it took a couple tries before it would latch on to her iPhone.
 I love this fitbit, does everything it says and works well.  I work out at a wellness center in our area, it would be great if when I work out it would keep track of that as well. What I like best is it reminds you to move every hour, which is a plus. I wish it were waterproof if it were I would give it a 5 star rating. I hate that I have to take it off while swimming, doing dishes, taking a shower, really those are times I am moving the most and it does not record it. You can't even add it in. That would also be a plus if you could add in time you spent doing things while not wearing this device. About that it is comfortable kind of bulky I have hit it several times, but I purchased a cover for it so it is safe from breakage. If I had to buy another I think I would spend the extra money to have a water proof one .<br/>  Update : An important part of what it does was keep track of sleep. This was something I was wanting for I always thought I need to sleep better. Since this tells you allot about how you sleep then it you would be able to use the information to help you sleep better. It is my belief that it just insert something and it not accurate at all. Last night proved this. First it never was accurate on the time I went to bed. I would go to bed at 9:30 and it was reporting I went to bed at 11:45 , this was off every night last night was way off, I really don't believe I laid in bed awake tossing and turning  for 2 hours and 15 minutes. well then I got up twice, the second time I woke I checked on it and it said I had slept 3 hours and during that time I was right in line with the percentage for my age. I was in REM twice. After being awake for about 25 minutes I went back to bed. When I awoke I then checked it again. Now it say I slept 5 hours and 45 minutes. Still only woke up twice not three times and only in rem twice but now the second time I was in rem was much later then the first time so it was further apart and once again I was right in line with someone of my age group. So its fake not real at all, makes you wonder if anything is????
 It's a great device, but a limited lifetime.  In all fairness I love my Charge 2 - just be aware that it's good for maybe 18 months.  As long as you think of it as disposable, it's OK.  Excellent device and app, but about 14 months in the screen started to crack - no impact or anything, it just wore out.  It's all over their forum.  Of course the warranty is only a year - they offered me a 25% off coupon, but that's it.  Bummer.  There are a lot of options for a lot less money, but Fitbit is really good.  Just figure you're going to throw it out at 16 - 18 months and get a new one.
 I fully realize that this particular fitness tracker has thousands of varied reviews.  Some are very correct and some reviews are pathetic, for the lack of better wording.  In my humble opinion, this Fitbit Charge 2 has been diagnosed from every angle imaginable to the point where I seriously doubt my review will do much good here.  So knowing all this, here is my very best advice.  #1.  BUY IT.  #2.  UNDERSTAND IT.  #3.  USE IT.  #4.  BE HAPPY.  #5.  GET HEALTHY.  Thank you.  5 star product :)
 Well to be honest my family has four of these and we absolutely love them.  Actually, we had four of them, that was until today.  It seems my son's Fitbit was stolen today in his classroom.  While looking for it at his school, using the Fitbit app, we noticed the device simply disappeared from his account.  How could the device simply just delete itself?  I logged into his account and opened a chat with a Fitbit support agent.  Come to find out if your device is lost or stolen Fitbit affords you, the lawful owner who purchased the device, absolutely no protection from someone simply pairing it to their account and using it like they own it.  Add insult to injury the device is automatically removed from your account without any approval or permission process requirement.  I was flabbergasted!  I know the MAC address, I have the URL for the device but that URL is now locked behind the permissions of the user account the thief created it and not only will Fitbit protect that user's privacy like a paying customer they won't even disable the device to deny the thief the value of the stolen device.  Disgraceful.  Needless to say I will not be spending another $150 to purchase a replacement until Fitbit implements some safeguards to protect their customer's devices...
 I bought this particularly because I wanted something that included my heart rate with my steps.  It is an adequate pedometer, although if you swing your arm really hard a few times, it will add lots of steps to your total.  So a cheaper pedometer would have been fine.  It is completely useless tracking heart rate.  After a couple of months, I can assure you that it  simply doesn't work.  Yesterday at the gym when I was racing up stairs on the stairmaster -- panting and sweating, my heart rate on the stairmaster was rational, but the Fitbit said 72.  It said 75 later when I was cutting up onions.  I didn't expect it to be definitive, but I expected it to be in the ball park.  It isn't. The fitbit says I did five flights of stairs yesterday.  I counted 17 when I was paying attention -- taking stuff out of second floor closets and putting it in basement storage.  All-in-all, a waste of money.
 Purchased my Fitbit Charge 2 via Amazon August 2017. I was very happy until my device wasn't holding a charge consistently a month after my purchase. I am not sure if it is the cable or the device itself. No damage inflicted by myself or others. I also noticed that the part of my wrist where the fitbit lays (where the green light is) caused dryness and wrinkling even though I wear it slightly loose as recommended. I have refrained using the device to prevent scarring. I would like a resolution.
 The Charge2 is a night and day improvement over my old Charge HR. The hardware is great and they have made great strides with the iOS App.<br/>The device and software are 5 star products. The reason I am deducting a star from the device is a problem that plagued the Charge HR, the band.<br/>About 8 months in, the band started to bubble in a similar fashion as my Charge HR did. Luckily they designed the Charge 2 with bands the user can swap out, and now the device won't be discarded due to band malfunction.<br/>Overall I love the device and reccomend them to friends and family (3 have stepped up so far). Just wish they had improved the bands a little more after the the issues so many of us had with the Charge and Charge HR.
 This thing is the most inaccurate pulse checker in the world... i work at a hospital and i checked my actual pulse vs this thing multiple times and it was always at least 15 beats off.. take note im walking around taking care of patients all day so my HR gets up there. i know its not supposed to be reliable but good lord this this is not even close... did i pay 150$ for a pedometer..... hunk of junk do not buy!<br/>Yes, I exactly followed the correct wear and set up instructions. Yes, I set it to my dominant hand to decrease sensitivity.
 I don't really see a point to this device and regret buying it.<br/><br/>The step counter and activity reminder might help you get off of your office chair, but other than that, the counter can be fooled by a swinging arm, and the heartrate monitor isn't accurate from what I've read and experienced.  That also means the calorie burned counter isn't accurate either.<br/><br/>But it should be a good companion for other exercise, right?  Well, no.<br/><br/>The display stays on only for a brief moment.  Fitbit won't allow you to change it.  Their claim is that it will affect battery life.  Well, how about letting the user decide how to use their device?<br/><br/>So this means that if I want to lift weights with a 45 second interval between sets, I'll keep having to twist my wrist to check the time.  But wait, none of the watch faces include the seconds!  Only the hour and minute, plus date and day, as if that matters..  So I guess I have to start a stopwatch and look at that, always twisting my wrist to wake the display.  And if you didn't manage to wake the display when the 45 sec interval ends?  I guess you'll just have to estimate when 45 hits, or keep twisting your wrist like a loonie.  Marvelous.<br/><br/>The only benefit of this watch to me is the interval training thing, where you can set a vibration reminder every X seconds, which is really the main reason I bought this.  But with winter coming and no more running outside, I could just look at the clock on my treadmill, which conveniently includes the seconds.<br/><br/>You might be better off buying an Apple watch.  At the very least, you could sell it for almost the same cost you bought it for.  Charge2 watches on eBay go for $55 BuyItNow all day long
 Lost 40lbs and counting with this Fitbit! I sleep better and I workout harder! This is my 3rd upgrade with Fitbit... I can't see how they can improve on this one. Thought the phone and text notifications would not be as valuable as they are. I read more texts on my Fitbit then I do on my phone now!! Have made different life decisions based on the data this has provided! Everybody else in the world is capturing our data, with this Charge 2 at least you can access it and leverage it for your benefit!!!! Hey it is a watch too!!! Love the heart rate monitoring during workouts! It even tells you when you are in the fat burning zone, cardio zone and peak zone! Just turned 40, way overweight and woke up every day feeling like I never slept... Got this Fitbit and it literally changed my life!
 Wore this today to my cardiac rehab session. Heart rate readings from the Charge 2 was the same as the monitor I was connected to. That's what I was hoping for. I also need to use this while exercising on my own to ensure my heart rate doesn't go too high.<br/><br/>Would have given 5 stars if I didn't have to sync it with my phone in order to actually set it up. Plus if the band was better. I've already ordered one of the metal, magnetic clasp, bands to replace the stock one.<br/><br/>This is already 10000x better than the other unit I had picked up earlier, which I've already returned (cost under $50). Lesson learned about trying to get something that cost less and appeared to have good spec's, reviews, etc.<br/><br/>Update (12/12/17)<br/>After using this for some months, I've had to ditch it. Pedometer function is horrible now. Almost ANY hand movement is registered as a step. Doesn't matter if you're not actually walking. I even see it registering lifting a glass to drink as a step. Also, the heart rate monitor accuracy is NOT all that good. If you don't get it positioned EXACTLY right, it either doesn't read, or reads REALLY wrong. Especially when exercising. I've had to try all sorts of positions on my wrist with it while exercising and even then it doesn't always get the HR readings. It's fairly close when it read my at rest HR, compared with what the doctor gets (checking their reading against what this gives). But that's a delta of up to 5 bpm.<br/><br/>I'm now using a &lt;$30 pedometer to record my daily steps. Which is MUCH more accurate (I know, not saying much). I've had this show 1000 more steps before I start my exercise/walk, compared with the pedometer. Then, when I'm done, it either reads within a few hundred of the pedometer, or up to 1000 lower. Luckily, I'm more concerned with time of exercise than step count.<br/><br/>Due to ALL of the inconsistent results/readings, and other PITA factors, I've stopped wearing this item. Another PITA factor is how you simply CANNOT shut it off, at all. At MOST, you can 'restart' it. So, I've let it sit idle to fully discharge the battery. I've not  yet] tossed it out, but I probably will soon. I might decide to destroy it with thermite over the holidays...
 I bought the Charge 2 with high hopes. I tried two of the cheap Chinese knock offs, but their heart rate monitors and step counters were so far off it was ridiculous. The only “good” thing about the Charge 2 is that the HR monitor does seem to be accurate enough. However, it comes at a cost: battery life.<br/>The Fitbit Charge 2 is supposedly good for up to 5 days. But, when you fully utilize it, you’ll be lucky to get 2. The major reason is that the HR monitor drains the battery very quickly. Unfortunately, the only way to prevent that is to dig into the app’s settings or log into your Fitbit account on a website to disable it. Fitbit has directly stated that they have no plans to add an on-tracker option to enable and disable the function as it exists on their other products. Consider it could be as simple as a press and hold of the button, I find it almost offensive that they won’t consider it. Other things like notifications and alarms have that EXACT functionality, but not the HR monitor.<br/>Additionally, there’s no way to manually adjust your step count. They have some hack where you log it as driving, but it still counts as activity. I’m sorry, but sitting on my rear end driving is NOT physical activity. This would be so bad, except the tracker logs hundred of steps while I’m burping my infant. And thousands while the tracker sits on my unmoving bed while I take a shower. Total garbage and no way to clean it up.<br/><br/>I’m not sure what else to say except that I wouldn’t buy it again if I had the choice. Fitbit isn’t worth your business.<br/><br/>Pros: HR monitor is accurate enough for a wrist-based solution, but you can probably find the same from another reputable manufacturer.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- band is hard to fit and not comfortable<br/>- customer service and product support is lacking<br/>- battery life is awful when used as you’d expect to use it<br/>- “Quick View” (turn wrist to bring the screen to life) doesn’t work 95% of the time. This can be verified by checking fitbit’s forums.<br/>- Doesn’t sync well with other apps like Endomondo even though they are supposed “work together.”<br/>- screen scratches very easily. I’m not even sure what I did to scratch it.<br/>- band disconnects from tracker if “persuaded” in the right way. Doesn’t require using the mechanism that one would normally use to remove the band.<br/>- no manual step adjustment.
 Heart rate is completely inaccurate, by some 40 beats per minute.  Not even close.  While on an exercise bike at level 10 resistance, RPM of 100 for 1 hours Charge 2 never showed HR over 95.  My actual HR ramped from 78 to 148.  I bought this primarily to check my HR against my inside bike's HR monitor.  I have coronary heart disease and HR monitoring is critical when I exercise vigorously.  In fact, If I believed the ridiculous number on my Charge 2 and continued to exercise harder because I thought my heart rate was that low, I might have had a heart attack.  Additionally, the display is supposed to light up when you swing your hand/wrist toward your face to look at.  While on the bike, this did on occur.  This is not just another bad performing product, it's malfunctioning has life threatening implications.  It also causes into question date produced by it's other functions like sleep data. On sleep data, when positioning the Charge 2 near my phone with the sleep app, the two are supposed to synchronize so that the sleep data is captured by the phone app and displayed. The first four times, the synchronization occurred fine.  The fifth day, it did not work at all.  I did not set this up until I'd had the Fitbit for  a couple months, so I passed the return time.  For $129, this is a complete ripoff.
 If you're buying this for accurate heart rate monitoring, don't bother. I read all the reviews, and decided to roll the dice and give it a try anyways. But the technology just isn't there yet; reading heart rate through the wrist is very inaccurate, and you can get readings as much as 20-30 points off during exercise.<br/><br/>It's also very hard to wear correctly to produce more accurate results. You're supposed to wear the band an inch above your wrist bone and medium snugness. If you're like me, however, and you have forearms that taper pretty dramatically as they approach your wrist, the band will always slide back down. If your wrists and forearm are one continuous width, you might be OK.<br/><br/>It measures other things other than heart rate, but my phone already measures my distance walked (and has map apps, and a GPS built in), and sleep information is dubious. It will remind you to walk, which is nice, but you can remind yourself. If you are buying this as a heart rate monitor, it will likely be wildly inaccurate and therefore not a good metric to judge your heart and fitness levels by.
 I had the Fitbit One for a few years and I did like it. Then I got to the point where I wanted more information about my fitness level. On Cyber Monday, Amazon dropped the price of Fitbit Charge 2 to a price I couldn't refuse, and I bought one.<br/><br/>The Charge 2 is far more accurate in tracking exercise than the One. I use an elliptical machine, and the One decided I never got any steps when I spent 30 minutes on the elliptical machine. The Charge 2 allows me to have Elliptical Machine as an exercise option. I press the button, and the stopwatch starts. I get a buzz on my wrist when I've reached my time goal (at the moment, 20 minutes). After I sync my tracker, I can see how many minutes I spent in the cardio fat burn, cardio, and peak zones, peak heart rate, average heart rate, and heart rate minute by minute.<br/><br/>I get cute graphics when I reach a step goal. Once I got a rocket ship lifting off.<br/><br/>There's a breathing exercise with the Charge 2 that helps with relaxation. I'm just starting to use this. I'm bipolar and having a non-drug way to bring myself back to center is great. I haven't had the Charge 2 long enough to tell if and how much the breathing exercise helps.<br/><br/>I read a number of reviews before ordering my Charge 2. When I tried the Fitbit Wrist Band thing, my wrist fell right on the line between small and large. When I measured my wrist, my measurement fell right on the line between small and large. Because of the reviews, I ordered small and that's the perfect size for me. I have to use the 6th hole from the end of the band. A large would have been way too large.<br/><br/>The only criticism I have is that when I set an alarm, the Charge 2 doesn't vibrate enough to wake me up. I've gone back to using my regular alarm clock to make sure I get up at the time I want.<br/><br/>UPDATE 1-6-17<br/>The relax feature is extremely helpful. I had a frustrating, infuriating event happen this morning. I used the relax feature and was able to bring myself back to center in two minutes. This is wonderful! I now have a non-drug way to keep myself at center. The relax feature can be set for either two minutes or five minutes. I highly recommend the Fitbit Charge 2 Heart Rate + Fitness for anyone who is bipolar, has a mood disorder or an anxiety disorder.
 Only had it for a day so far... was rather excited about the sleep tracker option but I should've guessed there's no way this could have any accuracy in sleep tracking.<br/><br/>I've been an insomniac for a very very long time... lately I've been able to manage only about 3h sleep total a night, so I remember most of the night since I've been awake. What a surprise when the fitbit tells me that I've slept for more than 7 hours.<br/><br/>I guess it monitors motion mainly... so if i don't move much when I'm awake it says I'm asleep. It's misleading advertisement tho, some ppl will actually believe these readings and it's not right to say that the product has this ability.
 Seriously thought I was not going to like this but I think I'm addicted to it!!!  Nah, that's not possible but I do love it.  It motivates me to get a minimum of 10,000 steps in daily but of course, you get to set your own goal.  You can also arrange the display any way you like, so I put the time, my steps and heart rate on the first screen. I love that it tells you who is texting you at a glance. It's easy to use, and once I got used to wearing a watch again, fits nicely and is comfortable on my wrist. It does have one minor flaw in my opinion.  The strap closure piece is awkward and difficult to move into the various slots. I always feel like it's going to break but it has been about 2 months and it seems to be holding up well.
 Buyer Beware. There are probably a lot better options available The product is okay, while it works. (That being the key phrase!) I had to replace the band at least 6 times which cost money (and was a nuisance) but I could live with that (fortunately I didn't lose the unit each time the band completely broke and it fell off). The band broke the first time 6-8 weeks into ownership. I spent probably almost 2 hours jumping through the customer service 'hoops' to get a replacement band mailed (which took about a week). After that, I decided I would just buy the replacements bands to avoid the hassle. The screen went black completely a few days past the one year warranty expired. I had always heard their customer service was good but I was less than impressed. Of course they suggested I could buy another one. Or, as I opted to do, I could invest money in a DIFFERENT brand.
 Defective product and Fitbit wouldn’t replace it!  Fitbit wouldn’t power on after a year and a half.  I called Fitbit support and they had me try all of the troubleshooting steps with no luck.  Fitbit said on the phone that it was defective and they wouldn’t replace it since my 1 year warranty expired.  The only option they gave me was 40% off there newest Fitbit that costs $269!  Give me a break.  Like I’m going to spend more money on a FitBit when they don’t stand by their defective products!  Stay away!!
 Fitbit makes a whole plethora of wrist devices but arguably the Charge series has been the most popular for good reason. They're reasonably priced for what I would call the perfect amount of features. Coming from the first generation Charge HR though, that device was not without it's problems. The Charge HR was very fragile and I went though three after various issues such as abruptly dying or the the band literally falling apart. It got to the point where I was sick of constantly replacing the Charge HR for these issues and decided to check out it's successor when the price dropped: the Charge 2.<br/><br/>Unlike the first Charge, the Charge 2 now comes with a heart rate monitor by default, meaning it's no longer restricted to a separate "HR" model. The general list of features is the same as the old model but the larger display makes using the device a bit more pleasant and easier to see than the old model. The build quality of the Charge 2 has jumped up by leaps and bounds over it's predecessor and now features metal construction on the body and the bands, while they seem more durable are also now removable. You can swap them out with whatever third party Charge 2 bands you like and that's a huge plus for people who loathed how terrible the quality was on the old Charge. As far as form factor goes, it's still largely the same size as the old device and is perfect for anybody who doesn't want something as big as a Surge or Blaze but still wants a screen. Pairing the Charge 2 with my phone was straightforward and like it's predecessor it's no slouch when it comes to tracking. It picks up everything from steps, stairs, and sleep all without human intervention.<br/><br/>I will note some cons with the Charge 2 though. First of all Fitbit still hasn't added proper waterproofing to the device and as result it cannot perform swim tracking and Fitbit even recommends not taking it in the shower(I won't lie though, I've done this many times without issue). As being a pretty heavily requested feature with the old device, it boggles my mind why they didn't bother to include it in an otherwise near-perfect device. Second, the larger screen obviously will be more susceptible to damage so I highly recommend you fit it with some form of aftermarket screen protector just to be on the safe side.<br/><br/>On the whole though, the Charge 2 is the perfect successor to the old device and fixes many of it's flaws. This about as close to the perfect Fitbit as you can get.
 I received this as a Mother's Day gift, so I've been able to use it regularly the last few months. First, I'd like to start with the pros. The band itself is comfortable, the charge holds for about 4 days and then I re-charge, the connection is good between my phone and Fitbit (I receive texts easily), my heart rate is on point and the band easily picks up my movements.<br/><br/>The negatives to me were significant because I'm such an active person who runs regularly. The band does not correlate well with distance. For example, if I run 1 mile it will not show 1 mile, but will be short. In my eight mile run it'll knock off anywhere between .2-.8 miles. Ouch! I would also like to be able to wash it easily, but because it's not water proof I'm pretty cautious with it. I sweat like a pig and haven't had issues with it getting soggy during workouts which is good. I would recommend it for people who aren't necessarily avid runners but who need encouragement in becoming or having a more active lifestyle.
 i was so excited to finally get the Fitbit i had been wanting for the longest time. as soon as I got it I let it charge for a while. after a hour or so I went to get it to connect to my phone. I tried to connect it for HOURS and didn't connect. I tried contacting the Fitbit Customer service several times I asked questions on the Fitbit Community site... Seem like I wasn't the only one having problems. No one knew what was wrong with the Fitbit Charge 2 I had purchased from here. it wouldn't load past the set up screen.
 I bought the fitbit charge 2 a little over a year ago.  though the band is a bit bulky i've liked many of the features.  that is until a week ago when both sides of the wristband fell off.  i'm now interacting with fitbits online service and they wanted me to provide a videotape of the damage.  what a joke.  i just want a new band for the current product.  i'm not a scammer, just wanted to continue using the device but they are pushing back on me.  its pretty bad quality control for the band to fall off right after the one year mark.  i will move on to some other device based on this terrible quality and terrible service.  find another tracker - fitbit just wants to make money on the consumable ie. the lame wristband
 I've had several different FitBits, and was very excited to see the new features of the Charge 2. For the most part, this tracker is great. You can customize the display completely, and contrary to other reviewers, I found (and always have) that FitBits accurately measure my heart rate. However, the calories as others have noted are extremely inaccurate, so ignore those. Another plus of this device is the ability to change out bands easily, although some of the bands on Amazon are hard to get off so read the reviews.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with the Charge 2 specifically is how horrible the step tracker is. It measures 50-60% of my actual steps, but FitBit guarantees 95% accuracy. If you go on the forums, you'll see hundreds of people with the same issue. I've even been sent another device from FitBit which is just as horrible. My girlfriend has one and it's accurate for her, but when I wear it it's not. It's only accurate if I walk and grossly exaggerate my arm swing. I haven't had problems this bad on the Charge HR. Very disappointing. They tell you to adjust the stride length, but that has 0 effect on the tracker's ability to measure steps. That's purely a distance fix. By the way, if you're having issues with the device measuring distance during a run, make sure GPS is enabled for run workouts (it's in the settings) AND that you have the app open on your phone (your phone can be locked but the app can't be completely closed). If it wasn't for the horrible step counting (about half my steps get measured), this would be a 5 star device.
 Purchased Fitbit Charge Tracker on February 8, 2018. It stopped tracking steps on 6/13/18. I sent an email, I called the service number and they tried to sell me something else. Could not speak to a customer service rep. I am very disappointed especially since this is the 3rd tracker I have purchased from Amazon and they all only last a little while. I use my tracker every day to track my steps and as a watch. I think I deserve a new tracker or at least a person to talk too.
 This is the first Fitbit I've ever owned and now that I've had it for a few months I absolutely understand why people rave about their Fitbits.<br/><br/>The product itself is lightweight and just as easy to take on and off as a regular watch. The HR2's has several different displays to choose from and I chose the one that has the date and time, how many steps and my current heart rate as the "home" screen. Twisting your wrist to look at the display immediately lights it up. Tapping on the display will also show how many calories you've burned, your active minutes, how many flights of stairs you've conquered and miles walked. Pushing the side button will show your heart rate, stopwatch and will let you start tracking a walk or a run. AND it's battery life will last for a couple days as long as you aren't asking it to constantly sync.<br/><br/>Easily 75% of why I love my Fitbit though is the excellent app. I can track my steps and heart rate etc. but I can also track my sleep (one of the main reasons I wanted one), my water intake, and keep a pretty accurate food log. The challenges with friends are key to helping you stay motivated and I've found myself going for a walk at 10 o'clock at night just to "get my steps in."  The community feature is also amazing and uplifting. It's a Facebook style feed where you can join groups like Healthy Eating, Weight Loss, Hiking etc. based on your interests. 98% of all of the posts and comments I've seen there are just absolutely positive. There is very little body-shaming or negativity of any kind. You're just with individuals who are looking to become healthier and happier and a lot of those users have very good advice or recipes.<br/><br/>At this point  - 2+ months in - I can't think of anything that would make this product better or easier to use.
 I was so excited to receive my Charge 2 as I have been without a step tracker for quit sometime. (I had my old one for years and it finally just gave out)  I received it last night, charged it and was so excited to get started. I like the fact that you can track your steps, heart rate, sleep and everything else. First thing I noticed this morning was that while sleeping I went 186 steps. (I have never sleep walked so I am pretty sure it was from tossing and turning.) Also just by moving my arm a certain way I add steps, I type for most of the day at my job so the steps are not accurate whatsoever. The solutions on the Fitbit community are to take it off when sleeping and if you know you are going to move your arm around a lot. Doesn't that defeat the purpose? This experience has left me very dissatisfied with the Fitbit product. My last step tracker was a Garmin and I would totally go back to that if I didn't spend all this money on this one :( I read the return policy beforehand, but didn't think I would be this unhappy so now I am stuck with a product that isn't accurate whatsoever. I would highly recommend researching this product before you buy it to make sure it's what you really want.<br/><br/>Also, I have NEVER gave a product a bad review and never had a bad experience with anything I have ordered. Until now.<br/><br/>*Edit* I misread the return policy and will be sending this back today!
 I ordered Fitbit charge 2 because I noticed Fitbit charge 3 had really bad reviews so I figured I'd go for the one with better reviews. I mainly purchased it to track sleep patterns and steps. I wore it during the night time first of all it was uncomfortable to sleep with I'm not used to sleeping with watches or jewelry so I felt like it kept me up more than normal, in the morning I woke up and checked the sleeping patterns and it said that I slept all night with waking up only one time..that was inaccurate because I was super tired apart from the constanttossing and turning got up twice for the restroom.  I finally got up and went about day doing my normal Saturday chores nothing extra didn't go to the gym since I just wanted to stay home and relax. Was curious to see how accurate it tracked steps so I tried to keep track of steps here and there on and off but every time I looked at the Fitbit it had already added 200 steps if not more even when I did a couple movements without walking.  By noon was getting close to 10,000 steps (yes ten thousand) which I know is super hard to accomplish from the reviews and people saying they have to reset it to different steps because that's too many.....well by the end of the day I had done 13,000 steps LOL super inaccurate... not to mention the whole evening I was just sitting on the couch playing loteria with my family bare any movement
 I wished I read these reviews before I purchased this piece of crap. Firstly, I’m not enthused with the lack of empathy that your customer service. It’s like they are robots. I first called in Sunday, October 28, 2018. At that time, I explained in detail the steps I had taken on my OWN to resolve my issue. I had done a hard reset and a software reset. Saturday night, by the next morning the issue was still not resolved. Even after explaining the steps I took your rep asked me the same questions several times, further adding to my frustrations. I have had my Fit-bit for 3 months, I’m aware of how it works. Yet, you send me a one size fits all issue email, again showing no empathy nor competency. Had someone bothered to read my profile/case they would have known that was ALREADY discussed with me in detail and that a link was sent to Sunday on the very same thing.<br/><br/> I was told told to log activity manually! Why would I even have to log my activity manually? I bought the Fit-bit to log my activity!<br/><br/> As of TODAY, I have called in THREE to report my issue, yet I was sent an email telling me I need to reply with this information? My one issue now has ballooned into three issues. Activity minutes not being recorded, taking a longer the usually amount of time to synchronize, it took five minutes, the latest issue is occurring now. Just took a 15-minute walk. NO STEPS WERE RECORDED, clearly there is in issue that is going with this unit. I’m at a lost why I even call and explain to you what my issue is.As it falls on deaf ears! I have called three times, why have you not begun your investigation? After looking back through my history, I can see where this has happened before I just did not notice it. This issue is intermittent, as well as annoying. I was asked what my activity minutes should be. Exactly how would I know since I’m not sure when they stopped being recorded? The support or lack thereof that I have experienced with your call center has been maladroit and scattered.<br/><br/> My question is, at what point is a replacement and/or refund offered? At this point, I’m over your product and lack of support. 😬😬😬😬
 I returned within 12 hrs of use. This thing counted 300 steps as i drove into work. Then at work It was racking up the steps, i have over 6k before lunch. Does not count in real time so you cant check for accuracy. Really wanted it got bpm and same thing, not accurate holding it against my BP and BPM cuff I use twice a day. The real kicker is I charged it for 8 hrs and it was dead by the end of the day I wore it. Way to muchnil inaccuracy and maintenance for something that should work a heck of a lot better.<br/><br/>I watched a video on these things comparing them to each other and other methods and your samsung phone is better and spot on. I tried it and sure enough it is. Galaxy s8 with the built in program is amazing. I checked bpm against my cuff and a stress test I took and it was 100% accurate. Also the pedometer counts the steps as you take them. Walk 20 steps and it counts 20 steps as you take them. And the real kicker, you already own this and take it with you every where, that's good enough for me
 I utterly love Fitbit.  I don't know how this thing inspires and motivates so well but it really does. I'd dropped inches after picking up a discounted Fitbit.  It was very basic, I didn't get the right size and wasn't crazy about the color but I loved it so well I used some rewards from my heath insurance toward Amazon gift cards and upgraded to the Charge 2, which I just received, set up, and am excited about using.  I highly recommend getting one of these and downloading the app.  It's amazing to be this age and feel (and see!) strong muscles back in my legs.  I've built my sluggish stamina back to the point that some of my walks are vigorous enough to record as elliptical workouts.  I add a lot of exercising as I do my housework, and I just have fun goofing around energetically to music so that in what feels like no time at all, an hour + aerobic workout is registered.  Food and water intake are logged.  Which inspires to take in more of the nourishing stuff and much less junk.  Earning the little reward badges for meeting or surpassing goals feels so good.  This little device is well worth the investment!  EDITED:  2 stars removed and edited to add the Charge 2 is much more frustrating to sync.  Try to do so, sometimes it works and as often it just will not despite all connections being in place.  Don't know if it's the device itself or the new dashboard configuration.
 This is an excellent fitness tracker. I used it mainly to monitor my sleep, heart rate, and exercise. It does these three functions fairly well with few problems. The pedometer is the least accurate feature, because after I play an hour of piano, for instance, it says I've walked a mile! But the fatal flaw is, about 10 months after purchase the display stopped turning on when I flicked my wrist. That means if I want to check the display for time and heartrate etc. I have to press the button. This is unacceptable for when I'm lecturing or teaching as I have to constantly check the time and pressing the button is just cumbersome. If you're holding something in one hand then you basically cannot check the time. Not to mention if I am exercising it makes checking my stats annoying. I have a friend who says he has the same problem. Will not be buying this product again.
 3/31/19<br/>I have had this thing less than a week so I am still on my honeymoon.<br/><br/>Here are my first impressions:<br/><br/>It appears to work as intended. If one wants to just scamper around the neighbourhood it is perfect. It dutifully counts “every breath you take / every move you make / every bond you break / every step you take”. The heart rate reading matches that of other gadgets I own.<br/><br/>I noticed right away that it seems to count not steps but arm movements and converts these into steps by means of a complicated algorithm.  First, I spent two days spreading mulch from my truck and hit 14,000 steps each day! Well, it counted each forkful as four steps: into the mulch, out of the mulch, into the barrow, put the fork down. Actually pushing the wheelbarrow to and from the site counted as zero, no matter how far I travelled, as my arms were not swinging. Then a few more ‘step counts’ to unload the wheelbarrow and spread the mulch.<br/><br/>The next day I went to the gym (as if my poor old body hadn’t suffered enough). Here I realized that ten “flights” on the stair machine counted for zero as my arms were not swinging and my altitude did not change. I guess the rowing machine and the elliptical trainer will add ‘steps’, but the treadmill and the stationary bike will not. I scored more steps loading and unloading the weights on the barbells than I did actually doing squats or bench presses. A wee bit of research on the interwebs showed me that remarkably few calories are expended in weight training. Something to do with kilograms and meters and joules, oh my.<br/><br/>The free Android app gives me some cool charts and graphs but seems to have no way of entering all this sterling work into my daily totals other than just calories.  It displays my VO2 score (shampoo?) and tells me I am in pretty good shape for an old man. The free Fitbit Coach app seems stuck in the isometric era and similarly does not enable input of weight training results.<br/><br/>It nagged me to enter food intake but provided no way to convert cookies to calories, in a manner of speaking. I checked the Amazon reviews and found that the third-party app MyFitnessPal linked to Fitbit and facilitated the entry of food calories.<br/><br/>• I like the way the Fitbit tells me the time when I look at it although I sometimes have to whack it a couple of times to get its attention.<br/>• It is cool-looking on my wrist.<br/>• I can set my pace length or let it detect it automatically.<br/>• The stopwatch function works well and is easier to use than the app in my smart phone.<br/>• The sleep monitor also works as expected; giving me information I already knew and didn’t really care about. It could be handy if one has sleep problems<br/>• I have not tried all the notification features, such as email, and probably won’t.<br/>• Neither have I tried scampering around the neighbourhood as that is not a part of my exercise regimen – yet.<br/>• It connects seamlessly with its own Android phone app and the MyFitnessPal app.<br/><br/>I purchased the Charge 2 Fitbit as some Amazon reviewers said it was better than the Charge 3. I also bought the three year protection plan, something I rarely do, as reviewers said the device sometimes fails after sixteen months. We shall wait and see how this pans out.<br/><br/>I give it five stars because of the reasonable price and that it performs as expected. Time will tell of its reliability.
 I purchased the tracker 7 months ago and 3 weeks ago the band on one side detached due to the poor quality of the plastic/attachment part.<br/>We called Fitbit and after 40 minutes on the phone with two different associates and emailing a picture of the damage I found out that while it’s under warranty and it’s covered, the requested band (black, L) is not available and could take up to 8 weeks to get it.<br/>This was our 2nd Fitbit tracker that we purchased within two years and none can be worn or works properly.
 Let's get my only complaints out of the way: they need to add a workout for stationary bike. The charger is finicky in that you have to really seat the device in the charger and set it down gently to make sure it retains contact. Their food database is loaded with a bunch of redundant stuff that sometimes makes it hard to find what the heck you ate. Other than that this device is AWESOME<br/><br/>I am a sucker for metrics. I like collecting data, processing it and doing something with it. It's a major part of my job and so it carries over into my personal life. This device is a goldmine for me. Not only does it scratch that itch for collecting metrics but it "gameified" fitness for me.<br/><br/>I grew up playing videogames and one of my favorite things about them is getting achievements. This device paired with the FitBit app gives you achievements as you continue to do more and more. Whenever you hit your step count for the day, climb another 100 total flights of stairs, or come in under your calorie goal for the day, it's a little reward and a stimulus. I get that dopamine rush when the Charge buzzes and it congratulates me on 10,000 steps in a day.<br/><br/>It's addicting, which in this case is a good thing because it has me addicted to trying to live a healthier lifestyle. My weight loss progress had stagnated until I started using this. Now I'm down 27 lbs from where I was in March.<br/><br/>I'm not saying this device magically makes you lose weight. It still requires effort from you. It doesn't make workouts easier or running any more tolerable and it definitely doesn't make me any less hungry when I'm trying to come in below my calorie goal. But when you do reach those goals, this device makes it more rewarding.<br/><br/>Besides the psychological aspect of all this, I think this is a well made and well designed wearable. I like the spartan looks and the simplicity of it. It's not gaudy or flashy, and it goes with just about everything I wear. The battery lasts about 3-4 days for me before I have to charge it, and it charges very quickly. The heart rate monitor is pretty dependable and I rarely have a problem with it not reading my heart rate.<br/><br/>In terms of the accuracy of the fitness tracking, all I can say is that my weight loss has been consistent with what the app says. I set my goal to lose one pound a week and I have averaged more than that. I doubt this device is accurate down to the calorie but it's accurate enough that if you follow the calorie count for the day, you will most likely lose weight.
 July 9, 2017- I've had this product for 1 month and I love it. If I have time to write a follow up review next year, I will. At first I was reluctant to buy the charge 2 because of the price. It was not on sale and I paid the full $159 for it. But in 4 weeks it has changed the way I eat and think about my exercise. I was already a moderately active person. I go to the gym 5-6 times per week and I like walking. I noticed right away that on the days I went to the gym, I easily made 10K steps. On weekends when I exercise too, I will get as many as 20K steps.<br/><br/>Since buying the device I pay a lot more attention to my level of activity each day as well as my calorie intake. If I am close to my 10K steps and its getting near the end of the day, I simply take a walk around the block (something I never did before). Every 1-2 hours it will also remind you to get up from your desk at work and walk around if you've been stagnate.<br/><br/>The real gym for me is the calorie counter. I was worried it would not be accurate based on reviews by mainstream news shows like Today. I noticed before getting out of bed in the morning, my app would show I burned 300 calories. But after using this device for a month I believe it is accurate. As long as I eat 500 less than my calories AND stop eating after 6:00 pm, I lose weight. The problem is I eat late at night and snack late at night. So whenever I eat late, I gain weight event if I've eaten less calories than I burned. Because of the calorie counter, I know when I have room to eat more and when I've gone way over for the day.<br/><br/>As a former Weight Watchers (WW) member who reached lifetime goal and gained the weight back, this device has been very helpful to me and has a lot of the features of the weight watchers app. You can track how much you eat on the app and it will give you the calories for the food. You can scan a bar code with the app and the app will read the bar code and give you the calories. You can track you weight and your daily water intake. Since the app is free, I feel like I've gotten a whole lot for my money as a much more affordable cost than WW. Right now WW is about $45 for meetings and the online tools. That's over $500 annually. I paid $159 for this device and get all of the same benefits except for the meetings. They even have multiple online communities you can connect with based on your goals and your lifestyle.<br/><br/>While I like the instant gratification the Charge 2 gives you with its wide screen (you can read your daily steps and calories just by glancing at your wrist), if you're on a budget definitely buy the less expensive models. There is an app you can download to any iPhone or android device. Most people check their cell phone 100+ times a day anyway. It's very easy to check how many calories you've consumed and how many steps you've walked on your cell phone.<br/><br/>The only drawback of the Charge 2 is that it needs to be charged about twice a week. I an wondering if the cheaper models with the smaller screens or no screens need that much charging. I am also curious to see when this thing stops working and needs to be completely replaced. If you have small wrists, get the small band.
 This is SO much better than the original charge HR. But, since that was an amazing piece of design nearly guaranteed to fail on everyone at least once, the bar was low. For essentially the same price (though I waited for it to be on sale for $99) it does more, shows more and is far more reliable. Much better charging situation (though it's finicky about how you attach the charger). Connected easier than the other - I'm assuming better bluetooth. It's size is reasonable on my arm, unlike some of the obscenely larger faces on their higher level models.<br/>I really hope I don't need to test their warranty on this, but I used a credit card that extends my warranty because I had to claim TWICE on the CHR within 14 months.<br/>The strap lock is still picky, but the user replaceable straps is a serious bonus, even if I never buy a cosmetic band, I just feel like it won't suck like the CHR did.<br/>Good on FitBit for eventually getting it right at this price point.
 Loved it until the screen cracked.<br/><br/>I have had it for less then 6 months and the screen cracked.  I've not dropped it or smacked my wrist into anything.<br/><br/>Prior to the crack I would have given it 4 stars.  I like it overall as it is accurate &amp; easy to use.  You do need to turn your wrist vigorously to turn on screen but I have just reverted to manually turning on screen.
 Very disappointed in the Charge HR upgrade I made.  Overall, the Fitbit products that I have owned seem to cease to work properly almost exactly a year after purchasing.  The suspicious person in me wonders if there is a chip to make them stop working after a certain period of time so that another purchase will be made?  I take good care of my devices and they do not get in the water except for sweat when working out.  I do wear it most of the day, except when I sleep.<br/><br/>The Charge 2 inconsistently auto syncs to my phone and sometimes I have to connect it to the computer (per Fitbit customer service) to make it sync at all.  In addition, it does not consistently sync with the following apps that I use(d): My Fitness Pal, Weight Watchers (when I was on that program), or AARP.  In addition, it does not consistently alert me to phone calls or reminders to move.<br/><br/>I plan to change manufacturers when this one goes "kapoot" or I've had enough, whichever comes first.  Interested in the Garmin... My daughter has the Garmin Fenix and she loves it.  The Fenix does more than what I need and too big for my preferences, but we'll see what Garmin comes up with over the next few months, e.g., Christmas.
 My husband and I each got one of these and they are our first fitness trackers. They are really motivating us to lose weight and stay active. The app is very easy to use, even for people who are technology challenged as we are. We really enjoy the challenges because they make our weight loss/exercise routine much more fun. I've read complaints from some others regarding the accuracy of the sleep log. The sleep log feature is a guideline. If you have serious issues, go in for a professional sleep study.  We especially like the food log which makes us more aware of what we are actually eating all day.  We couldn't be happier with our purchases.
 I like the functionality of the Charge 2, but there are three issues that keep me from loving it.<br/>1)  The narrow band, coupled with its impressive thickness, makes it uncomfortable to wear at night.  The Charge 2 snags on the sheets when I move my arm, which is frustrating and alerting.  The narrow band makes it harder to keep in position and makes it bite a little more when it moves around.<br/><br/>2)  The geometry of the band (mostly the narrowness again), lets the device tilt allowing the green light to escape.  I often have my arms up around my head when I'm sleeping, so when I move around I'll often get a blast of green light and wake up thinking Voldemort is attacking me.  (Well, not really, but the green light is surprisingly bright in a sleep environment.)  In any case, it may add to the interesting sleep data, but it isn't conducive to a good night's sleep.  I've seen others talk about turning it off, but the heart rate sensor is an integral part of the sleep tracking function - a function that was a driving force for my purchase.<br/><br/>3)  The screen wake settings aren't effective enough.  I set it to manual (I may not be using the correct terms) so it wouldn't turn on automatically when I move around, but the Charge 2 still likes to light up in the night.  Where the green light was disruptive, the main display can almost serve as a flashlight in a dark room.  I don't know if I'm snagging the button on the sheets, tapping the screen against skin, or the device just forgets that it's supposed to ignore a wrist roll - but it seems to light up more than I'd expect.<br/><br/>A note to Fitbit:  It would be nice to have the quick view/screen wake settings on a schedule.  Set time ranges with options for each.  Let it wake on a roll during the day, set to normal manual mode in the evening, then require a double-click (no button snags or device face touch false starts) or other pattern to engage the screen during sleep hours!  This seems so obvious...<br/><br/>My solution to most of the above was to switch to the new Versa.  I've only had my Versa for a day, but the fit is more stable.  It doesn't snag &amp; tilt like the Charge 2.  It doesn't leak green light.  And the watch face I've chosen isn't as bright at night (although it still seems to disregard my "manual" setting intermittently) and I could choose an even more night friendly face if it becomes necessary (more red light, fewer lit pixels, etc.).
 In the last couple of weeks, I have been trying to find a Wrist HR monitor. My chest strap HRM is uncomfortable and has no method to save workout data. I was looking for something to track weight training and cardio.<br/><br/>After a day looking at reviews, I decided to try the Fitbit Alta HR. It was a total bust. Lots of issues but the big one was totally unreliable HR data. So, I returned it and went with this Fitbit Charge 2. It added:<br/>* Weight Lifting as an exercise activity.<br/>* Manually start/stop activity.<br/><br/>So, that was good. The big problem still exists. Inaccurate and unreliable data. The last gym session of 45 min of Weights and 4 miles on the treadmill, it said I had gone .2 miles and the Activities lasted 900 minutes. Man, that's slow!<br/><br/>As far as an HRM...it is ok. It has quite a big of lag so it is hard to use it between sets to check HR recovery. So, kinda useless. Also, neither the Alta HR or the Charge 2 have an On/Off function. I guess they figure you will only take it off to charge it.<br/><br/>It is going back.
 I'm having massive drain on my phone battery because of the fitbit app. I haven't even opened the app but it runs in the background and sucks all my battery doing nothing. 80% to 40% in 2 hours where I didn't use the phone.<br/>The device is fine on its own but it's useless without the app so I don't know what to do with this. The app is updated. Nexus 6p 6.0.1.<br/><br/>Update: 3/13/2017. Fitbit staff was kind enough to email me the solution which is to turn off all day sync.<br/><br/>But now I have a major concern about the accuracy of this device's measurements. We had a snowstorm here today, so I had to work from home. Didn't venture outside the house or undertake any strenuous activities. Did not climb any stairs either. I pretty much worked from my bed today and spent most of the day sitting down at my study table or on my bed. According to my Fitbit, I've clocked up 7066 steps and burnt 5009 calories.<br/>How is this possible?<br/><br/>My BMI is around 1800 according to my Omron body composition analyzer. I cook my own food and eat alround 2500 calories. On a regular day when I am walking around, running on the treadmill, lifting weights etc, Fitbit says I've walked between 5K and 7K steps and burned around 3K calories. I can tolerate a difference of 500 calories but this is way too much.<br/><br/>Why does Fitbit think that I've burned 5K calories and walked over 7K steps between my bed and study table?<br/>And how is this acceptable?<br/><br/>Strangely, the battery is now showing low after less than two days.<br/>I also have concerns about sleep tracking but that's a topic for another day.<br/><br/>Update 3/18/2017:<br/>so there was some kind of bug that caused the step counter to not reset at 12 AM 3/13/2017. But I have noticed since then that the battery life has deteriorated from 4.5 days to 2.5 days now.<br/><br/>Update 3/21/2017:<br/>Battery lasts exactly 2 days now.  This is with all day sync and always connected options unchecked.  At this rate it'll on its way to becoming a cheap wrist ornament in a few weeks. Time to call in Amazon to arrange an rma or get my money back.<br/><br/>Update 4/9/2017:<br/>Around 3/21 I called FITBIT and asked for an RMA. They checked my usage history and confirmed that there is a battery problem with my device. Sent me a new one. The rep I spoke with was very polite and the line was clear. Did not even have to return the old one. It arrived in a no frills manila package with no wrist straps.<br/>Seems to be a new device and not a refurb. That's great. Battery lasts 4-5 days now. I'll upgrade the review to 5* if this continues to be the case.
 More of pedometer with heart rate available using two hands and two inputs.  The device can be configured via Android. I used my Amazon Fire 7 inch tablet which worked great for setup via Bluetooth.  Since they have Android and Fire apps already, it seems brain dead the app does not have the option to make heart rate the first stat that displays when you read the watch.  Instead, you must use 2 hands to get your heart rate.  Not very safe for use while cycling.  Inconvenient to use while walking, jogging, etc. for heart rate read outs.  If you do not care about your heart rate, this could be a great choice.  Also the touch screen is extremely unresponsive as in hardly ever responds to touch input.  Overall, a flashy, glitzy device that is less than mediocre in design and usefulness.
 I finally got one of these and now I know how little sleep I'm getting and how many steps a day I'm taking haha.<br/><br/>I really do like this fitbit! I was surprised to see my sleep patterns, and my heart rate is cool too. The steps isn't always accurate I discovered last night as I was shopping in Home depot and pushing a cart.... unless it's believable that I could go back and forth across Home Depot 4 times and up and down multiple isles while shopping in only 20ish steps.... so much for putting me ahead on the walking to NYC challenge.<br/><br/>That's another thing that's fun- the app has challenges you can do with friends and their friends like who can get the most steps in over the weekend, or who can be the first one to pretend walk to NYC (basically get the steps in).  Man, I really wish I had this when I took the kids to CA for Spring break! All the theme parks I would have won some serious challenges! And when you win- it's basically just an alert on your phone, not like there's prizes or anything more than the sense of pride and bragging rights for the accomplishment.<br/><br/>The biggest eye-opener for me was seeing how little sleep I'm getting! My most recent goal is to get 8 hours a night, which has actually been a real challenge. (as you can see by my screen shot)
 The best part about it is that it is inspiring me to exercise daily. If I didn't get my steps in and I'm on the couch at 9pm, I'll go for a walk. The step counter seems fairly accurate. It was also fairly inexpensive ($119 on sale, compared to several hundred for an Apple Watch. And I don't have an iPhone so...)<br/><br/>The negatives:<br/>1. The heart rate monitor is ok, but is sometimes way off. It gives me a general ballpark, most of the time. Today I was on an elliptical doing intervals and was nearing peak (150bpm), then did the cool down - all of a sudden, showing 80bpm! I felt my pulse, and I was still way up there. So it's not very accurate, but gives you an idea. Most of the time. You'll see complaints about this on their website forums.<br/>2. The elliptical app is not very good - it does a decent job of counting calories, but I went pretty hard for half an hour on my Kettle today - showed I burned 312 calories (probably about right), but only showed 388 steps and 0.17 miles - the Kettle showed I did 2.7km! Again, lots of complaints about this on their website, which they respond with, basically: eh.<br/>3. There's a stopwatch - but no timer. So you can start a timer and see how long you've been walking or working out or whatever, but no way to set a timer to give an alarm after x amount of minutes. This would be VERY useful for my meditation practice. Again, addressed on their website, and they're not doing anything about it. As there's already a stopwatch, I can't imagine it would take more than a week for a developer to build a timer, which would be much more useful.<br/>4. Related to #3, there's a "relax and breathe" app, which is, you know, OK I guess. It's more like a dumb video game - you have to breathe to match some animated circles. But a meditation timer would be 10x more useful.
 I bought this as a watch for monitoring my heartrate during workouts (so I can moderate my intensity). As such, it is a dismal failure. I will be returning this and try a different watch (probably a Polar). The watch is nice and visually pleasing, but it has a  fundamental flaw  which is that  it does not display your heartrate or your running time continuously during your workout.<br/><br/>This is a feature which to me is so basic that I did not even think about seeing whether it was a supported feature. However, after I got the watch and got the app I tried it, and ran into the issue that once you start the workout the screen goes blank.<br/><br/>I tried to find whether there is a software setting for fixing this There is not (at least I could not find it). There are many people  who want this feature, but Fitbit seems not to care about them, and for me this makes this a watch which is pretty much useless.<br/><br/>This is essentially more a watch for people who like to track their steps and sleep and so on rather than a watch which provides information during a workout, so it is not for me. I wish that had been clearer from the documentation which is a bit misleading (the fitbit website shows lots of people using it while working out),
 I got the Fitbit Charge 2 for a couple reasons:<br/><br/>1) I was tired of having to charge my Microsoft Band 2 every morning and suffering the consequences when I forgot to do it.<br/><br/>2) I wanted a tracking band that worked seamlessly with Gyroscope, an iPhone app that tracks physical, mental and productivity metrics.<br/><br/>The Fitbit fulfills my expectations and more:<br/><br/>(+)  It synced easily with my iPhone and Fitbit.<br/>(+) It updates in real time. Unlike my Microsoft Band 2, which seems to require one to manually initiate the sync, the Fitbit syncs continually throughout the day. In fact, as I'm walking or biking, I can see the step counter ratcheting up in real time.<br/>(+) Aside from tracking the usual health-related metrics, this Fitbit also has a relaxation widget which guides your breathing for 2 to 5 minutes and gets you into a mellow state.<br/>(+) You get notifications and text messages.<br/>(+) Best of all, I can go 3 to 4 days without charging.<br/><br/>That said, I do have gripes that are minor enough that I'm not knocking off any stars:<br/>(-) The default display reminds me of something the Atari era. But if you cycle through the choices, you'll find some pretty good faces that are less embarrassing.<br/>(-) The charging receptacle can be finicky and is also apt to press the button that shuts off notifications. But, if you put it on a few times, things will go smoothly.<br/><br/>In terms of accuracy, counting steps, if you wear it on your wrist, you have to be aware that count steps when it senses normal arm movement that accompanies walking.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a good buy. There are plenty of bands and watches that cost more, have high-resolution color displays, but I have found that the significant trade-offs can be summed up as follows:<br/><br/>1) Not entirely iPhone compatible. From what I can see, most of the Bands that look appealing are more optimized for Android.<br/><br/>2) The requiring charging more often to the point where it becomes a hassle.<br/><br/>I am happy with my Fitbit Charge 2.
 The fitness tracker itself it's Ok, it does basically what it says it does: it track your steps, your heartbeat, and your sleep. I didn't use it for music, I don't care the "couching". But it tracked what I wanted and the battery lasted at least 5 days. But we don't leave today in a world of "just devices". A (big) part of the experience is to make sense of the data you gather. That's why this thing syncs with your phone and you can access your data from a browser. Well, if you are an Android device user, Fitbit doesn't like you.<br/><br/>After a few weeks using it,  I realize that if for some reason it would track and activity wrongly, you would not have the chance to correct that register. Examples: you start a run and forget to turn it off when you are finished... Or you start tracking your activity and you realized later that you have been tracking it the wrong way, i.e., you start to run and when manually activate the activity, by mistake you started tracking it as a biking session... you realize that 15 minutes later, or when you finish the activity.<br/><br/>I thought it was odd you could not do it, so I googled the issue and run into a thread in the Fitbit Support Forums requesting the feature. It was an almost 4 year old thread. I'll do a long story short: after a few weeks I found (and posted) in that thread, they announced in May that they were releasing the feature... for iOS products.... and that they would open a new thread for Android users... That was already bad enough, why would Android users NOT want that? (the original thread was never about Android or iOS, was all the time about being able to correct what you had manually done incorrectly).<br/><br/>And three months after the open the "new" thread on Android, just now, they announce that the feature is "not planned" and they closed the thread right away (obviously to prevent users complaining about the blatant discrimination).<br/><br/>The feature itself might not be critical (even though is basic: you can manually make a mistake, it happened to me as described above: started to run, thought that I had chose the "Run" track, by mistake I chose the one before, "Lifting Weights", and when I finished, I realized the activity was tracked as "Lifting Weights", not running). It's something basic, I mean, that's the fitness tracking experience about: TRACKING WHAT YOU DO IN TERMS OF FITNESS, so, this should be a logical feature.<br/><br/>Not for Fitbit. And never for Fitbit if you use and Android device. This purchase was a mistake. I still give it 2 stars instead of 1 because the device itself does its job, but the user overall experience is poor.
 FItbit Charge 2 was unpleasant from the start; it A. came -without- an a/c adapter, what does this mean? I had to go fish out not 1 but 2 old a/c adapter connectors out of old crap for this $130+ new purchase - absolute garbage., B. with an a proprietary charging connector and only 8" charging cord!! What does this mean? I couldn't connect to my surge protector on the ground getting an extension cord - absolute garbage (trying to get us to by extra accessories at purchase just to enable the most basic usage? Unimpressed), and C. After I finally found a good a/c adapter for the too-short cord and charged it, it told me to go to a website for setup; the website then told me to download the app, and after registering, it had to do a software download for the charge 2 device -for- the app, and -then- it download a separate software update for the damn device which unbelievably took 10 minutes (this is a watch not even a low-grade smartphone)! And it had to be in close physical proximity to my phone the whole time. What a slow boring unboxing setup disaster, I played with it ineffectively for 10 minutes scared there would be more rigmarole and immediately returned. Didn't wait to see how things possibly went from there.
 I purchased this fitbit specifically for the heart rate on the wrist feature.  I had a heart rate monitor before, which gave out on me, so I wanted a product that would give me all in one.<br/><br/>This fitbit does a HORRIBLE job of tracking heart rate when doing extraneous physical activity, and therefore measures your fitness level incorrectly.  After an interval of Insanity, when I can't get out a word b/c I'm that out of breath, I know my heart rate has to be above 160, yet the tracker reads 120.  It makes no sense.  Had I known that this feature worked so bad on this product, I would have purchased a cheaper fitbit AND a heart rate monitor with a chest strap.  Now I already spent the money on the fitbit and will need to get a heart rate monitor to be able to better keep track of my exercise.  Frankly, I would like to send it back but I am outside of the return window now.  Outside of the heart rate features, all other features work well, so it's not a total loss, but definitely not what I was expecting for $150.
 I've been wearing this every day for half a year now and I can confidently say that is has changed my life for the better. Just being aware of my various bio statistics really helps me to make better choices in my life. I think my only complaint would be that the heart rate monitor sometimes doesn't work if I'm too sweaty, but a quick swipe of sensor takes care of that immediately. It is comfortable to wear (I don't even notice it anymore unless it's not on my wrist) and the battery lasts for several days even when on constant update mode. It is easy to wear, easy to use, and easy to configure settings to work the way I want them to. I also like its social aspect; I can connect with my friends who also have fitbits and compare information that I want to share with them. I like that I can charge it in my car and not miss out on any steps or sleep. Sleep is one of the best monitors, especially since the update that allows me to see when I am in Deep, Light, REM sleep or awake.
 I have only 1 con with this. The sensor for steps is a bit sensitive. I was flipping through index cards and it was counting it as steps. Otherwise if you don't take the count meter extremely seriously then it should be a problem. It's not a perfect science. There will be times it doesn't count a few steps and I guess it makes up for the time it took steps when it shouldn't. At the end of the day it should be considered an estimate... Right?<br/><br/>Anyway,<br/>The app and the product is solid. It has everything you would want to stay motivated everyday. That's the point too right, to stay motivated and watch your progress. This will do that. It has a very high quality feel which you expect from one of the lead activity tracker company's. Fitbit knows what they are doing.<br/><br/>If you are a hardcore person then this probably isn't the right product for you. If your an average person then yes, I recommend it. I do wish the product itself was slightly thinner but overtime I imagine that will happen. 😉👍
 My daughter bought me a Fitbit for Father's day.  Just after the 1 year warranty, it fell apart.  The rubber band peeled off and bubbled.  I wouldn't have bought a new one except I didn't want her to know that it fell apart.  I replaced it since she had spent a lot of money on this gift and I didn't want her to feel bad.  I called Fitbit and they wouldn't replace it.  If you buy a Fitbit, don't expect it to last very long.  I won't buy from this company again!<br/><br/>Update: New Fitbit band is coming apart. Apparently, Fitbit hasn't improved the band which is still defective. How difficult is it to make a decent band. If it was just a solid piece of rubber or silicone this wouldn't happen. I love my Fitbit but will be shopping for a different brand fitness tracker that doesn't need to be replaced every 6-12 months.
 When I first got this I didn't like it, but I gave it a shot and now I feel lost without it. The positives are the calorie counter, step counter, and that it buzzes me when I get messages. It is interesting to know about my sleep cycle, although it isn't particularly helpful. The calorie counter is cool, because I know how many calories I burn with my workout and then can base my intake on that to maintain my weight - which in the app there is a food intake/ calorie keeper. It's handy that a lot of the foods can be scanned in by their bar code. The step counter is good, because it is motivational. The message notification is convenient, because I like to leave my phone on vibrate. The negatives are that it doesn't recognize all my workouts. It will for the elliptical, and walking if it's brisk and for long enough. My Pilates and weights though, nope. It is very irritating to realize I didn't start my workout timer after I am already 20-30 minutes into my workout. The food intake on the app could use some work. My frequent list should recognize my frequent meals obviously, but it doesn't do a very good job. I haven't drank coffee for breakfast in months, but yet it's still on there and my daily oatmeal isn't??? As for the message notification, it appears that you can only be notified for 3 things? So, I have my FB messenger, my phone for calls and my calendar reminders. Sometimes the buzz for my calendar doesn't work, and I really wished I could opt to have my text messages buzz me too, but there's only an option for 3 notification buzzes. Aesthetically it is kind of bulky. I like the purple band enough and it's easy to clean, but I wanted the rose gold to be shiny not the cheap looking matte it is. My last wish would be that it charged quicker. If I am going to have to charge it every couple to few days then I'd like it to charge quicker, otherwise I am losing out on my steps being counted or my sleep being recorded. Neither are super important, but why buy the watch if you didn't want to track these things?
 I had a FitBit Flex that I loved, but I was never crazy about the band design and I lost several. After the last time, I'd found it and put it in a pocket where it went through the washer and dryer - it still worked, but not well. I replaced it with the Charge 2 mostly because of the band design - this one has a steel buckle, like a regular watch.<br/><br/>The Charge 2 has a lot going for it even if you did like the other band style. It charges without a fuss using a simple clip (provided, and uses a USB port). It shows stairs climbed (and counts hills as stairs.) You can see the time and your current steps - or whatever your primary goal is - by a press of a button. It shows - pretty accurately - your heart rate. Also shows your distance traveled, calorie burn, minutes of intense activity and how many times you've managed to get 250 (in my case) steps in each hour of your day.  This FitBit seems to have improved what it counts as "steps" - my old Flex appeared to count some arm movements as steps, but the Charge 2 seems pretty accurate.<br/><br/>The Charge 2 not only counts sleep in overall hours and graphs your time awake, it also graphs your sleep cycles, showing awake, light sleep, deep sleep and REM (dream) periods. You can look at all this information on your phone, laptop or any device via Bluetooth. FitBit also can share info with SparkPeople (and likely others.) The Charge 2 will gently prompt you to get moving (if you want it to) and celebrates enthusiastically when you meet your goal for the day.<br/><br/>The only, very slight, drawback is that it's larger than the Flex, and I'm not a fan of large watches. But that said, it's shiny black and they have lot if different colors of bands available, including metallics, so it can be dressed up or made to match an outfit or a whim.<br/><br/>Overall, yes. Definitely an improvement in both band design and FitBit function. Worth the price.
 I'm not a big fan of inconsistent tap activation. Sometimes you have to tap normally, then sometimes tap harder than you would like to on an expensive watch. The HR monitor was not very accurate at first, but after a month or so it got better and more consistent. Early on it would tell me I had just a 110bpm at very high levels during intense workout, now it's around 170bpm, which matches other monitors I've used. I like the simplicity of the watch, and when you want more info and stats you can just open the app on your phone instead of fidgeting with the watch. I also love the way it links and is compatible with many 3rd party tracking apps like Lose it, where I also track my calories/macros. I've only had it for a few months, like it allot, but don't love it. Mainly because the design feels dated. The Alta is skinny looks good only on women, the ionic is too huge for a simple workout tracker. The charge 2 is the sweetspot in size, gender neutral, but definitely needs a bit of a refresher. I would like something a little nicer, but just as simple as the charge 2 and I would definitely buy it. That's why I knocked off 1 star. Also, I bought it on sale for $99 so it was a good price point, I would definitely not had bought it when it was selling for $149.
 I've had this for about two weeks. My biggest complaint is measuring the heartbeat during intense workouts. I have measured it using my phone and doing a 15 sec count to see if it's off. Half the time it won't even register my heartbeat and the other half, it's reading ~100 when it's actually 150-160.<br/><br/>Measuring sleep seems fairly accurate. For the most part, if I wake up it recognizes it and usually is close to the amount of time I'm awake for. Once they had had a long wake up when I fell back asleep (registered 50 min when it was probably 5 min). I have no clue about the light/deep/rem because the only way I could realistically measure it would be to have an actual analysis.<br/><br/>The battery life is great. Not only does it last for roughly 4 days, but it charges quick. I throw it on the charger for 30 min every so often and it hasn't died on me yet. I don't need to let it sit over night.<br/><br/>Steps seem accurate. Software seems good. I knocked it on easy to use because I don't know if there's a better way to wear it to measure my HB. I did it how they told me to so if I find a better way to get consistent accuracy, I'll bump the stars up for sure. My main reason for this is the HB and calories.
 The heartbeat sensor gets annoying constantly pressing against your wrist. I find that I have to wear it very loosely to be comfortable. The bluetooth connection to your phone works but the display is so small and the scrolling so slow that it's really only effective to cue you whether you want to look at your phone or get it later (which may be the desired purpose). I primarily use it to trigger me to move from my desk every hour. For that, it's effective. In terms of tracking steps each hour, the tapping on the screen to move to the right screen gets old and is not a great user experience. Still, they had the foresight to allow you to change the order of those screens which makes all the difference in the world. I now have hourly steps as the first screen so no more tapping necessary. While the sleep information is interesting, you won't want to wear this to bed every night. It definitely wears your skin down and is uncomfortable when worn too long.
 I wanted one for a long time, kept trying to decide between which brand.  I have Mac phone and laptop so was considering Apple Watch.  Am so glad I got this instead.  I liked the pure black so was willing to pay more for the"gunmetal" color.  It has already motivated me DAILY to not only track my food but to get up and move more.....and the get in that 5 days of exercise.  It tracks my sleep and quality of my sleep, the face is the perfect size for my wrist (I was worried since I am a 5'1" female that it would be too large looking on my arm), and the small was more than big enough for my wrist.(I almost got the large but I actually have plenty of length with the small.). I have also been traditionally allergic to metals other than 14 K gold, so the stainless steel on the back of watch faces has given me rashes and I haven't been able to wear a watch for years.  I have zero problems with the Fitbit and my skin,  So glad I finally got it.  Wishing I had gotten it a few years ago instead of waiting so long.  If you have been considering getting one....just do it.  It's wonderful
 I have been using the fit bit charge 2 for several months now for several months. This is my first tracker, and so I can only report on how it works, rather than how it compares to others.  Overall, the Charge 2 is a nice sized tracker, seems to be well made, and has apple and android apps that let you keep track of a a good deal of helpful information--much of which tends to encourage you to exercise more, which is good for most of us.<br/><br/>First some of the positives: (1) it provides a variety of useful information--heart rate, steps, estimated miles walked, hours of sleep, estimated calories. (2) It does so for all manner of exercise from hiking and biking to elliptical trainers and workouts.  The stat's tracked are about the same for each, but keeping track of separate activities helps keep one's past exercise clearer in one's mind. (3) It attempts to estimate sleep patterns, which for folks with a bit of insomnia or irregular hours can help give one a sense of how bad a night or week they've had. (4) There are several published tests of the fit bit that show it to be quite accurate, probably sufficiently so for the purposes most folks use it for. (5) When a phone is carried along, it will also plot your route fairly accurately on what looks like a google map.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there are some glitches: (1) One that seems to be common among users is that during intense exercise (how intense probably depends on your fitness level) the fitbit itself fails to compute heart beat rates, which if one is trying to make sure that he or she doesn't "over do" it, is a major nusiance. (2) At least for me, the heart beat counts do not seem to be accurate all of the time, it seems to systematically under count them during and after pushups for example and often gives excessively high counts when walking. This can sometimes be a bit worrying and/or annoying,<br/> since the numbers shown make you want to believe thay are accurate. (It would be useful to have Fitbit publish some statistics on their website about accuracy.) (3) The sleep patterns seem to be fairly accurate most nights, but again there are nights when it seems to insist that I was awake when I was not, and ones where it insists that I was asleep when I was not.  This is less troubling for me than it might be for others, but again it would be nice if fitbit would give us a sense of how accurate their model is. (4) I've noticed that sometimes the stairs counted leave out rises and falls noted on the fitbit during a walk--which seems odd. (5) Much of the data processing is done at the fitbit website, so when one is away from the web, the fit bit app will not tell you anything more--indeed less--than the fitbit itself.<br/><br/>All in all, even with the glitches, its a very useful engaging device. The "data" is nearly always plausible and a great reinforcer of exercise even for someone who has never had a serious problem keeping an exercise routine going.
 I have absolutely loved this product. I looked at the Apple Watch, the Fitbit Blaze, and this one, and finally decided on this one - and I am very glad. I am a medical student so using the stopwatch in clinic is easy and helpful for taking vitals, and it shows me texts and phone calls so I don't have to pull out my phone; I am very active and love how this tracks my exercises and normal daily activities to show me peak heart rate and fat burn vs. cardio, etc; and I also have anxiety and depression and have loved having this to track my heart rate AND I love the guided breathing exercises, perfect and discreet throughout the day. I purchased other bands to go with it and love having the options, a screen protector, and I wish I would've bought a different charging cable and charging stand right away because it is a little difficult to charge with the short cable they sent. There is a slight learning curve, granted I like to learn as I go instead of reading the instructions. The app for my phone is amazing as well - track what you eat (and it shows caloric intake vs. calories burned), water intake, your sleep cycles, your heart rate throughout the day, your exercise, your weight and body fat, and your activity (which you can customize! adjust how many flights of stairs, miles, calories to be burned, and fat burning minutes). I love that it sends me reminders to move - I get up and walk for a bit at least and go up and down our stairs. Cannot say enough about this product.

The original firbit strap was extremely poor quality and literally cracked after what I would only imagine a normal use for any active fitbit user.<br/><br/>2.  About 6-7 months in, the fitbit has been absolutely horrible tracking my steps especially when doing chores inside the house when I am holding stuff and walking around etc. It seems to be working fine when I exercise and there is continuous active period of several minutes.<br/><br/> However while walking on and off without moving your hands it fails to record any steps at all which is ridiculous and disppointing if you are trying to hit a step goal per day.<br/><br/>Guess what? when I am using hair dryer though it records many steps which I never took!!!!!!!!! Too much reliance on hand movement resulting in inaccurate step-count. Not sure if I got a lemon but definitely not happy with any of this.<br/><br/>3. Sleep recording seems to be terribly off as well, as it shows I am awake more than an hour every night even though I am clearly not and I do not have it on sensitive setting.<br/><br/>For the amount of money spent, these issues are absolutely unacceptable for a device not even a year old. Unfortunately it is too late to return this, and definitely will not be upgrading.<br/><br/>*********************************************************************************************************************************************************<br/>Edited to add the video to show that it literally hardly tracks any steps unless you move your hands!!!!!!!! --- absolutely unacceptable, so disappointed with this purchase.
 I love mine!  I am still fascinated with checking my info frequently and it works to motivate me on sluggish days.  I wasn't sure I could get 10,000 steps a day in so I set it to 8,000 steps a day but I am managing to exceed the 10,000 on most days as I am averaging more than that.  I have started running in addition to doing my 2x/ week weight workouts and still occasionally doing my at home DVD workouts.  It also helps to make sure I am drinking enough water (although this requires that you log in how much you drink).  I love the reminders!  It buzzes me to let me know when I have hit my goal and to remind me to get my 250 steps in per hour.  I also can log what i am eating and I was surprised to see I eat more calories than I thought.  I am not currently trying to lose weight as I am breastfeeding my baby so I am not worried about that for the moment but I do want to keep working out to get back in shape.  This is great for motivation, for tracking so I can see how I am doing and then when I go back in the log I can see how well I have done.  I do still have times when I want to veg out a little more but that's ok because i can always add some steps in later on.  If I had known I probably would have gone with the smaller wrist band.  I wear it on the smallest or 2nd to smallest setting and I got the large - I wish there was at least one smaller setting.  I got this size because you are supposed to move it up your arm a little and wear it tighter when you are working out so you can more accurately get a reading on your heart rate.  Also, I noticed I have to be more careful when I set it up to recharge as sometimes I haven't done it right and all night I go on thinking it will be ready in the morning but not so because I didn't set it up right.  I look forward to learning what other things I can do with it.  I haven't tried the guided workouts or the relax feature.  Love, Love Love it!
 I never thought I would love the Fitbit as much as I do. Before I actually decided to try one out, I was skeptical because I thought it was just some silly step counter! This is my first one ever, and there's something about it that motivates me insanely to move more and eat better. You can track your food intake, sleep patterns, water intake, heart rate throughout the day, calories burned, and of course, as we all know, your steps. Most importantly, the Charge 2 vibrates to remind you to move, shows your text messages and calendar notifications if you sync it with your phone via Bluetooth, and always keeps itself on your mind (in a healthy way). I'd highly recommend trying it out if you are trying to lose weight or need a way to keep your fitness/nutrition goals on your mind.<br/><br/>Only cons: Sex and singing burn calories, and they should totally be on the list for the exercise log!
 My daughter loaned one to my wife and it helped her understand her sleep and daily routine, so I bought one for her and one for myself.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>It serves as a watch and can show you at a glance how much exercise you are getting into your day without carrying the telephone all the time. Counts steps walking or running, tracks your run on GPS (if you set it), and in theory, tracks how many floors you climb.<br/><br/>It pushes you to get up and meet your goals.<br/>You have a good record of heartbeats without taking your heart beat all the time. It is very accurate in counting steps.<br/><br/>With the app on your phone, you can see yesterday's, or the week's exercise, sleep, heartbeats. The sleep tracking can help you try different things to sleep better (caveat below).<br/><br/>When the battery is low, it sends an email to tell you.<br/>_______________<br/>Cons:<br/>You have to take it off to swim and shower. So you have no monitor of how you are doing in the pool, and it is also a nuisance.<br/><br/>It does not count climbing the stairs if you are carrying anything or sometimes on carpeted steps. The step counting algorithm needs work. In theory it works with your activity and biometric pressure. I made an overnight flight, sitting in my seat from 10:30 pm to 5:00 am. At 2:30 I looked at my watch and had climbed three flights of stairs. Yesterday I was out walking as a gusty, cold front came in, by the end of my 2 mile walk around the flat neighborhood, it said I had climbed 16 flights of stairs. By the end of the day, sitting the rest of it, I had 19 flights of stairs. But my wife, who did not leave the house, had ZERO flights for the day.<br/><br/>Sometimes in stops recording in your sleep if your arm gets in certain positions, where I guess the contacts don't conduct what they have to.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how it calculates the different sleep modes, as sometimes I'm sure I'm awake, but it says I'm sleeping.<br/><br/>It does not count treadmill walking. The reminder to get up and walk even goes off during your exercise if your exercise at the moment does not include walking.<br/><br/>There is a function that tracks your active time at a pace harder than normal, but it only tracks if that has been over ten minutes. So if I walk slowly to the pool, it is 15 minutes, not counted. If I go at my normal fast pace, it counts the 12 minute walk. If I go at a faster walk, I get there in 9 minutes so it is not registered.<br/><br/>You need to find a time to take it off to charge every 5 days or so for a couple of hours, and it will not record during that time.
 I realized when I was looking for my Fitbit I was having a very hard time deciding whether to choose small or large. My wrist size is 6.5 inches and I also used the printed size chart directly from the Fitbit website...which My end result was a large...It fell just on the large side of the little coloured bar. I decided to get a small...and I made a right choice. With the small, I can wear as they recommend. Not to snug, not to loose. Plus I have an excess of 4 more holes remaining to choose from.
 Pros:<br/>-Sleep Stages are awesome.......when it decides to actually sync and record sleep times.<br/>-The charging cord is so much easier than charge HR<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-Instead of just tapping the button to start a workout you have to tap the button, select Run then select which type of workout you are doing. Way too complicated and plain annoying when you are in the mood to do a workout and have to do all of that nonsense. Record the type later in the app. Way too much.<br/>-Silent alarm is not as strong a vibration as the Charge HR was. Have slept through it several times.<br/>-Stopped syncing sleep stages 15 days after I received it.<br/><br/>I previously had a Charge HR that had no issues at all for 2 years until the band holder fell off. Fitbit of course makes no replacements so I bought a replacement off ebay. Those fell off time and time again so I saw this sale on Amazon and picked one up on June 7, 2017. Got it June 11th and here it is June 26, 2017 and it is not syncing correctly and sleep stages is wonky and does not accurately record or sometimes even show up. I have been on the community forums and googling how to restart it (3 times in a row while plugged in) and all the other suggestions to fix it but nothing is working. I am not impressed at all with this ALLEGED upgrade to my Charge HR. Had I not given it to my daughter who is unwilling to give it back I would gladly continue to pay $3 for 10 band holders rather than this piece of junk.
 I really like this Fitbit (which was a replacement for a Fitbit Charge).  Having the larger screen allows better notifications and control of actions that the Fitbit does.  Constant heart rate monitoring gives a better overall look into your fitness level by being able to compare resting heart rates to exercising rates.  The Fitbit is well made and the straps are replaceable this time around (which is great because I am rough on straps, and my previous Fitbit was all beat up with gouges taken out of the rubberized strap).  The battery lasts almost an entire week and has a proprietary charging system which works but could be better with the standard micro USB charger almost everything uses.  I did purchase a screen protector as again, I tend to be kind of rough on these things so I want to protect it a little.  The screen is much brighter to me and displays well in bright sunlight as well as darkness.  The app that supports this Fitbit is outstanding and tracks a lot of useful information.. It also allows for manual input of dietary info as well as water intake and others.  My probably biggest like on this is the fact that it reminds me to get up after sitting for so long and walk around.  As a person who is at a desk most of the day, this helps get me up and stretch the ole joints out.  Highly recommended.
 I accidentally dropped my Charge HR in the sink and it stopped working so it was time to upgrade to the HR 2! I was super excited about it but I've been kind of disappointed in it. I thought it would be better since it's a newer model but it frequently drops my heart rate especially during workouts. Fitbit tells me to wipe away any sweat that gets under the band but that doesn't really seem to help during workouts. I've tried moving the tracker to different places on my wrist/lower arm and tried the whole wipe sweat away every few minutes thing but it doesn't really seem to help. About 10-15 minutes into my workouts it just drops my heart rate and can't seem to find it again. I would only run into this problem once in a while with my Charge HR but now that I've upgraded to the Charge 2 it's almost every day that I'm noticing the heart rate issue. I loved my Charge HR and I'm kind of regretting not just buying another one. The Charge HR 2 does have some nice features like the reminders to move and a much more functional screen but the heart rate thing really dropped my rating on this one.
 I wanted to get a fitness tracker so I could sync with my health insurance company to receive their rewards and discounts. First, I purchased a $30 fitness tracker and could not sync it to any app on my phone.  I then decided to just go for it and purchase an Apple watch since I had an iPhone anyway.  The Apple watch would not even hold a charge for 6-7 hours! I returned it and bought this fit bit.  I am super, super happy with it! The charge lasts for about a week. It's comfortable to wear and I still get text/call notifications if I want.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 for two reasons- 1. It does not have a do not disturb feature on it, I like to wear it while I sleep to use the sleep tracker feature and I had to find workarounds to my issues. This means I must remember to manually turn off text/call notifications at night. AND every time I moved the watch face lights up and wakes me up.  So I just turned off call/text notifications all the time so I do not forget and only turn this feature on when I need it. I also cut an old tube sock and wear it as a wristband over the fit bit at night so the light doesn't wake me. I did some research and it seems this is one thing most people are unhappy with. 2. It doesn't count steps unless you are swinging your arm.  This means pushing a cart or stroller won't count steps.  I often am carrying things in my hands and usually not swinging so much when walking so I purchased a leg band to wear during my walks and it seems to get a more accurate step count.  With the steps- when I was wearing my apple watch and did nothing but sit and crochet all day, it counted 10,000 steps.  The nice thing with the fit bit is it records a few steps while I am crocheting, but it's more accurate than the apple watch for me!<br/><br/>Even with the two things that I had to find a workaround I am extremely happy with the Fitbit! It certainly has motived me to get out and move more!
 Initially I loved it, but soon, as I tried to glean some insight from the data it is collecting from me, I was disappointed. The moderators on their online forum respond quickly to your complaints and suggestions, but seemingly never in a useful way. After a couple of months, I was having issues with spotty step counts. Now, the HR monitor, which was the whole reason I purchased the item, no longer works. I would have given this one star, but at least it made it for a year before crapping out on me. But still -- shame on Fitbit.
 I have been using this for about a month now.  Here's some things that I feel need to be improved- 1. Battery Life.  It seems that the battery lasts about 4 days before it is needing to be charged.  I would have wanted it to last closer to 7 days.  I try to find a convenient time to charge mine such as when I have hit my step goal/had a very active day and am looking to watch some TV for the night.  2.  The watch band keeper strap- the additional tab is obtrusive and makes the band difficult to tuck.  3.  Learning the exact point of pressure to get the screen to scroll is a little difficult to learn.  The instructions are useless on this feature.<br/><br/>I gave it three stars because of the "little" things that need improvement.  Overall, this is a great way to track your activity through the day.  If you are a cube farmer and don't have an active lifestyle, it will confirm that.  If you have a job that allows you to walk a good bit, it will help you track your daily activity so that you can see the days you excel and the days you just have an average day.
 I got this watch through another seller, so my experience with the buying and shipment will not be included in this review. However, I think we're all aware of Amazons great Prime service.<br/><br/>1/2/2018:<br/><br/>Fit - First day of wearing the Charge 2. So far, the fit is great. However, I do wear it "upside down" where the sensor is over my wrist on my left arm. I notice a bit more accuracy when wearing it like this. I tried my right arm as I have a sleeve of tattoos on my left arm and didn't notice any real difference when switching arms, but wearing it in this fashion does increase accuracy of the HR monitor IMO and also increases comfort as it conforms to the shape of my arm a bit better.<br/><br/>Form - The form is great! I got the standard edition in large, color black. The screen is small and the whole thing is very sleek. The display is not colored, just black and white, but does display pretty well in the sunlight as well. I've heard other people suggest silicone bands that the iWatch has, and I'm pretty sure they have leather bands available. The bands are really easy to take off, once you get the hang of it, and require no additional tools. Great look overall.<br/><br/>Function - Now, this is the main reason we all bought or are looking to buy this thing right? This will be in two sections: the product and the app.<br/><br/>Product Function - The product functions well, has a lot of options, has reminders and alerts to keep you on track with your goals, syncs up to your phone through the app and can display texts and calls, and also has an alarm function. I've noticed the HR monitor is pretty accurate (typically within a couple of BPM's) most of the time. I haven't noticed any inconsistencies with the step counter, because counting thousands of steps would be impossible for me. I do love that you can change it from a step monitor to a calorie burn counter (FitBit has their own algorithm for this) which will display on the watch and the display can actually be changed to suit your taste. There are plenty of options and I won't list them all here, just the ones that I find impressive. Go to their website and look at the help page to find out more.<br/><br/>App Function - I've been a member of MyFitnessPal before and the FitBit app works pretty similarly. You can input food and scan barcodes, input water intake, input alarms and goals, change notifications and display setting and menu settings. They have recently added the macro info, but it is only in percentages. I find percentages to be kind of useless, and would like a further breakdown by grams, which it sounds like they're working on. There's plenty more this app can do, but those are the basics. I've really found that this app has me really dedicated to inputting the information in there, which definitely helps.<br/><br/>Overall - Love this product and it is a huge improvement over the first model I used when FitBit first introduced their basic product line. It's very intuitive and allows you to track the basics for weight loss. It probably won't suit the more professional athletes deeper needs, but it does a great job for the average Joe. There are plenty of products that can sync with the FitBit app, and I'm currently waiting on a Weight Gurus scale to keep all my weight loss and gain information in one place. Marked it down by one star as the macros only have percentages, and the product seems to work better when the unit is situated under the wrist. Other than that, I absolutely am satisfied with this product.
 I wore it for about a minute to see how it looked before I took it off to give my daughter a bath. Half way through the bath I started getting dizzy and hot. And then it got so bad that I felt like I had vertigo. I was yelling for my husband because I was so freaked out, and couldn't walk downstairs to get him. I thought maybe I had food poisoning, but I never got sick, just the worst dizziness I've ever experienced. I realized the only thing I did differently than normal was put on the fitbit with the pulsing green lights underneath, so I googled the effects. I found dozens of testimonials about this specific fitbit model giving people vertigo and extreme dizziness, to the point they were seeing neurologists because it was so bad. I normally don't write reviews, but I can't believe this product is allowed to be on the market.
 I really enjoyed my fitbit for 14 months. Out of nowhere, it just stops working. There is no way to reset it as it won't even recognize the charger anymore. Blank screen- it won't sync. Never got through to customer service rep as I was on hold for a very long time. I see on here and on the fitbit community help board that I'm not the only one whose stopped working just after the warranty. I also see that they are offering those who can get through to customer service 25% off a replacement...sounds a bit fishy...
 This replaced my Fitbit Charge HR that I wore for approximately 2 years. Like the Charge 2, the Charge HR showed gave me some visibility into how I sleep too few hours or have fewer active minutes than expected (I frequently got over 10k steps/day and over 20 flights/day with relatively few "active" minutes of increased heart rate). However, I can't say for sure that the Charge HR resulted in any different behavior for me personally.<br/><br/>The Charge 2, on the other hand, has definitely increased my activity throughout the day. I work at a desk job and I now get an alert if I've walked fewer than 250 steps in an hour. I use to average 7-8 hours/day of 250+ steps and I've averaged 12 hours/day for the last 10 days.<br/><br/>The Charge 2 looks more similar to a watch than the Charge HR and has the option to change out the band. I've ordered a dressier band but it hasn't arrived yet. I'm hoping it will look nicer with work/dress clothes. In any case, the band was the part that broke on my old one.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that the face scratched easier than expected (and I don't want to wear a screen protector over it as I think it would be more noticeable appearance-wise than the scratches). In any case, I was doing yoga outdoors and set my arm down gently on concrete (not swinging it, and no forceful contact. just laid it down) and ended up with 2 small scratches on the face in the first week of using it.<br/><br/>If you're deciding between the Charge 2 or Charge HR, I'd go for the Charge 2.
 Do not buy this. The first one I received was defective. After jumping through hoops, they sent a replacement. I was unable to pair that one to my android. Fitbit is aware of the update/technical issue on their end, they admit it was a snafu with their programmers,  but  almost 2 weeks later, it still isn't fixed and they keep giving me the runaround. Apologies, but no solutions. I have useless, expensive piece of junk sitting on my dresser, and corporate doesn't seem to care at all. I have contacted them numerous times and can't even get an estimate as to when they will resolve this issue. Fitbit Corp. Does not care about customers.
 I purchased this device to help me meet my new fitness goals and also to gain better insight in to my sleep patterns. It was very easy to set up right out of the box. I had to swap out the band with one that was more adjustable, but I have an freakishly small wrist and nothing ever fits me. The device is very easy to use and is comfy to wear, though it took a few days to get used to the bulk. I love the app! The device syncs with the app on your phone when it is within Bluetooth range and gives up to the minute statistics. I am able to easily add glasses of water to my dashboard to keep track of hydration. I especially love the sleep information. It is very detailed and easy to read. AND at the end of each week, FitBit sends me an email with a summary of the weeks data. I now find myself moving more since I really want to get to that 10,000 step goal so my device will display a firework show and congratulate me on my success.
 I bought this for exercise &amp; heart rate monitoring, but it is really not that useful. I found my old misfit device is better. The heart rate worked about 90% of the time, but sometimes not. It almost never correctly reported going up &amp; down stairs. It doesn't pick up exercise such as riding an Exercycle or lifting weights. Basically this is only good for walking and running.<br/>You can record minutes doing a limited set of things, such as yoga or cycling. But it doesn't give you step credit for them. An expensive toy that didn't do what I wanted.
 I have mixed feelings about my Fitbit charge 2. I mainly bought it to track my steps and moreso my sleep. The Fitbit has problems in both categories that have had me contemplating returning this. I just wanted it so badly I dont want to return it but it seems useless. I realized that when Im driving in the car it will often count as steps! Like wtf?!? I drove about 30 miles last night and it said I took about 2500 steps in the time I was driving. So its clearly not accurate any day since I drive my car every day. The main reason for my purchase was to track my sleep. About 40% of the time it doesnt work. It will tell me the times I slept but it wont calculate the level of sleep im in throughout the night as far as if I was in light, REM, or deep. My girlfriend has one and said maybe I wear it to tight since she wears hers more loose and hers works way more often than mine. But I tried loosening it and it seems to work even less now. Im very disappointed.
 I purchased the Gunmetal special edition Fitbit Charge 2 a day before a big international trip. I wanted to be able to track how much we were walking, floors climbed and average hear-rate as we did walking tours around cities in Italy. This little activity tracker has exceeded my expectations in terms of what it can do for such a small size and value. I was very certain I'd get the apple watch. I realized there were too many features on the watch, yet it didn't work on notifications from non-watch apps - ugh! I like that the Charge 2 is a great activity tracker AND has text, call and calendar notification ability as well - why did I need the apple watch then?!!! I also like that the Charge 2 is easy to use and cycle through all the options it has, without trying to click on a watch's screen (as is the case of the apple watch). Looks good, works well and easy to operate with multi exercise mode capability, and great value for money vs. other activity trackers out there. I paid around $30 extra for the Gunmetal color which looks very sleek and un-watch-like.I don't know if there is any actual gunmetal in this product, but I will say I don't see scratches on the screen. The app is pretty nice to use too, and the fitbit online community has SO much information on how to get the most out of your Charge 2. I recommend this as a great fitness tracker!
 I have had several fitness trackers and all of them kind of sick, including this one.  Not my first fitbit - that one did actually get returned (Charge HR) as a warranty issue for short battery life.  We have an Alta.  I dabbled with a super inaccurate cheap Chinese unit, and also played with a Polar - which was amazing as a wearable device but was horrible as a bluetooth connection device - completely negating its usefulness.<br/><br/>Then there's this one.<br/><br/>The heart rate monitor confuses me.  I have a Polar chest heart rate monitor which is very accurate.  We have at home work outside with intense cardio.  Insanity Max 30 - this device is within a fre beats of being accurate.  ANYTHING else with elevated heart rates and it's just ridiculously wrong.<br/><br/>Example- on our Bowfkex Max Trainer... my heart rate monitor will register 185.  The hand held on the machine will register 184.  The Charge HR? Uh, well, 95 - of course.<br/><br/>The problem with this is when you try to track daily calorie burning and you have multiple sources saying a workout was 300+ calories burned, and Fitbit says 'great job, you worked out for longer than you actually did a d burned 30% of the calories you actually did'.<br/><br/>I guess it's nice for tracking steps and sleep - although I find that inaccurate too.<br/><br/>It gets 3 stars because I haven't returned it.  Just on the cusp of "keepable".
 Lost 4.6 lbs since I purchased this.  I am diabetic and have not lost weight but gained it incrementally.  I started inputting my food and can see my calorie count in and out.  It helps me to eat less.  Twice I over ate and went for a few laps around the neighborhood to bring my in calorie under my out calories.<br/><br/>I love how it wakes my in the morning.  I get up earlier than hubby and no more loud noise that wakes him up.  And no more startling for me.<br/><br/>Easy to track water input, just select the bottle.<br/><br/>Sleep - well I have real problems in this area.  FITBIT is identifying key times that I wake up, which I did not know about.  Working with this info and my sleep people I feel confident the cause will be identified.
 I bought this after trying a cheaper brand and I absolutely love it.<br/><br/>The accompanying app is detailed and easily customizable, and the band itself gives tons of feedback (or less, if you prefer). It's encouraging and full of support to help you get in shape, and being able to track my caloric intake (and output) and my sleep patterns are great. It's even got me going out of my way to get a few extra steps in. Plus there's a sister app called Fitstar that has online workout programs that track with the Fitbit, making it even easier to stay in shape.<br/><br/>I had one minor issue that cropped up regarding notifications, but after a ten minute live chat with a tech I had it fixed which really impressed me.<br/><br/>Hands down worth the money.
 I bought this and have been wearing it constantly for about three months now. I LOATHE the wrist band. It is nearly impossible to get the strap through the little loop without assistance. For the first week or so, I had a weird tingling/very mild burning sensation in my wrist. I googled that and it sounds like a lot of people have had that happen. Only because I'm such a cheapskate did I keep wearing the thing. Luckily it doesn't bother me anymore. I don't know if the tumor blocks the nerves now or what. (Kidding?)<br/><br/>As far as recording steps, heart rate and sleep, no complaints here. It does what it should. It's the write band I hate. I know they sell other ones but I paid over $100 for this so by God I'm going to use it.
 Inaccurate. Doesn't calculate steps correctly, even when stride length is adjusted. Doesn't track distance accurately, which cannot be corrected. After one replacement band and several conversations with Fitbit I've learned that they are aware of its inaccuracy and there is no fix for it. They suggested manually adding my workouts for accuracy. But that's what I bought a fitness band for.
 I had the Fitbit Charge HR before buying this Charge 2. Overall, the Charge 2 is nicer in a number of ways, and people have detailed those here, but just the appearance alone is much better.<br/><br/>So, why give it only 3 stars?<br/><br/>--Even more than the HR, getting the band strapped on, and more so getting it off, is an absolute pain every single time. Not easy at all.<br/>--I use activity apps on my iPhone 7 Plus and my Pixel XL during the 6 days a week I speed walk. The Charge 2 never agrees with them statistically, but the smartphone apps are always almost exactly the same as each other when I have done tests carrying both phones.<br/>--I have put the HR and the Charge 2 on a wrist each, and THEY don't agree with each other.<br/>--I'm coming up on 74 years old in a few months, and I'm very active, but tonight the Charge 2 claimed I had a resting heart rate of 58. Baloney. That's really nice to see at my age, but it's way low. As it is, the Charge 2 pretty constantly shows a 63 or 64 resting heart rate. No other method or device gives that reading. I wish it were true!<br/>--On the other hand the smartphone apps and the Charge 2 are in close agreement on the number of steps I take when walking, but then, they're not remotely close on how long I walked, time-wise. The physical distance I traveled, though, is usually more reliable than the other data.<br/>--I'm not really sure how it's coming up with its sleep data. I have started taking it off before bed.<br/>--So, basically, I've got a nice activity tracking device, which sold for a very reasonable price, but with a data stream that I can't seem to verify most of time in most of the readings.<br/>--Also, the Fitbit app and Dashboard are sometimes accessible, sometimes not, on my computer. Fitbit has been trying to download an upgrade to their desktop app (iMac) for a week or two, and it fails every time. No other downloads have failed in that time period.<br/>--Trying to be even-handed about this because I want to like it, I really like the new charging cable. That might sound like I'm trying to be sarcastic, but I'm not. It's a really big improvement.<br/>--In the end, all I can do is watch the readings and trends on the Charge 2 and compare them to each other, but not to real-world data.<br/>--I have no plans to send it back. I think it will improve over time with software updates.<br/>--Quite a bit of time has passed since I wrote the review above. With one exception, I have come to like the device quite a bit. The exception, unfortunately, is extremely important. It syncs and updates the Dashboard VERY sporadically, and I haven't had it sync in a week now. I've followed the companies suggestions for solving this. No luck.<br/>--One thing that is very important to me (at almost 75 now) is the accuracy of my heart rate while exercising. I have found that to be quite reliable.
 Amazon Review Checkers seem to rate the reviews on this product as suspicious, I suggest everyone check the review qualities sites before buying anything on amazon.<br/><br/>I wanted this to work, but unfortunately, this isn't a good fit for me.<br/><br/>I had seen some review sites raving about the app. So this was a complete surprise for me, but the app is frustrating to use. It's unresponsive, and fails to update even after repeatedly 'syncing'. You end up clicking on stats multiple times without anything popping up. One place, where the app does shine is its community function. If you had buddies using fitbit, you can set challenges and have friendly competition with them. It's a good and fun way to motivate you.<br/><br/>While it looks sleek, the band itself isn't the most comfortable and doesn't "give". This will become a problem especially if you're doing weights or anything requiring you to flex your forearm muscles. Taking it off and adjusting is a surprising hassle as well. I know it's a small thing, but when you have to deal with it everyday, it becomes annoying.<br/><br/>Now onto my main complaint, the heart rate sensor. I understand that this won't be your ultra accurate chest-strap sensor equivalent. I would be happy if it just gave me indicative rates during my workout. For resting heart rate and walking around it seems to be in good range, however if you are at the higher-end of your heart rate ranges, this seems to completely go berserk. For HIIT exercises, it would sometimes give me ridiculous heart rate that were clearly wrong (74 bpm right after a high intensity session). I googled to troubleshoot, I try to keep it tight on my wrist, and two inches above the joint. For continuous aerobic exercise, it was better apart from little blips here and there. So for those going on long runs, this is a good fit.<br/><br/>This doesn't have a GPS itself, but it can connect to a GPS of your phone to track your runs/cycling. Of course if you're doing a field sport where running around with a phone isn't an option, the GPS function is non-existent.<br/><br/>In summary, it's a reliable and sleek looking pedometer and a decent heart rate monitor if your heart rate is stable. For $130 odd, it's not a good value for me.
 I purchased this as a replacement for my 2nd Fitbit Charge that was again falling apart.  I wear my Fitbit everywhere, everyday so it gets a few knocks now and then.  The older version of the Charge would only last about six months before the rubber wrist band would begin to come unglued from the electronic face; air bubbles would start pushing the glue off from the rest of the plastic/metal components - thankfully this issue has been resolved with the Charge 2 - now the bands are replaceable and are no longer glued on.  All the same features at the original, plus a few more make this a fun little gadget to monitor my steps, sleep, etc.  The app for the iPhone syncs with the device really well and there are a lot of features to choose from.  Another bonus is that there are different accessory bands/straps you can purchase for the device.  So far, no issues with the bands and it works great.
 Ok...the verdict is in on Fitbit Charge 2... only marginally better than Fitbit One.  1.  First it counts about 30 % more steps than One...woohoo...makes hitting 5000 steps much easier. See pictures below.  2. Second it is abysmal at syncing automatically but at least has a handy Sync Now feature which works. As opposed to my One which would not even manually sync. 3.  Third it does work with the iPhone app and my IPad. 4. It is comfortable to wear..like a watch.  5. It will not show me the time without tapping on it, which is frustrating but can be dealt with.  6. It can be gotten wet...for example washing dishes.  7. Battery lasts about a week which is good. So...bottom line ...would I buy it again? All the other fitness tracker watches said they were unreliable when used with an IPad to sync.  So I guess so.  I will continue to use it but will have to member to sync once a week at least.
 I LOVE MY FITBIT CHARGE 2!!! I bought the Fossil Q Wander 2 before this and it was a big disappointment. I have only had it 3 days, but so far the battery life is great. I have worked out with it at the gym and used it with walking and strength training. It logs strength training more general way and not specific to exactly what you are actually doing. If you wear the fitbit correctly during workouts the read is pretty accurate and tells you when you are in a fat burning range. You can start and stop the time when you stop in between sets to log time spent strength training. It links to other fitness apps like myfitnesspal. I wished though that it would link with my water drinking app, where it reminds me I need to drink. Or, I wished that the fitbit app it self would see me notifications, because in the app it allows you to log water intake, but not reminders. I learned I am not sleeping enough, when I thought I was sleeping enough. I mostly spend my time at night in light sleep, so that is interesting.<br/><br/>Overall, I do love this fitbit charge 2. It is easy to you, great size for a small wrist, great style and more feminine with a rose gold. It makes me more aware in an intentional way about my daily health.
 I like everything about it except that it’s very uncomfortable to wear. Coming from misfit shine, shine 2, this is a huge update for me in terms of functionality and money matter. The band is very good at fitness tracking. Everything advertised is correct. I used it for elliptical and it tracks the heart rate correctly, giving the heartbeat almost the same as the elliptical machine. The calories, however, was a bit off. Charge 2 gives me twice calories burnt compared to the elliptical machine even though I set all the stats the same on both (weight, age). For this I’m not sure which one is wrong though.<br/><br/>I love going through the stats shown on the display and continuous heart rate tracking works superb for me. Some complain that the screen is not much of a touch screen as you can only cycle through the stats, not swiping forward/backward, but this is not a big deal to me.<br/><br/>The band looks great. At first I thought it’s a bit too bulky but looking on the mirror it looks just fine on my wrist. The only reason I return it is it feels very uncomfortable to wear to sleep. During the day, once working on the computer, you might wanna loosen it up a bit, but the design of the band makes it rather tedious to do so. I totally hate the little knot that stucks to the hole. It’s said to help secure the band but I think that’s rather unnecessary and makes it a tad more difficult to adjust the band.<br/><br/>I originally gave a 3 stars, but gotta add 1 more to credit for the fitbit app. I’m a newcomer to fitbit and find the app and its community a great motivation. I’m looking forward for some new device of Fitbit that’s easier to wear than this.
 Downgrading a star from my original review because I found that it really has problems accurately tracking power walking. I did some tests on this and found that when I'm power walking, the device typically misses 25-30% of the steps. The workaround for this is to swing the arm the FitBit is on pretty vigorously. That significantly reduces the error rate and results in a much more accurate count.<br/><br/>The reason I chose the title for this review as "ish" is that this is the way I feel about this device. It's accurate-ish. It's convenient-ish. It does what I want-ish. So my review is that it's okay-ish. Things I liked:<br/><br/>1. The app and the website are still at or near the top of the line in this field, with all sorts of options to track your progress and encourage you to keep going.<br/><br/>2. I like the addition of the hourly reminder to get up and move, something that wasn't available a couple of years ago, the last time I tried a Fitbit.<br/><br/>3. I like the fact that the bands are interchangeable, as that alleviates one of the biggest pain points of its predecessor. When the band fell apart, as it inevitably did, the prior model was basically worthless. With this model, I've already ordered some spare bands.<br/><br/>4. It gives notifications when you get a call or when you get a text message or WhatsApp message (but not both - you can either choose text or you can choose WhatsApp).<br/><br/>What I didn't like, and why this review rating is only okay-ish:<br/><br/>1. The device isn't all that accurate. Riding the bus home, for example, always adds a couple hundred paces. So does brushing my teeth (the Fitbit is on my tooth-brushing arm). Conversely, shuffling around my home in slippers results in almost no paces counted. Even out on the street, walking with arms swinging, I've seen it miscount paces.<br/><br/>2. The heart rate monitor also isn't all that accurate (and yes, I've read the website and I've followed their instructions exactly). It's even worse when I need it most, when I'm in a cardio session and my arms are sweaty. The sweat makes my arms slippery, which means that the tracker will also slip (unless I tighten it so tight as to leave gouges in my arm) and the sweat seems to interfere with its mechanism for monitoring heart rate. If you need precision in heart-rate monitoring, you need a device with a chest strap or some other solution.<br/><br/>3. The website keeps pushing you to exceed your prior totals. Up to a certain point, that's fine, but beyond that point, that is really not the right thing to do and could result in injury.<br/><br/>4. The calorie counter is a joke, of course. The Fitbit doesn't have accurate enough data to be even close to an approximation on calories. For example, a typical 6-foot man weighing 220 pounds might be very fit (cardio and bodybuilding on a regular basis), fit-fat, or just fat. The calorie consumption for each of these scenarios can differ pretty dramatically.<br/><br/>5. The stair-climbing algorithm is really poor. I live on a hill and I can either climb 120 steps to get to the top or I can take a winding path. Taking the path gives me credit for 24 flights of stairs. Taking the steps gives me credit for 6 to 8.<br/><br/>6. The notifications vibrations are pretty easy to miss and I really wish that they didn't have the limitation of only listening to text or only listening to WhatsApp. I use both pretty widely and it's frustrating to only get notifications for one of them.<br/><br/>Overall, the device is okay. I really want more accuracy on all of its metrics but, at least in the Fitbit world, I think this is the best I can do.
 I have a love/hate relationship with my new Fitbit Charge 2.  I like that it tracks my heart rate, calories burned, etc.  I like that I can use the app to enter the foods that I eat, and water that I drink.  I had a hard time getting the Fitbit to fit flat against my wrist and stay in place.  The band was too loose or too tight.  I ordered a stainless steel band with a magnetic closure and that solved that problem; plus it looks much nicer.  The MAJOR problem I had with it is the fact that tennis is often the activity which I am most involved in about 4 times per week.  The Fitbit does NOT track your steps properly at all when playing tennis.  I would wear my Fitbit and my good pedometer simultaneously, and the Fitbit would never register more than half of the steps I took.  I got online and found that other tennis players all had the same complaint.  So today I tried something new.  I took the band off and placed the Fitbit against the skin of my breast inside a tight sports bra, keeping the contacts on the Fitbit against my skin.  Voila.....kept perfect track of my steps.  But let's face it, this is a real hassle.
 I've had this product for less than a year and the screen has already cracked. I didn't drop the product or bump it on anything. It broke while I was riding in a car. I would consider this a manufacturer defect based on the screen splitting on it's own with no stress placed on it. I contacted the company and  was told the best they can do is a 25% coupon code. Their website is offering $50 off, but the offers cant be combined and their online discount is better than what customer service offered. Lastly, the congratulated me for all of my fitness accomplishments in the past year. How sweet.... let me exercise one more time by rolling my eyes. I'd rather buy a fitness tracker from walmart, at least you can return broken stuff there.
 Was my first fitbit and I'm loving it.  A few minor issues but overall I'm happy with my purchase.  One of the biggest drawbacks is that the wrist band that comes with it, eventually breaks, generally around 6 months.  Tip: If yours breaks within the warranty (I believe 1 year) just email Fitbit's customer service for a replacement if it broke from normal wear and tear.  They will ask you to provide a picture proving it was broken (which only takes a few minutes if you have a smart phone to snap a pic and attach to email).  The replacement lasted 5-6 months like the first one.  Since then I bought a magnetic one for $10-$15 at Walmart and it has held up better than the vinyl ones Fitbit provides.  Also, at times the fitbit doesn't sync up my steps live when I'm in a wooded area (i.e., nature walk or hikes) as it normally would in a residential zone. For these few issues I gave the final rating 4 stars, instead of 5.  But the main electronic piece is nice and durable and somewhat scratch resistant after I've banged it up several times during vigorous exercise.  I will definitely buy from Fitbit again.
 First of all, I love Fitbit customer service. They truly stand behind their products and are quick to offer solutions when a problem arises. However, I’ve had four fitbits in the past 2.5 years (2 purchased and 2 replacements) and they really just are not durable at all. I finally got to the point after the 4th one stopped working that I decided not to even call about it and definitely to not purchase another one. I had an Alta it stopped working so they sent me a replacement. That too stopped working so I decided to just go for this cheaper model. It stopped working within 2 months. They sent yet another replacement and that one just gave out after 8 months. I swear I don’t do anything out of the ordinary with the devices, I don’t eve let them get wet.
 So I have had my fitbit for seven months now. I bought it in NOV 2016. I was on the couch, when I heard a little snap. I couldn't figure it out till I looked at my fitbit. The screen literally cracked from nothing. I called them since it was under a year warranty. They said it is considered accidental damage and they could give me basically ten dollars off a brand new one. Googled around and this is a very common problem. So if you do want this I suggest you buy it from fitbit and get the accidental warranty as well.... It could save you a hundred dollars in half a year.
 I returned this because I have a Windows 8.1 laptop and a Kindle Fire tablet and the Fitbit Charge 2 doesn't work those two platforms.  In the setup directions it said to download Windows 10 and then proceed with the setup. The return process with Amazon was great, however.  Printed out the return label and repacked the Fitbit and took it to UPS.  Amazon notified when they received it and they credited my account.<br/><br/>I think that Fitbit should specify in their descriptions what operating systems that they work with.  As a senior citizen and not technology literate it was frustrating to hunt around their website trying to find out why I was not able to set this up.  I was looking forward to tracking my fitness progress and ended up being disappointed.
 After 14 month's the screen frozen. I contacted fitbit service that tried to reset it but with no success so they offered a 25% discount for a new item. I asked the representative if suppose to last only 14 month's and his answer wad that its built to last longer but sometimes its not. Well I bought it because fitbit supposedly credibility otherwise i would spend less money for some Chinese devise. After checking the web The frozen screen its a known problem and if it would happened to me in the 12 months warranty period fitbit would replace me the device. The frozen screen its not a problem i could have prevent it didnt happen because of something i did. Bad luck and horrible fitbit servise put me in a position of buying a devise with life expectancy of 14 months. By the way the devise was great as long as it worked. .
 This was my first fitbit and I love it.  It tracks your sleep patterns, step count, and heart rate.  When I go on my runs it will map out the path I have taken and give me a break down of how each mile was with an overall of the run.  If you are inclined you can use the app and track your food, and water intake as well as your weight.  I do have the Rhenpo smart scale that will sync with the fitbit app and there are no issues with the two apps communicating with each other.  I usually take a walk in the afternoon and even though I don't designate that I am going on a walk the watch will notice that I am and log it as an activity.  There are achievements for hitting certain milestones like steps taken, total miles, total stairs and so on.  Then there are challenges in the app you can take with friends and some can be done solo.  The app is easy to set up and the user interface is intuitive.  I would recommend the watch to anyone wanting a better idea of what their activity level is.
 I’m so disappointed in this Fitbit :disappointed: I was really looking forward to using it. To begin with, it’s bulky. I got the small size and it was still bulky. I wanted to use it to track my HR during exercise. I currently use my Polar chest strap and wrist monitor. Well, I took both to my workout to compare accuracy. The HR was soooo inaccurate on the Fitbit! Anywhere from 3 bpm to 20+ bpm points off! That is unacceptable IMO.  I read the consumer report that said there was a 6 point difference in accuracy for women and to wear it on the forearm. I did that and it still was inaccurate. Furthermore, once my HR reached 150+ bpm the Fitbit could no longer detect it. Unbelievable! Needless to say, I’m returning it.
 Update: After 2 months of use, the text/call notifications and all-day sync have stopped working with my iPhone 6.  Contacted customer service and they are replacing since still under warranty.<br/><br/>I ordered the Charge 2 to replace my One that was several years old.  The primary selling points for choosing the Charge 2 were the heart-rate monitor, having a wearable on my wrist instead of needing to remember to move it if I changed clothes, and the ability to sync with my phone for text &amp; caller ID.  Here are my thoughts after a month and a half of using:<br/>Pros:<br/>The caller ID &amp; text features work great with my iPhone 6.<br/>I haven't washed it or forgotten it which was a recurring problem with my One.<br/>The sleep tracking is very sensitive and seems to give a good read out on how well you rested.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>The battery life is MUCH shorter than my One, so I have to remember to pack the charger when traveling on weekend trips.<br/>The heart-rate monitor is questionably precise. (I haven't compared with another device, but it feels off)<br/>The step count is not very precise. (I have found it has not picked up steps on several occasions and the distance is quite a bit off when using for running as compared to other apps and mapping.)<br/>While the rose gold/lavender is pretty, it gets really dirty looking really quickly.  Being the light color, it seems to be stained up from everyday wear despite cleaning attempts.<br/>The heart-rate monitor sensor protrudes from the back quite a bit.  This made my wrist sore for about a week at the beginning.  It doesn't bother me now, but it took getting accustomed to.<br/><br/>Overall, I would purchase again, but would choose a darker band color and not pay the extra for the special edition rose gold.  I do hope the next version has better accuracy.  I am not concerned with super precision, so it works fine for me, but my One seemed much better at tracking.
 I love my fitbit HR. I had been looking for something to get my more active and the step counter has really upped my steps each day. It's fun to watch your heart rate in real time (I watched a suspenseful movie the other day and thought it was funny that I could see how elevated my heart rate was during it). The options to record runs/workouts is an awesome feature that definitely saves me from having to use apps on my phone because I can start recording with the touch of a button on my fitbit. I was initially worried the size was going to bother me (I was trying to decide between the Alta and the HR), but I go used to it very quickly. My only issue is that after 2 months the battery started dying daily and it's supposed to last 4-5 days. Luckily it happened within my warranty so customer service for fitbit was able to send me a replacement within a couple days and that one is working normally again.
 The neutral (meet minimum expectations or items that I don’t care about):<br/>-Step count: Fairly accurate<br/>-Resting heart rate: Good to know. Readings tends to be slightly low when compared to an Orman Blood Pressure Cuff (calibrated at my doctor’s office).<br/>-Sharing: For those who can’t do anything without telling everyone your business, there are many options (I have them mostly turned off)<br/>-Calories burned: Interesting<br/>-64oz to drink (water intake) and Food Plan: Way too “user input intensive” for me. I really cannot imagine myself counting, let alone running to the app to enter each glass of water I drank.<br/>-Weight: Paying attention/tracking one’s weight is always part of any fitness plans.<br/>-Badges &amp; Trophies: Meaningless. Already knowing I did 10k of steps is all that is needed.<br/>-Plastic wrist band: An odd, plastic material. Good for not coming loose, but, can be frustrating to slide in/out of the retainer strap because the material tends to stick to itself.<br/>-Battery life: Mediocre, yet, as advertised. My experience has been that I need to charge the unit every five days.<br/><br/>The good:<br/>-Reminders to Move, my favorite function! It is so easy to be focused on whatever it is that you’re doing and forget to move your butt.<br/>-Number of steps: Challenges you with a “goal to match or beat” daily.<br/>-How did you sleep tracker: I’m not sure how useful or practical this is but I find it quite interesting, and I’m still deciding how to take advantage of this information.<br/>-Settings: There are numerous options that can be turned on/off, options, or levels set. I don’t use most of the Notifications but I appreciate the options to control them.<br/>-Ability to view your progress on either your smart phone or your computer.<br/><br/>The not so good:<br/>-Expensive for what it is/does<br/>-Very, very, hard to see in bright sunlight<br/>-For me, the “turn your wrist” to activate only works about 60% of the time<br/>-Step count:  Can give a false feeling of “healthiness”. I know of a couple of individuals with Fitbits who wear them religiously and focus on the number of overall steps and beating daily goals, which they often do (and are quite proud of their step numbers). The problem is that is that they rely on this number for a snapshot of their overall fitness. They do not perform other exercises, track calories or carbs, or track their weight. They are both very overweight.<br/>-No ability to detect *stair machine use<br/> -No ability to detect or track *push-ups or sit-ups<br/>*There is a capability to create a custom “Activity”, which, after you create it, will show up as a manually selected option on your unit. These “Activities” are based on TIME/DURATION/DISTANCE, which would be fine for the stair machine (time only, you have to manually select it), but, has no practical value for exercises based on repetitions performed (you could do 1 or 10 push-ups in one minute).<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/>I purchased the Fitbit on a recommendation from a family member, that absolutely loves theirs. After living with mine for a few weeks I’ve decided that having a fitness tracker is a good thing. Without any experience with other products I’m not sure that the Fitbit is the best option, but, overall, I’m glad I made the purchase.<br/><br/>How I see it: 5 Stars = Product/Service went well above my expectations, 4 Stars = Product/Service exceeded my expectations, 3 Stars = Product/Service met my expectations, 2 Stars = Product/Service fell short of my expectations, 1 Star = Product/Service sucked.
 I love this lil' guy. It charges quickly, keeps track of things - and if you're like me and want to count steps on a stationary bike, I just fit him into my shoelaces and ta-da! Perfect. I don't use it for much tracking on the app (which is a great, app, by the way - very easy to use) but more for the steps throughout the day. When I see I've only done 500 by 12 p.m., then a bit of me feels guilty.<br/><br/>My only regret is that I programmed my name as "EMMA" instead of "Emma", however, I've come to love how it screams, "Good morning EMMA" at me when I pick it up. Very enthusiastic.
 This is a really good item that will help you move more, (you have to do the eat less part) to help you become fit. I have had this fitbit for 5 to 6 days now and I love it. It's simple functions of counting steps, heart rate, run tracking, stopwatch, and relax modes are wonderful... But use it with the fitbit app and you can also track(along with the above things) things like food, your water intake, and your sleep!!!<br/>I know it's counting of the steps is off slightly, but it is not off by more than 8-10% typically. One time I counted 500 steps, however, my fitbit said 541, another time I counted a 1000, and the fitbit said 1069, and the last time I checked the count, I did 100 steps, and the fitbit said 104. So be aware it will be close but not 100% accurate.<br/>I did find the heart rate to be very reliable. Oh the relax function is wonderful and it works. The other functions of Run  and Stopwatch do work well.
 I purchased a Charge 2 just after Thanksgiving. I already have a Zip but purchased the Charge 2 primarily for cardio data. I noticed that the Charge 2 was consistently reading 1500 - 2500 steps higher than the zip. I did a controlled test wearing 3 Fitbits: my Zip, an Alta and the Charge 2 - two people walking together, both counting actual steps. The Zip was the most accurate, followed closely by the Alta - both read only slightly low. The new Charge 2 read significantly over so that over the course of a day, the wearer would think they had walked 10,000 steps when in actuality, the wearer would only have walked 8130 steps. I attempted to resolve this by varying the tightness of the wristband but it over recorded steps regardless. It makes me question the accuracy of the other numbers. I attempted to establish a Fitbit chat session but gave up after an extended wait. I’m no longer wearing the Charge 2 on a daily basis.
 I was looking for something that would gauge my hiking steps and this fits the bill. It seems to accurately measure elevation, heartbeat, etc. However, for me there are a few issues that I really don't like about it and I would go back to Garmin, if they sold something comparable.<br/>CONS:<br/>1. The rubber strap is too wide and becomes uncomfortable to wear after awhile.<br/>2. The rubber strap is textured and collects dirt and gook on it. I find I have to wash it more frequently than my Garmin strap.<br/>3. The fact that I have to take it off to recharge it is really, really annoying to me, and would be reason enough for me, personally, to go with another tracker. Garmin has a battery that easily lasted almost a year, which was WAY more convenient than having to take the darn thing on and off to recharge it all the time.<br/>4. I can't read the data on the FitBit screen in the outdoor sunlight, which then makes it useless to me if I can't check out what I'm doing.<br/>5. The lights on the FitBit go on and off when I wear it to sleep. It actually wakes me up so I don't measure my sleep anymore.
 Cons:<br/>1. Tracks my arm movements as steps.... I just write it off to the fact that I am active, even though it REALLY tweaks my step count into way more than it really is.<br/>2. Get a kick out of the fact that I remove my Fitbit, lay it on the table, and it happily beats the little heart, telling me a heart rate - without even being on my arm LOL<br/>3. Resting heart rate is not the same as Lowest heart rate.<br/>Pros:<br/>1. I bought this so I can track my sleep better than with my iPhone app. I'm happy with this because I have never slept well (4-6 hours/night) and am often drained. This Fitbit helps me track whether life changes (exercise, nutrition, etc.) are affecting my sleep and whether I should change.<br/>2. Charges quickly<br/>IDEAS:<br/>1. would be nice to hear a tone when fully charged so I remember to put it back on before I go to sleep.<br/>2. ADD "LHR" Lowest Heart Rate to the BPM/Resting Heart Rate viewing window. Useful for those working to intentionally lower their heartrate through de-stressing or breathing techniques.<br/>Not really accurate, but I love the sleep features and fe
 This was a Chanukah present from my husband, but I picked it out! I had been hesitating to get a device, as I wasn't sure how much I would want to keep track of all the things that the original Fitbit did. However, the Charge 2, with the text, calendar and phone notifications, put me over the edge. It is great knowing how much I am moving, I like the reminders to move, and I love the ability to get a silent notification (vibration) and be able to glance at my wrist to see a text or calendar reminder, especially since my phone is often not in my pocket, but someplace on a table nearby. I like the silent alarm feature, which I can use to wake up without bothering my husband. The Fitbit app is pretty good, although I am not sure I understand why it has to be connected to the internet just to log food items. I did have to turn off the auto-sync, as it seems like that was causing me to use a lot (110MB in a couple of days) of data from my cell plan. The app still automatically syncs when I open it, or I can force a sync, and so far that does not seem to be a problem in terms of data usage.<br/><br/>The only thing I wish it had was a way to more accurately track my exercise on a ski machine, which is my main exercise. It seems the closest "category" of exercise is "elliptical", but if I select elliptical, it grossly underestimates the distance (Nordic track says 6 miles, at 8'20' pace,  Fibit app says 1.82 miles at 23'30" pace with 4600 steps). If I let it select the exercise through autosense, ti just shows time and calories, no distance. I do move my arms the entire time, so that is not the problem!
 I really liked the Charge 2 despite bands only lasting 7 months or less. I didn't mind because there are some nice leather and metal replacement bands on Amazon. When you are buying new bands several times per year it is more expense than I was expecting. My fitbit stopped working last week after getting wet. It was not soaked but there was condensation in the screen. It is supposed to be splash resistant. I put the fitbit in a bowl of rice for week but it still didn't work. The fitbit provided good data and I liked the app especially the heart rate and sleep data. Unfortunately, it is too expensive to last less than 2 years of use. There are too many complaints on the fitbit forums across all models. I will not replace this fitbit.
 My fiancé was very happy with his new fitbit! He was upgrading from a very old fitbit, so he was excited about the HR feature and being able to replace the band. I'm trying out an off brand at the same time, so we can compare.  While fitness tracking options are similar, the fitbit offers more detailed sleep analysis (although I'm not sure how it could possible analyze R.E.M. sleep), and seems to have a wider variety of bands available. My cheaper $30 Wesoo brand tracker has a remote camera button and some notifications (like Facebook messenger) that his fitbit does not.  Mine also has a lost phone feature that he said his Fitbit does not.  His charger is a clip that goes around the device, while I have to remove my band and plug into a USB port to charge.  All in all, fitbit is nice, but I'm preferring my cheaper version. If you want more band options, get the Fitbit. If you only want to count steps or get notifications from SMS, calls, and social media, get the Wesoo and save the money.
 I have had the original version for 4 years and it finally broke. It was awesome. Everything seemed logical so I decided to go with the updated version where, after two weeks NOTHING seems logical not distance nor heart rate. I was crushed to see that my resting heart rate was ‘really’ 10 BPM higher. I just figured newer technology was better, more accurate and that I had some heart health to take care of. Then one day I noticed my treadmill distance was off by 3/4 of a mile. With my older Fitbit this was never the case. It tracked within a 1/16th. My active minutes were OFF THE CHART too. I had minutes I did not earn. On occasion that would happen with my old Fitbit but I was always able to pinpoint SOME activity that may have caused it. With this new Charge 2 i earn points putting on my makeup in the morning. I got concerned because I thought that my hesrt rate was way too high. I began checking it the old fashioned way and was very happy to see it lower. Much lower but consistently at least 10-15 beets lower. I use my Fitbit mostly to gauge my cardio health and my distance and both weren’t correct. I’m so very sad to say that I’m returning it. I hope that this is a problem with the newer Charge and not across the board. I LOVE AND NEED MY FITBIT ❤️
 I liked the Fitbit until it decided it wasn’t going to reset my steps for several days in a row. Went through their community help boards and figured out how to make it work. Worked for a few days and then it decided to stop counting my steps. Did the reset process for that; deleted the app, set Fitbit up as new, etc per what they suggest. Step counter works when it wants. I have returned the Fitbit. All the issues I’ve had seem very common. It’s unfortunate that they can’t get the bugs worked out as I did like it, but I paid for it to work as advertised, and it most certainly does not do that.
 This is my first tracker.  Kind of bulky on my arm, but I have gotten used to it. It does catch on things sometimes when I am working in my barn doing chores.  I worry that I will break the screen, but so far have not.  I don't like the placement of the time on the very top edge, because I have to rotate my arm a lot in order to see the time.  Also, I don't like that the screen turns off.  It doesn't always turn on when I flip my wrist (or don't flip it exactly the "right" way), so it often is a 2 handed process to see the time of day.  Seems to often have trouble syncing with my Samsung Galaxy 7 phone.  I usually have to do it at least a couple of times...
 I originally purchased my Fitbit from Amazon .My Charge 2 did not last even a year.<br/><br/>It was never abused, only that I wore it all the time (never in the shower). I kept it clean. I really took good care of it.<br/><br/>Anyway, I contacted Fitbit directly, and they were kind enough to send me a replacement for the same model, free of charge.<br/><br/>But since I have received it, 3 weeks ago, I have not been able to activate it - either on my iPadPro app on on the Windows 10 app.<br/><br/>I have reached out to customer support and was told this was a known bug in the App and other Charge 2 replacement customers were facing the same issue. I keep calling the company and the only response I get is that they don't know when this issue will be resolved.<br/><br/>Great answer! I can Charge 2's are on your priority list.<br/><br/>So Fitbit please let me know, how long this bug take to fix and what am I supposed to do with a useless replacement watch now?
 I'm disappointed with this product. Pulled the product out and went through the set-up process. When I linked it via bluetooth via my phone, as per the instructions, it said to update the device, which I agreed to do. Then, the Fitbit spontaneously shut itself down and would not respond no matter how many times I clicked on it. Maybe it ran out of battery? Plugged it into my laptop for 2 hours - nothing. Plugged it into an UL-certified wall plug - nothing. So I called Fitbit the next day. Spend 2.5 hours with them (once again doing everything I had already tried to do to the Charge 2 to make it work) on the phone. Thankfully, they agreed to send me a new one in the mail - after 1 more hour on the phone - but with a 2-3 week wait time. Also, because I'm only getting the tracker/electronic part - they told me to save the elastic bands, which were stuck to the device and would not come off via the given instructions (as shown on their website). I got them off with extra force and now one of the straps doesn't click on correctly and will pop off the tracker spontaneously. Yeah, I'm less than thrilled. The way I see it, this product is worthy of a 1 star review if it can't even function for 10 minutes, or Fitbit is fleecing me out of my money. Thanks for either being crooks or creating a subpar product Fitbit. If this new Charge 2 doesn't work, I want my money back - not another one of your faulty electronics or 50% off another one of your products.
 As a physician, I rely on accurate information.  While I realize these devices are far from perfect in the heart rate monitoring department, I expect that they would at least trend in the right direction.  The Fitbit works really well at times, but there are times when I think I would be better off not having any information at all.  A few examples:  when spinning, during a standing climb at high effort, the heart rate can fall 20-40 beats per minute (sometimes it loses the HR altogether) with no change in effort. Repositioning rarely helps and I need to wait for 2-5 minutes for the device to ‘wake up’ and find my heart rate again.  When hiking, the Fitbit predictably loses my heart rate when I am walking up a steep hill and recovers when I reach a flat area. This has gotten worse over time.  Finally, when seated quietly, the HR can read over 100bpm when it is actually below 60.  I will be considering a different fitness tracker in the future.
 Product is excellent; easy to assemble and use.<br/>For Android (Samsung) devices, the available app is nearly useless.  Major syncronization issues which are given "lip service" by Fitbit technical support.  Until the Android app is workable, I would rate Fitbit as a "4-star" for iPhone, "1-star" for Androids.
 Bought this as primarily a heart rate monitor.  It is quite good for this.  Including real time-ish tracking during exercise.  As a step counter it is poor though.  The Fitbit one is better in every way.  I also have one of these and it is always right on.  Interestingly though the app itself seems to know this and usually the Fitbit 1 steps override the wrist monitor.  But not always.  They seem to know when one is being worn/used and not the other and sync accordingly.  For example, biking registers on the Fitbit one (in pocket device).  The Charge 2 has some cool and sometimes scary features (recognizes type of exercise including walking, elliptical and biking) and can view texts on it.  The sleep monitoring is quite the black box.  Hard to tell but it's not really all that accurate, it misses bedtimes by hours sometimes.  So take those numbers with a grain of salt for sure.  I would say buy this device if you are looking for an easy to use wrist based heart rate monitor.  It's not much more than that.  But that's still pretty good.  Get the Fitbit one (if you still can) for step monitoring.
 I absolutely love my fitbit charge 2. I shopped around and red lots of reviews before I decided. I have had it about a month now and the battery has lasted about 4-5 days if I don't have it constantly connect to my phone. My phone and fitbit battery were dying quickly so i just turned off notifications and i don't sync it until i'm home on my wifi, then i turn the Bluetooth and GPS off until i need to sync again. Other than that, i think i need to get the screen protector so i don't bang it up, i'm clumsy with my arms. Works well with my Samsung S7 and my Kindle Fire HD (3rd Generation). I even used it to monitor my heart rate so that I could drop it low enough to donate for the Blood Bank.  My favorite feature is the sleep tracking.
 After I got one, I bought this for my mom to help her exercise more daily and track her steps, stairs, metabolism and sleep. It also tracks her heart rate so she knows when she's in a fat-burning or cardio zone for her age. I have one in black and we both love that the app keeps track of all stats and trends. We challenge each otber to increase steps. We also have a step/distance challenge at work. I also love the vibrating alarm on this model that I set up to 6 alerts to wake me and discretely remind me of events throughout the day. The vibrating alarm is great for people with hearing loss (like me) that may not hear an alarm or don't want to awaken others. I used to have a knock off fitness band, but it wasn't accurate and the app didn't sync well, so I upgraded to this one. I love the buckle and the laching band to keep it in place. You can also switch bands for any color or material, which are reasonably priced. I also love how it tracks my sleep so I see when I wake during the night and can improve my sleep quality. It is not nearly as accurate as an overnight clinical sleep study and should never replace one, but it offers general sleep trends according to your heart rate.
 After wearing it for few months 24/7 I developed severe pain in my wrist, (When tendons become irritated or inflamed, the condition is called tendinitis. Tendinitis causes acute pain and tenderness, making it difficult to move the affected joint.). I stopped wearing it just to give my wrist a rest still unaware that FitBit was the actual cause . After almost two months not wearing it my wrist got well again. I put Fit Bit back on my left wrist and on a third day of wearing it the pain came back and I felt slight tingling in my fingers. Went on line and found out that many users of this product developed same pain. I contacted FitBit and they offered very quickly full refund including shipping and all taxes pretending like they ware not aware of this issue. I am self-employed and my work is manual so I need two hand to do my job. I have lost month and half of income that FitBit does not take into the account.
 First let me say I have LOVED my Fitbit Charge 2.  I bought it December of2016 and it has been my daily companion.  BUT...I've worn it on my left arm every since I got it, which has been almost a year now.  A few weeks ago, I started having pain in my left arm.  It hurt to pick up things and the area above my elbow was sore to the touch.  I could not figure out the cause.  I hadn't hit it and I rarely sleep on my left side.  I finally researched Fitbit and pain and unfortunately found a LOT of comments on the Community blog where people were experiencing similar pain issues, but with no feedback from FitBit. I put the Charge 2 on my right arm and the extreme pain has subsided on my left arm although it's still sore to the touch. Other people said their pain started within days or weeks.  Mine took almost a year.  I've tried to find a comparable activity/sleep tracker, but so far no luck.  I'll keep it on my right arm for now, hoping it does not cause irreparable damage while I keep trying to find a reliable activity/sleep tracker to replace it.  I would feel better if Fitbit would at least respond as to what might be causing this. :(
 Overall I am happy with this watch but I do have a few issues..<br/>Pros:<br/>- Battery life is pretty solid<br/>-pretty durable .. I wear it all the time with the exception of showers<br/>-great sleep tracker<br/>-Love the silent alarm feature<br/>Cons:<br/>-sometimes it blinds me in the middle of the night when I move my arm. Its super bright and annoying because half the time during the day when I go to look at it, I have to click the button for the screen to show., but will work 100% of the time at night when I move my arm.... not cool.<br/><br/>-Somehow my notification setting gets turned off on it a lot. Which really stinks because that was 75% of the reason for me getting it. I was tired of missing calls and text.<br/><br/>- The color of the band does get very dirty and fade fast so I would suggest getting the dark color band. I got the purple one and it does help hide some of the ware.
 I like it, but it has issues. First the good. It fits well and is comfortable. I forget I have it on. I love the app and look at it way more than I look at the watch. It seems to do a good job of recording steps and heart rate for normal daily activity. I also like the fact that I can log my water as it is something I track. Now the not so good. First, the display rarely lights up like it is supposed to when I turn my wrist to look at it. Some times I flick my wrist several times and then just give up and press the button. For some reason it does manage to turn on when I roll over in bed at night and shocks me because the light is right in front of my face. Second, the heart rate only seems to work when my skin is dry. Once I get going on a serious cardio workout, the heart rate either reads really low or quits altogether. There is a lot written about this online. Fitbit's only response is to wear it higher on the wrist. I've tried every position possible with no result. I wear a polar strap so I know my actual heart rate when I'm working out. The fitbit is clueless. Why wear a fitness tracker if it fails when you are doing a hard core fitness activity? Finally, it doesn't know what to make of activities like skiing or cycling. It gives you credit for some steps but I think it is pretty meaningless. As long as the heart rate is working, your calories burned should be ok, I assume. The concept of this device is great and the app is nice, but it isn't quite ready for prime time in my view.
 I replaced my Fitbit HR with this one.  I vacillated between FitBit and Apple Watch (we're an Apple-everything family...iphones, ipads, imacs), but in the end, I just wanted a smaller watch.  I'm happy with this Fitbit now, but I upgraded primarily to track my walking routes (4-6+ miles).  I was disappointed when the iphone kept running out of juice before the end of my walks. Not only did it not track my whole walk, but I always listen to audiobooks and, of course, that would quit also.  I'm not sure if this is a problem with Fitbit or Apple, but I fixed the problem by purchasing a portable charger and a short connector cable.  Now everything works without my iphone 6 running out of power.  My husband follows me using the Find Friend app, and was was concerned when the iphone would die and he couldn't track me (I'm 69).  I also use the Fitbit occasionally on our treadmill. The treadmill steps/miles never match up with the Fitbit. I while back, I started holding the treadmill arm with one hand and lighting hitting my stomach/leg with each step.  By counting/comparing steps with my tracker I found this hitting leg on left step and stomach on right step is the most  accurate for me.
 THE GOOD:  Nice display.  The text and phone call alerts are helpful.  The clock and vibrating alarm may be its best feature.<br/>THE BAD:  I've compared the HR monitor to my chest strap, which i think is pretty accurate and the Fitbit is always 10-30% low depending on how hard I'm working.  This means the net calories are going to be off.  It's not water proof or very rugged so you cant wear it in the shower much less at the beach, pool, etc.  My band began to delaminate pretty quickly where it meets the display.  I've glued it back down but it's not like new.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION:  If you're just getting into fitness or are mainly interested in step counts, reminders to move, etc. or if you're in the market for a watch linked to your phone for messages, alerts, etc. then this may be for you.  If your more serious about HR zone training, calorie counting or plan on getting wet you should probably look elswhere.
 Bought this and a fitbit alta at the same time. For whatever reason the screen on this scratched so bad we could not use it, all within two weeks of normal everyday use. I had a fibit charge for 4 years with no scratches, and have had no problems with my alta. I tacked to fitbit and their solutions was to send me a coupon for 25% off a new product, not help me fix or replace it. I will not be purchasing from fitbit again as they do not care about customers.
 I have owned almost every Fitbit out there. I always end up returning them because they just seem to be missing something, or in the case of the Blaze it didn't work properly. I was really skeptical of this one, but I've had it now for a couple of months and it's everything I needed it to be. The biggest features for me are the silent alarm, display with clock, and exercise tracking (in that order). The Blaze has all of those things but also a lot of bugs. The Charge 2 does basically everything the Blaze does, only better, and cheaper. The GPS tracking is pretty accurate, but can be a little off at times. Calibrating only does so much, especially since it depends on the device it's paired to. The battery life is not bad. The silent alarms work great. I opted for an aftermarket band from Amazon to replace the standard once which I found uncomfortable and a little ugly. My ONLY complaint is that the display is difficult or impossible to see in strong sunlight. Otherwise, I'm very pleased.
 I have had several Fitbit products (Zip, Charge, Charge HR), and the Charge 2 has been my favorite so far. I am a regular runner, and the Charge 2 provides me all of the metrics I would want. Additionally, this device is much more stylish than previous models. I really appreciate that I can swap out the wristband in the future, as well! Perfect for casual runners and those interested in tracking health metrics!<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>- Great functionality. I love seeing so much data on my wrist without having to take out my phone to check out the Fitbit app.<br/>- Stylish design.<br/>- Not bulky, given the functionality.<br/>- Improved accuracy. Distance and step accuracy are much better than the previous Charge designs. Not perfect, but improved.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>- MSRP is a little high. I got mine on sale for ~ $110. I think this is a reasonable price point for this device.
 I have owned this watch for almost 3 months now and have had no issues. I usually buy cheap, waterproof watches because I am in the habit of never taking my watch off. My watch and my wedding ring stay on 24/7. So I made the mistake many times already of taking my watch into the shower with me. It has been pounded by shower water all too frequently and has yet to show any deleterious affects. I particularly love the notifications. I frequently leave my phone in another part of the house exactly when my wife tries to reach me! For the fitness side, I am steadily increasing my step levels and I really like the small and simple prompts the watch gives me throughout the day in order to reach my daily goal. I am very pleased with the purchase and recommend this watch to all my friends.
 I purchased this just over a year ago. This is my second iteration after owning the Charge HR for year before that. Here's what I think<br/>- Lots of potential if you want a holistic view of your body and health in one place<br/>- Most measures seem to be relatively accurate if compared to others. For example, steps and distance measures when compared to what my iPhone would capture (through other apps like Runtastic etc) are pretty much in line with what the fitbit would capture<br/>- The app is actually well designed and very intuitive with plethora of interesting information that I never knew about. Helps and motivates getting better at it<br/>- I don't really use the food log as I have other better apps for that<br/>- The only finicky thing about it is the auto-detect of activity. Its a bit hit or miss. Running and biking is easily identified and captured data for but other activities are not so accurate. In larger scheme of things thats not that big a deal<br/><br/>Here's the worst part about this and the company<br/>- This is a gadget and you may not be lucky enough to see its limitations or flaws within its warranty period (limited, one year). This happened to me, about 3 months beyond my warranty window, the battery simply stopped keeping its charge (ironic as its the fricking name) and discharding immediately. I contacted support, they acknowledged that the battery seems to be defective but other than offering a measly 25% discount on a new purchase (so basically shell out an additional $100, potentially every year) they wouldnt really help me. To me thats a no-no. They need to have the ability to do something more than that. I've collected decent data on my body over the past two years and I'd like to continue to do so. In switching to a different device, you lose the investment in building that data and history and have to do that all over. Maybe its not that bad but to me this was a big disappointment.<br/><br/>Luckily I did speak to a supervisor who agreed to replace my unit for free (that will NOT come with a warranty and you will not be able to purchase a protection plan on top of that either). I have to just hope the new one manages to outlast the previous one.
 Was excited to receive this fitbit and began using it immediately. Noticed that I sure was walking a lot of steps. Wonderful! And then I decided to check it. I counted my steps myself and upon checking the device,saw that it tallied 300 steps to my own 100 count. Whoa! Tried this several times<br/>and found it to be way off. Called Amazon who said to call Fitbit support. They said it was defective and would send a replacement, to "throw" this one away! Well, they sent just a part of it. Good thing I did not throw original away. Well the part would not work. So, they said I had to return it before they could send a replacement. Still waiting as they use snail mail, no express! This has been going on for almost a month now. Called Amazon and am returning for a refund as Amazon said they could not recommend exchange because another unit might not be better.<br/>Has anyone else experienced this problem with the fitbit charge 2?
 Item was received one day early. Poor packaging and the original Fitbit Charge 2 in factory sealed box. The package contained an USB charger (without a power adapter) for the Fitbit unit which obviously has to be plugged into a computer.  However the package does not have the "Wireless Sync Dongle" unit with the Charge 2. Without the Dongle it is not possible to syn the Charge 2 to a desk top or lap top computer.<br/><br/>I called customer service and asked them about the "Dongle".  I was told it was not included with the Charge 2 package.  The Charge 2 can be synced to a cell phone using blue tooth. What is the purpose of sending a USB charger that has to be plugged into an USB port.  After I mentioned how ridiculous this sounded she agreed to send me a Wireless Sync Dongle.<br/>For others like myself who prefer to use a computer with a large monitor screen versus a cell phone screen the Charge 2,  is definitely not the product to purchase. I personally feel this is a effort to cut costs by not providing all the parts and pieces.<br/> My rating of 3 stars is fair. Fitbit has been around for years with millions of users and they do not provide all the accessories to make this a friendly product right out of the box. Disappointing !!
 I tried to love this product but couldn't.  I have several fitbits and this one I just could not tolerate after a week.  I would be at the gym working out and the Fitbit would only calculate 2,000 steps after 2.5 hours at the gym, one hour being cardio.  I even tried to set as run, it would start on that function and end up off again not calculating my steps.  I like  the HR Charge 2 as its better than some of the other Fitbits.  The one I have the screen cracked.  However,  I'm just going to get another, but go through the store.  Third party devices are sometimes different than the store.
 This is my 3rd or 4th FitBit and first off, not one of them have lasted a year without some kind of issue.  Comparatively speaking though, the only issue I've had with this model is with the band.  It didn't last 6 months.  Luckily, you can easily find cheap replacements online, but I shouldn't have to at this price.  The Fitbit itself is great and the battery will last 4-5 solid days before I need to recharge which means I can get good day to day trend data.  I charge it during the 15-20 minutes I'm brushing my teeth / taking a shower and I'm good to go.  I never have to charge it longer than that.  The heart rate monitor and flights of stairs counters are pretty accurate, the # of steps is debatable, but at least it's consistent.  I wish the technology was advanced enough to keep an accurate count if I am pushing a cart, but by now I'm cognizant of it enough to push (or pull) the cart with my opposite hand.  Overall, I'm quite happy, outside of the band issue, no complaints.
 I'm wishing I shelled out the extra and just got the watch.. For the features this doesn't have. But mostly for the old style tech this has. Like reading messages. Its like I have a old pager screen on my wrist lols. Also, the heart meter seems to not function allot. One of the main reasons I got this was for that and the sleep functions. So I'm always looking at it and I catch it blank allot to the point I now wear it upside down so the fitbit is on the spot you check for pulse. It has since not messed up much in the heart tracking since I wear it in this position.. The silent alarm is just that, silent. The vibrations are so soft I slept through them. Even after setting another FIVE MORE alarms in sucesión each minute after the first, in attempts to make the prolonged vibrations wake me up. Nope. Slept like a drunk baby still. There's also no way to adjust the alarms besides the time the alarm goes off. Thats it, just the time it goes off....... So you better set a alarm in case or miss work.. From what I've read, all the fitbits suck with this feature. When it comes down to it, the sleep side is verry slim. There's just no options there at all compared to the rest of the trackers setup. I've even missed some notifications while working because the vibrations are too soft compared to say planting a tree.. The band it comes with,.. I loathe it. I'm a grounskeeper Hawai'i, so I sweat allot, dirt and stuff gets in there. I clean it out but this thing get sticky and irritates the %*€~ out of me to where I'm always adjusting the size and moving it around. Pain in the ass. Never experienced anything like this before with a 'watch' type gadget. I do NOT like the band. At all.. I'm fidgeting with it as I type this..<br/>Okay,... after a week with this one, I'm just pau with it. I am returning it this Friday and getting the Fitbit Blaze special edition one once it's back in stock here instead like I knew I should of. That's what I get for not following my intuition.. Now I have to wait for it to restock too...... I knew once I saw that first message scroll by like I was back in the pager days It wasn't gonna be a fit for me but I tried it anyways as it had everything I wanted in a tracker. But I loving the product enough to checkout Blaze like I was gonna in the first place.. This is why you keep receipts and packaging! And go with your gut in the first place.....🤙🏼
 I am in love with this tracker. It's got everything that I want and tracks everything pretty seamlessly with my phone.<br/><br/>However, I think the quality of the default band is garbage. It gave me a rash, stuck to me, and gave me ACNE! So, I ended up shelling out some extra money for their "leather" band recently during their 50% off father's day sale and didn't have any more skin problems. I do think it's ridiculous that they are essentially forcing those with sensitive skin types to purchase even more on top of an already expensive product.<br/><br/>So in short, wait for a sale, like I did, because then I can feel a little bit better about the purchase...
 The only objective I got the Fitbit Charge 2 was to monitor my heart during exercise. I wish I had googled it before so I would see hundreds of complains about Fitbit not tracking accurately heart beats during exercise. I've tried to make is tighter (and looser), to move it up (and down) the arm but it just didn't work. I was sweating on the treadmill and the Fitbit insisted my heart beat was around 86. The real number was probably near 130.
 Update:<br/>I wanted to think this was perfect, but it certainly has its flaws. The notable one being its inability to be consistent in HR monitoring during workouts. It's even worse when you get sweaty, an unavoidable part of challenging physical activity. When my HR is reading 170-180 and suddenly restarts down at 75BPM while taking its time to get back up to accuracy, I'm losing valuable details of my workout. In events like these, the Charge 2 is just a glorified stopwatch. Unfortunately, FitBit doesn't have their own compatible chest strap, so if I want even more accuracy I have to give up the perks of getting a fitbit in the first place.<br/><br/>Original Review:<br/>While I wish there were more competitive aspects not surrounding steps (ie: mins exercised), I am very happy with the overall performance of this tracker. It is my first, so I have no personal comparisons to make, but I can state that it is very easy to use. I picked up one for myself and my mother this holiday season and we were up and running as soon as we opened the box. The app is also quite intuitive. For my purposes, this has been very helpful in allowing me to have more effective workouts, as I can see where my heart rate is afterwards and how that reflects throughout the rest of my day versus if I didn't workout at all. I love having data points, so this is perfect for me. I also enjoy the sleep tracker which has been surprisingly accurate for just being on my wrist.
 Whoever designs things like this should be punished by life imprisonment and making them try to troubleshoot and use it every day. It is difficult enough to set up. You have to do everything from your phone. If it decides to not talk to the phone any more, you're dead in the water if it won't pair again. Only worked about 6 months. Looked up how to do a factory reset, and it is literally impossible to follow the directions. Get a TicWatch instead. My E runs solid after a couple of firmware upgrades and long ago quit having Bluetooth issues.
 Many of the functions work but the one that does not is probably the worst.  The heart rate monitor is totally off.  Tried all of the recommended changes to make it work but nothing worked.  If you are doing exercise and need to monitor your heart rate it could probably give you some deadly information.  Not a good buy.
 This is the second fitbit product I've purchased that has died within 3 months of purchase (the other being the Flex). I use it normally (not in the shower or anything). I like the features, but can't justify throwing any more money away on a product that has this kind of technical problems.<br/><br/>I had no issues with it when it was working. I saw the battery was getting low, so I put it in the charger and it started flashing a pixelated screen (I knew this was a bad sign). It will no longer turn on and seemingly won't charge either.
 I think the Fitbit itself is good. I only received last Friday and haven't had enough time to devote to all the features. However, I am very disappointed in the sizing of the Fitbit band. The size categories are extremely misleading. Small states to 6.7" At the point of my wrist where the Fitbit sits is 6.7". Therefore, I assumed I was on the very high end of the small, so ordered the large.<br/><br/>Imagine my surprise when the Fitbit arrived and I need to have the band on the second SMALLEST setting. Given the fact that getting another band that actually fits my wrist will run another $29.95 on top of the $129.95 I already spent, I'm not happy.
 Purchased one of these a few months ago for a class I was taking. It kept track pretty accurately the amount of miles I would walk on a daily basis, the calories I was burning per exercise, my heart rate, and most importantly (and quite eye opening) my sleeping schedule.<br/><br/>I can't stress enough just how awesome this feature this. I'm no longer exercising on a regular basis, but I STILL wear this thing every day. Knowing just how much sleep you actually get and how much of it was actual sleep and not tossing and turning is very useful and interesting information. Sometimes you go to bed but don't actually fall asleep until an hour in, and the FitBit can actually keep track of this. Best feature honestly.<br/><br/>One thing to take note of is that you can view all the information that your FitBit gathers not just through the app, but also online if you don't have access to your phone at that moment. Great little device that I'll be using for a while still.<br/><br/>Also I'd like to point out that the Fitbit has been updated multiple times over the past few months to add new features and just generally improve the device.
 Love this thing. It tracks steps, exercise (even when I dont start the tracker), and most importantly- heart rate. It helps keep me more cognizant of what I've done that day, and helps me keep going with the fitness reminders. It has a variety of options straight from the band (from the daily metrics to a meditation feature), which have all been very useful.<br/>It is very comfortable- as someone who NEVER wore watches, it took me a couple weeks t get used to it, but now I forget it is there. While it isn't as stylish as statement watch, it is simple and small enough that I dont mind wearing it with my work clothes. The size helps- small enough to not be very noticeable, but large enough that the screen is easy for me to read.<br/>The battery generally lasts me a week or more without charging and only takes an hour or so to charge back up, so that is spectacular.
 This is a basically functional fitness tracker, but has some glaring weaknesses. I have worn a Fitbit One (the little thumbdrive-type tracker that clips to your pocket) for years, and have been pleased with its accuracy as a pedometer and modest usefulness as a sleep motion tracker. The Charge 2 of course has more features, notably the heart rate tracking, which is useful for exercise and also yields fundamentally different and better sleep tracking then the One. But because the Charge 2 is worn on the wrist, the step counter is laughably incorrect. For a few days I wore both my Charge 2 and my One, and the Charge claims I walked close to 40% farther. In addition as a wristwatch the Charge 2 has a mediocre user interface and very limited configurability.<br/><br/>I will probably keep both, and use the Charge 2 just for sleep and gym, and the One to more accurately track my actual physical activity for the rest of the day.
 I'm so disappointed in this product and the company that makes it. The Fitbit's work well as long as they are working, but this is the second one I've purchased that eventually just stops holding a charge and then quits working completely. When this unit was new it would hold a charge for 4-5 days. After about a year, the charge time became shorter and shorter until I was having to charge it every day, sometimes more than once. Then, suddenly it went black and died. The unit I had before this one (the less expensive original Charge) did the very same thing. These are pretty expensive 'disposable' trackers. Will not buy another Fitbit product.
 I LOVE my Fitbit. Had it almost a  year now and the band is only slightly dirty. Much better than I thought it was going to go. I've dinged up the face by accidentally walking into walls (Fitbit does not fix natural clumsiness), but it still works 100%! Battery is like 5-7+ days, REALLY good life span. My dad hasn't been all that thrilled with his Fitbit products, but mine is literally the best. My boyfriend got me a Michael Kors Access Smartwatch for Christmas thinking I could "replace" my Fitbit with it - the Smartwatch went right back to the store in favor the of the lighter, sportier Fitbit. I really do love this thing. Helps with breathing, I used to wear it to sleep and it was great for sleep tracking. Highly recommend!
 I am very happy with the Charge 2 it does what it advertised and does it well. If you are looking at the new Alta I would get the Charge 2 instead. The button on it lets you do more, pause your exercise, change settings and more on the band instead of having to go to the app like on the Alta. I ride a bike and it works flawlessly with Mapmyride. You will need your phone for GPS but the Charge 2 will use your phone's GPS to track your workouts. I like the breathing exercises and sleep stages. You can change bands if you want a new look and it has a clock face so it's a watch too. You can get notifications on it and it works with Myfitnesspal if you are watching calories. It's a wonderful tracker you can't go wrong for the price.
 I purchased my device one week ago (through the fitbit seller on amazon) and it already stopped working. The company refused to help and put the burden on me to pursue a return instead of taking care of it for me. Poor customer service. Also: it does not accurately track calories. My friend who is a similar height and weight to me (less than a 5 pound weight/half inch height difference) is recorded as burning over 200 more calories than me for the same yoga class class. I'd just get a regular heart rate monitor if I were you.
 I wanted to write a review immediately because of how thrilled I am with my new Fitbit, but I waited three weeks to make sure I was satisfied.  I've been wearing another brand of fitness band for 3 years, but made the switch to Fitbit due to deteriorating quality of the other bands and poor customer service from the other company. I am so happy I made the switch!  I am getting better and more accurate statistics from my Fitbit Charge 2 that have helped me refine my fitness goals.  I like that the Charge 2 functions as a smart watch; caller ID, text messages, and calendar reminders all show up on my Charge 2!  The band is easy to put on and take off, and it is lightweight and comfortable.  I am also enjoying the Fitbit app and the new dashboard; I feel like I get a very accurate results and the information provided is helping me reach new fitness goals.  My only (very, very minor) complaint is that the battery life is only around five days, but the Charge 2 only takes around an hour to reach full charge so it is only a minor issue.  If you're ready to make the upgrade to a better fitness tracker, the Fitbit Charge 2 is a great investment!
 I certainly like this product.  I got one for Christmas years ago, but it is old and who knows where I put it so I decided to get a new one.  I really do like this, it keeps track of my steps and heart rate.  I will say I am disappointed it is not compatible with my phone (LG V30) so I can receive text messages and calendar things on it, but oh well.  It is a bit difficult to get the band off, but I think I have the hang of it now.  The cord it comes with is way too short.  It is not long enough to be plugged in and sit on a dresser or even a night stand.  That is one thing I think they really do need to change, I went out and bought a longer cord because it is really asinine how short it is.  All in all it is a good product.<br/><br/>Jennifer Edit: I dropped my review rating as the battery has now decided to stop holding a charge after less than a month.  Fortunately Fit Bit manufacturer is sending me a replacement, but it is sad I have to have it replaced after a month.
 The band on my Charge 2 has fallen off numerous times.  I called customer service, and I was told my FitBit tracker was beyond the warranty.<br/><br/>The representative said, “these bands are ‘made to last."  She blamed weather changes, and temperature, and usage.  I have taken care of my tracker.  I put a screen cover on, and the screen has never been scratched.<br/><br/>What I really noticed is the point where the band attaches (on both sides of the tracker) is plastic and breaks easily.  To me, this is a product defect.  All I got back from her is “I will be taking note of your observations.”<br/><br/>Because this seems to be a defect, I said, “I think there should be a replacement sent free of charge”.  She replied, “My system would not provide such request.”<br/><br/>Then she asked if there was anything else.  I told her, “I don't have anything else to say here. Publicity will say much more.”<br/><br/>Keep in mind I have had this issue for many months.  So, DO NOT WAIT TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THIS ISSUE!
 I received this just a couple of days ago.  I had an Apple Watch Series 2 that I just got rid of because i just thought it was too big.  I love the size of the Charge 2.  I don't feel like it does as good a job of tracking my heart rate accurately though.  As long as I have my phone with me it does a good job, along with the fitbit app, of tracking my runs.  The little messages and achievements are nice and a welcomed, but small, bit of motivation.  The battery life is wonderful and I really like that over the apple watch series 2.  I know the apple watch can do a lot more things that the charge 2 cant but I never even got to use the sleep monitor feature of the apple watch because it was always dead before midnight.  My only real complaint about the Charge 2 is the band. I do not like the way it clasps and I struggle with putting it on and taking it off.  I think it would be better if that part of the band was smooth instead of textured.<br/><br/>*Edit - I lowered my rating to 3 stars.  I really do not like the band on these.  It gives me rashes on my wrist even after cleaning daily.  I've ordered a different band made of a different type of material.  Hopefully that will be better.
 Fitbit drops more than 30BPM or struggles to read heart rate, showing "--" at random moments throughout the day. At first I thought it was me, but then had occasion to compare it to a chest monitor, and noticed that it was the fitbit just spazzing out on its own. EX. Walking along at steady pace (not exercise just regular walking) and HR sudden goes from 95 to 65 or 70. Stays that way for a few minutes or more, before realizing it's incorrect and then adjusting back to my true heart rate.<br/><br/>Others have also reported that of the various Fitbit styles, Charge 2 seems to be the most inaccurate at measuring BPM. I was OK with it being off 2-3 compared to the other styles as reported on reviewer websites, but the error of just dropping out of measuring my heart rate completely really threw me off.<br/><br/>I emailed customer support as the device is well within it's one year warranty; it's only 3 months old! and more importantly the customer service has been terrible - they are refusing to repair or replace the fitbit. Given I'm a long time fitbit user and my 3+ year old Charge HR still works just fine, I'm annoyed at the inaccuracy, poor service, and poor function of the Charge 2 which cost me almost triple what I paid for the more accurate HR.<br/><br/>I'd advise to either pick a different Fitbit style, or go with another brand all together given the poor response from customer service to do anything about a ~$200 paper weight.
 The buyer should be aware! This is a poorly made product. When I complained to Fitbit, they offered me a discount in getting another fit bit. i have owned 3 fit bits since 2015 and they have all broken down within a short period of time.  If I got another, who is to say it won't breakdown again?! I have copied my response to fitbit below.<br/><br/>"I am not interested in this offer. Your product is made of very poor quality. This is the third time that my fitbit watch has broken due to no fault on my own. I bought my first Fitbit Charge HR in December 2015 and because it broke, your company replaced it, at no cost to me, and that one also broke down. I bought another Fitbit Charge HR 2 in January 2017 and that broke down a little after one year. I have no interest in wasting my money on such a poorly made product. Due to the frequent breakdown in your product, your company should fully replace my FitBit. If I buy this fitbit at the discounted price, as you suggest, who is to say that it won't break down in a short time again? I also own an Apple Watch 2 and that has never given me problems. I will never do business with your company again."<br/><br/>If I could, I would give fitbit ZERO stars.
 I resisted this product for awhile, because I am not a "fit" person, but now that I have it, I have to say I adore my Fitbit. I actually got it to track my sleep a little better, but I have ended up falling in love with all its features. And, to my surprise, the longer I've owned it, the more I've kept up with my health. I use the app to log my food intake (which has made me realize I need more veggies in my life), to keep track of how much water I drink (surprise, needed more hydration, too), to log my weight loss goals (I mean, it is the beginning of the year, after all), and I use it for its original purpose, sleep. It is so fascinating to keep track of my heart rate, to see how busy or not busy I am at work, and to keep challenging myself to just go another a few steps.
 I updated to a Charge HR 2 when I lost my Alta on a long walk, and I am SO thrilled that I did.<br/><br/>Caveat: I do NOT use Fitbits for workout tracking. I originally bought the Alta to track my steps more accurately than my phone, but as I used it I grew more attached to the sleep statistics in the app, as I react poorly to lack of sleep. This turned into generally using the stats in the Alta for stress management.<br/><br/>Upgrading to the Charge 2 HR was amazing not only for checking my heart rate in conjunction with meditation or work stress - it was a fantastic upgrade in my sleep statistics. Instead of getting just how long I slept and how much was restless, I have statistics on my deep sleep and REM  sleep, which is so much more useful. While the app doesn't correlate data of heart rate and sleep, I can do it myself based upon timelines, and it's not only useful but interesting! Love my new Charge 2 HR :)
 DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!  I wore for LESS than one month and the screen cracked.  I wore it like a normal watch.  I work in an insurance office all day and walk/run for activity.  Nothing unusual during wear..  Called their "customer service" and they offered to give me 25% off to buy ANOTHER one!  Why would any reasonable person throw more money at a cheap piece of crap, much less give it to a company that doesn't stand behind their products.  I'm going with Garmin.  My boys rough and tumble in theirs and have no issues after several years.
 These bands are awesome. They work just like a standard Fitbit would (because it is one duh) and look great.<br/><br/>The Fitbit is about 1 and a half times the size of the Alta which is nice for people who do not particularly want to hide or show off the fact that they have a Fitbit.<br/><br/>The app that you should download is very user-friendly, and on almost every page it explains what certain features and stats are for or mean.<br/><br/>The battery life on this is about four days having the Heart Rate monitor always on as well as All-day sync up with your phone. It is not the five days that they claim at least not in regular use. Charging takes only about 2 hours if the battery was completely dead and maybe 45 to an hour if the battery is at 50%.<br/><br/>Overall the Fitbit and the app are excellent. As of right now, they are limited to what apps and items it can sync up with and for. It only does sleep for Samsung Health, and you may find a few other apps that it partners with but not many really. They are however always adding more partnered apps and features so it might be in the near future.<br/><br/>This is a great product and its going to be a great Father's Day gift too.
 What good is a fitness tracker that can't measure your heart rate when you are sweaty? Had I known this was a common problem with fitbits, I'd own something else.<br/>I bought the Charge 2 specifically because of its highly-touted heart rate monitoring capability. I happen to get sweaty, as the human body is designed to do, when I work out. Being humid where I live exacerbates the issue I imagine.<br/>The Charge indicates no heart rate at all, something in the 50s (when I know it's in the low 100s), or "resting".<br/>If you do not perspire when you exercise, you're in luck. And in need of a little more cardio...
 I finally decided to invest in a Fitbit and found that Amazon had the best price. With that price, however, came poor quality and a complete lack of support.<br/><br/>Around 6 months after I purchased it, my Fitbit completely stopped working. The screen is black and plugging it in to charger doesn't make a difference so it is not simply out of battery. I logged into my Amazon account to contact the company in order to have my issue resolved, and Amazon simply says that "no product support is available". I find this completely unacceptable. When a product stops working for no apparent reason, especially one this pricey, I expect to receive help and a way in which I can contact the seller. I have not damaged the Fitbit, yet now I am stuck with a useless one and no way to speak with the seller. I recommend spending a little extra money to purchase this item directly from the Fitbit company, unless you want to get screwed.
 I have had several different types of Fitbits  including the HR charge and love them all. Recently I purchased the Charge 2. I was particularly interested in two new features, the "relax" and "reminder to move." As it turned out my purchase was very timely. Within a couple of weeks of receiving the Charge 2, I developed some medical issues that require me to take my blood pressure every couple of hours. So before I do, I use the breathing relaxation feature to calm myself before I take the reading. Also, I'm the kind of person that tends to curl up in a chair and read or watch TV and forget how long I've been sitting there. With this gentle reminder to move, not only am I up and moving some portion of every hour, I also find that it's easier to reach my daily step goal. So thank you Fitbit. Charge 2 - it's a good thing.
 This is my first Fitbit. Works as described. I am an elementary special education inclusion teacher and walk all over my school throughout the day. Besides the obvious functionality of counting steps, etc., I like how I can discreetly see calls and text messages and decide if I need  to call/reply whether it's from staff, a parent, or of a personal nature. I also like having a wrist watch again in lieu of checking my phone for the time. The Firbit has helped me be aware of my calorie and water intake and sleep patterns. I am not typically into gimicky stuff but I do like the Fitbit badges that you get for total mile thresholds - like the Penguin badge based on the miles in the Walk of the Penguins (If I recall correctly 75 miles.) I just recently got like a London Underground badge for 250 miles. I also like how you can scan food item bar codes through the app to help record calories. I like how it nudges you to walk every hour if you've been sedentary. Overall, good health awareness to help modify behavior and choices.
 The product seemed ok in the beginning, but didnt last. I bought march 2017 and by July 2018 it was broke. Contacted Fitbit and they said it was out of warranty. So 1 yr and 3 mos for $150 is not very good product. Ive seen other reviews for same issue im having. It has a problem with the heart rate monitor and losses battery life after 1 day. It was well taken care of , just normal wearing daily, taken off for showers, etc. I would recommend looking at other companies products unless you want to be out your money in a year and looking for a replacement. Fitbit offered me a 25% offer to buy another product that will break in a year. No Thanks.<br/>By the way I rarely write reviews but felt it was important to warn people about this product.
 This tracker should get ZERO STARS....<br/><br/>Step counter is inaccurate!!! Steps were being counted with just slight arm movement.<br/>Support was zero help. Their suggested solution....go into the app and just remove the steps that were miscounted....WTH???<br/><br/>I even got another 67 additional steps added after it reached 10,000 steps and then proceeded with it’s fireworks celebration. Too bad I was sitting in a chair not only when it reached 10,000 steps on its own but during its fireworks celebration.<br/>If you want a step counter that’s inaccurate this tracker is for you!<br/><br/>Very disappointing Christmas gift. Thanks for nothing Fitbit!
 For a non GPS unit this does a good job of tracking daily activity. I had originally bought this for my wife but she thought it looked too "manly". I was kind of interested in getting one myself so I decided to keep it for myself and get her the Alta HR. I enjoy keeping track of my steps and exercise, the phone notifications are great, it seems to more accurately detect movement than my iPhone. Negatives are wrist band length, my wrist is much too big for the small but I am left with lots of extra strap with the large, and not being water proof. I would love to have it during swim workouts. The only option that let me swim at the time of purchase was the Flex which was far too dependent on the app for my liking. My next one will probably be a GPS enabled unit that is waterproof.
 This is a great tool for anyone training for a sport at a semi professional, collegiate, or national level. As a teen athlete sometimes getting "enough" of a lot of things- rest, sleep, food, water- is a difficulty with the fast-paced nature of training. Personally I found this super helpful, when used in conjunction with the app and website, to track my calories, water, and sleep, allowing me to improve my athletic performance and put on lean muscle mass- knowledge is power! My favorite feature is probably its sleep monitoring because I never realized how little time I spent awake and not in restorative sleep stages until now.<br/><br/>My primary critique is its inaccuracy in calorie counting and heart rate tracking during plyometric and HIIT workouts, which I suspect may be due to a shifting of the band. As a very petite person, the tightest setting of the band hangs loosely on my wrist, so I have to hike it up my forearm during workouts.<br/><br/>Another feature I didn't know about until I stumbled upon it was the guided relaxations the display can lead you through in 2 or 5 minute sessions: Perfect for quick calm-downs for someone like me who struggles with panic attacks
 I absolutely love my new Fitbit! It's easy to set up and the app that goes with it is amazing! There are tons of features like food log, weight log, sleep log, heart rate monitor, exercise log, phone notifications, you can customize the clock face on your fitbit and which menu items show up (such as floors climbed, active minutes, calories burned, etc). This is my first Fitbit purchase and I'm thoroughly impressed!<br/><br/>My only complaint is the screen scratches easily. I bought myself and my husband the Charge 2 and he scratched his the first night wearing it, we hadn't received the screen protectors I ordered separately yet. I highly recommend putting a screen protector on it before using!
 I've never own any type of Fitbits prior to this so I didn't have high expectations. This was a gift for Valentine's Day and about a month after daily usage - it wouldn't sync with my phone. After troubleshooting on my own, I had to contact their customer service to see if this could be fixed on my end. Nothing worked so after confirming my warranty, they sent me a new one and it works fine now. So A+ for customer service!<br/><br/>I wanted this mainly to track how many calories I burn from doing cardio versus weightlifting so this gets the job done. I like that it gives options on which type of activity I am doing so it can track the exercise properly. It's easy to use and easy to read. Since it does get uncomfortable at the end of the day, I normally take it off prior to bed.<br/><br/>It's simple enough for a first time user to use and it's doing good so far.
 I bought this product on 12/27/17 and it stopped working on 12/23/18. When I called fibit they told me it was set up in 10/25/17 which is impossible since it was purchased two months later, and that they cant help that i have to contact the seller on amazon, and of course they direct me to fitbit. Don't purchase because you wont be covered by the Fitbit warranty if anything happens to it as they told me it was registered under a separate email address, not mine, two months before I bought it which then put me out of the warranty when it stopped working before a year of my purchase.
 Have used 5 days.  Will not track sleep. Did at the start. I did try placing tighter. Still nothing.<br/>Probably will return if can't fix this.<br/>Up date.... they have a way to call or email them from ap on your phone. I did.<br/>Very helpful. That is a problem they are working  on now. She forced it to update.<br/>New review.... I really like my Charge 2. I mainly use for sleep tracking and how many steps I took that day.<br/>Battery charges fast, Has lots of other helpful things you can add to help you in understanding if your really fit.<br/>I Love the size of the Charge 2.<br/>Good product.<br/>Great customer service.<br/>Helpful in understanding where you lack in fitness.
 I love this Fitbit.  This is the first one I've ever had and I really am impressed.  It's pretty accurate with the steps.  I love the little stick man that shows up to let me know to get moving.  I sit at a desk all day and tend to not get up and move around as much as I should.  I also like the sleep portion that shows me how my night went.  I knew I wasn't sleeping enough but I didn't know it was that bad.  It has motivated me to get to be earlier and get more rest.  I can't wait in the morning to sync it.  I also really like that it will show you when you receive a text message on your phone or if you have an incoming call.  This way I can keep my phone on vibrate during the day at work.  I can also leave it at my desk and walk to the kitchen or copier and know when my phone is ringing.  Overall I really like it and would recommend it to anyone.
 I have tried several other cheaper brands of pedometer/heart rate monitor/ calorie tracker and nothing compares to Fitbit! It costs so much for a reason!! You truly get what you paid for. The app is wonderful! I debated on whether or not to get the small or large and after measuring was right on the verge where I could do either one. I am so glad I chose the small it is comfortable and does not look like I am choking my wrist 😅 Like I was afraid of.  It may seem silly but having this does motivate me. I am 100lbs overweight 😫And this along with diet and exercise the lifestyle change will see me to my goal. I enjoy seeing and feeling my Fitbit celebrate when I reach my goals,etc. I have tried without this handy gadget to lose weight and this is a great accountability tool! Get it, you will not regret it! Good luck on your journey!
 I have been using the Charge 2 since the beginning of April, so a little over 3 months now.  This could easily be a five star product, but certain elements don't work as expected.<br/><br/>1. The band that came with it lasted a whole 2 months before it started bubbling up and falling apart.  This isn't too bad, there are many places here on Amazon to pick up replacement bands fairly cheap.  I ended up buying a metal one for everyday use and then a rubber one for my workouts.<br/><br/>2. The GPS doesn't always connect or stay connected.  If you have any type of "Battery Saving" option running on your phone it seems to disconnect the GPS as soon as it sleeps.  Went on a 10.5 mile bike ride and it told me I went 0.4 miles at 0.6 mph.  By disabling the Battery Saver option it does a lot better, the route shows up almost perfectly on the little map it makes for you.  Although it does still cut out once in a while to where you will only get a portion of the ride.<br/><br/>3. The heart rate monitor seems to cut out a lot.  I had a Fitbit Surge before I bought the Charge 2, it's heart rate monitor seemed to work great.  The only time I had problems getting a reading was when I would start a workout like weight lifting, but usually 10 minutes in it seemed to find it pretty easily.  With the Charge 2, it will drop and not have a reading about half the time I check it.  And then it seems to jump around a lot.  I'll finish doing sprints and it will show me with a rate of 65, then later when my heart rate returns to normal it will show it at 160 to 170.  I will say that it's usually only during workouts that it seems to have a problem.  If I'm just walking around or even just sitting and manually check my heart rate, it's usually within 5 beats.  But during the workout is when I need the data to be correct.<br/><br/>4. Battery life.  I don't even know what to say here.  Up until this last week the battery life had been great.  I had every option running on it and I was getting 5-6 days out of a 1 hour charge.  All of a sudden I've dropped down to 2 days max with the "All Day Sync" and the "Always Connected" both turned off.  On top of that, it now takes just shy of 2 hours to fully charge it.<br/><br/>The first 2 items combined lost the Charge 2 one star, to me they are relatively minor.  The last 2 items lost it one star for each, to me these were major issues.  Other than that though the Charge 2 does everything else as expected.  So if none of these things are important to you then it may be perfect for you.
 This is the third version of a Fitbit device I've owned.  Each new version I've bought offered greater functionality and greater ease of use and I cannot imagine being without one.  HOWEVER, each device has used a different charging method and different charging cord, which has resulted in a lot of material wastage in my opinion.  The charging method and cord for this particular device works well--so far.  But let me add that the reason I'm now on my third device is that the previous ones stopped charging.  They simply gave up the ghost.  If I have that experience a fourth time I'll probably search for another way to monitor my activity.  My present primary reason for using Fitbit is that its software interfaces smoothly with WeightWatchers software.
 It's a motivator, and it syncs with a mobile device to record and track various activities including sleep. The plastic clock face does scratch easily and it doesn't always display the time and fitness goals when you turn it toward your face (as it brags to do), causing you to shake the watch and try again. My biggest beef with it is the low-quality band. Mine has de-laminated after only four months of use, causing and unsightly bulge of the band face at the joint where it meets the watch. Now, after numerous emails with customer service I am told it will take 6-8 weeks to get a new band. So I will have to wear an unsightly band around for two months. Their compensation isn't to take a band off a new watch in the box and send it to me, but to offer me a discount on their premium service instead. In essence: to compensate me, they'll offer a discount on a Premium Service I don't require. In the meanwhile, I'll have to wait for 6-8 weeks for a new band... Stupid.
 Love being able to see my sleep patterns and heart rate.  Pedometer sucks so I bought an Omron pedometer to put on my waistband.  Today my Fitbit shows 14,795 steps and my normal pedometer shows 9,567 steps which shows how off the Fitbit is.  Doesn't surprise me since you wear it on your wrist and not only to I tend to talk with my hands but it seems like my arms are always in motion.  I like the reminders after I've sat too long that it's time to get up and move.  I make a special trip upstairs or out to the lounge for a cup of water just to get moving.  I have only had the Fitbit for a short while so I haven't gotten into all that you can do and track.  I did notice at first the burning on my wrist from the metal that helps track your heartbeat.  It feels like someone is pulling the hairs out of your arm.  It did seem to go away and every now and then I feel it.  I do try and take it off every couple of days for awhile.  It's been kind of fun to have - but a bit expensive.
 I used the Fitbit Charge HR in the past and was a fan of it and the software. However my Charge HR broke while I was working and I found my self in the market for a new fitness tracker. I decided to give the next model in the line a shot. I liked the "nudge" feature that kept me moving. I was also enjoyed using the guided breathing exercises.<br/><br/>The reason for the low score was due to the rash that developed with this model. Also the heart rate sensor is raised slightly higher than on previous models so I believe that contributed to the irritation. I followed the cleaning steps outlined by Fitbit and the irritation persisted.<br/><br/>I contacted Fitbit and after a few emails back and forth, they refunded my money. I used that to money to buy a new Charge HR and have remained happy with that.
 Love this! Only been a week, if you see no update it means I still love it. I'll start with the cons since there's only one. The screen doesn't always wake up when you lift your arm to view it. A light tap solves that.<br/>Pros: easy to read layout of activities with iPhone app.<br/>• I like that when I log my time during tennis that I can see which games gave me a better workout due to heartrate (I already know, just fun to see it).<br/>• you can keep track of as much or as little as you'd like<br/>• have worn it in the shower with no trouble.<br/>• The step counter keeps me motivated to reach that goal. I'm not trying to loose weight, I'm in good shape, but it's always good to add steps to our days. Speaking of which, it's 6:01, time to go put in my 250 step quota.
 i've had the charge hr for quite some time and finally decided to upgrade to the charge 2 HR and so far i'm not at all disappointed with my decision.<br/><br/>it definitely has a higher quality feel to it and the screen is much easier to read while also giving you more information than the original charge hr was able to. the connected gps is a nice touch to be able to see your run routes. the ability to switch out the bands is a nice addition to in case you want something a little more casual or sporty for your wrist.<br/><br/>I'll update this review as i've had this longer but i see this getting quite a bit of use out of me.
 Ok so this was great until just recently. It hasn’t been even two years and it’s has broken and stoped working the screen went jittery and puff nothing. I never over used it no hard workouts nothing never wore it under water not one. So I don’t know what caused this. But a few months ago it also decided to not charge no matter what it would say it was100% but as soon as I took it off of the charging wire it died so this product did not live up to the hype mainly do to the fact it did not even live for two years. I bought it in December of 2016 off of Amazon and not it may of 2018. Not happy not willing to spend money on a new one. But none the less like I said before it worked well while it worked.
 As a technerd I've been eyeing Samsung smart watches for years, but can't break away from these Fitbit products.  I had a Charge which broke apart and was replaced by Fitbit under warranty (thanks Fitbit!).  When the second one started to break apart--hey, maybe it's me being doplic doing crazy cross-training stuff--I decided to get the Charge 2.  I'm happy I did.  It seems to be a more durable design.  I don't think you can beat the combination of this small form-factor device, the Fitbit app (now allowing you to compete in steps with your friends in novel ways), and the FitStar adaptive/progressive exercise app (soon to be Fitbit Coach).  If they can keep me from moving to a Samsung smart watch, that's saying something.  The display of SMS messages is just ok.  I have a certain idiot's tweets configured to come as SMS messages.  Twitter is 140 characters.  The Charge 2 only shows 40 characters.  Meh.
 Pros:<br/>Tracks sleep, steps, heart rate, etc.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-Isn't 100% accurate at tracking sleep, steps, heart rate, etc. It really can only be used a a reference, not an absolute measurement.<br/>-Wristband will eventually start smelling without an easy method of removing that odor. Other sports watches don't have this issue.<br/>-Screen scratches quite easily
 I love this piece of equipment. The fitbit is a good thing for tracking sleep, food intake and exercise, and it seems accurate in my estimation. I find that it has improved my life in many ways to know what's happening physically and nutritionally with the body. However, when it first arrived it would not connect to my mac computer. I rang customer service, was on hold for a long time, ultimately had to be rerouted to a customer service representative in another country who was extremely knowledgable, patient and helpful, but had to arrange for a dongle to be sent to me. Then I was able to connect. I don't understand why my computer needed a dongle for it as I haven't seen it mentioned in other reviews, but it was annoying that it was not connectable straight away.
 Valentine's gift for my husband, and I got one as well. We love them. They're not bulky. They fit well and comfortably. I have anxiety attacks so it's good to monitor what my heart rate does when I'm having them. I really enjoy the feature that allows you to track sleep. I don't feel rested and seeing my sleep patterns is a good tool. You can also set it up for notifications from texts and calls, and it will scroll through the text for you for quick reading.<br/><br/>We are very happy with our purchase. I also love that the bands are interchangeable and there are tons of choices.<br/><br/>My only complaint is the charger came as a USB cable and nothing to plug it into the wall with. I guess some people use their computers to charge it, but that is annoying to me. Luckily I have extra chargers laying around for my phone and can use the box from them... but still... also the style of charger ensures you have to buy specifics and not just a standard micro USB like a lot of devices charge from. I typically avoid products that deviate from the standard charging methods, but I didn't know this device came with a weird charger. Too late to turn back now, I still love the Fitbit.<br/><br/>All in all, a nice product and decent price. I've paid more for smart watches that do a lot less.
 I had a fitbit HR, which I loved, though the strap broke after a short time and was not well made. I finally ordered the new Charge 2 and was excited to have a Fitbit again. The step counter seems to be considerably under counting. When I manually calibrate and count my own steps, which I regularly have done, the Fitbit seems to be undercounting by 25%-30%, so not really even close.<br/>Also, one of the cool features is that you can have personal activity trackers and personalize this product, though every time I go to personalize and make a change, it automatically turns back to the default, so these functions do not work at all and are therefore pointless for me. I am not sure if I have a defective product, or if this is just Fitbit.<br/>I am trying hard to be a loyal customer and in general I do really like Fitbit and love owning one, but this does not work as advertised and I do find myself disappointed and now curious to look at other manufacturers.<br/>I give it three stars because of the features that do not work, but other features work well and so it does not deserve fewer stars.
 This fitbit Charge 2 meets all of my needs. I went by wrist size and ordered the small as I was near the line when I measured my wrist. I would order the large if I had it all to do over again. But this is a simple fix. I simply ordered some replacement bands in large and the problem was not only solved, but I can mix and match according to my outfit, if I so choose. Luckily, the replacement bands I chose ended up being fairly neutral and work well with any outfit. But I digress. The pedometer is VERY sensitive. It records some of the slightest movements as steps and will tell me I have walked almost 250 steps in an hour when I haven't left my desk! That part aggravates me. I don't need to know how many steps I could have walked lol that defeats the purpose! I have tried changing wrists and settings to no avail. It is the only thing I don't care for. When I am walking, it is fairly accurate so I can live with it.
 The first week using my beautiful new, purple Fitbit was good and bad. Loved the app. Great battery life. Step count accuracy, hmmm... the jury is still out. My biggest issue with my Fitbit, was that after one week of use, I was keenly aware of pain radiating from my wrist up into my shoulder. So I switched wearing product to my other wrist. Within 3 hrs, I could feel the same pain evolving in the new wrist. After a quick Google search, I found others had a similar product. Thankfully, after contacting Fitbit's customer service, they have provided my with a return label and will refund me via check once the product is returned.
 Finally got one of these and love it. It is very comfortable to wear all day and all night. It reminds me to move and that is what I wanted from a device like this. I have a few things that I want to share with potential buyers:<br/><br/>The band is PITA. There is a little tab on the retaining ring and it catches the end of the band when I put the device on and I have to lift the retaining ring up to clear the hole when I remove the device. When I put the device on first time, I was pretty frustrated!<br/><br/>"Floor" function works but it is affected by barometric pressure change, e,g,. when the weather changes drastically. We had some really cold days lately and as the snow storm rolled in, the device told me I climbed 10 floors when I did not!<br/><br/>"Step" function is fairly accurate. I actually counted the number of steps and it was sot on. However, if you move the arm that the device is attached to, the device counts as steps. When I made a protein shake and the motion added 50+ steps but I was walking!<br/><br/>All in all, it motivates me to be active and that is what I wanted from the device and it does the job. It is also pretty stylish. I am not a big fan of electronics watch (I am a HUGE fan of mechanical watches and have 5 of them) but I wear this as a fitness tracker along with my mechanical watch.<br/><br/>A friend of mine wanted one so I bought her one in Plum for her V-Day. She got it today and loves it.
 I love this fitbit. I bought the original Fitbit Charge several years ago and loved that one as well. I was deciding between the Apple Watch and the Fitbit Charge 2 and it ultimately came down price and function. I needed something to track my heart rate, that was water resistant, can track sleep, track steps, and was cost effective. Fitbit Charge 2 won. I've worn it every single day since I've purchased it and it has held up to the wear. I have also worn it in the shower several times by accident without any issues. I have it synced with my phone so it vibrates when a text or call comes in. It will also read the first line of text from a text message. That is all I need from a watch. I am very happy with it.
 I purchased this to help me lose weight, get more active, and generally live a more healthy life. It has helped a lot.<br/><br/>Negatives:<br/><br/>The cord to charge it is absurdly short. It's a unique charger, so you can't use a different cord.<br/><br/>Two of my friends got this same Fitbit when I did, and we've all had issues with syncing. We've been able to work out the issues, but that feature seems touchy.<br/><br/>Positives:<br/><br/>Overall, this is a fabulous tool. The app is amazing, although note that you must initially use the app to start using this product. It won't do anything until you make an account and link your Fitbit to the app. Not a big deal for most, but I wanted to note that. After that, the app isn't required. It's wonderful and has a bunch of great tools, but you don't need it.<br/><br/>In addition to tracking steps, the app helps you track calories burned, length of workouts, sleep, water intake, weight loss, and more. It also makes it easy to stay connected to the community. I've gotten a lot of encouragement and inspiration from the things people post. I also love the challenges. Those motivate me the most.<br/><br/>The hourly movement reminder is wonderful.<br/><br/>I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who is wanting some motivation to lose weight or just live a healthier life!!
 I've used a Fitbit HR for about 2.5 years, but this model is a huge upgrade in both functionality and style. I don't know why the model with the purple band was cheaper than the same model with other colored bands, but I didn't care because I immediately replaced the plastic band with magnetic Milanese loop bands. If you've been thinking about upgrading your fitness tracker I encourage you to strongly consider this one. I love being able to check my heart rate during exercise to ensure I'm getting the cardio workout I need. The face is really easy to read, and there are so many options to choose from when you set it up. I also enjoy the more in depth sleep stats and especially the benchmarking feature that compares your sleep cycles to benchmarks for your age and gender. I didn't think I cared about the notification feature that displays incoming text messages, but I'm finding it very handy.
 A bit dissapointed at how innacurate the step count and distance travelled is. Not a great product for moms. When I go on my daily walks and push a stroller, the fit bit will not count steps. I have my phone on and it interestingly it shows my walk on the map but gives different distance all the time. Anywhere from 0.01 miles travelled to 1 mile travelled for the same walk. Super frustrating. I now just manually add it on my phone. Also, if you are walking around bouncing your baby but not swinging your arms, does not count steps or distance.<br/>Another funny feature is even though you can track your stepclimber exercise , it won't give you any stairs for the day.<br/>I do enjoy having a watch and with some potsing around I feel like you can get pretty close to accurate. I do like calorie counter, water intake tracker, weight tracker, heart rate info, so I will give it 3 stars.
 I was eyeing a Fitbit for months and finally bought this on sale on Cyber Monday.  I love the color and the capabilities.  The feature of setting five different workouts to appear on the display, then holding the button when you start and finish it, is a nice touch, which saves me time from having to log it through the app on my phone.  I also like the heart rate monitor, and it automatically picks up activities you do for 15 mintues (walk, run, etc.) and logs it as a workout. The sleep tracker is convenient, though my least favorite feature on the device.  I occasionally take it off at night just to let my wrist breathe a little; the band can sometimes be irritating, especially if it's hot.  I also like that it provided text and call alerts.  Long text messages don't come through completely, but it's enough to get the gist of the message and determine if it's worth replying or not! It does get to be a bit of a pain when I'm doing something where I can't respond, and getting text after text can be annoying (like when your friends or family decide to create a group message and reply all...ugh), as the device vibrates every single time.  This particular Fitbit IS NOT WATERPROOOF. It is water resistant, meaning if it gets splashed, you're probably ok, but don't wear it in the shower or swimming, unless you are looking for an excuse to buy a new one.  Overall, I am very happy with this product, and I like the positive messages I get when I'm an "overachiever" and have gone beyond my step goal or met my workout goal, etc.  It's also nice when it reminds me to get up and move if I haven't hit 250 steps per hour.  I had a Jawbone in the past, and this is far better. I'm sure the app does even more than I've discovered so far!
 I just ADORE this little guy. It's really helped me stay active and keep track of my body. Have my caloric output available to view anytime has really helped curb my junk food intake, even when I'm not counting calories. It's great to be aware. And when I am in the calorie-counting mood, the Fitbit app's database of foods and nutritional is pretty robust. I'm all around very impressed, and I've hardly taken the thing off in the past few months since I've gotten it. I've even accidentally gotten in the shower with it on and had to hurriedly remove it after it's gotten wet. I wouldn't recommend letting it get wet intentionally, but it's withstood these few accidental showers well!
 This has been extremely helpful to me! I love being able to track my heart rate, steps, and distances run. If you carry a GPS enabled phone while you run, it'll use that to get the distance. This has been very good for all the distance runs I've been doing. It gives me a lot of data I can use to analyze the effectiveness of my run.<br/><br/>I also like the total step counts for the day. Yesterday, I was 2,500 steps short of my goal at the end of the day, but I really wanted to reach my goal, so I went on a brisk walk until I reached my goal. Very motivating!<br/><br/>Finally, the app that comes with it couldn't be better! I love the sleep analysis, the alarm clock, the nutrition tracking, and more. I use my Fitbit app a ton and I love it. This has become a very important part of my fitness success.
 PROS:<br/>1. Nice and perfect fit for the wrist<br/>2. compact and light with all the adequate functions<br/>3. Adequate notifications<br/>4. interchangeable wrist bands<br/>5. Great battery life - almost 7 days and more than 6 days<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>1. Proprietary charger - I find myself looking for charger with no success when I am not at home.<br/>2. Very subtle vibration - the Vibration is very subtle - you could almost miss it if you are in sleep. Hence the silent alarms to wake you up are obsolete. Often I slept through them without even feeling them. My old charge 2 was much better in vibrating. I tried compiling 3 or 4 alarms within a minute gap so that it vibrates longer enough to wake me up but with no luck.<br/>3. Not many notifications available - it can only support calls, Texts, Calendar events - there is no provision to scroll through multiple events and also only show up part of the text.<br/>4. There is small delay in alerting the event, sometimes the call would go to Voice mail before you get the alert on the watch.
 While this FitBit is totally awesome, it's kind of undone by the charging port.  So I have 9 different places I can charge different things with USB capabilities.  No joke, only 1 works.  So I can't charge it from my night stand, I can't charge it from my desktop, I can't charge it from my wall adapter, etc.  It can only be charged by 1 of my 3 ports on my laptop.  For whatever reason, it's super touchy about ports.  Yet everything else I have charges without any issues.  So I really don't like that.  It's kind of a pain in the butt.  But if you don't have any issues with charging stuff, then you'll be good.  Like I said before, the FitBit itself is totally stellar!!  So take my experience for whatever it's worth.  Good luck!
 I bought three "Charge 2" so far, one for me and two as a gift for my family members. Two of them I bought more then 1.5 years ago, and the other one I bought last then 1 year ago. Here is the situation: both of the older ones are broken or not working. The one that I bought less then 1 year ago is the only one that still works perfectly.<br/><br/>So, overall, the watch is good, it's a good tracker. The heart beat report is not very accurate, you can realize that it takes a few seconds before it updates to the current bpm, but it's good enough to have a general idea of the bpm. But I was already expecting this delay from what I've read on previous reviews.<br/><br/>Let's jump for the problem of the two older watches now:<br/>1) The one I gave to my dad literally stopped working after slightly more then one year of use, it doesn't even turn on again. It's screen is completely blacked out, and when I try to charge it, it doesn't vibrate or anything. So, I contacted Fitbit, and here are the bad news: there's no repair center to fix it, and as it was not on warranty anymore, there was nothing the company could do for me. To make me happy, they offered me a 25% discount to get a new one, but that's the problem: the website was already offering 20% discount! The actual discount I was getting with their "courtesy" was only six ($6) dollars, I couldn't believe that. I felt that if the watch is not on warranty anymore, the customer stops being valuable for the Company.<br/>2) The other watch has a broken screen, the watch is more fragile then I expected. Mine also broke with slightly more then one year of use, and I though that the watch was resistant enough to use it while practicing exercises. It should not brake if the person falls/hit somewhere. But it's still functional and I'm still using it, as there's no way to repair it.<br/><br/>TLDR: the watch is more fragile then expected, and there's nowhere to take to repair it: if the warranty expired and your watch is damaged, you have no other option then to buy a whole new watch.
 Bought it as a gift for Christmas. She was thrilled to get it and has worn it every day. Did have a problem with the clip on the band coming off where it was attached to the watch part. Almost lost the unit at the airport when it caught on a seat. The band would not reattach. Contacted Fitbit. They said there had been a manufacturing problem with the clip that held the band onto the watch. They replaced the band at no charge without question and we had the replacement in a coupe days. This new band is very secure.<br/>Still give them a 5 stars for quality of product and excellent customer service.
 Love the actual product itself.  Three stars because this was intended for me, but is now an early Christmas present for my husband.  After initially synching with my Windows 10 computer on set up, it refused to synch after that, in spite of e-mail exchanges with Fitbit support and at least four hours of on-line research on my own first  (interesting that the suppport didn't offer anything I hadn't already tried - so this is clearly a recognized problem).  Finally put the program on my husband's droid, synched like a charm (and then transferred the information to my computer), but refused to synch again once we removed the fitbit app from his droid.  So... end results:  Merry Christmas, honey!  Meanwhile, I'm back to my vivofit.
 Not at all accurate . This is the 2nd one of the Charge 2 .The 1st would not even sync and was not accurate  .Called fitbit they told me to reset it .Synced 1 time then had to be reset again  and every time it was to be synced . I am not going to reset it every day .Returned it and received a replacement ,still not accurate .My WII fit was more accurate
 I would advise against purchasing a Fitbit Charge 2, and perhaps other Fitbits.  The glass on mine cracked for no apparent reason after about 13 months.  When I Google this, I fine that many people complain of these cracking for no apparent reason, like mine did.  It appears Fitbit has a design problem, but they won't admit it.  They offered me a discount on a new one, but there is no point in buying another that may well crack, as has happened to other people.
 I've been using my Fitbit Charge 2 for about 2 and a half months. For me, its primary uses have been sleep tracking, HR monitoring during bicycle commutes, and movement reminders at work. Overall, I've been pretty underwhelmed - the fitbit works for all of these things, but data tends to be suspect and performance is inconsistent.<br/><br/>On about 10% of nights I don't get any detailed sleeping data, just a coarse output of how much time I was asleep. This is a little frustrating, since the sleep tracking is one of the only things I really care about. Some nights, it will think I'm asleep when I'm just laying on the couch watching TV.<br/><br/>The HR monitoring during cycling is without a doubt the most frustrating thing. I live in Oakland, and the roads here are bumpy and poorly maintained. Because of the vibrational chaos running through my wrist, the HR monitor works maybe 75% of the time, and when it does I'm left doubting that it's readings are accurate at all. On occasion, I'll be putzing along and it will show 130bpm, but after I hit the top of the annoying hill by my house I'm cruising at a calm 85 bpm. What gives? The inconsistency here is maddening, because it means that I can't trust the HR monitor output over the whole ride.<br/><br/>Another frustrating thing is the supposedly automatic screen turn on when you raise the watch to look at it. About half the time I'll lift my wrist, the screen won't light up, and I'll be sitting there looking like a crazy person at a blank watch. Sure, I can turn it on by pressing the button on the side, but that defeats the whole purpose in the first place.<br/><br/>To its credit, the auto-detection of activities is eerily accurate, and the movement reminders are appropriately cute and very helpful for maintaining activity at work. The customizability through the app is a great perk, and has allowed me to fit the device to my needs. But at the end of the day, it's technically underwhelming and not worth the cost for the dicey performance.
 This is my first Fitbit and I got it specifically to get me moving more.  I'm 45, and would like to lose about 7 lbs.  I have a desk job and love the reminder every hour to get up and get in 250 steps.  The sleep tracking is really interesting, not super necessary for me but neat to have.  I don't track food on it because I use Livestrong My Plate and it's not compatible. That would be a nice addition.  It's comfortable and the battery lasts almost all week.  I like that I can see my progress without having to look at the app.  One of my favorite features is the notification of phone calls and texts.  My phone is often in my purse and I don't hear the ring.  Now it vibrates my Fitbit and I can see who is calling.  It's a purchase I waited for a year to make and it's one I'd do all over again.
 I owned a Charge HR, and decide to buy the Charge 2 HR based on the stellar reviews.  It is very good, and has a lot more to offer than the original.  For that reason, I am glad I bought it.  Here are some feedback points, compared to the orginal.<br/>- The new features, such as showing text, lets you leave the phone behind while you exercise.  While the phone sits 30-50 ft across the room in my gym bag, I am still kept updated.  Calendar reminders too.  Can't beat that.<br/>- Since the display is bigger, there is more information which can be shown.  The app is robust enough to give you good options on what you want displayed.  The previous version was limited.<br/>- They packed more features while maintaining a 3-4 day battery life.  For that reason the whole unit is significantly heavier than the older version.  It's not too heavy for exercising, but could be viewed as a light watch.<br/>- The band is still reliable and secure.  To get these benefits, you must spend effort putting on the clasp.<br/>- I purchased a metal band separately, and this unit looked great.  After 10 days, I took it off due to the excess weight.  I would only recommend the metal band for light exercise.<br/>- Still assessing the 'auto detect' exercising, compared to the original HR.  HR 2 wants you to start and start the appropriate activity (running, weight training), and is supposed to auto detect what you are doing after 20 min.  The old one was pretty accurate at recording the correct activity after 15 minutes.<br/><br/>I recommend this product for anyone who want to track their exercise activity, and/or burning of calories.  I purchased it on a Black Friday sale.
 I finally caved and bought a fitbit, and I absolutely LOVE IT! I've been waiting for something similar to the aria with a HR monitor to launch, in an affordable price range. I liked the blaze, but it was WAY too big, bulky, and seemed more manly. Thankfully fitbit launched the Charge 2HR. I was lucky enough to purchase mine on cyber monday and got an amazing deal. Definitely made this purchase that much more enjoyable!!<br/><br/>It's small enough to pass as a watch or bracelet  depending on which interchangeable bands you use] yet elegant enough to be office friendly with the right band.<br/><br/>This fitbit has made me realize I'm not as active as I thought I was. I guess a desk job will do that to you.<br/>I have the hourly reminders turned on  editable through the fitbit app/webpage], and LOVE the sleep tracking information. I've actually noticed a huge improvement in the amount and quality of sleep I get just by being aware. The smart technology is amazing too! If I forget to tell my fitbit I'm working out/running, it figures it out and starts tracking.<br/><br/>Being able to sync 3rd party apps has been great as well! The Charge 2 HR and fitbit software are very user friendly. I love being able to customize what shows up on my display.<br/>The ONLY thing i wish to change, would be the ability to program more stored workouts into the device rather than switching them in the fitbit app. Don't get me wrong, It does save a lot, but I like to switch it up every once in a while and having to pause to reprogram my settings can be slightly frustrating.
 I've had it for 5 days past the "allowable window to return" and the tracker is no longer working. It is just over a month old. The steps are frozen and it's not recording my movement. This was not a cheap device and I am astounded that it is so new and not working correctly. I want my money back or an exchange for a working product, but apparently now I have to deal with the warranty instead of a simple return because it's defective. I am pretty angry because I really count on a tracker to help me meet my daily activity/health goals and I don't have a lot of time to fuss with troubleshooting defective merchandise or dealing with warranties.
 I purchased the fitbit (charge 2) three months ago.  Wanted to wait to review it after I've had it awhile.<br/>Cons:<br/>-I am now wondering how long these are designed to last?  The battery life is going downhill fast.  It now needs to be charged every 72 hours, which seems ridiculous.  When it was new, I needed to charge it every 5-6 days....<br/>- The heart rate monitor is hit or miss- sometimes it won't even pick up my heart rate. Sometimes it is 20bpm off of what the fitness equipment at the gym is listing as my heartrate.<br/>- the 'flip your wrist' to turn on the screen works only about half the time.  I often end up having to push the button to get the screen to come on.<br/>The pros:<br/>-the pedometer tracking is pretty accurate.<br/>-The tips on the app are useful and helpful<br/>- I like the reminders to walk every hour<br/>- the sleep tracking (along with the sleep stages) is pretty interesting.
 UPDATE -<br/>After having this for 9 months I am changing my review.  I have several complaints to share below.  My overall assessment is that it's an effective step counter and sleep monitor, but not good for much else.<br/>1- The display does not stay on for an extended period of time. In fact it only stays on for about 10 seconds and can't be changed. This makes it difficult to continually monitor heart rate.<br/>2- After 6 months the screen developed 3 vertical cracks yet I don't do vigorous exercise. And the straps started pulling away from the face of the watch as well.  Not a very well crafted watch.<br/>3- the heart rate monitor periodically stops working.  During a run after checking HR 3 times it doesnt display anymore, it only shows the beating heart.<br/><br/>I haven't tried any other fitness watches but I have to believe there are better options than this model.<br/>Unless you are counting steps and monitoring sleep only, I do not recommend this product.<br/><br/>My first Fitbit so not a savvy user of these products. Have to say I am pleased with the product. I especially like the sleep monitor.  Only complaint about it is that it shows your sleep start time as the time you lay down, not actually fall asleep. When it recaps the sleep episode it seems to account for it somewhat but it isn't completely accurate.<br/>The only other complaint is that it doesn't always come alive when I lift it to look at as its supposed to. I often have to press the side button to wake it up.  Very minor issue, overall a good priduct.
 I upgraded when my flex battery stopped charging and it was completely worth it. I love that I can easily see a bunch of different data directly on the Fitbit. It displays steps, heart rate, miles, calories, flights of stairs, active minutes, and steps that hour. It buzzes when there are 10 minutes left in the hour if you haven't gotten 250 steps yet, which helps keep me active at work. However this can be annoying if I'm drifting in and out of sleep and the Fitbit thinks I'm awake. Because there is no sleep mode, this does happen every once in a while. It also sometimes take a while for the sleep data to sync to the iPhone app.<br/><br/>It charges in about an hour. When it has a full charge, it lasts about 4 days.<br/><br/>When you flip your wrist to look at the time, like you would with a watch, the screen is supposed to light up with the time, date, and steps. This works about 90% of the time, but it does need to be a pretty exaggerated motion to work.<br/><br/>Overall this is a good step counter with extras that make it worth the money.
 Fitbit just keeps getting better. I bought a Fitbit Charge about a year ago, without any real hopes about it- I've used pedometers and fitness trackers before but haven't ever been very impressed. However, the Charge was great! I love the sleep tracker, steps, distance and flights of stairs- nothing else I've ever tried has tracked all that at the touch of a button. So when the Charge HR came out, I immediately went to try it- keeping track of my heartrate was the only thing I was lacking in my Charge. The Fitbit Charge HR was just what I was looking for! The addition of the heart rate completed my tracking needs and I love the setup of the home screen. I love that you can set your own goals, get cute little green stars and encouragement when you reach your goals and can add friends to compete with you. When the Charge HR 2 came out, I couldn't resist- this thing is AWESOME. I love that I can watch my heart rate all day while at the same time tracking my steps, I get notifications when my phone rings or I receive a text, I can set my watch to track different activities like running, weight training, interval training, biking or anything else I'm doing, I get reminders 10 minutes before the end of the hour to get up and move, to keep me from staying sedentary for too long, plus without having to sync to my phone, I know exactly where I'm at with all of my goals. This is my most used possession and I'm a permanent Fitbit fan now.
 I have been using my Fitbit Charge 2 since purchasing it over a year ago, and my overall rating is that it's great! It paired easily with my Samsung Galaxy 7 and tracking has been a breeze.<br/><br/>The reason I am downrating the Fitbit--the ONLY reason--is that charging it is a real pain. I have to try repeatedly to get the charging cable to connect properly with the Fitbit so that it will actually charge. There were several instances when I plugged it all in, left it attached to my computer for a few hours, and disconnected it only to have it tell me it needed to be charged still, because the connection hadn't been made. Getting the proper connection between the charging cable and the Fitbit is NOT easy. Today it took me over 20 tries to get it to connect, and this was AFTER cleaning it thoroughly.  Why not use a simple USB port??
 My unit arrived and there are 2 problems: the charger will not charge at all. Tried it in different computers &amp; wall unit as suggested, so I think the problem might be with the charger itself. The other problem:  *PLEASE MAC USERS BE AWARE*  that this WILL NOT sync with the newer operating OS 10 (Sierra). This is not listed on the Amazon product site. You only find out once you go to setup on Fitbit's website. I couldn't even get to the point of trying to sync it with my iphone because it kept telling me to charge the drained unit, which again, the charger would not do. So I'm not sure it would have worked with my iphone either. I will never find out, I am returning it today. Very disappointed.
 I ordered this model of Fitbit because I was interested in the HR feature and sleep tracking. I've now had it for a bit over a month. So that's (mostly) what I'm going to focus on. While the HR tracking probably isn't as accurate as the an EKG or chest band (not that I was ever able to reliably use a chest band!), it's far more than good enough. It matches the finger clamp device that's ubiquitous at medical offices, and is far superior to the built-in trackers on the cardio machines at the gym (at least at my gym, many of those don't work at all, and at least one has missing digits on the display).<br/><br/>And I have the say that the sleep tracking has been educational; I'm not getting nearly as much sleep as I thought (which probably explains how I feel). Of course, no electronic device can fix that for me!<br/><br/>I've downloaded the iOS app. It has a lot of bells and whistles that I don't care for (weight and food tracking, and cheerleading; blech). Fortunately, I can disable displaying weight and food, and ignore the community crap.<br/><br/>The reason I can't give this 5 stars is simple: the band is poorly designed. It shouldn't be a cardio workout to fasten the strap when I put the band on. But it is.
 Seems to be fairly accurate, but not exact. The HR tracking appears to not be in real time. If my heart rate gets up and I look at the monitor, the increase will not show up for a good 5-10 seconds. Seems to be about 4-10 beats lower than actual rate. But from what I have read, no wrist fitness tracker will be 100% accurate. I also don't like the feeling of it on my wrist, but I may be sensitive and have not been able to wear it at night. Maybe the slimmer Alta version would be a better option. It is fun to be able to track your calories burned and whatnot for the day
 I've had this for a few days now and its very interesting. I do not wear watches or bracelets so its very strange to have something on my wrist all the time. The heart rate monitor is interesting to check throughout the day and with different activities.<br/><br/>My main interest in purchasing the fitbit was for the sleep tracking. I've been keeping an eye on the sleep tracking based on my own memory of when I fall asleep and wake up and it seems fairly accurate. I have noticed in the mornings when my alarms go off and i open my eyes only long enough to snooze the alarms it does not always recognize that i am away but simply marks the time as restlessness, but to be fair I am literally half asleep and press 1 button to silence my phone before I am passed out again.<br/><br/>The text messages on my phone are handy while I do sometimes miss seeing what they are as it senses that a movement is me trying to check the alert rather than picking something up or other movements of the sort. Also while laying bed it is sometimes hard to get the screen to light up as well<br/><br/>Overall I'm really enjoying this product and would recommend it. Its also really easy to find off brand replacement bands for cheap that are just as good of quality as the original band so you can have all of the colors in no time.
 This was a good watch while it lasted.  The watch keeps good track of HR and steps and has been a good way to monitor my activity fairly easily.  I have used fitbit devices for about 3-4 years.  I use them normally while running, cycling, weightlifting.  Just normal exercising.  The last HR2 lasted 14 months.  Just barely over the warranty period.  This is hardly acceptable.  Don't be surprised if that is your experience.  You will not get a replacement.  Your warranty is 1 year.  Either buy a better brand or buy an extended warranty.
 I bought this Fitbit for my husband. Unfortunately its readings are far less than accurate.  For example, it doesn't register steps when one walks indoors.  So far this a.m. he's worn it around the house for about 2 hours and it shows he's only taken 7 steps.  When outside it registers distance fairly accurately.  I can only surmise the wearer has to be walking on something other that carpeting to attain accuracy.<br/><br/>He is a recent open-heart surgery patient who's been told to keep track of his steps closely: thus, this product is a complete bust.  We over-looked the inaccuracies previously as he was quite active and spent so much time outdoors.  Now, when we need solid feedback on his activities we can't get it. We should have returned this poor quality product earlier.  Cannot recommend at all!
 I love the FitBit concept. I wear mine all the time. A little bulky for my little wrist bit it's manageable.<br/>Wish it auto detected the running. GPS doesn't always connect but close to accuracy when it does. Pairs well with other apps.<br/>I've gotten it wet a few times and have had no issues. I'd splurge and buy a different band. The screen looks a little old school with the colors and graphics.<br/>The stopwatch is handy and the vibrating alarm. Somehow I change settings when I'm sleeping or some time during the day.<br/>What I dislike the most is that the notification for phone calls have taken a while and I've missed calls.<br/>Overall it does a good job.
 I do not know where to start.......  This is a great piece of tech-gear to have if you trying to loose some weight or are into fitness.  I have only had mine for about a week now and I think it is amazing.  I have synced it to my fitness app on my computer and cell-phone and I have noticed a definite increase my activity and attitude.  I could go on and on on about how much I like this, but I'm sure you have already read all the features.  I will just say this:  If you have hit the wall with your weight loss or fitness program this Fit-Bit Charge 2 will boost your efforts and motivate you to keep going.<br/><br/>UPDATE:  02/28/2018 - After enjoying my Fitbit Charge 2 for 20 months it has stopped working, first the screen/read-out went, I could still get info on my phone for a few days, then it started vibrating about every 2 seconds.  Needless to say, vibrating I could not wear it any longer.  I looked up the problem on line and found others have had the same issue.  I contacted the Fitbit costumer service but as I suspected being 20 months old there was nothing they were willing to do.  I was offered a 25% discount if I purchased another Fitbit from their on-line store.  The Fitbit cost $150 at the time I bought it.  I would have expected it to have lasted a lot longer than 20 months.  For the sake of argument, you should know it was never submerged in water or damaged in anyway.  What was once an awesome piece of gear is now a big disappointment.
 When I first purchased my fitbit  in 2017 (18 months ago),  I loved it.  It worked great for about a year or so.  Then a month ago, it gave up on reading my heart rate during workouts.  I did everything support has asked me to do, but the problem was never resolved.  Do yourself a favor and look at their community forum.  The Charge 2 will start to have problems reading your hear rate passed 130bpm while you sweat or wont read it at all. It will also continue to display the heart rate even after you take it off!  You can try everything they suggest, but it never works.  This is NOT a cheap device and I suggest you find something else.
 It may sound like I'm doing a review on the Charge HR, but I'm not....just wanted to do a comparison to the Charge 2.  About a year ago, I purchased a previous model, the Charge HR.  It worked great for almost a year!  But, about a month ago, I was cooking something and some grease got on the band and caused it to bubble.  Also, in the past few months, the HR monitor stopped working.  But, the rest of the Charge HR worked fine....it still tracked my steps, stairs, calories burned, etc.  Ok....now to the review of the Charge 2 Heart Rate.  I really liked the features of the Charge HR, so I decided to purchase the next generation, the Charge 2 with HR monitor.  First off all....it has a much sturdier build.  Second....if grease splatters onto the band and messes it up....you can buy a new band.  You aren't stuck with the band that comes with it.  Not only that, but you can buy leather bands if you want it to be more like a watch, or many other types.  The screen is bigger.  I went ahead and purchased some screen protectors because bigger screen means bigger chance of scratching.  But, I give it 4 stars for now since I've only had it less than a week.  But, if the HR monitor will continue to work as it should, then I'll come back later and give 5 stars.
 Been using this Fitbit to keep track of my activity, and I love how it works while I'm awake and active.  I wouldn't recommend wearing it to bed, though.  On several occasions, I wore my Fitbit to bed and when I woke up, it had falsely recorded 200+ steps that I hadn't taken (obviously... unless I've been sleepwalking, heh).  I tried to troubleshoot this with Fitbit's support (which is very good, by the way--they were super helpful), and they told me to wear it on the opposite wrist while I slept to counter the false steps it was recording.  It... kinda worked...?  But sometimes I would still wake up in the morning and find false steps recorded (albeit, much fewer steps, but still...)  I've stopped using it to record my sleeping pattern and am currently just using it to keep track of my activity during the day.  Despite its slight oversensitivity, it's still a great little gadget and I love it.
 great watch. My favorite from fitbit. upgraded to an apple watch and now my husband has it. great for text notifications. does not show the entire text, but gets the message across on whether it is urgent or not. Does not mark the message as read so messages are not missed. Fitbit by far has the best sleep monitoring out there. was also able to easily monitor yoga and sync the fitbit app with nutrition apps. Best watch for fitness. If you are more interested in notifications and messages, the apple watch is much better. If you are more interested in tracking health and fitness, the fitbit is much better. Only downside was it would record rocking in a rocking chair as steps/exercise.
 I bought this for the heart rate monitor feature. It seems to tout that as what sets it apart from other fitbits. The "HR" is in the name, after all. But when actually exercising, the wrist monitor is inaccurate by tens of beats. You can't set alarms to notify you of max HR,the display does not stay on more than three seconds, to preserve the battery, and it is awkward to flip your wrist to turn the display back on in the middle of vigorous cardio. This makes it useless when doing HIIT workouts. It turns out most wrist monitors are not accurate, so be aware when searching for other options. I ended up buying a polar chest strap monitor and it works perfectly.
 Fitbits are attractive, with lots of nice features and a well made app, and this is at the heart of why they sell so well. They design these things to hook you, and then make sure to push out new models quickly so that by the time your current model starts to fall apart you're excited for the new shiney one anyway. But these ultimately are not built to last, and so far, for the three models I've owned, have not even lasted the full year they're under warranty. They scratch easily, the bands break, the synching slowly stops working, the heart rate sensor goes berserk, the step count starts getting aggregiously inaccurate, the notifications stop working... I just wanted a nice fitness watch that keeps me accountable for staying active and after a year it's reduced to being just a watch. Trying to contact customer support was such a headache I opted to just let it go and go with a Garmin or a Polar to replace my Fitbit.
 I don't do reviews often, but feel my recent experience warrants a kudos.  I received the Fitbit Charge 2 tracker as a Christmas gift.  I love it!  It is loaded with features, is comfortable and easy to use.  My main activities are swimming (don't wear in the water!... But if you look at the reviews/specs of other multi-function trackers that you can wear in the water that cost a lot more, they won't track your heart rate while swimming, so for the extra money, I don't mind taking mine off to swim or shower), walking, biking and some yoga.  In the winter I use a treadmill or indoor track and stationary recumbent bike for walking/biking.  I'm no longer an athlete trying to train.  I'm 59, have always been active and now just trying to keep moving and maintain and this tracker works great for me!  I switched from my first tracker, a Jawbone, mainly because I wanted real-time heart rate and a watch on display.  I do computer work so I love the "hey you've been sitting and need to get up and move!" reminder feature.  I also have some trouble sleeping and use the band to track sleep habits.  Here is the kudos part.  Fitbit has proved to have wonderful customer service!  I recently had trouble with my band after a software update and the sleep data portion of the mobile app no longer gave me the data I'd been used to and utilized.  I have trouble sleeping and have periods of time where I wake several times during the night and was using the band to help me track my sleep patterns, as well as resting heart rate.  My particular problem caused the app to not track correctly for me.  I'm sure I'm in the minority and the app worked fine for most folks.  When I brought this to the attention of customer service, they didn't just blow me off and give me a canned response,  They actually seemed to care and more importantly, even tho' I'm probably in the minority of people with issues with the software, their team worked through channels and fixed the problem!!  They care enough to take care of all their customers!  So if you are looking for an affordable, easy to use, multi-feature fitness/health tracker with awesome customer service, I highly recommend the Fitbit Charge 2!  I am a real purchaser and this is a from the heart opinion, not some marketing ploy :-)  I want to spread the word and reward a company for a great product and job well done taking care of their customers!!
 I used to have the Flex and decided to upgrade to this Charge 2. I love it so much! Wearing the flex tended to be rather underwhelming and kind of a waste of wrist space, to be honest. Now that I have this, my fitbit is always on my wrist! I love that it is a watch, step counter, heartbeat monitor, and so much more. Unlike the flex, this displays the exact number of steps counted. This also tracks flights of stairs. I love that I can set it to prompt me to move if I have been sitting for a while. Another great feature is the ability to sync phone notifications. I miss phone calls and texts all the time because I don't always have my phone right next to me, so I really really love that the Charge 2 notifies me of incoming calls and texts. You can even set it to scroll text messages across the screen! Love love love.
 POS! With daylight savings everything about it went nuts and nothing can be done to fix it. Tracking is way off and it’s not resetting no matter what I do. Honestly given how many reviews on community forums discuss this same problem, this should be a major recall because Fitbit knows its software is flawed and continues to be flawed after years of the same issue. Fitbit brand is a joke.
 It didn't really work for my needs. I am not very active but I wanted the breathing exercise assistance and heart rate monitoring. The steps are insanely inaccurate, regularly 25% or more too high for my actual activity in a day. The heart rate monitor was sufficiently accurate, but the device is so thick (tall) that on my tiny wrist it was pretty uncomfortable. I returned it. My husband loves his, though and kept it. He is more active than i and his steps are usually only about 15% higher than actual. That's still far too high, but he doesn't  use it specifically for steps tracking so it doesn't bother him as much.
 I bought this as a gift for my lady. She loves it. She had a Charge 1 and was upgraded to this when the charge 1 was having issues.<br/><br/>Color scheme is great. The smart watch functions are awesome and sync well with her dated Galaxy S5 . The heart rate monitor is great it's about as accurate (or innacurate) as you can expect for a wrist mounted monitor.<br/><br/>The screen is a happy medium between adding more size and not adding too much more bulk. I'm glad I got this one over the Alta which would have been a bit cramped.<br/><br/>Fitbit seems to be the Apple of the smartwatch/fitness tracker world , and in this case I'm happy I invested in this bandwagon.<br/><br/>This is a great buy even at full price if it's on sale definitely go for it!
 I really love my fitbit. I mainly use it for step and notifications from my phone.  I have to be able to be accessed at all times due to my disabled daughter and its really handy to just be able to look down at my wrist and see who is calling or even the text message without having to get my phone out while I am in a meeting.<br/><br/>At first it was awkward on my wrist but I quickly got use to it. I turn the notifications off at night time so I don't have it lighting up in the middle of the night.  The app on my phone is really neat as well!  Love being able to track my sleep, my weight, my steps, my water, etc.<br/><br/>Definitely a great purchase and I have already recommended to a couple of coworkers!
 I do 30 minutes of treadmill every morning and recently upgraded to the Charge 2 from my basic Zip<br/>  My Zip used to log my steps even though I hold on to the side bars of my treadmill.  The Charge 2 doesn't read my steps.  I also recently went shopping at a warehouse where I put on many steps.  Those steps didn't count because I was pushing my shopping cart and my wrist wasn't moving.  So if you are in a supermarket pushing a cart, or anywhere pushing a stroller, you're steps will not count.
 I'm having fun with this.  I especially like how it will remind me to get up every couple of hours and move.  Sometimes it asks in a sweet way and it makes me laugh.  I like how it buzzes once when I get a text or keeps buzzing (silently) if my phone is ringing - this is especially helpful if I've silenced my phone and forgot to turn on the volume again!  It also displays who is texting me and the beginning of their message so I know if I should pick up my phone and read the whole thing (helpful when I'm out exercising - in case it's an important text).<br/><br/>Heart rate isn't so important to me, but the rest is very helpful, now that I've bumped up my activity level.<br/><br/>Watchband is rather sporty and clunky, so you may want to order an attractive band from another seller to slip on and off.
 I buy this for my mom .  last week my mom at church see the watch come out the information something not right . but her feel her self right that time only a little big uncomfortable . but  the watch keep coming out the heart rate keep up the number .she thout its watch out off the order.  and my dad let my mom go to hospital to check .thanks god . Doctor say my mom come hospital just intime .if late a liitle big .mybe my mom cant come home now .they  let my mom stay in hospital 3 day .
 Horrible all around!  I started using my Fitbit and was being shocked by the device.  At first it was light so I thought I just needed to get adjusted.  Then it got worse and I took it off after being shocked so strong I couldn't move my arm. Also I had headaches from wearing it.  I used it all of 3 days and my arm hurt for a week.  The headache went away a few hours after taking it off.  I called Fitbit directly and they said it was defective and had me send it to them and said a new one would be sent out to me and that I would get an email saying exactly what to mail back. I never received the email. But I emailed the Fitbit back in the original packaging.  It has been 3 weeks and no emails... no new one mailed out. No follow up. Nothing.  At first I was happy with doing the exchange since the one I had was defective but the lack of customer service or concern from them  has made me want my money back.  They claim I won't be able to talk to them about that for another week at least.  Waist of money.  And since I have already sent it back to them I am not able to return it to Amazon.
 This is my 2nd unit in 18 months.  1st one the band failed and they replaced it.  it failed again and I think the attachment sites on the unit were messing up too.  they were so inefficient with replacing again, which was within a year of purchase on SECOND failure so less than 6 months use of the new bands...so I bought a new unit. I figured I wasn't going to get a good result anyway because the watch part also looked like parts weren't right anymore.  New one is working fine so far but overall I am not super impressed.  if you want a step counter with sleep tracking, this is a good option.  Just don't expect amazing software or long term durability.  Dial down your expectations if you're accustomed to advanced touchscreen functionality and go crush your daily step goals!
 Purchase 2 Change 2 for my wife and myself.  Mainly for my wife to spot check heart rate after a surgery. And to monitor physical activity.  Over all works fairly well.  The on mine I find the lower heart rate are always spot on compared to my BP machine.  But the one reading it seem to perform poorly with is when I exercise on a challenging walk it reads 96 to 104 then with in second jumps to 130s.  It seems to lag behind some time 30 seconds.  I was able to confirm the lad recently wore it during a medical trendmil heart test with my medical provider.  The change two was exact on the highs  and lows.  Really lagged on the HR  increasing up to 30 seconds.
 Gave this to my wife for Christmas and now that she has learned how to set it up can't get her to stop talking about steps.  She even likes the little warning to move around when she has been sitting too long watching a show.  She set her initial steps to 10,000 and quickly surpassed that mark, and now has almost doubled her goal.  She has not yet figured out the food counter, but that seems to be her next goal.  Being out of shape and overweight, I've decided to get one for myself.  Tried to set it up today, but does not recognize my phones Bluetooth, asked the tech person at work and she advised me to charge the fitbit completely then see if it will set up.  Surprised it did not come with directions on setting it up.  It's been charging for a couple of hours now so I think I'll try to set it up again.
 Bought this cyber Monday for $99. I love the watch and pedometer. I find it does mistake some movements for steps but nothing too crazy. I'd guess it's pretty accurate with pedometer and BP. I found that I have actually been using it mostly for my sleep analysis and as a watch. Easy to use and app is easy too. Definitely a gimmick though, bc I'm really not doing anything with it I couldn't before. But it is nice to get a good picture of my health to see how to improve. I recommend. I am a 7" wrist so got large but I'm on the smallest 2 holes, prob could have got the small.
 Love love love my Fitbit charge2. I seriously wear this every single day and make it a point to hit my step goal.<br/>I originally had a Fitbit one, but recently upgraded to this. I wasn't sure how I would feel about the Bracelet, but i dont mind it. I am a stay at home mom, and I don't mind the black rubber-y band around the house or when I run quick errands. When we go out or to church or I'm not wearing my "yoga mom" clothes, I do switch to the brown leather band that I ordered separately and i think it looks very nice and classic.<br/>Everything I read online said the battery life tends to last about 5 days. This isn't the case that I have found. For me, it seems to last 2 or MAYBE 3 days before I notice the battery showing orange (rather than the fully charged green) on the Fitbit ap.<br/>I also was under the impression that this Fitbit would count your steps when you push the stroller or grocery buggy---I have found this not to be the case which is kind of annoying to me. My fitbit One did count those steps, but it was usually worn on my bra so I guess pushing a cart didn't actually effect it.<br/>Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase.
 I haven't had a fitbit before this.  The mobile app is very intuitive and useful.  I like that I can customize a lot from the app, and get so much data.  I wasn't expecting it, but the most useful feature to me so far is the sleep tracking.  It seems to be pretty accurate with the sleep stages.<br/><br/>Aesthetically, I really like it with the tan leather band my mom bought me, but dang the price tag is high on the leather bands! The more affordable rubbery bands are OK, but do get a little uncomfortable at times.  I also wish the screen was less pixelated.  It's not horrible, but seems like it could be better at this price tag.
 Loved it.  Had it for 9 months and it helped me through my recovery from hip surgery. Over the last couple of months the band which is still in great shape kept popping off.  Most of the time I caught it and it pops right back in. I know this feature is so you can have lots of cute bands but it is just too easy to lose it - which I did last week.  Someone found a nice Fitbit Charge and I am out of luck because the wrist band did not lock it securely.  I did contact Fitbit and they offerred me 25% off on a new one.  Some people in the forum I read were using duct tape to secure and some used pony tail bands.  I think I will buy a new Garmin instead with a secure band so I won't worry all the time about losing it. Sad because it was wonderful in every other way!
 Well, Fitbit will loose it's band with daily usage and with the body sweat. I was lucky that it didn't fell off while I was running on the tracks and lost it. I tried to reach the support and then they say that they need pictures. I sent the pictures and then they say add case number, I added that to printed image document, scanned and sent it. And to that they say that write number on paper and then keep fitbit next to it and then send that picture. Don't know why they want it in that way, when I scanned and send them. That was awesome support I got.<br/><br/>Time to move to Apple Watch it seems now and throw this in TRASH BOX and get rid of FIT BIT. I was fan of FITBIT but their support made me think over it and now I and done.<br/><br/>Do think before you buy any FitBit products.
 I first purchased the original Fitbit Charge several years ago only to have it break within the first year.  I was able to return it free of charge and upgraded to a Charge 2 thinking it would be more sturdy.  Then the Charge 2 broke within the first year I had that, so they replaced it free of charge.  The second Charge 2 I received had a band that broke within the first of having it which was, again, replaced for free.  I have that for about a year when we traveled to Disney this June only to have the band break again.  Only this time the Fitbit fell off my wrist entirely and was lost in the park before I even realized it was gone.  Now I am without one and thinking I won't replace at all since the product is apparently not that well made for the price they ask for it.
 Great product for the price. I mostly wanted the heart rate data for my own tracking and I initially found the prompts to get up and walk annoying but now I am kind of glad they are there (and you can turn them off if you don't like them). Lot's of good data tracking features in the app and I enjoy the sleep monitoring features as well.<br/><br/>It would be 5 stars except for one annoying design flaw. The automatic view activates when you move your wrist quickly so if you're sleeping and you move you hand towards your face, you are quickly blinded by the suddenly very bright interface. It would be extremely easy to fix by creating a "sleep" function that was programmable inside the app and I saw on the fitbit site that they have been talking about this since 2015 but apparently they have decided against this fix, most likely in order to sell newer, more expensive models with this new "feature".
 I spent way too many hours trying to decide on getting this or an Apple Watch and man I am glad I got the Fitbit. It does everything that I need while having excellent battery life and keeping me motivated.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>- great battery life<br/>- keeps track of my sleep patterns (great for people who have sleep disorders like me!!)<br/>- heart rate monitor (great for keeping track of where you are in a workout)<br/>- text and call notifications<br/>- the "relax" mode (a wonderful tool for people who suffer from anxiety and/or stress) ((like me....again))<br/>- multiple exercise options to fine tune exactly what you are doing<br/>- perfect size. not too small, but not bulky either<br/>- great app to inspire and push you more<br/><br/>CONS<br/>- during cardio my heart rate monitor likes to give me "--" which is neither helpful nor comforting. this could easily be user error<br/>- I wish the app synced up faster
 I like the size of this--not too big or too small. It keeps track of your heart rate, steps, sleep, mileage, etc. It is water resistant and includes a charger. My first one did not hold a charge. Quick return to amazon and the new one works great. I get about 5 days before it needs a recharge. The charge takes about an hour. I really enjoy tracking my sleep. It is nice to get real data and see how much or little sleep you actually get. The social functions of the app are also a plus and can help motivate you. I am a male, six feet tall and purchased the large size.
 I am not sure how I have managed without a wearable fitness tracking device. I have a very small wrist and the small size fit snug and is very comfortable. I took me about 30 minutes to completely setup the device using the fitbit website<br/><br/>The rose gold band looks more has more of a rose then lavender colour which I am thrilled about, it goes well with my items in my wardrobe.<br/><br/>I really like the charger, which is clip which you clip on the device to charge. The battery has lasted about 6 days which is great and I dont have to charge it often.<br/><br/>I have noticed at time the screen does not respond to my taps, I have to put a fair amount of pressure before it displays the time. It also does not support notifications from other apps, such as Whatsapp / facebook messanger etc.<br/><br/>Overall this is a great device and I love the social aspect which allows me to complete with friends and family
 I LOVE THIS TRACKER! I originally had a Jawbone Up MOVE tracker and I was really resistant to switching to Fitbit, even after I had numerous problems with my Jawbone trackers (I had 3 total, all 3 eventually died on me and Jawbone never even bothered to answer my troubleshooting request for the 3rd one). I love all the items this tracker tracks and I'm surprised by how useful all the stats are. Surprised mostly because for the longest time I was very much, "all I need is to track my sleep, my steps, and my workouts" mentality. The interface is super easy to understand and navigate through and the band doesn't bother my wrist, it feels exactly like a watch. I love the reminder feature to get up and move at least 250 steps per hour, it's allowed me to be more active at my sit-at-a-desk job. I do wish the battery would last a little longer, but that's probably because I look at the stats regularly through the course of a day (plus I was used to the MOVE tracker giving me 3 months of battery life on a watch battery). Overall, I am VERY happy with this purchase and that I finally joined the club.
 Loved my charge 2, but all I can think about is frodo loved his ring but when the thing is constantly trying to escape you it just doesn't deserve 5 stars.  I tried three different bands because the originals were popping off while I was wearing it causing the watch to drop from my wrist.  Went back to only using original bands and sure enough I returned from my jog with no watch...  From the heart rate log I could see it fell off after 24 minutes into my run.  I retraced my run and no fit bit to be found.  Maybe whoever found it will give it 5 stars...  I give it three for faulty strap connection....  Otherwise amazing device...
 I wanted something to track my walking steps and distance and also to give me an idea of my sleep patterns. The Charge 2 seemed the best choice and is doing a great job. It was super easy to set up on my iPhone but I do wish it integrated with the Health app already on the phone. Unlike the Health app, it counts hills climbed as stairs making that info more accurate. Since I tend to keep my phone on silent, the call and text notifications are helpful. Wearing the Charge 2 is comfortable even while sleeping. But I do try to move it higher up on my wrist periodically so it isn't constantly in the same spot.
 Got this Fitbit Charge 2, works great with my Fitbit App. Nice to track my sleeping and see when is my deep sleep happens and how long. My wife, my in-laws, Aunt, my mom and sister all got Fitbit. Fun to keep track of who walks the most.My story with Fitbit: Before Fitbit my In-Laws and aunt used their scooters everywhere they go, even in the malls. Now they got Fitbit, they stopped using scooters and started to walk. This gave them the motivation they need to live a healthier life. Thank you Fitbit for getting my family back on track for a healthy future. I wsould recommend this to anyone. App is easy to use and  the price is affordable compare to Apple watches and Samsung watches with tracking abilities. Plus, no monthly fee added to my phone bill, like the others.
 I also have the fitbit charge HR and immediately can feel the difference. It feels more light on my wrist and the screen is perfect size. I used to have an Apple Watch but found myself never using it to its full potential as I just wanted something for exercise. That being said, it's not a smart watch. It is all about fitness. Heart rate, sleep monitor, steps, calories, distance. One big improvement is the ability to switch out bands. The biggest disappointment is that it is not water proof... I cannot use it while swimming laps. However, for the price compared to an Apple Watch or other sports band with that capability I'd rather stick with this watch!
 I have been with my Fitbit for weeks now and honestly I had a hard time rating this product. Now I love my Fitbit and it’s good for what I want it for, that is, a simple “smart watch” that gives me notifications from my phone and has a heart rate monitor. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that Fitbit advertises it can withstand the sweatiest of workouts yet when I do my HITT workouts and my wrist gets sweaty it loses my heart rate. So then I have to wipe off the sweat of my wrist as best I can during the workout to get my heart rate. Which, in my opinion, isn’t doing what it says it can do because the Fitbit doesn’t give me my heart rate all the time, even in the “sweatiest of workouts”. This heart rate monitor is why I got the Charge 2 Fitbit and this why I gave it 4 Stars.
 Installed FitBit app per instructions.  Followed directions to a T and could not get it to sync.  Spent 90 minutes screwing around then wrote a bad review.  Drove over to my son-in-laws 2 hours later to see if he could figure it out.  Went to show him the sync problem and it just synced then without him doing anything.  So drove 12 miles, two hours later, and it synced out of the blue.  Go figure?  So 3 stars for being a time wasting finicky install.
 We bought two of these for our kids.  They have loved having them and keep track of everything.  I didn't know it when I bought them, but they vibrate when the kids receive texts and the message scrolls across the screen.  It makes it feel like a much more expensive watch.  I wish Fitbit repaired screens and/or sold parts.  They scratched and chipped their screens fairly quickly and just have to live with it.  We specifically bought this model for the closure.  Some Fitbits just push a plastic ball through the wrist strap and we were afraid that wouldn't last very long.  This closure seems very secure.  I took my kids to the store to measure their wrists and ended up getting both of them a small.  My son's wrist was borderline, but the small is just fine on him.
 The Fitbit Charge 2 is the first fitness tracker or smart watch I've bought, wanting something fairly simple. That said, I knew I also wanted more than just a step counter. It's low-profile enough to not stand out aesthetically, especially when swapping out the band but even with the basic silicone one it comes with. Other than a few glitchy annoyances it's a great value and, 8 months later, I'm not looking to upgrade or replace any time soon.<br/><br/>The heart rate cuts in and out occasionally (still enough to track a workout). I'd like to be able to track more different activities in real time (you can select 5 different activities for access on the device, and manually edit or log other types of activity on the app). A few months in, the device stopped reading my heart rate entirely, but that was an easy fix once I looked up the problem on the Fitbit help page. After about 6 months, the rubber wristband that came with the watch would no longer attach to the device itself, which seems like a common problem for this model. Replacement bands are cheap, but I expected a little better durability in that regard.
 It does what is says it does and works well at the basics.  The app behind the Fitbit is the real wizard here though with the ability to challenge other users and compete making you and your friends healthier.  However, I find the Charge 2 to be overly bulky on my wrist (cuffed shirts won't go on over it) and uncomfortable occasionally causing zingy nerves in my hand and arm.  It's not great looking either but of course I knew that when I bought it.  However, because of those items, it's a fail for me as I can't wear it daily.  I was really excited to try out my first Fitbit but now I see ads for more stylish and less bulky ones all the time that I wish I had instead.
 I really liked that this tracked my sleep and had so many tracking options right there on my wrist. The low rating, however, is due to the device completely dying less than 2 months after my warranty period. After speaking with Fitbit "customer support" I was offered 25% off a new device for my troubles. I'd understand such a small offering on something that costs as much as these do (there are other trackers that cost much less and are just as reliable. . . which doesn't say much) if I'd had the tracker for 2 years, but it feels as if the device was designed to die right after the warranty ends. Don't waste your money. Buy something at a lower price point. At least when that dies just outside the warranty, you'll kind of be expecting it.
 Love it, tracking all my needed physical stats. The heart rate comes in very handy, and the reports<br/>are very useful. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is I had to buy a device to connect it to<br/>my computer. They don't tell you that in the add info. and was an additional cost. You can connect<br/>it to a smartphone, but the computer device is necessary for computer use.
 This was a replacement for my aging original model Charge HR whose band was starting to fray and the battery starting to lose its charge more rapidly. The new Charge 2 is a nice upgrade. The face is broader and options for larger characters make it easier to read, there are reminders to move, and a variety of alerts. I also like that the band is removable/replaceable. Two downgrades for me: 1) the Fitbit display is somewhat polarized so when wearing polarized sunglasses the reading is a bit clouded and 2) this might be an app failure instead but, of the preset exercises, there is now rowing/rower option. Otherwise I'm liking it very much so far.
 I initially really liked it.  I work out often so it's nice to have something to monitor your HR, steps, miles, and etc.  When someone calls or text it alerts you.  You can also read all or part of the text depending how long the text is.  You can add friends who also have the fitbit and it keeps track of everyone steps so it keeps you accountable.  There's also challenges that you can do.  Once you achieve the steps you open a landmark and you can view the scenery. I've had this for 2 months now.  I've notice though during my workout session the HR would go blank.  Not sure why, I just updated it so I'm hoping that will fix the problem. Would recommend for anyone who works out or wants to get into shape.
 I absolutely love this product! It's not much bigger than a regular watch so it doesn't draw a lot of attention (a huge plus for me at work). I can't always have my phone on me, but this sends me text and call notification, which is awesome! There are so many features to this Fitbit, and every single one is as amazing as the last (sleep patterns tracking, heart rate tracking, etc.) I highly recommend this to others. I have had mine a week and haven't had any issues with it. It's very accurate when worn as instructed for workouts. Best investment ever!
 Both left and right wrist straps have fallen off of the basic Fitbit Charge 2 unit.  My wife has been wearing this unit since late December, 2017, and last week both straps "detached themselves" from the basic FitBit measuring and recording device which seems to work perfectly.  The 'upper'  strap sort-of stays on; the lower disconnects every time she takes it off.  My Fitbit Charge 2, on the other hand, has been in use for 15+ months with absolutely no problems - as yet.
 The Charge 2 is my first Fitbit ever. I do like the fact that it has a nice, crisp display, wears comfortably on my wrist and does grab other peoples attention. In terms of accuracy, the step-o-meter isn't as accurate and does count few steps while you're sleeping - only 10-15 which is not a deal breaker. The sleep tracker also seems to rely on your 'preferred sleep' configuration in the app and lack of movement rather than actual sleeping modes which makes it less than accurate in tracking actual hours slept. It can be easily tricked into calculating hours as 'sleeping' when you're actually lying in bed awake and not moving. I didn't get to check the heart rate yet but it's definitely a cool feature. The biggest deal breaker for me is the lack of waterproofing which is a major bummer for a device that is meant to be sports oriented and tracks every move.<br/><br/>Al in all, the tracker is nice and acts as a catalyst in getting people to move regularly and burn more calories. The hourly reminder works great and I find myself getting out of the office to complete my scheduled exercise routing very frequently.
 It did everything it was supposed to: measure my heart rate, remind me to move when idle, track my exercises, and tell the time. It has no off button, isn't water resistant, and hurts my wrist when wearing it longer for more than a day which makes tracking my sleep extremely difficult. However the companion app is great, I can track my water intake per fluid ounce, syncs with Google Fit, and it has a neat feature that allows me to scan the barcode of the food I'm eating. Samsung Health can take a page from Fitbit. In the end I bought a Gear S3 for a true smart watch experience as well as a daily fitness tracker (which was on sale for only $100 more than this Fitbit). That being said, it's still a good product for someone who's looking for an inexpensive fitness tracker (and who doesn't sweat a lot).
 Purchased in Nov 2017... Gunmetal version is sleek and works well.  I am pleased with the software also.  The problem that I have relates to the band.  If you wear the device 24x7 (I like the sleep data), the band breaks.  The watch body is all metal and durable, but part of the clip at the end of each band is made of plastic and fails often.  The other problem is that the gunmetal version of the band is only available if you are able to make a warranty claim with Fitbit.com.  The replacement provided to me in October 2018 only lasted until the first week of January of 2019.  I think the unreliable band is worth at least two stars.  Without warning, half the band detached from the device.  Fortunately, I was indoors and didn’t lose the device.  Hope this review is helpful.
 The Fitbit charge 2 doesn't count steps. It counts arm movements. This is a big deal if you use a treadmill desk, or push a baby jogger, shopping cart, or similar thing. If you're not swinging your arm with the Fitbit on it - then you're not walking as far as its concerned. The sadly discontinued Fitbit one counted steps if it's in your pocket regardless of whether you're swinging your arms. It was a much better match for you if you use a treadmill desk. Conversely, all you have to do is wave your arm to get it to count steps...<br/><br/>This behavior may matter to you - or it might not.
 Wonderful for an inspirational exercise product, I wish I understood it better because I care deeply about my health and have problems with mobility. I also regret not getting a waterproof version for lap swimming. The material in the watchband does not seem to agree with my anxiety ridden skin. It may be worth checking out if there’s latex in the bands. They look nice but accumulate a bit of dirt on the lighter colored bands. I’ve been enormously healthier since getting our fitbits last Christmas.  So there is an enormous silver lining with this product.
 This is the most  uncomfortable thing I've ever worn on my wrist. The band is so hard and the watch part is not curved enough to wrap properly on a wrist... very very uncomfortable and  it doesn't work very well... all you have to do is sling your wrist and it counts steps... what kind of crap is that?  Not recommended because its a very inferior product.  Mine is only two months old and it works sometimes and doesn't work other times and I bet I'll have a hard time getting it repaired or replaced, what do you want to bet?
 I LOVE THIS FITBIT!  Even though I have a small wrist, and the amazing price was only for the large, the tracker itself is the same size, so I just bought aftermarket bands and now it fits my tiny wrist perfectly.  It arrived super promptly, and it was the best price I'd seen on this model!  I'm so glad I found this deal.  The tracker itself is also the bees knees.  Heart rate, floors climbed, movement reminders, a deep breathing thing called Relax that you can do for 2 or 5 minutes at a time (which is handy for calming down when someone pisses you off).  The silent alarm is a little on the weak side (I had a Flex before, which would vibrate hard enough to wake up my dog and husband too), but it usually gets me up....usually.  I like the improved sleep tracking with the heart rate monitoring on this tracker.  Very cool to see how much I shift in and out of deep sleep. I highly recommend.
 I would like to start out by saying I loved this product until today. I purchased the Charge 2 9/30/17. I am strictly a walker but glass cracked down the middle after 6 months. I contacted Fitbit, sent them a picture and they replaced it. I was very happy.  Now 9 momths after getting the replacement, the same things happened again.  I contacted them again and expected that they would replace it again.  No such luck.  They go by the date you originally purchased it even though it broke exactly the same way as last time in less than one year.  They say the Fitbit 3 is improved but the discount that they give you to purchase a new one does not include the Fitbit 3. I gave it it 2 stars because I do like the app but do not want to keep purchasing new ones even at a discount because of poor quality. Guess I will have to look for a better quality product that will last.
 Auto recognize did not work. I troubleshooted per fitbit &amp; blogs but it still wouldn’t recognize/track my runs which averages 1.5 hrs. The straps were also very difficult to maneuver. Also, DO NOT BUY SQUARE TRADE. I bought it for my alta (which is why i got charge2). After a year the alta stopped autorecognition of excercises as well as inconsistent text notifications. I sent it to SQUARE TRADE and they said nothing was wrong with it! Smh, the warranty is cheap but its not worth the hassle of filing claim(which took a long time because their servers are terrible) &amp; mailing the Fitbit.
 So far so good. Sometimes the HR monitor doesn't read. I tighten up band for workouts and it still doesn't read sometimes. I was researching and looking for a tracker for quite some time and went with this because family and friends own and are happy with. I kinda wish I spent more money and for the Apple Watch and could have more functions. Watch doesn't really stay in place when wrist is all sweaty from workouts. I do boot camp style fitness. So everyday is different. So four stars just because the HR doesn't measure sometimes. I like seeing sleep patterns and seeing graphs for workouts and HR
 Works great other than needing to get a new band size (seems I was sent a small).  After purchasing a new band, I also installed a screen cover,  Would recommend for many guys who wear it all the time working on "stuff" like cars and such.<br/><br/>I did find that the heart rate monitor is a little finicky.  If it is too loose or too tight, it will not read properly or at all.<br/><br/>The app is pretty useful, although it requires you to keep bluetooth AND GPS on.  But it works well for me, and my DR likes it, as well!  I got it specifically for sleeping measurements (it works pretty well) and overall mileage and steps and such.  Has worked well so far!!!
 I think those of us that have owned fitbit's for the past 5 years or more have a healthy case of love and hate with them.  Like all of the ones I have owned, I always feel that they truly rush the new designs into production without fully uncovering the bands flaws and making the necessary corrections.  This time, its the new clamp charger that they have designed.  You have to make sure the 3 prongs match 100% or your band will not charge.  If it gets bumped slightly or slips, you will wake up to find your band just dead as when you put it on the charger.<br/>Everything else works as advertised. Other than the band issue, I would give it 5 stars.
 I love this little gadget. It's small enough that it doesn't get in the way of your activities, and the execution is nearly flawless! Replacement bands are cheap and easy to take on and off. The app is very easy to use, and it integrates with a lot of other health related apps.<br/><br/>It's not perfect. The heart monitor is inaccurate for weight lifting, but that's because the wrist is not the best place to monitor for that. It's not waterproof and it doesn't have a built in GPS, but I don't run and swim. Someone else might need those features. Considering the small size and reasonable price tag, I really can't ask for much more.
 Screen faded away. The picture isn't blurry that is the best the screen is. The additional screens are worse(2nd photo is stop watch screen). This watch is not been active for 13 full months yet. However since it's over 12 it's out of the warranty. This is a known issue however the only thing Fitbit will offer is 25% off a new watch... HOWEVER this is only off select models. I still spent $140. I also got the additional warranty. Also prepare to use Twitter to contact customer care... 3 Twitter messages before a ticket was created. Then I received and scripted email followed by 25% coupon email. Its a shame because I love my Fitbit. :(
 The idea of the fitbit is great. All of the things it's supposed to do is exciting. I was so happy to receive this as a birthday gift. It's horrible. It adds hundreds of steps while I'm sleeping or sitting down. It isn't accurate at all. It also isn't easy to navigate through the screens while being active. Sorry, this isn't worth the price.
 I absolutely love this watch. It is the best fitness tracker I have ever tried. I work out with a trainer and this watch is so easy to have track all of my workouts. It tracks my sleep well and everything else I need to stay fit and healthy. I wear it every day. I love that it even tracks my activity even if I forget to set it to a particular workout it will begin tracking it for me. It helps keep me focused. I had no idea how much I was burning everyday so It even helped me adjust my calorie intake. It is the most accurate tracker with my miles and mapping my routes as well. I highly recommend this watch. I started with a fitbit zip just tracking my steps but the Charge 2 takes it to a whole new level. Love love love
 I’ve purchased 3 fitbits in the last 2years. The first 2 just fell apart and this last one just stopped working and will not hold a charge. I was told by Fitbit they can’t replace it because it’s past my warranty date. This product is made poorly and obviously has an issue. To spend this kind of money on something and then to not have it work how it’s supposed to is horrible. I will never buy another Fitbit ever. Please be aware of these issues before you waste your money on this product.
 So I upgraded from a Charge HR after two years. I loved my Charge HR and thought since it was looking a little rough it was time for an upgrade. I'd read about the reminders to move that you can program into the Charge 2 as well as the increased repertoire of exercises it could track and the better heart rate and sleep tracking and I was sold. And I still am sold on these features, for the most part, that whole reminder to move thing depends on your tracker being able to vibrate to catch your attention. I've had two of the main fitbit modules now, because the first one didn't vibrate consistently (it was only like once a day randomly sometimes for step goal reached, sometimes for a reminder to move it didn't have a pattern), and I got the second one today and while it does vibrate, the vibration is barely noticeable. Fitbit told me as I was chatting with them about the first non-vibrating module that they had listened to feedback about the vibration of the original Charge HR and had lessened it for the Charge 2, but they took it too far. If you use your fitbit as your alarm in the mornings, you will not feel it if your anything but a light sleeper. As for the reminders to move, you may feel them depending on how distracted you are, it's really hit and miss. I want a vibration that's noticeable every time, which it was on the HR, and while they maybe could have brought it down a notch without affecting that, they brought it down too many notches to be functional now.<br/>For the non-vibrating things, totally great would recommend, it's a definite upgrade from the Charge HR, it tracks sleep stages and breathing, and can sync with your phone's GPS to provide accurate exercise routes, and that's all awesome. Just be aware on buying about the vibration issue and you'll be totally fine with your Charge 2.
 The Fitbit charge 2 is the perfect model for me. I did not need a bunch of features more tuned for someone who is very active, as I'm not an active person. But it did have a few features that called to me, namely being the sleep tracking, notifications of calls and texts, and the silent alarms that wake you up more gently than a blaring alarm that feels like a heart attack in the morning.<br/><br/>From top-down, it has a slim profile, being just under an inch wide, however it does sit about half an inch up off the top of your wrist, so if you're looking for something that pays flatter, one of the other models might be better. I don't personally mind it's height, but I can see how it might be cumbersome to some people.<br/><br/>I ordered an XL because it was the size I was fitted at using their little measuring device, just entering into XL. However, when I received it, of the ten slots to clasp it at, when tightened comfortably I was on the third from the tightest slot. Within a month, I apparently slimmed down enough that even at the tightest slot, the whole Fitbit would rotate on its own, often stopping where the main piece was on the side of my wrist. I measured my wrist today, and it is exactly 8 inches around, comfortably fit.<br/><br/>I ordered replacement bands through an off-brand company, selecting size Large instead. I just received those today, and of the 13 slots available, I am smack dab in the middle at 7. So the good news is, for only 8 bucks, I was able to change the size of my device, and have 6 more slots to go before I need to downsize again. Being able to change out the bands is an amazing feature, because not only does it lengthen the lifetime of usefulness of the device, but you can also change the color to suit your whimsy of the day. The bands are also not very expensive at all, making this device a cheap, fashionable accessory after your initial hefty payment for better living.<br/><br/>So all in all, I would say this was one of the best purchases I've made in a long time. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who hasn't purchased one yet, and I have (to my doctor's nurse, no less!). Just be sure to measure your wrist carefully. I would say definitely use a soft measuring tape or a length of string and ruler, instead of their paper measurer, but regardless, at 8 bucks, changing sizes once you own it is beyond cheap, so it becomes a non-issue.<br/><br/>I've included a picture of my two bands, side by side.
 My last Fitbit was a Charge HR, and let me tell you, it was simultaneously the most awesome thing and the most horrific wearable.<br/>Despite what Fitbit says, their elastomer bands aren't always completely innocuous. I had the most horrific recurring burn on my wrist. Always the same place, the same shape, and usually taking the same amount of time to appear. I cleaned it daily, wiped it down several times a day, and frequently took it off. Nothing helped. It was an amazing device, but no way could I wear it on a daily basis.<br/>The Charge 2 is amazing in that respect. Not only does it look and feel like a real watch, it also hasn't burnt me once.<br/><br/>Now, I love watches. I love collecting them. I love wearing them. I love the different bands and the different faces.<br/>I cannot even tell you how happy I am that the Fitbit Charge(HR) 2 has the option to change the bands. Now I have a great watch that does so much, and I can not only wear it everywhere and on every occasion, but I can actually COLLECT THE BANDS! Now instead of buying new watches, I can buy new bands. I have my eye on a lovely almost bronze-brown metal band and the same band in a sapphire blue, and a pink.<br/>The best part about the changeable bands is that there is almost literally no end to the variations the Charge 2 can go through.
 Less than 4 months ago I purchased the Charge 2.  The wrist band broke off from watch housing 10 days ago and I am unable to get it repaired and replace.  Amazon referred to the seller who "closed the return request" and directed me to the manufacturer- Fitbit.  Fitbit refused to provide a either a shipping label or address to where it can be evaluated, repaired, or replaced.  The chat with the Fitbit Rep was an exercise in frustration as he demanded a smartphone photo of the damage to the watch.  (I don't own a smartphone.)  Next they told me to borrow a camera so I could provide a photo to be uploaded.  (Mind you, this is the third Fitbit watch I have purchased through Amazon. )  The Fitbit Rep's attitude and tone was implying that I was trying to get over on Fitbit with a phony claim.  Fitbit refused to honor their 2-year warranty by creating obstacles that prevented me from mailing the defective watch to their service center.  You have been respectfully advised about my time consuming experience trying obtain warranty service.
 I've owned this for one year and wear it every day, including at night. So here is what you need to know:<br/><br/>- Must take it off to recharge, and must recharge about every 4 days. If you wear FitBit at night for silent alarm and sleep monitoring, remembering to charge during busy day can be an issue.<br/>- My watch face just cracked and I don't even remember hitting it hard. But I've worn it hard and seems durable, though not (clearly) indestructible.<br/>- Can't go swimming with it. Says you should take off in shower, but I've forgotten and worn a bunch of times and was never an issue. Seems water resistant, not water proof.<br/>- Love the sleep monitoring - shows REMs, deep sleep, etc. and compares to other users. Really great if you want to know how you're sleeping.<br/>- There is a silent alarm function. Vibrates, so good if you have SOs and children you don't want to wake up. But be warned, it only buzzes a few times then stops, so if you are in a deep sleep, very likely it won't wake you up. Wish it would keep going until you stop it.<br/>- Heart rate monitoring also a plus, but I've compared it to heart rate functions on the treadmill at the gym and they don't synch up. Not sure which one is inaccurate, but it's off by a lot.<br/>- You can get texts and notifications of calls, but can't respond or do anything with them. But if you don't look right away, or tap it by accident, the message goes away. So it's good as a tool to let you know you got a text or a call and to check your phone, but that's about it.<br/><br/>I know this sounds like a negative review, but I give it 4 stars overall. I ride a bike and it does a great job tracking my miles, heart rate, and elevation. But I've also found that the app has to be open and running for it to work. Sometimes I've gone on a long bike ride only to discover the FitBit wasn't tracking. Would love it if the FitBit would track your exercise automatically. It should based on heart rate and GPS location if you are running or biking vs. riding in a car. A little AI on their App would go a long way, but it's pretty easy to use, doesn't look awful (I got a silver watch band which looks nicer), and does what I need it to do.
 Love this Fitbit! Arrived quickly and packaged well. Upon receiving, I immediately downloaded the app and synced up, which was super easy! I mainly purchased to track my sleep and steps and I was thrilled to learn all the other aspects of health that the Fitbit is capable of tracking! My husband was so impressed that I ordered one for him today too! Knowing that I’m wearing this all day and night makes me more conscious of my activity levels and what I’m eating and drinking. I’m really enjoying this so far! The price point is something to be excited about too! Compared pricing at big box stores and they didn’t even come close to Amazon pricing!
 I like that it monitors my heart rate all the time so I would know if my rest heart rate or my heart rate during exercise changes. It also monitors my steps and reminds me if I’m sitting too long. Sleep monitoring is a plus. I’m not sure how accurate the analysis is regarding the sleep phases. It at least tells me my heart rate during sleep. Indeed I found my heart rates fluctuates more when I didn’t sleep well. And, of course, it’s a watch that shows the time and the date.<br/>The battery is good. I charges it around once a week (usually the day I don’t want to wear it).<br/>One thing I don’t like is that the screen is not responsive enough. It requires hard taps to wake it up. Sometimes it’s a bit annoying.
 Never thought I would ever use a Fitbit, considering the fact that I don't exercise. I'm 5'7" and 128lbs. I do have a very physical job, which is really want I wanted to use it for, to track my physical activity during work.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Heart rate monitoring not only shows your average resting heart rate, but it shows your "Fat Burn" rate.<br/><br/>Slim, sleek design<br/>Easy setup, under 5 minutes<br/>Smartphone app is AMAZING<br/>Sleep tracking is extremely accurate (and very sensitive)<br/>Battery life: I've had it for 3 days and I have yet to charge it.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>You will become obsessive over your Fitbit.<br/>Notifications are kind of annoying and trying to find the settings to change it was a pain.
 Really like my fitbit, wish i had paid more attention to reviews about the face scratching. Because it will, if you are active in the least bit. I have banged my hand enough times to have 3 lines running. It does a wonderful job of keeping me updated about my steps etc. I have a small wrist about 6 inches and the small size is fine, doesnt give a bulky look. I havent switched my band as yet because ive found the plum so nice and versatile with everything i wear.
 This is a great band. The size is comparable to the original Charge, but it seems to be holding up MUCH better ( I went through 4 Charges in a 2 year span, they kept breaking). The only annoyance is that the heart rate monitor and the way the band latches causes the whole tracker to be unbalanced; because of this, the heart rate monitor keeps migrating. It usually ends up sitting on top of my wrist bone, which can be uncomfortable. Other than that, I really like this product. The workout trackers come in really handy at the gym (if you remember to turn them on and off) I like the heart rate feature, it is helping me get healthy. I LOVE the fact that I can turn my alarms on and off through the tracker instead of the app, saves a lot of time and aggravation. Also LOVE that it has a battery life monitor on the tracker; no more dying in the middle of the day because my app didn't tell me soon enough that my tracker was gonna die.<br/><br/>TL;DR Love it! Band is slightly annoying but the features make up for it.
 I had the fitbit one for three years, and then randomly lost it ... with the fitbit one I was annoyed by the clip and the wrist thing to track sleep, and so I was unsure if I wanted to try another fitbit.<br/><br/>With the Charge 2 Heart Rate, I'm really glad I lost the fitbit one. First, I should say that I don't like the look of any of the wrist fitbit trackers. But, I'm not reviewing the look. If you are reading this, you've already gotten over the look of the thing. This is more about function. And this thing is really functional.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>Sleep tracking ... it just ... tracks sleep. How in the world does it do that? In the fitbit one I'd have to put it in this odd sleeve thing, and then press and hold a button to say I was going to sleep, and then again when I woke up. It was a pain, and I ultimately stopped doing it. This one just does it. And it seems very accurate. Wow -- this alone is worth the price.<br/>Heart rate tracking ... again, amazing. I am really impressed with the sensitivity of this device. It picks up my workouts very well. I've already learned a great deal about my health through this<br/>Battery length: pretty good ... maybe 4 -5 days?<br/>Charges quickly -- maybe 1-2 hours?<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>The charger shape is a bit odd - not easy to store - and I haven't figured out how to work this charging into a good routine since it is on when I sleep (but again, that is not about the device, that's me).<br/>I don't love the wristband, but it is definitely better than the fitbit one clip<br/><br/>Not real complaints here. Very happy with this!
 Got this one for me and for my GF during Black Friday sale for a steal !! The only reason I bought this was my GF wanted one and I thought the price was too tempting not to get one. Untill I started using this I was of the opinion that any fitness band is a waste of money because both android and ios phones have the ability to do exactly same job which these fitness band do.<br/><br/>But this band looks good, so it definitely has a firm factor, you wear it and it has a style of its own. It is sensitive, so when you point it towards you the display lights up which I feel is a cool feature. Has an amazing battery backup. Mine lives for 6 days without recharging. It is feature rich - so like steps, miles, inclination, heart rate, date, time calories and it even reminds you to start walking.<br/><br/>Feature wise might be same as other fitness bands (I havent used any other type of fitness band) but I like it - its light, attractive, easy to setup and has a cool iphone app.
 Where to begin. I primarily bought this for sleep tracking as I was curious to see how it compared to what the sleep clinics say. I was quite surprised at first as it gave very detailed information about my nights sleep. The data seemed odd, but I kept using it. Each night it was tracking that I slept all night when I was up half the night. I'm sure they did research and tried to improve the software, but the sleep tracking is absolutely rubbish. I stopped looking at the data after it constantly was saying I had performed over 200 steps in my sleep.<br/><br/>Why did it get three stars and not one. Well the watch is very high quality and the app integration is fantastic. Conclusion: if you want a decent comfortable watch that can count your steps and give you fairly Innacurate heart rate monitoring and no useful sleep information then by all means buy this watch.
 There tend to be a lot of reviews for products written by folks who haven't had the product very long. I thought it would be helpful to provide a review of more long term ownership.<br/>  I'll preface the review by saying I cycle multiple times a week, run when my knees allow, swim when I have the opportunity and like to do interval training at the gym when the weather keeps me indoors and I've had my Charge 2 about 10 months.<br/>  The tracker itself has a cheap feel and the face of mine is pretty severely scratched at this point. The so called "touch screen" doesn't function well and never has.  It doesn't work when I need it to in the middle of a work out, but will react to bumps when I'm cycling and change screens away from the screen I want. The feature where the face is supposed to turn on when you turn your wrist to look at it doesn't work well either. There have been countless times I turn my wrist to see distance, pace, or heart rate only to be greeted by a blank screen. The syncing has continually gotten worse to the point that I have to sync the tracker to my phone multiple times a week and sometimes it takes several tries. I've had an iPhone and a Galaxy S8 during this time, so it's not the phone.<br/>Other features:<br/>GPS - the tracker doesn't have it so it has to be connected to another device to track running or cycling routes. With the connectivity issues, this can be frustrating. Finishing a 40 mile ride to find that the tracker didn't connect and track the ride is disappointing.<br/>Heart Rate Monitor - again another feature that works sometimes. The monitor itself isn't terribly accurate and as soon as I start to break a sweat the heart rate monitor often stops displaying. After the workout downloads to the app, the heart rate is shown for the recorded workout, but functionality during the workout is wonky.<br/>Sleep tracker - this feature was not accurate at at all and seemed to drain the battery much faster so I just took the tracker off at night.<br/>Step tracker - seemed to be pretty accurate overall. However, it would count steps when I clap at sporting events, concerts, etc.<br/>Fitbit App - the Fitbit app is pretty solid. It's easy to use with a pretty intuitive interface. It works well with other apps like Lose It and Strava. I also like the Fitstar add on which I think is now Fitbit coach.<br/>  Overall, I wouldn't recommend the Charge 2 unless your looking for a simple pedometer with some added features.
 My husband and I both ordered one of these to track our steps and hold ourselves accountable. I like it a lot for what it is but there were a few setbacks:<br/><br/>-The band sticks to my wrist and makes it sweaty, so it can get somewhat uncomfortable after a bit.<br/>-The Fitbit looks silly with the metal bands or any band that isn’t the band it came with (or the same one in a different color).<br/>-Sometimes the screen doesn’t turn on the 1st time I tap it or put my wrist up (my husband’s does the same thing).<br/><br/>Overall, I’m glad I got it and I do use it.  It’s just not super fashionable but it’s not terrible either. I’d definitely recommend it for counting steps and tracking health info.
 Initially I loved the Fitbit Charge 2, but after only 5 weeks it is now requiring me to charge it every single day and sometimes twice a day as it will not hold a charge.  The information it provides is fantastic as is the weekly review of everything you have done, I just wish they made a better quality product.  Adding to this review now as I contacted Fitbit about the problem and they are sending me a new Fitbit to replace the faulty one.
 I am a person who takes really good care of their things. I am so disappointed the face cracked the whole length of the face no apparent reason just notice a line down the whole length of the face. Now it's branching little cracks off the original crack. I am still using it because I do love to keep track of my walking. I did nothing to have this happen I really think its from the heat walking in the sun. I will never buy again because it was a disappointing product. It's not even 1 year old. It cracked after 3 months just keep using it hoping it will last at least a year.
 I had the old FitBit Charge and was hesitant to upgrade to this model.  I have very tiny wrists and thought it might be too big with the larger screen.  I am SO happy with the new model.  It fits better than the old model!  The Fitbit part is not as long, so the band curves better around my wrist.  The screen is great and has many more functions.  I like that I can see my heart rate, steps, time and date all on one screen without having to scroll through.  The alarm is better too.  You can set your alarm time and then enable/disable it from the Fitbit itself without having to go back to the app and sync.  The heart rate monitor can be turned off, which I love because I am not sure it's healthy to have those little lights on my skin 24/7.  I love having options!  There are more options for workouts as well and it has a workout timer and a separate stopwatch function.  The step count is comparable to my old Fitbit. If you are debating on whether or not to upgrade, do it!  It is very worth it!
 I purchased this out of curiosity after hearing about how a woman may have been saved by her Fitbit.  Wow, I really like mine and it has sparked me into a higher level of exercise (more time at it). The heartbeat monitor works pretty well and it certainly keeps track of my steps...I used to do about 6000 a day now I do 15000 with no problem. The sleep tracking function is very interesting and you can actually see your sleep quality .I even named mine...FITTY.  Only reason I gave it Four stars...The Band is pretty hinky
 I am not one for fads and I bought the fitbit charge 2 not because I am an exercise enthusiast. I bought it to track information about my heart rate, exercise, steps, calories and weight, and sleep. I am impressed with the information, and the way the fitbit "reminds" me of my goals. I was also able to integrate my smart scale with the fitbit app. I also like being able to log my food, by either scanning a barcode, or querying the database - most of what I have eaten so far is in the database, and I have only had to manually enter an item a 2 or 3 times in the last 5 days. So far, I am optimistic I can use this information to help manage my weight and glucose levels. I'll check back in a few months and let you know!<br/><br/>As for fit and wearability, it is lightweight and comfortable to wear 24/7 - just not in the shower! And you have to take it off to charge it. Only downsides are it is not low profile enough to comfortably button the cuff of my dress shirts, and it takes a little "persuasion" to get the display to come up. Wrist turning and tapping are not always responsive. Just use the button.
 9/10<br/>I am very satisfied with this purchase. It is affordable and very useful. To help you decide whether or not to buy it.<br/><br/>Pros<br/>Many function/capabilities<br/>Fantastic sleep tracking<br/>The step reminders every hour- Actually really motivating, caused me to go on many walks with my time with it so far<br/>Fair battery life and fast charging<br/>Heart rate monitor- Pretty accurate during everyday activities.<br/>Design- very sleek and cool looking, and you can also buy leather bands on Fitbit's site.<br/>Guided breathing sessions- 2 or 5 minute options, 5 is a little too long and 2 seems like the right amount for me. Helps me fall asleep.<br/>Notifications- Don't need to pull out phones to see text messages, but doesn't support third party software.<br/>Silent alarms- Pretty useful for reminders.<br/>Adventures on the Fitbit app with friends- Very competitive and motivating.<br/><br/>Cons<br/>Durability- Lots of scratches and one noticeable one on my Fitbit. I am a very careful person and my phone has never been dropped let alone cracked. I have tried many screen protectors and none work. I am planning on buying the IQ shield one. Please buy a screen protector with it (IQ Shield), don't make my mistakes.<br/><br/>Resting heart rate- Inaccurate. I see my heart rate at below 60 a lot of the time, such as extended periods of sitting down in school and resting in bed, but the resting heart rate shows 66-68 most of the time. Not sure how Fitbit calculates resting heart rate.<br/><br/>Strength of silent alarms- Very rarely does it wake me up in the morning. If it is used as a reminder doing things during the day it works great, but don't rely on this for an alarm clock.<br/><br/>Floor counter- This was recently introduced to Fitbit and it is very noticeable. One day I got 70 floors, when i did at max 15. It worked great the first few days and then it started going crazy. Hope Fitbit continues to develop this feature, because it has great potential.<br/><br/>Heart rate sensor doesn't work during workouts- Not much to elaborate on here. Use a chest strap if you want accurate results.<br/><br/>Overall, I am very please with this purchase. Would be great if it was more durable, but oh well. I would definitely recommend this fitness tracker over every other one, and I hope the Fitbit Charge 3 will be released in late 2018-early 2019! I'm sure it will be fantastic! 4.5 stars would be my rating, but you can't put half stars. If this helped you out please let me know by hitting the helpful button. Thanks for reading and I hope this helped.
 I have been dreaming of owning a fitbit for years and finally decided to buy one. The product itself wasn't too bad, definitely not worth the hype. The step counting and stair counting wasn't accurate. The notifications didn't always come through. However, I could have lived with all of that.<br/><br/>What ruined everything is when I contacted Fitbit to deactivate my account in an effort to reset my goals. Fitbit deactivated my account upon my request and assured me I would be able to create a new account with my old email. After waiting a day or so I tried to create a new account with my old email and wasn't able to. I contacted Fitbit and they told me that I would need to wait 48 hours to create the account. I waited 72 hours and still was not able to create an account with my old email address. I contacted Fitbit once again and was told to create a new account with a new email and I would be able to change the email back to my old one once the account was created. I created the new account and then couldn't add my new Charge 2 as a new device. I called Fitbit Support this time and was told that despite previously being able to pair the device to my phone, I cannot anymore because my phone is not supported by Fitbit.<br/><br/>This is ridiculous. I have my bachelor's in Computer Science and firmly believe there is an issue with the software on the device. Once it has been paired to one device it must be deleted from that device to be paired with another device. No one at Fitbit warned me of the complications of deactivating my account. The support kept giving me the run around and was unhelpful. Not worth the headache, will be returning!! Going to now be researching better alternatives! My advice, don't buy!!!
 not accurate with steps sometimes doesnt count them want to return it  few months later the band is broken DONT BUY THIS OVERPRICED JUNK
 Got this for my husband and it has really helped him keep moving. He replaced his watch with the Fitbit. He also uses the step counting feature, the heart rate feature, "get up and move" reminder, and the text/phone call notification.  I didn't intend for him to use it as a notification for activity from his cell phone and this has been a surprisingly helpful feature.  It compares to the features you might find in a higher priced brand of the same kind of product.  He did notice that the glass scratched fairly quickly and bought a screen protector to stop any more from happening. I regret not getting a protector from the get-go.
 I previously used the Garmin vivofit 2 (which I loved; never had to charge it), but over the past few years it became increasingly outdated (had to use a heart rate strap, no alarm, etc.), so I asked for this as a birthday gift. Overall, I like it, and it's giving me a lot of insights about my sleep patterns. The band is a bit thick for my wrist (I'm 5'1"), so sometimes I have to take it off just to give myself a break. I also have to wash it daily or it gets kind of a gross smell (maybe because the rubber is so soft; this never happened with my Garmin). My one major UI complaint is that there's no battery indicator, so I have to check my phone to see whether or not it's time to recharge. Overall, I think it's a good tracker for the price.
 I have to say that I loved my FitBit when I first ordered it. But after about 6 months, it just died and couldn't be recharged, wouldn't turn on, nothing. Customer Service sent me a replacement digital part. My husband had one that I had bought for him and the band broke in less than 6 months. They replaced the entire device.<br/><br/>Because of our bad experiences, I asked 2 of my FitBit using friends how theirs was holding up and the same--broke! One of the friends, hers broke multiple times.<br/><br/>I'm sorry, but across 4 people, if all their devices break, then it's a lousy product. I wish I could get my money back.<br/><br/>Buy another product to track your steps and stuff, not this one.
 The step-counting is great, the app is great, and I really like all of the features. The reason I've subtracted two stars is that on my third day of wearing it, at my office job, it somehow developed a deep scratch in the screen, which is apparently made of some kind of cheap plastic instead of gorilla glass. I mean, really. It's a wristband, meant to be worn nearly 24/7, and the screen is PLASTIC?<br/><br/>I talked to FitBit, and their solution was to give me 25% off of another tracker because apparently their flawed construction is not covered under warranty. Why would I spend MORE money on another tracker when this is how poorly they're made? They don't even have a repair center to fix their crappy screens. The whole experience has left a bad taste in my mouth and made me wish I would have gone with a different company with better customer support and product design. I'm going to talk to Amazon about a solution, but since it's not their fault in any way, I don't expect anything to come of it.<br/><br/>If that's the kind of damage that happens in an office within a couple days, though, I expect the entire thing to have disintegrated within a month.
 I used a Fitbit One for 5 years and loved it - and it still works, but the battery charge only lasts one day now so I had to find something else.  If they still made the One I would have bought it, but they don't so I looked at the ratings of the others and the Charge 2 was the only one that had decent ratings, so I got it instead of the Charge 3 or one of the new watches. It works great, but the heart monitor leaves little bruises on my arm, and if I wear it loose enough for comfort, the heart monitor doesn't work very well.  What to do.
 My Fitbit has never given me text notifications, that was the reason I upgraded to the charge 2 from the charge HR. I called and emailed Fitbit regarding this matter and they kept putting me off and delaying the issue until I asked them to replace it and they said it is not under their warranty and I pretty much just have to live with it not working!
 Revised my review from 5 star to 4 star.  This FitBit is very sensitive about the voltage coming in through the USB charger.  It's does tell you what it needs, it simply won't charge if you have it hooked to the incorrect charging brick.  I t really does not like charging "hubs" like those made by Anker.<br/>Otrher than that, after 1 month I still like it.
 This is the first fitness tracker I've ever purchased.  Overall I like it.  The accuracy is a little lacking.  Turning on GPS in the app, I run the exact same route every day.  The Fitbit Charge 2 logs slightly different distance every time.  Some days its spot on.  Other days it says I ran a shorter distance.  If exact accuracy is important to you, then this may not be the tracker for you.  Another thing that annoys me is in order to use the GPS you have to take your phone with you and have the app running.  In the next version of this tracker they need to include built in GPS.
 My old Fitbit Charge HR stopped holding a charge after 22 months, so I replace it with this Charge 2.  I am very pleased with the display that I've adjusted to show the Time, Date, Steps and Heart Rate all at once, every time I flick my wrist. I like the ability to arrange the display as I wish.  Easy to use stopwatch, alarm is easy to turn on or off, and can be set to just the days you want it.  Oh, and I really like the display that shows how much charge is left.  I check that daily, and recharge about every 4 or 5 days when it gets down to around 10 or 20%  Overall, really nicely designed.
 After heart surgery, my doctor told me to monitor my heart rate. I bought this product and it works well. I use the alarm to wake up, take my meds and other reminders. The step monitor is a little off but all step products I've used in the past is the same. The heart rate monitor works very well and I use it when golfing and exercising. Great product!
 I do not understand how i can trust anything it calculates when I make the same run and/or bike ride several times and I get dramatically different readings, if I get a reading at all. I read all of the reviews and bought this to help me train for my first triathlon and monitor my sleep and heart rate. The bonus, so I thought, was I did not have drag my bulky cellphone to get good running and bicycling information on training. My mistake.<br/><br/>Now I am asking the questing if heart rate and sleep are accurate. Data from other sources is leading me to believe this does not work either.<br/><br/>I will never buy from this brand for personal use.
 I'm not sure why this is rated as such a great fitness tracker. For me, I went through at least 5 wrist bands, they kept breaking where they connect/disconnect from the screen. I didn't even remove the band to change colors, ever, it just broke with everyday wear and tear. I finally bought a metal type band that didn't break. I also went through 2 of the actual trackers. The screen gets cracked and chipped and eventually just stops working. Fitbit customer service was great to replace my first one but not after it broke the second time. It is just not a durable enough tracker. I wouldn't recommend.
 I had planned to write a scathing, comprehensive review of this product pointing out all of its downfalls and shortcomings. However, I will instead make it short and sweet. The several Fitbit products I have tried have all failed to do their job. Put simply, the heart rate tracker is slow to react, inaccurate, and often completely misleading. I will frequently have a heart rate over 145 and it will never budge past 110. This problem has persisted through all my attempts with customer service, returns, resets, different tightness, adjusting placement, you name it and I have tried it. The ONLY reason I don't give this product a 1 star is because the sleep tracker and step counter seem to work sufficiently.
 After having an Apple Watch that I had to toss after the battery died shortly after I bought it (thanks Apple!), and after having a heart scare recently, I purchased a Fitbit Charge 2 last week.  First of all, the price is only $129 on Amazon, amazing.  Secondly, the battery life is several days.  Also amazing if you are used to Apple products.<br/><br/>What do I like about it?  In a nutshell, it is the best activity, fitness, sleep, lifestyle improving monitor/dashboard I have ever used.<br/><br/>The device is simply a first-rate heart and activity monitor.  You barely know that it is on, you can even sleep with it and the battery lasts several days and charges in under two hours.<br/><br/>But what makes it really powerful is the app.  Think of the app as a dashboard that tracks and displays your health, with little intervention.  It tracks your exercise frequency per week, your sleep quality, your longitudinal heart rate, your frequency of movement, and if you synch with MyFitnessPal, your nutrition.<br/><br/>And because it pairs your activity with nutrition, you get an accurate reading of net calories each day.<br/><br/>I am on day 2 with this device, but already can't live without it!
 Was looking forward to the functions which are not available on my Fitbit Zip (primarily heart rate, sleep cycle, and floors, hourly step goal).<br/><br/>I continued to carry the Fitbit Zip in my pocket after I started wearing the Charge 2.  The Fitbit Zip consistently registers 15-20% more steps than the Charge 2 -- a  bit disappointing for the Charge 2 (I've counted steps with the Zip in the past and it's always been very accurate).  When syncing with the Android app the Charge 2 does adjust its step count to match the Zip, but that's not an ideal solution.<br/><br/>Our house is two-storied and I make numerous trips up and down the stairs daily.  The Charge 2 registers about 75% of them.  Again, not the greatest accuracy.<br/><br/>The hourly step goal (250 steps per hour) shown on the Charge 2 occasionally differs from the app after synching.  The Charge 2 may show 9 of 9, the app will show 8 of 9.<br/><br/>Based on the poor data quality I don't have a lot of faith in the sleep cycle information (though I do find the graphs interesting).<br/><br/>I'll keep using my Fitbit Zip, but will relegate my 1-month old Charge 2 to a drawer for the time being.
 This device does a great job on encouraging the user to do more.  It is easy to use and holds a charge for a few days.  The band is strong and comfortable.  The watch and its software will accurately show you trends - are you doing better or worse.  And the feature that has you compete with friends is both fun and useful.<br/>Downsides include walking accuracy (it way over counts how many steps are taken), the sleep quality detail feature no longer works, and the light sensors on the back of the watch can be a bit distracting when they light up as you are trying to sleep.<br/><br/>All together, it does a good job at a good price.
 I LOVE everything about this Fitbit Charge 2<br/>I was given the original Charge HR as a Christmas gift last year and really liked it.  Decided to upgrade when this came out.<br/>It's comfortable, stylish and does everything well.  There are so many features.<br/>The blue tooth connection is excellent.  I love that I can see/read incoming text messages and know who is calling (caller ID), even when my phone is not next to me.<br/>I donate blood regularly and every time they take my pulse rate, it's always matched perfectly with the Fitbit... very cool.<br/>Also, I work in front of the computer all day and really love the notification to get up a move around for bit.  This feature has proven to be very helpful for me.<br/>I would DEFINITELY buy this again.
 Love my fit bit.<br/><br/>Back in October I had to go to the hospital from fainting.  After running a complete blood panel, I discovered my glucose was high, my cholesterol was high and my heart rate was fairly high.  It turns out overall I was fun, but I needed to make some lifestyle changes.  The first thing I need was get this fit bit.  Along with a proper diet, this fitbit has helped me stay on track with my daily exercise routine.  I love that this has a heart rate monitor, so I can constantly check my heart rate even when I am at rest.  It seems pretty accurate as well.  When I compared it to my doctors heart rate monitor it was only about 2 beats difference.
 I like it.  It tells me to get up and move when I haven't done 250 steps in an hour (a setting). I primarily use it to count steps, check my heart beats per minute and as a watch. I like that it can tell when I'm riding a bike because that is my preferred exercise (counts steps while riding).  Overall I'm very happy with it. It helps keep me moving and meet a goal (10,000 steps per day).
 I researched before buying this product (choosing it over Pebble) based on the following reasons:<br/>1. slimmer profile (Pebble is wider)<br/>2. fits what I wanted it for (heart beat tracking when active and resting and sleep quality monitoring; don't care much about steps and calorie burnt)<br/>3. easy App and site setup<br/>4. users' satisfaction and battery life<br/><br/>Before buying, I knew the heart beat rate is not accurate but I'd trade chest strap for fudging heart beat rate.  I just need to know the ball park.<br/><br/>So far I am happy with this investment.  The tech support is not bad.  My tracker stopped syncing after a month no matter what I did (turn BT on/off, deleting and reinstall app, turn phone on/off).  Finally I went to the tech chat and got it back in order (it's due to software update and must be done when the tracker is charging).<br/><br/>I also invested $10 to get the after market stainless steel replacement band to make it look less like a tracker but a watch.  I have no complaint about that either. <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/For-fitbit-charge-2-Bands-TreasureMax-Stainless-Steel-Replacement-Accessory-Bracelet-Band-Large-Small-Metal-Bands-for-Fitbit-Charge-2-band-Charge-2-Bands-Fitbit-Charge-2-No-Tracker/dp/B01LXZS454/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">For fitbit charge 2 Bands,TreasureMax Stainless Steel Replacement Accessory Bracelet Band,Large,Small,Metal Bands for Fitbit Charge 2 band/Charge 2 Bands/Fitbit Charge 2(No Tracker)</a><br/><br/>The profile is tall but it's expected when the heart beat tracking underside.<br/><br/>CON:<br/>I wonder why this little tracker is retailed at $150.  I can get an earlier generation iPad mini that can do a whole lot more except tracking heart beat rate (APPLE: please try to get heart beat tracking function onto iPad.  I'd wear a chest belt if it happens).
 The interface and app seem great, but I needed something that had a smart alarm (or the ability to link to one), and this band only has a vibrating alarm function. Plus two (normal) days into wearing it and the display was scratched.. I came from the up3 band (come back Jawbone!) and I didn't even think about that facet. My suggestion to the sellers would be to bump up the price and include a screen protector- or better yet if Fitbit would add some sort of scratch resistant coating. Consumers, if you're still interested in this band it's not a bad product. But it wasn't a good fit for me.
 I attempted to upgrade my Flex (which had stopped synching) to the Charge 2, but had to return it after 2 weeks. I liked the look of the Charge 2, and I got a really cool replacement band, but after a week, it just stopped synching across every device. After looking at several reviews of the app in the Google Playstore, I realized that the fault was with Fitbit even though their answer to me and others was to look at their troubleshooting page. Clearly, dozens of people who complained that their device that had been synching just suddenly stopped were not the source of the problem. After a week of frustration and not seeing that Fitbit was addressing its issue with its buggy app, I returned it and got the Garmin Vivosmart 3. It's only been a few days, but it's still synching regularly which makes me happy.
 The wristband just keeps unclipping from the face, so my $140 fitness tracker can fall off anywhere at anytime.  It has gotten to the point where I cannot keep it on for more than a few seconds.  I have reached out to, Fitez, the seller and gotten no response.  Per Fitbit's customer service, if you don't buy from them there is nothing they will do yet their site is overrun by people with the same complaint for the Charge 2.  In addition, the face scratches really easily.  Save your money -- do not purchase.
 Works well, but it is a little bulkier than I would have liked. It is accurate.  I work in health care and I occassionally check with a pulse oximeter to verify its accuracy.  Sometimes it says I biked when I didn't, but I think it is because I would be pushing around supply carts and it probably senses my legs are moving but my arms aren't and therefore interprets that as biking.  It is a nice device and it charts my sleeping patterns really well.
 I read so many review here and description, it says it has snooze!  While I wanted a watch to help with fitness and sleep, over half the reason I bought it was for the silent vibrating alarm with snooze as Advertised, I didn't want my phone with me at night as I always end up surfing the web (review junkie) too late and Im also a slow riser and Love to hit snooze like 4 -5 times. well the snooze only goes off ONCE! And if you get up and go to the bathroom when the alarm goes off, it detects your movement and turns off (i want to lay back down for a few more snoozes!!!).  So the alarm and snooze function is pretty unreliable unless your a person who pops right out of bed. Not sure I'm going to keep it due to this.
 Tech is great.(4.5 stars)Detachable Straps (1/2 star)... Sorry the straps do not reflect high quality design and function.  They do not hold up to active lifestyle.<br/>The construction of the "replaceable" straps are vulnerable and are not robust for very active lifestyle. This is my fourth fit bit device.  I purchased HR CHARGE (2016) Loved the tech, straps broke after about 6 months... replaced by Amazon (Great!)... 5 months later recharge cable/dock of device fell apart in my hands...  Literally the cement holding the plastic/silicone straps in place peeled away from the device... . I ordered Alta... really pretty, nice tech... thinner strap... NO STAIRS? DOH!!!.... OK... suck it up and buy a brand new HR CHARGE 2...  Have my Stair Count back... AWESOME... eventually... the first package delivered.. and Disappeared from my front door... called Amazon... they sent a replacement (Great!... back in business!).... and we now are 3 months of using the new device... and my strap breaks... literally taking off my jacket and I feel the top assembly release... caught it before it landed on the floor.  Inspecting the metal attachments, you can see the pressure clip that holds the strap in place has become  distorted and now slips off the device.<br/>PLEASE FIT BIT... there has to be some solution for your straps... OMEGA (SWATCH) , MOVADO, TIMEX (Iron Man), CASIO all figured out how to make amazing time pieces that hold UP... You can do it tooo.... I believe!!! Please  FIX this design element... I would be happy to wear test any suggested solution... would hate to think you consider 3 months the average lifespan of function to e of the strap and expect users to buy replacement straps each quarter.  Not a good revenue model.<br/>ACTIVE Lifestyle means: I walk about 18k to 23 k steps daily (have a dog and I commute using mass transit).. so I love my fitbit stats and the app... just need straps I can count on.
 After wearing this only 4 weeks something cracked the edge of the screen.  I reached out to custom service and it was literally a joke.  They sent a link 3 times to upload the photo to show damage....none of which worked for them.  So they sent an email, I replied to it numerous time with a photo, using both my iphone and my mac and each time he said he couldn't view the photo and I need to upload it another way.  And then I was told it's not covered because it isn't a manufacturer's defect.  Waste of money.  After just a few weeks they don't stand by their product.
 I replaced my Microsoft Band with this Fitbit Charge 2.  I only had the Microsoft Band for one year and had lots of trouble getting the app to sync.  The battery was also terrible.  I couldn't use it to monitor my sleep because the battery didn't last long enough to even use it for one day and night.  Then it took so long to charge again.<br/><br/>The Fitbit battery is amazing!  I use the Fitbit during the work week - all day and night without charging.  When I put it on the charger Sunday morning, it still has half the battery life left!  Amazing!  The only trouble I have is tracking my exercise.  If I sweat and the Fitbit slips down onto my wrist, it stops tracking my mileage.  Thus, when I've walked two miles, it only registers 1.3.  It is any easy fix just by making sure it stays tight.<br/><br/>The band is so pretty and comfortable - unlike the Microsoft Band.  I love my Fitbit!
 If the silent alarm vibration was strong enough to wake me up, I'd give it 4 stars. If the non-band piece wasn't so awkwardly long on my skinny wrists, I'd give it 5.<br/><br/>It also seemed to think I was sleeping while sorting papers for an hour, but I've had that problem with other fitness watches (maybe I'm just at peak zen while doing desk work??).<br/><br/>Honestly, I bought this primarily for the silent alarm (don't want to wake the significant other up, since I wake up at 5 and he wakes up at 8.). The fitness features are just a perk that happens to be compatible with my health insurance's rewards program. I read reviews that previous versions of the fitbit had a strong vibration that never failed to wake the user up. I thought the newer ones would be the same, but, they are much weaker. I sleep through it each time, even for naps. I used to have a Basis Peak, which, unfortunately, is no longer on the market, and that never failed to wake me up.<br/><br/>So, yeah... it's got good features, but the performance of some of those features are less than okay.
 I was very pleased with this device until, after 4 months of use, it would no longer sync to my phone.  Online forums revealed this is a common and widespread problem.  Fitbit's suggested fix is ridiculous.  They suggest completely removing the device from Bluetooth pairing, and re-pair the device to phone, re-booting the Fitbit, while the device is connected to its charger.  This works, but the problem recurs immediately afterwards.  Fitbit obviously knows about this problem, and has not fixed it.  Totally unacceptable.
 Original band broke after a few months.. It is plastic material!!<br/><br/>I work in a kitchen /bakery so I'm always running around.<br/>Plus I wanted one anyway :)<br/><br/>I shower with it on. Dishes. Anything really.<br/><br/>No issues since. My screen is pretty scratched up but that's my fault for not investing in the protective screen (which none looked even remotely useful)<br/>They were chunky and reviews mentioned it was not comfy or worked with many of the different band styles.<br/><br/>I have insurance but it's being tricky trying to file a claim!!!
 Had this for 2 days and so far I love it I have noticed sometimes that the steps get stuck and I thought maybe it catches up but it doesn’t appear to. It doesn’t last long when it does get stuck so no worries. 10,000 steps my first day with it and 17,000 my second :-) it’s highly motivating and I love the step count celebration when I hit my goal step count. Also being able to challenge friends is fun. I thought I had a large wrist but apparently I could have easily gone with the small. I can’t stand things on my wrist so I keep it lose. On the 4th hole I can easily pull it to the last hole.
 I had a love/hate relationship with the Fitbit.<br/><br/>Pluses:  really good, intuitive computer interface.  You can keep track of exercise, track food and match calories to exercise, get badges for fitness/exercise accomplishments, and estimate how high/far you've gone on a hike.<br/><br/>Minuses:  not really that accurate.  Heartrate monitor seems to overestimate active minutes, and underestimate really intense exercise.  The step counter tends to overestimate steps when I'm doing something that involves hands (e.g. housework or, in my case, belaying a partner at the climbing gym).  Hiking, compared both to other people's fitness trackers and known trail distances/elevations, it usually comes in the ballpark, but not stellar accuracy.  (Think within about 20% or so).<br/><br/>Fail:  The band.  The bracket broke on it a month in.  Okay, Fitbit replaced that under warranty free of charge.  Now the band keeps coming off the Fitbit.  Maybe I'm hard on my watchbands, but my cheap Timex watch has gone through exactly the same abuse and so far shows no sign of falling off.  I'm going to switch to a simple pedometer that should count steps more accurately and not come off my wrist
 This Fitbit was cheap and did not work consistently.  Very unreliable.  I bought for my husband to use when he worked out to keep track of his heart rate. Well evidently it doesn’t work when he sweats. The only time this thing worked was when he wasn’t working out during the day. He used for about 1 week before buying an Apple Watch and he hasn’t looked back since. The Apple Watch works very well no matter how much he sweats. I would NOT recommend this product to track your heart rate during work outs. You will be disappointed and waste quite a bit of money in the process.
 For me, If I can't swim with this what is the use. they need to make this water proof.
 I am loving this fitness band. I had purchased a different brand and thought I loved it until I lost it (the band broke). I was sad until I purchased this. This one has more features than my old one did and like that I can see how many steps I have taken by simply looking at my wrist. My other unit I had to open the App to see my progress. The band and buckle is more secure then my old one (different brand) and so far is comfortable. I like the fact that it looks like a watch as well. Would recommend.
 I am in my late 30’s and have struggled with my weight for the past 10 years. I have a underactive thyroid which makes weight loss especially hard. In spite of regular exercise at the gym, I could not manage to lose weight. I bought the Fitbit to take control of my calorie intake and better gauge my output. The app is amazing! I log in what I eat and now I have control. Regular exercise and managing my food intake has resulted in some actual weight loss. I have lost 13 lbs, and still going! Great product and software.
 Hasn't counted flights of stairs properly since I got it. It is inconsistent with counting steps. I have gotten 10,000 steps while driving cross country and spending hours in a vehicle and when I've actually walked on a treadmill or done serious walking outside it has recorded only 4 steps. The Fitbit Charge 1 I had was much more consistent, it just didn't have a decent band. The band on the Fitbit Charger 2 is much nicer but it is only holding a watch on my wrist and not the fitness tracker I purchased. :(
 Since I bough it I always wear it, simply cannot put it down.<br/>There are some flaws like the inaccuracy of your stepping sometimes or the heart rate measurement but when you realize that this is not a medical device but something which helps you to put yourself in a better position regarding your fitness this all goes away.<br/>The notifications work well and for me it is very very useful because I always leave my phone on my desk and with this I can pick up the phone easily and efficiently. Text notifications are also good but the app forces you to choose between usual texts, messenger and whatever but you can only choose one.<br/>All in all I recommend the product especially for a black Friday price I got it.
 The Fitbit Charge 2 HR I was sent is a dud. I fully charged it, read all the blogs, instructions, help sites etc. and it still would not pair.  I could only get as far as entering the 4 digit pin and then it stuck in an endless loop of "connecting". I had to remove and re-add the app numerous times because it was stuck.  I am sending it back.  I love my old fitbit, but wore it out, so needed a replacement.  I will return this one and try one more time. Apparently I am not the only one who has had this problem.
 This fitness band has lasted me a long time and works great! The only issue I have had with it is because I sleep with it under my pillow (my left hand naturally does that). Since I sleep like this I have accidentally turned the notifications off (you hold the button down to turn them on or off). The other issue is I must have slept on it weird because I put a huge dent into the bracelet. I could just replace it but it works fine.
 I've had my Fitbit for about eight months now, and I've about had my fill of it  All I ever wanted was a device that accurately measured my steps, and let me tell you, this device is not it.  It might do 100 other things well, but I have all of those things turned off, so I can't tell you anything about notifications or friends lists or challenges.  What I can tell you is that the step counting on this device is so inconsistent that the manufacturers should be ashamed.  Watch in amazement as you do 1/2 mile and get credit for about 50 steps.  Gaze in wonder as you see your hourly goal at 247/250 steps, and 1/4 mile later you're still at 247/250.  Sigh in disappointment because you wasted $100 on something that doesn't do its basic function accurately.
 Waste of money if all you need is heart rate and steps or miles counted.  Seems like you have to provide a lot of personal information to get it setup.  It syncs with your iPhone, but that's only necessary for sharing via social media.  If you just want some basic information to enhance your daily routine or workout, I think this is too much.  Too much information, too much tending, and too much money. Embarrassing purchase that I will never use.
 Wife loves it! Wears daily, strap wore out quickly but cheap, high quality replacement trio improved wardrobe. Mine was a cheaper, Chinese knock-off, does as good or better, battery lasts longer, does blood pressure that matches the NIBPs at the hospital where I work, looks great, and am happy with it. This is overpriced, doesn't check B/P, has short battery life, and I'm sure these will improve and the price will come down with competition and technology. Not unhappy overall, just can, and did, get a better value.
 i do not have a smart phone. you really need one for this program  in the fitbit to work easily. i then had to order a dongal..which it does not come  with so i can at least do somethings on the computer with it. that cost $10.00. the manuel, which you can only see online because it does not come with one is awful. someone said if they could give it a zero they would...and they were right!!! i have basically self taught myself on it. it does have some good features like the alarm to vibrate  your arm in the morning to wake you up is nice, i like to know what my step count is and how many calories i have burned, also when you go on the computer or phone if you have one, it will tell you how many hours you slept, if you woke up, if you were restless, and how much quality sleep you got....that is interesting. it does alot but i'm not sure how to work/program alot of the features since the manual is so terrible.....
 I enjoy using the fitbit charge 2 but I noticed it doesn't actually track my steps as much as it tracks my are movement. I can stand still in a conversation with friends talking with my hands as I usually do and the steps increase.  I was close to my target steps while cooking one day when the fireworks went off while I was stirring a pot congratulating me for meeting my goal. So I tested it I Held my arm so I could look at the steps increase as I walked from one down the block and the steps didn't change when let my arms swing and looked at the device the steps increased. I say all of that to say it captures any movement with your arms not necessarily the steps you take. maybe I should wear it on my ankle :&gt;)
 I rated this Fitbit Charge 2 five stars because I am enjoying the step up from the Charge HR.<br/><br/>I received my Fitbit last week and have been having a lot of fun with it over the past 5 days.<br/><br/>I know how to treat a Fitbit gently having been the owner of two previous vintages.<br/><br/>Today the rubber slit at the wrist and the buckle disengaged rendering the Fitbit useless.  I am simply sharing my experience, and you should look at this as an exception rather than the norm.<br/><br/>The beauty of my particular situation is that Amazon is replacing the Fitbit "and" the cost of the return postage is on Amazon (because of the nature of the return).<br/><br/>It has now been a few months since I got this replacement.  Regrettably, the wrist band has begun to bubble where the face of the watch begins.<br/><br/>Returns are helpful, and you have to try the Charge 2 for yourself.
 Bought this to replace my old Fitbit Flex 2, which died after about 6 or 7 months.  Unlike the Flex 2, this tracker is NOT waterproof; however on the plus side you don't have to charge its battery every other day as with the Flex 2--the Charge 2 battery lasts nearly an entire week!  My only complaints would be the plastic band is rather stiff and difficult to fasten and remove, also the entire device feels bulky on my wrist.  Oh, this one will display text messages from your phone, also the number of steps and your heart rate, which you might find useful.  As for me, just happy that it's still beating!  lol
 In less that 8mo the band broke and no longer connect to the device. I would have expected more from this product. It was a gift for my husband and he doesnt even used this to work out, it was only used in the house and office (which doesnt include any pysical labor).
 For how much I paid for this watch I expect it to last.  I had to have it replaced in the first year because the battery would last more than 2 days.  I give them credit they looked at my app history and could tell I was right.  Didn't give me any grief and sent me a replacement watch.  Now its been less than a year since it was replaced and I am back to having to charge it every other day.  But I do love the app and features it tracks.  Needs to be waterproof for at least swimming laps.
 I like seeing my heart rate, and steps taken, but this product is pretty inaccurate. It doesn't read stairs well, the sleep tracking is also pretty bad. The thing is actually pretty bulky, as the picture does well to hide its fat belly. It sits up off your wrist like a large school graduation ring on your finger, which makes putting Jackets and shirts on and off a bit of a nuisance. My glass screen came in with an awkward and slight indentation, making putting the screen protector on a hassle that still has annoying bubbles under the film that you cannot get out, I've gone through 5 screens just to get it on the best it could be. That said, I love the competitive challenges with my wife and friends, I like seeing how many calories I've burned that day (which is also pretty inaccurate), and if nothing else, it has given my wife and I a reason to walk a few more stairs/steps a day to get the trophy/badge for a few months. Initially having high hopes about this product, I don't know how long I'll be interested in such a device to be honest...
 I went from a Fitbit Zip to this Fitbit Charge 2 and I absolutely love it! I love being able to change out my bands and being able to track other options like sleep activity, heart rate, stairs, etc that my previous Fitbit did not track. It's comfortable to wear, not to big. I'm so happy with my purchase.
 The display on my first Fitbit didn't work, but Amazon was quick to replace it. The heart rate monitor on the Charge 2 takes the fitness tracker to a new level. I like knowing what cardio zone I am in while working out. When paired with the Fitbit app, the Charge 2 is very useful in monitoring calories in vs calories out. I am disappointed that it does not accurately track distance/steps on the elliptical. I also have not gotten the automatic exercise recognition feature to work, but that isn't a big deal.<br/><br/>The Charge 2 band is about the width of a men's watch. The heart rate monitor makes it stuck up pretty high on your wrist, but I got used to it after a couple of weeks. I discovered that tapping the band just above the screen makes it easier to navigate the screens than tapping the screen directly.
 Hi all, I'm from Singapore and ordered the Charge 2 during black friday sales. Got it at a good price together with a charging stand. Both product together still cheaper than the price of the Charge 2 selling locally. Item was well received as always from Amazon.com.<br/>I have to say I owned other trackers and Charge 2 is by far the best I've owned. Even though others does its job, but Charge 2 does it in so much ways better. Not to mention aesthetically it looks great on the wrist. As for what it can or cannot do I believe I don't need to mention it here as there are tons of reviews (professionally) out there.<br/>So for those living overseas and thinking of buying here in Amazon.com. I'll say there's no worries. It works just fine.
 Have tried everything available on line to fix this, heart rate works very sporadically, doesn't track all stairs. This started less than 6 months after purchase. Since the purpose is to track these things, it's very frustrating finding that the best exercise tracking you get is when you are sitting. I also purchased a extended warranty. Will work that now and get back to you on whether that works any better.
 I liked that the band stayed on (unlike the previous fitbit I owned). I liked that it tracked my steps.  What I didn't like is that the heart rate readings not at all accurate.  I found this out after reporting to my cardiologist that I was getting readings of 135, 145, 155 during cardio exercise. He ordered multiple tests, and that's when I found out that the fitbit readings were inaccurate. After this, I found that the band was coming detached from the main part. Now it won't stay on at all. And all of this after only eight months. I won't be replacing it with another fitbit. UPDATE: I talked to customer service and was told that the fitbit is under warranty.  So there may be a happier ending after I get another band and they "troubleshoot" about the heart rate readings.
 I have been a longtime Fitbit user. I love their app interface, style, and range of features. This Fitbit Charge 2 HR is no exception. My only criticism is with the bands. Although these are replaceable (unlike the older versions), I still expected mine to last more than a few months. However, even though the band did break, the watch itself remained functional and I simply needed to buy a new band. (Luckily, there are so many you find in all styles and colors that I actually like my watch better with the new band!)
 Works great, looks great, charges quickly!<br/><br/>I thought tracking steps was foolish until getting this.  I actually got it because I saw that someone else was able to track their sleep patterns and I wanted to track mine.  Now I track my steps, heart rates and exercise in addition to sleep patterns.  It also links with other apps if you track the same or more info elsewhere.<br/><br/>Tip - you need to have it tight enough to track everything without being too tight on your wrist.  After using it about a month I noticed that it wasn't tracking well.  I realized that I lost a few pounds resulting in my wrist being enough smaller that I had to tighten in one notch to properly track again.
 After many years of use my Fitbit One died and there was no resurrecting it. The Charge 2 had just gone on sale as the 3 came out and so I grabbed one. Had to get used to a wristwatch again is only downside but easier to latch around a wrist than figure how to tether the One. I love the ease of reading the watch face. It feels more accurate than the One. I love how it interfaces with my Galaxy 5 with no effort. Lots of good info is included on the Dashboard. I'm really happy with this fitness tracker.
 Was surprised that I had to set up an app on my computer to do the setup on the fitbit.  But I could not do the setup because it would not charge up.  There are 2 "pins" on the charger and 3 spots on the back of the battery where the charge goes but I could not get a battery icon.
 This fitbit works well, I love all the features.  I ordered on black Friday &amp; opened and wore since Christmas Day.  On Feb. 7th I contacted customer support because the display had faded.  The night before it was extremely bright, like wake everyone up at night bright, and then I could barely see the display when I was outside the next afternoon.  I contacted customer service via chat &amp; it was extremely smooth.  They shipped a new one out to me the next day, Feb. 8th.  Today is Feb. 20th &amp; it should come in the mail.  I've been wearing my fitbit the entire time because it still tracks everything &amp; I log onto the app to get all of my information, but I can barely see the screen in a dark room.  It has continued to fade more and more each day since Feb. 7th.
 Plastic at end of band broke after 9 months and it fell off my wife's wrist and is now lost.  Won't be buying any more Fitbits.  Will consider one of the many knock-offs that sell for a fraction of the price - won't be as upsetting if lost.<br/><br/>Also, before it was lost, had a lot of sync/connection problems with my wife's Android phone.  Very frustrating.<br/><br/>UPDATE: Fitbit customer service is outstanding! They shipped us a replacement for the lost one!  I changed the start rating from 1 to 3 as a result.  Still think they need to rethink the design on the band - there are a lot of complaints of them breaking on this and some of their other models...
 Does what it says on the box and it’s a great motivator. The battery life is the best, all I need to do is to charge it while in the shower or in the car every other day and it would last forever. I sleep with it and work with it.<br/><br/>The only downside is that it counts steps when you move your arm too much, such as putting on your pants, blowing your hair dry, washing and shaking your hands. It miscounts your steps if you move too slowly as well. So if you walk gently at home or at your office, it will not count those steps.<br/><br/>I guess, these smart products all gave their ups and downs, pros and cons. So if you are looking for a product that counts your steps and records your activities and don’t mind it’s not 100% accurate then this is your product but to be honest, there’s no 100%. For me, 95-98% accuracy is great and if it’s only 90%, it’s still gives me all the motivation I need.
 This thing is amazing. It even led me through the Fitbit app to leave a review here! Anywho, I'm a little disappointed it won't show me alerts from my phone anymore, but it is an amazing little device. I put it on and don't even think about it even when I look at the time. It's helping me to be more accountable for my fitness goals and the app makes it even better because it replaced like several others for food, water, and exercise logging. I've tried the forum solution on reconnecting my phone and the Charge 2, but to no avail there is no way it will let me see my texts on my watch again. Other than that, it's worth every bit of the extra $20 I spent the day before it went on sale on Valentine's Day. Get one and get yourself right, if you're struggling.
 I held off on a fit tracker for a long time (my wife and kids have a few different models and generations), but I had been unimpressed with them. This Charge 2 HR has changed my viewpoint. I am REALLY enjoying the features and the size. I do wish it would let me define a day as "wake to sleep" and not just "12:01am-12:00am" as I work out pretty late at night some days.<br/><br/>Pros: Good battery life, comfortable size/weight, good features.<br/>Cons (and it isn't much of one, imo): The included strap is durable, but feels like a clunky old digital watch band. Get the "UMTELE Milanese Loop Stainless Steel Metal Bracelet Strap with Unique Magnet Lock" band instead. The combination is REALLY good.
 This product works about the same as the old Fitbit  Charge HR.  I was a little disappointed that it did not come with the dongle that all the others came with.  I guess they assume that everyone just uses their phone.  Even with the dongle (I am using  an older one) it does not sync very well.  I have had to try as much as 12-15 times before it will even sync.  It works slightly better with the phone app but it is still rather slow. It is good for logging steps and activity although I'm not sure exactly how it determines how much stair climbing you've done.  Some days I keep count better and on one occasion, I got home from work with about 6 stair climbs, walked down the hall into the bedroom and back into the living room and it said 22 stair climbs.  If it is basing the count on heart rate, than I could have a problem.
 I bought this FitBit as a gift for my daughter, who is very active. It already has multiple issues after only 6 months of use!  First of all, a product that is DESIGNED for outdoor use and fitness activities should not suffer from surface scratches. Maybe Amazon is selling knockoff products, but I find it ludicrous that the design manufacturer would not have created scratch-proof glass for a fitbit. The band has already broken, as well. It falls away from the face of the fitbit after too much vigorous exercise. Now I need to buy a new band, after only 6 months of use. Again, I wouldn't be complaining if this wasn't a product that should be DESIGNED to withstand vigorous activity! It's a fit bit with a heart rate monitor!  And I would assume that a brand as large as fitbit would take all of these considerations into account in their manufacturing of this product. Finally, when I went to find customer support for this product, it says customer support unavailable. Why is that? When I purchase an item, I expect to be able to come back a few months later if it does not work properly. Now who am I supposed to contact?
 I am giving 4 starts because I actually loved it. But it had a couple cons also. One being it counts every time you move your hand as a step. I know it doesn’t have another way but I could be sitting all day and I’d look and have 4,000 steps. Also after 2 days of wear I got a large knot on my wrist that was very painful. After reading other reviews and complaints I guess it was from the radiation. I sent mine back and the seller was nice enough to accept. However everything else about this thing is awesome! Loved the sleep recording and the heart rate was nice to know.
 overall happy with the product however 1) the bands run very large. Unless you have an unusually large wrist for a woman order the small! I ordered a L for myself and XL for my husband (the XL was $20 more so OUCH!!....just for a longer band?????)I  based my order on the measurement chart and they were just huge. I had to order a small band (easier than returning the whole thing) and just gave him my large. 2) mine was not new!! Major disappointment to open something you pay full price for and it is used! The outer sleeve was missing from box, all the seals were missing, the charging cord was just shoved in the box, the paperwork was missing, the face of watch had smudges on it.....if I pay for new I expect new! I usually don't complain but an Open box item should be listed as such and offered at a slight discount. I was so tempted to return it! I could have never given it as a gift. See pics.<br/><br/>In the end the fitbit works great and overall very happy with it.  I like the fact you can sync it with your phone and see texts and calls when they come in, you can set vibrate alarms and various other alerts. It appears a bit bulky and this worried me however it is comfortable and I forget its even<br/>there.
 This is my fourth fitbit product and my second Charge 2.  All of the replacements came as a result of wrist band failures.  The last time, the band failed when I was putting on my backpack at the airport drop off.  The band failed, and I walked away.  By the time I realized this, all that was left of my poor fitbit was a crushed mess of broken band and fitbit guts.  I did my research trying to find a different fitness tracker.  This is still the best for my lifestyle.  What I did differently was immediately replace the factory band with a couple third party bands; one for working out and the other a little more dressy for the office.  So far very happy, but I still have lingering fears and flashbacks to the twisted hunk of metal and electronics smashed to bits and so lifeless and broken........
 My wife loves her fitbit products (this is the 4th she buys). My only complaint is that both of our fitbit products (my last model was the Surge) keep failing in quality. I mean, She has been forced to replace her units every 12-18 months because they either fall apart or just stop working. I admit Fitbit has responded as a company has sent replacement units every time we prove their products fail (3 times her devices + 1 time my Surge).<br/><br/>The point is their products should not fail. They should last at least 3 years, in my opinion, or else we are talking about "disposable" products.
 I love it. It works great. I like having the time and though I kept with the original display, it does have different display options. It's easy to organize everything on the FitBit app. I was worried about wearing it with the glass piece on the bottom of my wrist, afraid that the glass would scratch, but it hasn't. The FitBit is super comfy. I saw a few complaints that it doesn't track stairs, but if you read it on the app, for stairs it tracks every 10' elevation as one stair case. I wish that the screen was easier to tap and flipping my wrist doesn't always turn the screen one.
 I don't think I could love my Fitbit Charge 2 more.  I used my first Fitbit HR mostly for monitoring my steps and sleep.  Now that I've graduated to the Fitbit Charge 2 HR, I've started also tracking my water intake, and utilizing the food journal, which I didn't think I would ever get myself to do, but it's so easy to use once you get the foods you eat most frequently entered.  I even ratcheted things up more by getting the Fitbit Aria scale to automatically track my weight and BMI.  LOVE IT ALL, and would highly recommend to anyone, from a serious fitness enthusiast to someone who is looking to get a better understanding of how to care for themselves by increasing self awareness, to a newbie.  It's also great for communicating with your trainer or even a doctor to explain what's going on in terms of food and exercise.  I could go on and on all day, but just get it.  Just get it and start using it and you'll see.  Have fun with it and good luck!
 I purchased this model back in May 2018, hoping to get more "credit" out of my exercise, as I am on Weight Watchers and the two apps work in tandem (which is very nice), so every bit of accuracy helps me get the most out of my daily WW FitPoints goal. I wear it all day and all night, and I jog at least a mile or more on the treadmill every single day, so it gets used pretty heavily (but not as heavy as a hardcore runner, I'm sure).<br/><br/>The watch worked great until about a week ago, when it just randomly decided to stop monitoring my heart rate at times when I need it most, like the middle of a jog/when I'm in the middle of cardio/peak heartrate. This random "cutting out" of the monitor was enough for the watch to stop monitoring an activity (Example: constant 20-minute jog was not recognized, so the exercise did not count toward the Fitbit Weekly goal, and also didn't count on the WW app, etc.) ...I know *I* did the exercise, but there's nothing worse than seeing that "You reached 4/5 days of your weekly fit goal!" on the FitBit app, when I KNOW I did 5 days. :P<br/><br/>Reading comments here make me realize other people have this same issue. I've tried all tips and tricks that FitBit recommends on their forums (and also the tips they recommend on other Amazon comments) to no avail. That said, the watch worked great for 4 months-- it still tells time great, and still monitors my steps, but just the fact that the heart rate monitor is extremely finicky causes me to give this product 3 stars. For the price I paid, it should have lasted longer. My next purchase will probably be an Apple Watch.
 This has been a love/hate relationship. I've had this since Jan. 2018. At first I loved it, really made me more active as I wanted to see those numbers climb and my daily goals met.  It is very comfortable to wear. I like that you can change the band. I like the app and it's compatibility with My Fitness Pal.<br/>However...In April, the screen just spontaniously cracked in 2 places, like it cracked from the inside out. I contacted Fitbit and after a bit of a go around (they are very precise in what they want you to do for them) they ended up replacing it.<br/>Now, even before the screen cracked, I noticed that this tracker is not very accurate. I have taken 8 mile walks with this and MapMyWalk going on my phone just to see how they match up and the Fitbit is at least a mile under and over 1000 steps under what it should be.  I have gone on walks that I have clocked in my car, again the tracker is consistantly below what it should be.<br/>It's very frustrating to know what you actually walk but the tracker is way off.<br/>Now, all that being said, I usually walk at a good clip, about 4 mph, but when I walk with my 79 year old mom we walk about 3 mph. Interestingly enough, it's more accurate when I walk slow.<br/>My son has a Garmin for his cross country and track running and he says it is amazingly accurate. So, for my next bday, I'll be asking for a Garmin.
 It's just not accurate. I've run up and down my stairs 25 times just to get 10 flights. I'm still at 9 and tired as h@ll. I've run up the stairs. I've walked up slowly.  I swing my arms as I go up. Nothing matters. It's just not accurate. I like reaching my goals and can't. I liked my Fitbit One way better. It was really accurate.  For the record, I bought this a year ago but just put it on this week. I've been using my Fitbit one and decided to try this one. I should've tried it as soon as I bought it.
 I am an early adopter and purchased the  original Charge HR when it was first introduced.  The original unit and a replacement both failed when the band separated at the body. A repair band sold on Amazon didn't work.  I also had frequent problems with blue tooth sync.  I was hesitant to invest more money in another Fitbit.<br/><br/>After finding out that the bands were replaceable, I changed my mind.<br/>This new unit is amazing. The band is replaceable. The screen display is incredible compared to the earlier unit and blue tooth sync and notifications work well.  I recommend buying the screen protectors as well.
 Very disappointed that the screen is impossible to see when I am out in daylight.  Expected the notifications I set up to biz the Charge 2, but instead I have to check my email to get them.  I am one of those folks that don't have to carry their phone every waking minute. The time feature is sporadic in working.  Don't care for having to flip my wrist up to read the time.  Talk about obvious, when you're with friends. Hence my displeasure.
 I really like my Fitbit.  While I'm not using 100% of the features, I use a lot of them.  The heart rate is pretty accurate.  My doctor measures my heart rate manually and it always matches what he's getting.  I also love that it interacts with my Weight Watchers app on my phone.  Can't tell you how much it helps me in that aspect.  This definitely seems more accurate than my last tracker which gave me far too many steps just brushing my teeth standing still.  Overall I like the Fitbit and the Fitbit app on my iPhone.
 Causes pain and marks on wrist if worn all day. Fails to register heart rate at all 20% of the time. Heart rate while doing cardio exercise is CONSISTANTLY low by 20-30 beats per minute. Turns out this is a known issue with fitbits. This large of a difference is very unsafe. I noticed that the step counter counts two strides on an elliptical as 12 steps. If you need accurate heart rate monitoring, buy a chest strap heart rate monitor instead of an activity tracker. You also cannot turn of the bluetooth radio, so it's transmitting 24/7. Perfect for someone who needs constant reminders to stay active.
 I bought this thing to use it as a heart rate monitor when on the treadmill. It s very inconsistant and half the time it doesn't work at all. I absolutely would not recommend the charge 2.
 Have had this for 2 1/2 months. My biggest complaint is the Heart Rate Monitor almost always fails when running intervals. Its been pretty good during weight training, only occasionally failing to report an HR or clearly being off when its showing 120 and I am  pushing 170 at the end of a strenuous routine and had to check manually.  For the price I wanted to pay I am happy with this product and am not sure that one twice the price would have been much better for wrist base HRM.
 I've been wearing it for two months already. The battery seems to last very long. I think I charge about once a week. I'm new to tracking my steps so I have nothing else to compare this one to. I have the black band, smaller version (I'm a woman). I find it to be attractive. I use it to track my activity goals for the week, my steps, heart rate and calorie burn zone, as well as water intake, calories eaten and burned and how many hours I sleep. I love that this gadget can tell how many hours were REM, light sleep or deep sleep or awake. And the best feature of wearing it to sleep is you can set an alarm that will silently vibrate to wake you up without disturbing anyone else (ahem.. mommies who co-sleep). The only reason I dont give the Fitbit 5 stars is because when i take my son on our daily 2 mile walk for exercise, it doesn't seem to get all of the steps. I know because I test it periodically by watching the watch screen as I'm pushing our double stroller (Joovy Caboose Ultralight). I either have to push the stroller with one hand and swing my arm with the fitbit, or keep the fitbit in my pocket if I want a more accurate read, which is annoying because I'm missing out on the heartrate tracking feature which is important for me to record in order to get those goals met for recording calories burned. Other than that, I recommend. The app for the fitbit works very well with my Weight watchers app. Also works well with myfitnesspal.
 Tried to set up the Charge 2, apparently, you cannot do so without a 'dongle'.  There is absolutely no information anywhere that tells you this in advance, you find out when you're setting it up on your PC and get stuck on 'insert a dongle'.  Required additional equipment should be divulged BEFORE you buy something.
 Works really well, counts my steps and heart rate better than anything else. The heart rate is especially accurate, my nurse friend has checked a few times and her reading is always about the same. The the strap feels a little cheap and mine broke within weeks of getting it. They were really good at replacing it quickly but I still had to just through hoops.<br/><br/>The BIGGEST NEGATIVE is that the charging cord is sooooo short. I mean I can't plug it into the wall and have it sitting on my night stand. It is super frustrating. I literally had to buy a seperate cable just to charge it. This partnered with the battery only lasting a few days not weeks just adds to the annoyance.
 screen has gotten scratched  bit and the alarm seems to always shut off and not stay consistently on from day to day. is difficult to see when running in sun so have to wait for shaded areas of run or workout to see how i am doing. When exercising, when heart rate gets above 160 the device does not seem to show the heart rate so I get to see what my heart rate is usually after the run when it uploads to the fitbit app
 Does not reliably send messages and alerts from the phone.  So poor I was driven back to my old pebble watch.  Switching between functions was awkward, and the display would not come on reliably when I lifted it to glance at it.  Was useless for telling time, useless for notifications, and the heart rate function was not as useful as wearing a strap during workouts.
 This is the third or fourth Fitbit I have had. They are great and the app is good. The reason I've had so many is because the bands break easily, with no way to repair them. Believe me, I'm not hard on them. I just wear the watch normally except when I charge it. The last time I decided to complain and they promptly sent me a new watch. The band appears to be of higher quality, so maybe they have fixed that issue. Just stay away from their scales. It's a piece of junk and Fitbit won't do anything about it.
 I've had my fit bit for some months now and I absolutely love it it works great for me. I was looking for something to track my steps and work out activities and I love it does great no issues with it and really love the notifications on it I am someone who never has there phone on them and it is nice to be able to get the notifications like text and calls so if it is important I can get to my phone it is not like the apple watch in which you can text or call back through the fitbit, but it works great for me really loving it.
 Just like so many other reviewers noted- the dang thing quit working mere weeks after going out of warranty, and the offer was a coupon- good for 30 days- for 25% off of a replacement. Why would I throw more money away on a subpar product? Literally two weeks after the warranty expired, the stair climbing feature went haywire. Spent my whole day on flat land? 78 flights. Did the infamous Bisbee 1000 route (which involves climbing 1000 stairs)? 2 flights. I had ignored the fact that, in hard workouts, my HR stopped registering, and I had ignored the fact that the text alert worked for approximately 2 weeks and then quit functioning- but this was too much. Now the sleep function has also gone haywire, and the active minutes feature has decided I am ALWAYS active. I bought this stupid thing on September 27, 2017; it quit working mid October 2018.<br/><br/>I’m hoping someone has a suggestion for a more durable product. Fitbit’s poor customer service and low quality products mean I won’t be buying one of these disposable junkers again.
 I purchased the Fitbit Charge 2 back in May and wanted to give it a good trial before reviewing. I have Dysautonomia with a high heart rate, and, unfortunately, Superior Mesenteric Artery Syndrome. This fitness tracker has been everything I need right now. I'm able to track my caloric intake and output, water consumption, weight loss/gain, keep a food diary, connect with others in social groups through the Fitbit app... there's just so much!  My doctor has been able to look at certain health stats just by me pulling up my app. I highly recommend this product.
 Was a bit skeptical if this would motivate and how useful it would be, but I'm a believer. Just the right size for more useful information display, easy setup and navigation, love being able to easily change bands to dress uo, make professional, or more rugged<br/><br/>No problem synching with my BlackBerry Priv (android) though periodically have to reconnect Bluetooth. Not a problem or annoyance.<br/><br/>The rose gold option is a nice alternative and does dress up the look significantly.  Add a metal sculpted band and even can be quite feminine.
 Love, love this fitness tracker. I am so out of shape in the last few years. My daughter encouraged me to try Fitbit. I like that I can monitor my heart rate, as well as steps during the day. Periodically, I use the breathing relaxing feature often. The step reminder really pushes me to move more during the day. I spend hours on the computer, and time fly by. The notifications help me move, and rest my eyes in the bargain.<br/><br/>I brought a second Fitbit as a gift. So far I recommend this product
 Love the way the Fitbit Charge 2  works, but after about 4 months the band started falling off while walking.  It has fallen on the ground several times. Fortunately I have been able to feel it when it does that and able to retrieve it.  It's always the buckle side that comes loose.  I tried to do a return through the protection plan that I purchased with the Fitbit but got no response from them.
 I bought two of these, one for me and one for my daughter.  We love them.  I have a slow heart rate that is normally in the 60's but has dropped down to 46 while I was in the hospital.  Since I have insomnia and take meds to help me sleep I was concerned about what my heart rate was when I was sleeping.  It gives me a weekly update on my heart rate and the hours of sleep that I got.  My fears have been contained as it shows my heart rate while sleeping is in the 60's and 70's.  I can also check my heart rate during the day with just a push of a button.  I have mine linked to my Samsung 5S and my daughter has hers linked to her Samsung 6S.  I highly recommend this product.  I choose the black band for both of us but will probably order some of the other colors of bands.
 I am obsessed with my Fitbits, and was so excited to get the Charge 2. Aesthetically, it's unbeatable - I love the slightly thinner band (compared to the Charge HR), the longer screen, and the colors of this edition. The new charger is a huge upgrade as well. I only have two caveats to my rave review. The first is that my sleep tracking is less accurate than with the HR. It thought I was sleeping while I was studying the other day, and yet the next night it said that I didn't fall asleep until 2 hours after I actually did. The second concern (and the most fixable) is that this screen scratches SO EASILY. I mean, I literally had a scratch on it within 2 days and I didn't do any strenuous activity. Luckily, Fitbit was incredibly gracious and let me switch it out for a new one. I immediately purchased an IQ shield screen protector, and so far haven't noticed any scratches in the new one.<br/><br/>TL;DR: The fitbit is awesome, might have some sleep tracking issues, DO NOT BUY WITHOUT ALSO BUYING A SCREEN PROTECTOR.
 Don't waste your money you will get as far as entering the code then device gets stuck forever at connecting to fit bit.. Giant waste of money, checked online for help and there are hundreds of people having the same issue with this device. Was really looking forward to having this device, would just be nice if it actually worked. DON'T BUY!
 I tried to go the cheaper fitness watch route before getting the fitbit, but that didn't work.  I've had this for a month now, so I feel comfortable reviewing it.  It's a very nifty fitness watch that has few drawbacks.  I like that the heart rate and pedometers seem pretty spot on.  The old watch I had before this assigned me a heart rate, even when I wasn't wearing it... helpful, right?  I like that it stays synched with my phone for email, text, and calendar updates, especially since my previous "tracker" would drop out of sync and required multi attempts to pair the device, which got annoying quite quickly.<br/>As everyone knows, it's a great tool to monitor workouts and encourages movement, but I have to say my favorite feature is the sleep tracking.  I've always known that I'm not a great sleeper, but having the graphs to show when I'm awake, in light sleep, REM, and deep sleep is very informative.  When I sleep well and the sleep tracker confirms it, I do what I can to replicate those particular conditions (i.e., room temp, specific white noise sound, use of blankets, etc.).  It has a vibrating alarm designed to keep you from waking a partner up when you need to get up.  My husband sleeps like a rock (and wore this one night for kicks, which confirmed he's a VERY sound sleeper), but I like having it because it feels more considerate.<br/>The app is very well designed and easy to navigate.  There was an update to the dashboard recently, and I like it as it feels a bit more intuitive than the previous dashboard.  Having the historical date to review and to use for comparison is also very helpful when you're looking to make progress.<br/>The charging cord isn't my favorite, but at least it's a secure fit.  I feel as though a micro usb cord would be more useful, rather than something completely unique and kinda short, but oh well.  I had to change out the original band to the sport band which is more breathable.  Even with keeping it clean and drying it off when it got wet, it started chaffing my skin.  With the breathable sport band, I don't have that concern anymore despite being made of elastomer, too.  Other than those 2 small issues, I've enjoyed having it and feel comfortable recommending it.
 I  like this product for getting pulse and heart rate.  The step counting is interesting, but is based on movement of the hand rather than the feet.  So a step is more of a motion of walking with your arms.  You could job in place quickly without moving your arm and get no steps in.  I  do wish it had a temperature gage.  Instructions for synching it were confusing.  For the record, you need the app on your iPhone to do it.  It would not synch with anything else.  Once synch to the iPhone, the web page is visible.  The Sleep Patterns are interesting, but their explanation of sleep stages is confusing.  I  would like to see what. a normal sleep pattern looks like vs a troubled one someone.
 I LOVE this Fitbit 2 Charge!!  I just purchased a second wrist band!!  I haven't had ANY problems like I did with the Garmin I purchased last year!!  It syncs with my phone app and I can also check my progress on my laptop.  Great fitness watch with lots of extras!!  It is also accepted by my insurance for benefits, discounts, and health rewards!  I purchased the Large wristband even though I have small hands and wrists.  I'm glad I did because I can wear it in several different positions on my wrist!
 Replaced a Charge HR and definitely an upgrade. More stylish, bigger face, and much more user friendly. Has more features as well. I also bought the Milanese link band to class it up over the rubber, and unlike the previous Fit Bit Charge HR the band is easy to swap out..... no tools needed. Better charging system as well.
 While many experts and tech-savvys reviewed this product, here's few points from a regular person who's trying to keep fit and loose few pounds!<br/>Pros: good product, affordable price,exchangeable bands, lightweight, track different activities, product app is wonderful and was delivered in one day!!<br/>Cons: battery life is good but not as long as they claim, GPS works only if you bring your phone (which I don't like to bring during running as I run to escape and be fit), not waterproof (I don't swim much but I hate to worry about it while washing my hand or take it off before showering)<br/>What I wish it has? Well, built in memory to store some music and listen to it thru Bluetooth headset! I can live with the other cons :)<br/>It's a good product that you won't regret it!
 As a previous Fitbit Flex user, I decided it was time for an upgrade.  I absolutely love the features, and it's surprisingly comfortable and easy to forget it's there, even though it's quite a bit bigger than the Flex.  Now the bad:  I should've stuck with my old standby color, basic black.  I love the rose gold, and the lavender band looked great out of the box, but it has discolored around the edges in a matter of days.  It's the edges on the top of the band, not a hygiene issue.  It's dark grey, almost black.  I'm guessing it's a transfer of dye from my long sleeves - it is winter, after all.  But a device that's meant to be worn 24/7 should be made to withstand rubbing up against clothing.  It just looks horribly grungy already, like I've been wearing it for years, not days.  I do not see any Fitbit replacement bands with rose gold hardware, so replacing the band would create a mismatch of metals, which would not be a good look.  And the reason I chose this particular tracker color, at a premium price, was for its looks!  Very disappointed for this reason.  But it works great.
 I bought this for my dad to replace his original Charge Fitbit as I also have the Charge 2 (for just over a year) and like it.<br/><br/>The bands on these do seem to have ongoing issues - the area around the device loosens and creates large gaps. I have had to contact Fitbit twice during the first year of owning my Charge2 and both times they have replaced the bands at no charge after I sent pictures. I believe it is just covered under the warranty the first year so I'll be paying for the bands in the future.<br/><br/>As far as the actual device and the Fitbit app - it functions exactly as advertised and I think it has helped make me more aware of my current fitness/health and may be helping me improve as well.
 I love my Fitbit this is my second one.helps me watch my food and weight.step and sleep is the best.but I will say I put it on Friday and it's Sunday and my battery is dead.so I really think it's just a defected.i got the warranty on it. Fitbit is great.but Amazon I am very disappointed that it didn't come in a day a orders.and  customer service was no help at all.h haddled it poorly.so if u want it fast go to the store.same price.i ordered it from Amazon cause I order everything from them.but not so much now.
 I love(d) this product.  It was easy to use, tracked what I wanted and didn't interfere with my everyday life.  After less than 2 months however, it stopped taking a charge.  I only plugged it in when I got the email from Fitbit telling me my battery was low, which was also a very nice feature.  I thought it may have been the charging cable, so I actually purchased 2 replacement cables and a charging dock station for $10 bucks.  Since none of them worked my conclusion is the Fitbit itself simply will not take a charge.
 Not the most attractive thing in the world, but I have found fitbit to be pretty revolutionary ...I had no idea how little sleep I was actually getting...nor how little I was moving all day. It has really transformed how I take care of myself. I got one for my partner and it has made us very competitive, which is a good thing when it's about your health. I think it is too big, bulky, and dorky looking though...I would rather wear my watch. I bought the small band and it's just barely too small to fit on my ankle. My partner puts his in his pocket because he isn't allowed to wear it at work...it still logs steps, but not heart rate.
 My fitbit Charge 2 stopped work all of a sudden. I only have this watch for 5 months. It worked great then just stop working yesterday even though I fully charge it. Just blank black screen no matter what I pushed but when I hook it up to the charger then it will show battery full. So upset now because it was not cheap for only 5 months of use!
 I used a much earlier clip-on version of a fitbit product and loved it. It helped keep me focused on my exercise goals which, in turn, kept me tracking my food intake, then I managed to wash it and that was that.<br/>I've had my Charge 2 for just at a month now and have managed to lose 8 lbs.<br/>It won't provide you with the motivation to use it, but of you do use it, and take the time to understand the information that it can provide, it's a very effective tool.<br/>I've had no issues with the wristband despite having minor keratosis.<br/>The biggest eye-opener for me was the sleep tracker. It really showed me that despite the amount of time I spend in bed, I'm not actually getting a whole lot of sleep due to restlessness.
 I got this model rather than the Charge 3 because I was on a budget but this one has all the features I needed. The app definitely distinguishes Fitbit from other trackers. It can track your sleep patterns and there's a handy stopwatch on it. I also appreciate how it reminds me that I've been inactive and encourages me to move. The battery lasts about 2-3 days and it recharges pretty quickly. My only complaint is that it's not waterproof. I wish it were at least showerproof.
 I love this watch.  I had it for over a year now and I only take it off when I shower or go swimming. It is very comfortable and I have different colored bands for different occasions.  I love the sleep tracking feature and will help anymore who likes to work out.  I used this when I was in the police academy to help train for my run and monitor my water and food intake.  Too bad I couldn't use it for the actual PT tests.  Great for hiking too!
 This product seems to work fairly well at everything except when you need it most which is when you’re working out hard, and sweating and you want to be able to monitor your heart rate. Once you get even a little bit sweaty the heart rate drops off quickly. It seems that the heart rate monitor system cannot see through any kind of moisture.  I might be working out  for 45 minutes but the last 15 minutes of that it can’t track my heart rate so it doesn’t show on the Fitbit app  that I have been working out at all during that last few minutes.
 I should've read more before purchasing this item. I specifically bought it for counting steps and the counter for charge 2 is way off. I tried changing setting to my dominant hand and setting my stride. It still gives me way too many. How does one get 200 steps going from the bed to the bathroom and back to bed? This thing picks up every single hand moments as as step. Not helpful when I work on a computer and want it to help remind me to get up and move around. I can see other advantages. It's neat that it tell me I have a text.... But that's not what I bought it for and not how it's advertised/
 I learned about the wonders of fitbits from reading David Sedaris' new book Calypso.  Had to buy one right away and I love it.  Even as a watch, it looks so cool.  But now I can't wait each day to see how I did with keeping active.  It really has made me more conscious of my activity level.  The sleep cycle analysis was also very enlightening.
 I LOVE THIS!<br/>I'm so glad I didn't waste my money on an iwatch or whatever you call those things.<br/>Honestly this is all you'll probably ever need. I can view my texts through this, record exercises that I do, and it does what it says it does - record your distance/steps.<br/>I once thought this was a waste of money, but you cant carry your phone everywhere, and it rocks that it is right there on your arm.<br/>I wasn't going to get this too because I thought id look foolish wearing two watches, but it fits me perfectly!
 I wasn't sure if I was going to like something like this, but I wanted to at least give it a try and see what all the fuss was about. I'm not a super "fit" person, I don't typically exercise much, but I've been trying to be more active and this really helps me. Being able to quickly see how much I've done at any point in the day really pushes me to get up and move more, which is great! I love the app too! Would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to be more active, like me, because it's quite motivating. :)
 Stopped working after 14 months of use. Warranty is 12 months. Upon attempting to get it fixed I learned a LOT of people have the same problem of it failing to refresh past a certain date, just outside of warranty. If you were in Europe, you have 2 years of warranty. <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Fitbit-Charge-2-Heart-Rate-Fitness-Wristband-Black-Large-US-Version/dp/B01K9S260E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Fitbit Charge 2 Heart Rate + Fitness Wristband, Black, Large (US Version)</a>
 Bought this to track fitness. It worked for a while. The heart rate works well. But it won't stay logged into my iPhone. Right in the middle of a work out it logs me out, less than an hour after I log in and I lose tracking on walks, runs and bike. This device makes me log in several times a day "for security reasons". This has been going on for weeks with no resolution. Maybe they treat other device types such as Android better. iOS users beware.
 Love this! Works really good and only needs to charge once a week! I’ve had it for 5 months now and it’s still working fine. Would recommend to friends. But just a warning, please make sure you do not have any lotion or anything else on the section of your arm your watch sits on! It will darken your skin giving you laser burn! And might cause pain or burns on your arm! Also please keep the watch and your arm clean! And take the watch off from time to time to let your arm breathe because constant wear without cleaning could cause you to get fungus on your arm! And I know it says it’s water proof but don’t wear it in the shower it’s unsanitary and could cause water to get trapped under the watch which can cause a fungus to form.
 Loving my Fitbit Charge 2 HR!  Very easy to read the digital display, and the battery lasts several days before needing a charge.  I like the button that takes you to different screens instead of having to tap through, like some of the other models.  Being able to choose sport-specific workouts is awesome, and also like that it automatically recognizes some activities.  I like the reminders it gives you each hour to get up and move if you haven't taken 250 steps...sometimes it's easy to sit at your desk and not realize how much time has passed since you got up and moved!  I haven't used the Relax feature much, but it's a nice little tool that helps you to take time and practice some "mindfulness."  I haven't used the GPS map feature yet, but am excited to do so during walks and hikes.  The Fitbit app is awesome!  Tells you all sorts of helpful and useful information throughout the day.  Really comprehensive in that it shows your activity level, sleep patterns, and has the ability to easily track food.  You receive weekly summaries if you want to really compare your progress.  The various challenges you can do with other Fitbit users is fun, but I also like the different "hikes" you can take...when you reach various markers, you get different fitness or eating tips, and the app shows you pictures of where you are on the hike.  I love the Yosemite hikes!  I purchased a metal band for my Fitbit to dress it up a bit for work; makes it look more like jewelry than a fitness tracker. All in all, very happy with my purchase.  Can't really see any negatives!
 One star, the band keeps coming apart on my wrist. Not sure if I’m doing something wrong but will do some research into this issue. I would give it a higher rating but if I lose this item it would defeat the purpose of owning this.
 Be careful about fitbits if you have sensitive skin and/or nickel allergies. I was not aware that it had nickel in the sensor and the band latch, and by the time I figured it out, I had a blister on the bottom of my wrist and a burn? rash? on the top of my wrist where the sensor was. I didn't notice the rash at first, because I thought I might have just had the band on too tight, and it would go away after a day or so when i loosened/adjusted the band. However, when i took the band off to return it, the rash stayed for at least 3 or 4 days. It's gone now, but the skin has started to peel where the rash was. I'm sure the fitbit does a wonderful job, for people who aren't allergic to it.
 It's much more than just a regular tracker, it tracks everything you need plus other items that you don't even imagine!!! I simply fell in love with it, I use it 24 hours a day straight. The interface with my cell phone is excellent, very well designed and easy to setup and customize. I definitely recommend this product to anyone that wants to keep a nice tracking of your health and daily activities.
 I have missed having a Fitbit!!  I has been 2 years and am so glad to have the newest HR 2.  Right now I am going through chemo and cannot exercise as much. But having the Fitbit, I can get my baseline and go from there.  Love the sleep monitoring.  Love the new band, but it is a lot bigger than before.  I had a size small before and it barely fit me, so I ordered a large and it is almost too big.  But I do like that I have more room to adjust the band.  Love, love my new fitbit.
 My wife and I both have one of these. We love the information, although she's now addicted to getting her 'dots' - one for each hour between about 9.00 AM and 6.00 PM that you have 250 steps! Like when we're at breakfast and she suddenly has to walk around outside for a couple of minutes because she doesn't have her 250 steps in. The other information, such as sleep, ability to count calories vs. those used, etc. can really be useful in helping you reach health and weight goals. I especially like the ability to compare my sleep percentages in the various stages of sleep to other men my age.
 I have owned 4 Fitbit trackers in 4 years, and all have lasted a year or less before breaking. My latest, a Charge 2 “special editon,” doesn’t function now that the little button fell off. It’s just over a year old, so instead of fixing or replacing it, Fitbit offered me a 25% coupon so I can buy a new one!<br/>I think I have finally reached the end of my loyalty and learned my lesson. I won’t waste any more of my money on FItbit  products.
 I was planning on returning this because I wasn't able to cycle through the workouts and menus easily.. I initially thought this was a touch screen and it was just severely lagging. However before I decided to return it I checked the reviews to see if anyone else had this issue.<br/><br/>Turns out its not a touch screen and all you have to do is tap it just below the screen on the band, enough to shake it and it will cycle through the menus!<br/><br/>Love this and I love how easy it is to use (After discovering how to cycle through the menu)<br/>Would definitely recommend to any friend.
 I was used to wearing a smaller Fitbit so it took me some time to get used to wearing this larger size.  I really like it now.  I waited quite a few months before reviewing so I'd know that I didn't have any issues with how it worked.  The extra features on this Fitbit Charge 2 HR are worth the cost.  I also bought the Armor Shield to protect the screen &amp; I really recommend it.  Now I've purchased some other color bands too.  That's another reason that I like this Fitbit... I love being able to change my band color.
 The main expectation I've had from this watch is very simple - to track my heart heart during workouts. And at this point after several workouts I can say it's doing a pretty bad job!<br/><br/>First, it constantly jumps between very different values, often doesn't show my heart rate at all.<br/>Sometimes it shows pulse when the I'm not wearing the watch at all, and last by not least - it seems to have some algorithm to show a gradual change in pulse (i.e. some simple "trend" picking) that is also inaccurate. Here's a great example:<br/>A friend of mine wanted to try the Fitbit out, so he put it on (his pulse was 65) and then did some sprint runs. After which his pulse was around 120.<br/>So far so good. But then - another friend wanted to do the same thing. He'd put the watch on and it kept showing the 120 heart rate slowly decreasing. These are obviously false values as he was in a complete rest before trying the watch. And this continued for about 3-4 minutes on which the Fitbit slowly decreased the 120 value until it got to around 60 (which is probably the right number).<br/><br/>Again - my main takeaway is - the heart rate monitor is inaccurate and hence untrustworthy. I've read the manual to make sure I'm wearing it correctly (tight enough, on the right part of the wrist, etc.)<br/><br/>Lastly, it's not compatible with Nike+ App, which is my main running app, but I blame myself for assuming all standard workout apps are supported.
 I was so excited to get the Charge 2 because I've had the same <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Fitbit-One-Wireless-Activity-Plus-Sleep-Tracker-Black/dp/B0095PZHPE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Fitbit One Wireless Activity Plus Sleep Tracker, Black</a> for four years and love it.  But I was incredibly disappointed.  Here's why...<br/><br/>FIT<br/>The Charge 2 may be great for some people, but is incredibly awkward on my 5.75" wrists.  The screen is quite deep and sits so far off the skin that it looks strange when viewed from the side - almost like a handcuff.  And it’s so wide, that it kind of seems as though i’m a kid wearing a grownup watch.  (Also, from a vanity standpoint, it’s not flattering and makes one of the smallest parts of my body look a little chunky.)<br/><br/>But more than that, there's a little green light under the Charge 2 that is not fully covered.  One of its main selling points is the automatic sleep tracker - you have to manually set the sleep setting on the One - but because my wrist is so small the little green lights can show at night.  This may not sound like big deal, but it's freakishly bright in a dark room.<br/><br/>ACCURACY<br/>Unfortunately, the Charge 2 doesn't seem to be anywhere near as accurate as the Fitbit One.  I've worn them both for three days and, without fail, the Charge 2 consistently counts fewer steps than the One. As you can see from the photo, the One has tracked 6,083 steps, but the Charge 2 only registered 5,279.<br/><br/>This may be related to the fact that the Charge 2 is worn on the wrist, as opposed to the One, which is worn on the hip, and the Charge 2 doesn't track steps if the arm doesn’t swing.  For example, if I’m walking and texting, or holding a bag, the steps don’t register.<br/><br/>ROSE GOLD SPECIAL EDITION<br/>I loved the idea of the rose gold with a lavender band - and they look great online - but in person they just look cheap.  The lavender is a sickly grayish hue and the rose gold makes the metallic part look plastic.  I polled three friends and all three agreed.  If you're debating whether buy it or a “regular” edition, please save the extra money.<br/><br/>WHAT'S GOOD?<br/>The heart rate monitor is interesting, as is the sleep tracker, and I love that text messages are displayed.  If those features are important to you, then it may be worth it.<br/><br/>SUMMARY<br/>From the ads, the Charge 2 seems to be perfect combination of smartwatch and fitness device, but in person, it doesn’t live up to the potential.<br/><br/>I'm returning the lavender model because it's ugly and cheap-looking.  I’m going to pass on the Alta because even though it's streamlined, it doesn't offer stairs climbed (which is a feature that even my little old One offers) or a heart-rate monitor.  So what to do?  I’m probably going to stick with my faithful, reliable One until the next generation of Fitbits are released and think other small-wristed folks may want to to do the same.
 Could not get it to connect with laptop or a cell phone in order to set it up. Even purchased a dongle for the laptop, and tried again. Still no success. There were no instructions with the Fitbit, other than to go to a certain web site to get it set up. When you go to the web site, there are no instructions there, other than to download a program. After the program is downloaded, there are no steps to follow. I had to search for instructions on line. I finally gave up, and sent it back.
 First, I know and understand this is not a medical device, however it is also not great for what I thought it would be. It almost never tracks my heart rate accurately if at all. I follow all directions when I exercise about putting it 2 to 3 inches from my wrist but it still doesn't work right. It will say my HR is 75 and the machine I'm on will say 125. I will then stop and count my HR myself and it is 125. It never gets all my steps, or it will update a whole bunch of steps all at once which I still don't think is accurate of what I walked based on my distance. It does track my sleep well but that's about it. My boyfriend's seems to do a better job so maybe mine is just defective or something but I am very disappointed in this product.
 Fourth time is the charm for this 60 year old!!  Interested in becoming a bit more physically active while still enjoying my desk job I purchased a fitness band (forgot the brand!) at my local Apple Store.  It tracked steps, estimated calories burned and sent suggestions to my iPhone related app.  I was a happy camper until after 32 days the band no longer charged.  I love Apple products and their services provided at their local stores, but it wasn't an Apple product so they referred me to the brand's customer service who made it more difficult to fix than the cost.  Heard good things about Garmin so I purchased one and the battery was fantastic, didn't even need to recharge.  Looked good too.  Problem was I couldn't connect it to the app on my phone without consistent refreshes losing prior data.  The Apple Watch came out and I purchased one for myself, my friend and my stepdaughter......as we all love Apple products this was surely the answer to my quest!!!  Nope.  Between the three of us we repeatedly took classes at local Apple stores (free for all!) but between us (an accountant, territory manager and young college grad) we simply found it too difficult to use the physical tracking apps and it had to be charged daily).  Not one to give up I purchased the Fitbit Charge 2 on Amazon.  It is EASY to use, tracks the information I wanted, is fairly priced and the battery very easily charges (and it lasts almost a week between charges!).  Very, very happy with Fitbit Charge 2!!!!
 Works as promised. The bands bite into my skin a little when I'm typing on the computer. They have inspired a little competition between myself and hubby to see who can "win" more steps each day. The only thing I have a problem with is it doesn't tell you the battery life until it's almost dead, in fact once it just died without telling me. Ordered extra bands and love switching them out with my clothing.
 This is the 3rd Fitbit product I have purchased and will be my last. The longest lasting of the 3, (just over a year) but stopped recording HR a few weeks ago. Been through the loop with re-boots, support etc., all to no avail. When the product works I like it very much however we are now 3 for 3 in terms of the products being unreliable in a very short period and needing to be replaced.
 Having upgraded from the fitibit Flex 2 up to the Charge 2, there are a number of awesome features now available to me.  Including run tracking, time display, stop watch, heart rate monitor, and many other features.  Out of the box I was very happy with the upgrade.<br/><br/>Month 1:<br/>The product has performed very well in tracking my steps, sleep, etc.  The wristband has been comfortable enough during my usage and no complaints.  With all of that being said, my screen as cracked 3 weeks into the life of the product!  I have been recovering from a torn hamstring that prevents me from doing anything crazy active that might have damaged this product, with walking being my only available exercise.<br/><br/>Final thoughts:<br/>It is unnerving to have paid over $100 dollars for a brand name product that is supposed to be suitable for an active person, when it cannot seem to keep up with someone in physical therapy.  Working through fitibit, my unit is being replaced, which I appreciate, but it I will not be happy if the same issue persists on a replacement product.  I would recommend that research be conducted into the longevity of all fitness watch options before making a final decision.
 I am one of those people that goes to the gym 5 days a week and didnt think a fitbit would benefit me at all, but one day after looking at videos i decided to give one a try. I fell in love with all the info it provided me with. My first purchase was this charge 2 and gave it to my sster as a gift. The second one was the special edition which I think came defective because the screen wasnt as bright as the previosu one. I have now decided to upgrade to the Ionic! Recommend this to anyone into any type of fitness
 Purchased this during Black Friday for $99. What a deal!<br/><br/>Tracks sleep, heart rate, step, some workouts, text message/calls  notifications.<br/><br/>Compared to the new fitbits and other smart watches, this is great for just fitness tracking and for the right price I'd say this is a pretty neat smart watch.<br/><br/>Downside, is not allowed water resistant, accept NFC payments, and no storage for music.
 I have been using Fitbit charge hr for two years now. It did start to wear down so i wanted to upgrade to a newer model. Fitbit charge hr has its own flaws, you can find them on all over the web but Fitbit charge 2 fixes all of them. They really did listen to customer complaints and act on them. My only complaint about Fitbit Charge 2 would be the lack of a more durable screen glass. Mine didnt get any scratches yet but it seems so prone to get.
 Man, I really, really wanted to love this tracker. It has everything I need it to do--measures heart rate, physical activity, even tracks how many flights of stairs I climb per day. The app is very user-friendly and I loved that I could challenge my son and daughter-in-law who live in another state and also track my food and daily water intake as well as my sleep. All that being said, I am returning the tracker because it does not sit well on my small wrist. I am a small boned person--5'3. The bottom of the tracker is rounded and digs heavily into my wrist to the point of it being very painful. It didn't matter how loosely I adjusted the band, my wrist felt bruised. This tracker works great for bigger boned people but if you have small wrists, it might be painful for you.
 I recently upgraded from the old Fitbit Flex to a Charge 2, and I absolutely love everything about it! The screen is a little thicker due to the heart rate monitor function, but it doesn't really feel bulkier or heavier. I love the ability to count floors now, view my heart rate, and track my workouts using several different workout modes. I also love the fitbit app. There's no additional charge for using it (unlike some fitness trackers), and it's designed very well. The ability to follow my friends and family on the app is very motivating! The only feature I haven't used is the caller ID/phone feature, but I'm not interested in that at all. The Charge 2 is a great value for the price - I highly recommend!
 Bought this for my wife's birthday less than 8 months ago. Laughed at her because she was always taking it off so she wouldn't damage it as I have a Pebble Time I leave on all the time. Noticed, at her desk job, that it developed a crack longways down the middle of the watch. Contacted Fitbit and was told "we rigorously test these, and they don't break. It's not covered by the warranty. Have 25% off any tracker on our website." The features she liked on this tracker are available on competitors trackers - we'll be replacing it with one of theirs.
 I started off with a Fitbit Surge which was rather large but really comfortable. The band started cracking and there are not replacements for it so after two years I wanted a replacement for it and found this. I really like it. The screen is a little different. It's not a true touch screen, you have to tap the watch to get it to scroll through the screens and I found a tip on the Fitbit forum where someone said to tap the band just below the face, and that does seem to work better than tapping the face directly. It's much smaller than the surge and you can purchase replacement bands in different colors from Fitbit or aftermarket companies. I am satisfied and really like the Fitbit products. I would only change if I decide to get an Apple Watch.
 I love my Charge HR 2. Wear it every day. The device and the accompanying software on my Android phone are the core component of my fitness routine. Love the option that lets you long hold the button to record a workout, which will tap into my phone for GPS and show my run/hike on the map. FitBit does so many things right with their devices and software, I won't try to go into it all, but suffice it to say that I love this thing and get a lot of great value out of it.
 I just received my Charge 2 and am already in love with it!<br/>It was easy to set up and sync to my iphone and fitbit account. The instructions are straightforward, yet there a number of style and notification options - along with the ability to tailor the exercise tracking to your own type of workouts.<br/>The black band it came with is very comfortable and gives a sporty look. I'm surprised as the device is quite a bit smaller than I had expected and does not look overwhelming on my wrist.<br/>I also purchased a separate light tanned leather band and it was easy to detach the original and attach the other one. You can easily switch between bands depending on your outfit and the occasion
 When it works it's great but when it doesn't it is useless.  Online with customer support chat right now.  I bought my Charge 2 in late December.  Here it is early May and have had to have the unit replaced once and getting ready for the second replacement.  Same problem both times.  Just quits syncing with phone and/or computer.  Run through all the various fixes suggested and still won't work.  So now I have to take it FedEx to return before they will send me a replacement.  I would never buy another one.
 I would not recommend this tracker. I have had two other Fitbits in the past and loved them. However, for some reason the app does not keep accurate results for this tracker. On many occasions I've received notifications from the app that I reached my goal for the day, however, I haven't actually done so. So even if I did not reach for goal for that day, it will count towards my overall weekly goals like I did. Also, the monthly calendar that checks off the days you met your goal is constantly incorrect. While the tracker itself seems to account for my steps and exercise fine, if the app that stores that information does not work, it does me no good. Also, I cannot get my texts on this tracker like the others. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app, as well as, deleting and re-syncing the tracker. Nothing works. Overall, it has been numerous frustrations since purchasing this item.
 This fitness tracker was clearly designed by idiots who have never used a fitness tracker before. It isn't waterproof so no tracking for you if you're swimming. The display times out while the stopwatch is running, so you better get used to tapping the display non-stop. The display times out so I have twitch my wrist like an epileptic to see the time. All in the name of saving battery life. And how to you power the thing off? You know, to save my precious battery. I've burned more calories tapping and twitching than I do during my workout.
 Exercise tracking feature is horrible. I've used it three times (walking, running and biking) while simultaneously tracking the same event on my Samsung smartphone using Samsung's S-Health. Of the three events only one of them tracked the entire event (running) versus S-Health that tracked all of them perfectly. The other two events only tracked the last few minutes of the events (e.g. the last .31 mile of a 10 mile bike ride). Unclear why the Charge 2 wouldn't have the same results since it connects to the phones GPS other than it just doesn't work as advertised.
 First one lasted about 4 months and had to be reset constantly to work properly.  Fitbit replaced free of charge.  Second one worked fine for a while, then stopped automatically recognizing workouts.  Fitbit stated that I have to select workout on the device and use the elliptical with arms at my side rather than using the machine as intended.  So what once worked automatically now won't work, AND I'm supposed to alter my workout to fit the devolving capabilities of the Charge2.  Now I am having to reboot more and more often.  Garmin, here I come.
 Bought to replace my Charge HR that malfunctioned miserably after meeting the hottub for 10 seconds.  In general, most of the functions are an improvement, however, the Silent Alarm (one of the great benefits of the Fitbit) is so weak that I sleep through it (not the case for my old Charge HR).  I took off 2 stars for the weak silent alarm vibration and I'm considering returning it.
 I bought this as a gift for my wife to replace her old Fitbit Charge that after 3 years (including 1 replacement from Fitbit) was completely falling apart. The old one would sync without any problems. This one refuses to sync, frequently. It could be this device or it could be the Fitbit app. Either way, my wife isn't enjoying this Fitbit as much as she enjoyed the old one.
 Does this Heart rate monitor work? You never know. I contacted Fitbit support. 5 different agents no resolution for an erratic heart rate number. Last contact said, "Wait 24-48 hours. Someone from that speciality will send you an email to fix this one. No worries." In 5 different representives not one could help. Forty-eight hours of  unreliable readings, I sent Fitbit Charge 2, back to Amazon (plus 3 yr.insurance policy).
 Pros: I'm really happy with my purchase of this Fitbit. I'm 22 years old, an avid weight-lifter/runner, but recently graduated &amp; now have an office job that has hindered my ability to get my daily 10,000 steps in. (I've had this Fitbit for about a month now and wanted to wait before posting a review so that I could get really thorough with it, as for some it can be a bit on an investment.) This FitBit gives you hourly reminders to get up and walk, which I love! It also tracks my pace &amp; distance more accurately than a treadmill (as it is set to my height and weight and has a GPS tracker as well for outdoor running). The battery lasts about 5-6 days &amp; charging it does not take too long, which is amazing. I usually charge it once a week during my shower and then by the time I come out it is back at 100%.<br/>Features: You can track/time your workouts (with options you can choose of weight lifting, treadmill, running (outdoors), bike, elliptical, interval workout), it has a stopwatch, alarms (you have to set them through your phone/Fitbit app), tracks heart rate, tells total steps for the day, total distance walked/ran for the day, total calories burned for the day, total floors climbed/day, total "active minutes"/day. It has a "Relax" breathing technique feature (you can pick a 2 or 5 minute breathing session). If you wear it to sleep (which I recommend doing), you can check the Fitbit app and see what time you fell asleep/woke up, the number of times you were restless throughout the night, and the overall quality of your sleep, as well as your resting heart rate in the morning. The Fitbit app is another part that I really enjoy, as it has a dashboard where you can see your daily progress, and look at your past weeks/months. It allows you to add your other friends with Fitbit, and you guys can compete to see who takes the most steps/greater distance, etc. You can also see your improvement over time which I find to be pretty motivating as well.<br/><br/>Cons:The ONLY thing I really feel is missing from this fitbit (and others) is they do not track stairclimber workouts or how many floors you climbed that way. It tracks how many actual stairs you've taken and how many floors you've climbed based on incline, but it does not work on the stairmaster. I don't live in a hilly area or take the stairs too often, so I really wish it included this feature for more accuracy when looking at my numbers. To spend 30 minutes on the stairclimber and not have those steps or stairs climbed count is a little frustrating. Hopefully they will come out with a fitbit in the future that can track this!
 Had it for 2 months now. Luv this thing, combined with the FITBIT App it allows me to monitor everything, sleep, heart-rate, exercise, fitness, and calories in and out. Allowed me to get a handle on my weight and start losing it. Seeing the stats daily motivates me to do a little more and eat a little less. Dropped 17 lbs. in the past 35 days and am able to better track my exercise. The App and this device work seamlessly. Gives me a good 5 days between charging and that takes 2 hours. Its not a smart watch, no calls, no notifications, no texts, and since I have a smart phone, that works for me.
 do not waste your money on ANY fitbit product, brought this item and it stop working right about a year later andd i was told that they would give ma a 25% off coupon off another product, like i would throw good money after bad. this item was $150 and to only work for a year is outrageous
 I had to migrate from Pebble after they announced their sale to Fitbit so in querying my friends who all have varying fitness trackers including the Apple Watch the consensus was Fitbit.<br/><br/>The Charge 2 checked off all the features I need which include heart rate monitoring, step tracking, various workout type tracking, and text message notifications. All work seamlessly and without issue.<br/><br/>Battery life was the best feature of the Pebble as I consistently got 6 days.  Apple Watch requiring charging daily is a non-starter for me as I track sleep. The Fitbit nets me 4 days consistently which is acceptable.<br/><br/>The app is easy to use and intuitive and syncs well to MyFitnessPal
 I upgraded to this Fitbit because I wanted the alarm and the HRM and it was a great decision.  The Fitbit has always motivated me to get up and move.  Since I've retired and have the time to get to the Y and out for walks in the middle as well as sit around and be lazy, the Fitbit gets me up and moving.  I love earning my badges, sounds stupid, I know.  But I especially like getting my heart rate up to where the exercise matters  and getting the vibration that I've hit my 10,000 steps.  This was easy to set up and is easy to taylor to your needs.  I'd highly recommend it.
 I'm in love with my new FitBit Charge HR! I wear it all day, every day and I never have any issues with it bothering my wrist. Easily to clean and adjust when needed. It also sits on my wrist well, not too bulky. It fits nicely under long sleeve shirts/jackets. Purple is a huge bonus (it's my favorite color!). I do wish it were water-proof; I do a lot of hiking and back-packing in the summer so taking it off before I jump in the creek is always something I have to be careful of. It's accurate at calculating my steps and other stats, and I love all the extra features. My favorite is turning on the exercise mode during my yoga classes, it's a great way to keep track of my heart rate and duration of my class.
 Better than expected. For those that require a light heart rate monitor with essential features in at small package, this is it. If you are a more professional and require more features, move to the ionic model or somewhere else.<br/>I have another HRM with more features but I can't always wear the chest strap so I prefer this.
 OMG ..... could not be more inconsistent in performance - especially sleep tracking.  Sometimes it tracks detailed sleep, and sometimes it's just general "awake" "asleep" .... and then sometimes it records 3 hours of sleep when I slept a full 8 .... and then most recently it recorded NOTHING for 3 nites.  I have it on right, it's charged.  It's been an amazing waste of money.  I'm so disappointed.
 When battery goes dead you cannot reset time, etc without logging in &amp; syncing. AND BATTERY GOES DEAD A LOT!  Do not buy this unless you have access to device used to sync it ALL THE TIME. Right now fit bit is 6 hours off because i’m in different time zone than yesterday,  it was already wrong in my home time zone because battery completely died, and it will stay that way (6 hours off)  until i get home because i do not know my password ....... I will give away when I get home to someone with more patience....to someone I don’t like.  And btw, activity monitoring isVERY QUESTIONABLE. When I cut grass-riding mower- Fitbit thinks I’m biking..but it’s good to know that I use more calories riding a lawn mower than walking or jogging ;-)
 Fitbit sent me two replacements because my sleep mode didn't take all my sleep if I was awake between. The customer service was excellent! I did finally get one that tracked my sleep; however not my stairs climbed. I had to return it, unfortunately, because the button you press to check activity, put pressure on my skin, causing my arm to get bruises. I bruise easily, so I don't know if this would happen to just anyone. Other than that- great tracker and excellent service!
 I'm super disappointed in this product. I had the Flex and really enjoyed tracking my steps and what I ate. I lost 12 lbs! I wanted to update to something that served multiple purposes (tracker, watch, heart rate etc) so I bought this. I absolutely loved the design but when I put it on, it tracked 90+ steps before I had even gotten out of bed! No way. So I ordered a replacement and the same thing! I never had this problem with my flex so I'll be going back to that until I find something that actually works. $130 for a product that isn't accurate is a waste of time and money. I wanted to love this but I can't.
 I bought this Fitbit in August. It was great for about three months when all the sudden it stopped working and would not turn back on. I contacted Fitbit and they sent me a new one for free, but when I got it three weeks later it would not pair with my phone.  I did everything to make it work and it won't pair with my laptop or phone.  I can't get my money back or a different one, so buy an Apple watch instead or anything else other than Fitbit.
 Update 3/16/2017<br/><br/>I am very happy with how Fitbit handled my issue.<br/>Fitbit's customer service department proactively reached out to me, then discussed the issue, and replaced my Fitibit.<br/>To make one thing clear, Fitbit's warrnty does not cover "normal wear and tear" from average daily use of the product.<br/>Of course, my argument was that my particular case doesn't fall into that category.<br/>After Fitbit's review of my claims (I had to send in a photo of the product with a random number I had to write down and include in the photo to verify proof of ownership, and proof/date of the purchase), they decided to send me a replacement.<br/>However, Fitbit's decision to send me a replacement was not because they agreed with me on my assessment of the device (meaning the product would not be covered under warranty) but it was their good will gesture to keep their Fitbit members happy.<br/>Fitbit definitely earned my loyalty through this experience and I will purchase more Fitbit products in the future.<br/>After my experience with Fitbit's customer care team, I would've actually considered Fitbit products even if their final decision was not to replace the product.<br/>Why?<br/>Because we all know how difficult it is to reach someone who is willing to communicate nowadays from our own experiences.<br/>At least I know that if I have problem with Fitbit's products or software in the future, I know that I will get a timely response from a live person rather than some auto-generated responses that have nothing to do with issue on hand.<br/>I give this product 5 stars (4 stars for functionality, and an addition star for the excellent customer service).<br/>Also, I am purchasing screen protector this time (as I recommended in my original review) to make sure my replacement fitbit will not experience the same issue.<br/><br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>In terms of functionality, I would give this device a 4.<br/>However, this device is a scratch magnet!<br/>I do wear it every day but I am very careful with my gadgets.<br/>Apple watch, which I wear on my left wrist every day, actually had few incidents where I accidently hit it against stairs or walls so I wouldnt have anything to say if it ended up with scratches but amazingly, not even a light scratch yet.<br/>Fitbit, however, has numerous scratches when it was on my right wrist and most of the times it was protected under my sleeves.<br/>Im starting to think that it even gets scratched by your ordinary clothing materials, which definitely is not a good sign for a wearable device.<br/>Just don't take my word for it. Simple google search with "fitbit screen scratches" will show how common this issue is and the biggest problem is that Fitbit considers this normal and will not replace it even during the one year warranty period.<br/>They do not use sapphire or gorilla glass but a simple hardened plastic, which probably is the reason why it scratches so easily.<br/>You would think they would use some sort of scratch resistant material for the extremely small screen they have to cover for price they are charging but no.<br/>If you couldnt careless about your device being easily scratched since functionality is the most important feature to you, by all means go ahead and buy this product.<br/>But if you are like me and scratches bother you, consider other options.<br/>If you are absolutely set on buying Fitbit product, buy screen protectors to minimize your chance of scratches.<br/>But dont come back and say you werent warned when u see numerous scratches on your Fitbit and have no idea how you ended up with all those scratches.
 I have been using an older version of fitbit and loved it,  unfortunately a rogue wave got me while dipping my feet on the ocean , I was so sad but excited to upgrade to another model,  I have never been so disappointed. It arrived and I had purchased more bands to change them out. I upgraded the software and charged it. Walked around and looked 10 steps only registered,  I thought wth I walked at least a 1000 so went online tried the reset, researched and found that I wasn't the only one,  thousands saying it didn't register your work out.  So with a heavy heart it's being returned as we speak and I now have to find another one, so very upset as my last one lasted 2 years with n0 issues but me being stupid and forgetting to take it off. Bad show fitbit you need to fix this for me and your other loyal customers.
 Loved the fitbit (great user interface and smartphone app) until I did my first "real" workout with it. During the workout I couldn't get any reading for my heart rate. I talked to the coach at the end of the session and she said the fitbit doesn't work when there is sweat between the skin and the heart rate sensor... I went online and saw other people complaining about the same flaw. What's the point of a fitness tracker if it stops working when you want it most? I'm returning the product, ordered a Polar A360 instead which seem to work fine on sweat.
 I bought this as a Christmas gift for my sister. She loves it. Her best friend was so envious that she ended up buying one, too! It not only does the basics like tells you the time and date, works as an alarm, counts your steps, tells your calories burned, and tracks your sleep; but also can alert you of texts, calls and calendar reminders if synched up via Bluetooth to your smartphone. The band appears to be quite durable and is a dark purple color. What better gift can you give than something that promotes good health!
 I purchased this to replace my old Fitbit Charge HR and I love it.  I actually bought the Garmin Vivosmart HR+ to compare it to the Fitbit Charge 2.  I returned the Garmin after one day. I am not sure why I ever questioned my Fitbit. The Fitbit is more compact in size, had a more accurate reading for my heart-rate, and has a far superior APP. I only wish they would make this thing waterproof like Garmin has done.  But on the flip side, that could be why the Garmin was larger in size.  I recommend this to anyone looking to track their health.
 I use this all the time, and for walking and during Krav Maga classes. The band regularly comes off from the watch. It snaps but eventually breaks and will not snap back on. I’ve replaced it numerous times. Also, where you fit the band into the little strap, there’s a bump there that makes it so difficult to get it in. They should eliminate that. I’m not sure how accurate it is. Something I get steps credited when sitting down and moving my arms.
 When opening the box I noticed what looked like a scratch on the screen. However in direct light, it became clear this is actually a crack that extends further down and deeper. Returning in hopes of improved quality control on the next one.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Better construction than Charge HR 2<br/>Exchangeable bands<br/>Longer battery life<br/>Fits better and more comfortably than the Charge HR 2<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Quality control issue with the first one sent to me, hopefully this does not represent an underlying issue<br/>Sleep stages not working - Even though they advertise this feature and their blog states it is live, it is NOT!  This will likely be fixed shortly, but should not be advertised as a current feature.
 I love this thing but in the first week I did develop the rash.  If you're wise, I would suggest buying a different type of band for it.  I got a stainless steel and the rash cleared up and now it looks like an expensive band.  The data was close to my Garmin and s band.  It syncs with no so it's a no brainer purchase.
 The Fitbit Charge 2 has lived up to the hype that has been surrounding the product. If you are considering purchasing this product, you should want to improve yourself and track what your body is going through each day. It came in nice, easy to open packaging. You will be able to figure out how the device works rather quickly. You can also buy replacement bands which are easy to switch on to the device. For the price you pay, the Fitbit Charge 2 offers just as much in return.<br/><br/>The Charge 2 is durable, yet comfortable on your wrist. It was an adjustment as someone who doesn’t usually wear a watch, but you will soon forget it’s even on your wrist. The product is water resistant, but does need to be taken off when you shower. This is not a hassle as you would take off a regular watch when you shower anyways. The Fitbit Charge 2 can track heart rate, sleep, exercise, calories burned, and much more. You will be able to set and accomplish goals for yourself. This product allows you to improve yourself and you will be motivated to stay active. The features that the Charge 2 has are so helpful. You can do 2 or 5 minute breathing exercises to relax. You can choose whichever exercise you want to do whether it be weights or running, and the Fitbit tracks the workout. There is a Fitbit app that you will download, at no cost to you. This app lets you see the data your Fitbit has collected. The app essentially lets you run the Fitbit from your phone. You can receive call, calendar, and text message notifications right on the screen. There is also a stopwatch and an alarm system that wakes you up with gentle vibrations. The battery last about 4 to 5 days, and charges within a half hour to an hour. You will find that the Fitbit Charge 2 pushes you to better yourself, and challenges you daily. The daily step goal is 10,000, and you will find yourself trying to reach that goal and get better each day. You definitely won’t find a better device on the market for the right price than the Fitbit Charge 2.
 I actual really ticked off. I bought this on March 8th 2018 and it is now July 23rd 2018, the band is already broken where it hooks to the watch part. I haven’t even taken the band off of it! I would expect for the kind of money I paid for it that it would last well beyond a year... not just a little over 3 months!!! So now I’m stuck with a cheap band until I can order a good one. I should have just got an Apple Watch like I was planning to begin with.
 We have had 2 Charge 2's stop charging after less than a year of use. Now my Ionic is also failing by counting 1 step per second while sitting on my table and flashing on and off. Tech support was Zero help all 3 times. I will never purchase another Fitbit product and I highly recommend you do not waste your money.
 Great produce and fast deliver!<br/>This is my 4th Fitbit.  This time I choose the Fitbit Charge 2 and I love that the bands can be changed out. We seem to be extra rough on the bands. Husband liked the look of my new on so I upgraded his Fitbit with several bands too. We are now accessorizing our Fitbit's with a collection of different wrist bands for any occasion work, play or formal.<br/><br/>The first three were the Fitbit Charge HR  and we loved them but the bands design was lacking in stamina and we seemed to damage or wore the bands out. Not sure if it was us or a design flaw.
 My 2nd Charge 2 stopped charging. I re-ordered a new one and it also refuses to charge. It’s not my charger as I used the brand-new charger given to me. Buyer Beware!
 I really liked my original Fitbit One, and at first I liked this one, however there are problems with it. It stopped alerting me when texts were received, then it stopped giving me the ten minute warning when I didn’t have enough steps for the hour. I can never get the wrist bands to lock on all the way. It will pp off if I bend my wrist a certain way. I’m afraid it’s going to come off and get lost. For what this cost I expected more.
 I've owned the Fitbit One for over three years, and it has been on a downward spiral for the past year after I accidentally sent it through the wash and is now at the point where it can't hold a charge for more than a couple days. I decided it was time to upgrade. I like the One's clip style, since I can hide it somewhere on my bra and forget about it, but it seems like Fitbit isn't particularly interested in upgrading the One to something newer and better, so I decided to try a wristband style instead. Plus, I felt like trying something different.<br/><br/>I've had the Charge 2 for a few days now, and overall I am very happy with it. I stopped wearing a watch a few years ago and sort of missed it, so it's nice to be able to look at the display whenever I want. I love the notifications when you get a text or a call. (However, I wouldn't call it a smartwatch, so if that's what you're looking for I'd look at an Apple Watch or something similar.) I am a small woman, and I was worried that it would look huge on my wrist. It turns out it's somewhat bulky, but doesn't look too big. I like it. Another quick note on its appearance: I was hesitant to purchase the blue one because I kept seeing two different shades of blue one Fitbit's promotional photos, one relatively muted and dull (my preference), and another bright electric blue. If anyone else is curious, the real color is somewhere in the middle - not quite as dull as the muted blue, but definitely not electric. Overall it seems to at least not clash with most of my clothes.<br/><br/>Here are the cons I've discovered, keeping in mind I'm comparing this against the excellent Fitbit One:<br/><br/>- The step counter doesn't seem as accurate. It also seems to not count your steps well when you're holding something like a cart or a suitcase in your hand. The One seemed very accurate; this one may only be somewhat accurate.<br/><br/>- The heart rate monitor is weird. It sticks out the back and presses into the back of your wrist. You're supposed to wear it pretty loose, except when exercising, but it still feels a little bit uncomfortable sometimes. Also, the constant green blinking light in the back took some getting used to. It mostly doesn't show because it's pressing against my arm, but sometimes it slips a bit and then WHOA GREEN LIGHT. I don't know how weird this is to other people, but I'm a bit self conscious.<br/><br/>The pros:<br/><br/>- It really does look cool. Plus, removable bands mean you can dress it up however you want. I really love having a watch-like device to wear again.<br/><br/>- I am addicted to cataloguing my fitness/activity stats, and this does it pretty well. The Fitbit app also seems a bit more advanced when it's paired with a Charge 2 instead of a One.<br/><br/>- Sleep tracking is way better on this than on the One for three reasons. 1) No extra band you have to carry around and not lose and replace when it wears out. 2) It automatically stops and starts - you don't have to press the button to start recording or remember to stop it when you wake up. 3) It can't slip out of that pouch in the band in the middle of the night because it doesn't need a pouch.<br/><br/>- Notifications are amazing. I don't miss calls anymore, unless it's on purpose!<br/><br/>Having used both the One and the Charge 2, at this point, I think I prefer the Charge 2. It has a lot more useful features and it looks great. If you're on the fence about the clip and the wristband style, my advice is to decide which features you want the most, knowing that both the devices are better and worse in different ways, and then go with whichever does more of what you would find useful. You really won't go wrong with either.
 Love it. Pushes me to be healthier and the app tracks everything. I log my food, water etc. I have to say that the screen scruffs really easily. That is like the only problem I've had. I bumped it against the wall once and bam there's some marks. I bought a screen protector that should be here today so hopefully that will solve this problem. But other then that I have been thoroughly enjoying it! (Also don't mind my steps for the day lol I woke up really late and haven't been moving like at all😂)
 I finally bought a fitness tracker after months of debate. The software on the Fitbit makes it worth the money. I bought a replacement band for $10 at the same time and glad I did! The silicone band broke out my wrist in a few hours. I also spent the extra $9 on the charging stand. It makes charging much easier.<br/>I have nothing negative to say about the Fitbit Charge 2. I read the reviews prior to purchase and the extras made the choice ideal
 Does not consistently track sleep. Sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn't and the times that it doesn't there's really no explanation. It's uncomfortable for me to wear night and daytime so I only wear at night. Band feels hot to me. The tracker is supposed to wake if you turn your wrist to look at it and it doesn't. I have to try 3 it 4 times and by then I'll just hit the button. Since this doesn't work I am on the fence about even keeping it.
 The information is helpful but the Fitbit itself to me is uncomfortable.  I'm not trying to be negative but I actually have sore spots from where what I think is a very large watch head has impacted on my wrist/arm.  I've tried wearing it tighter and more loosely but this affects the heart rate and having it slide widely up and down isn't enjoyable.  I am not used to wearing things on my hands or wrist so this may be an issue related to me, but if you have small wrists with less fat you may find it uncomfortable.
 I ❤️ my Fitbit. It's cute and sends me an alert when I need to move. My friends and I easily keep each other motivated with weekly rankings and competitions. I like how my reminders from my calendar also populate on my FitBit, along with phone calls and text messages. It only needs to be charged once every few days and you'll receive an email about 1-2 days letting you know you should charge your Fitbit. Receiving trophies and badges periodically also helps me; I am very competitive.
 Wife love it,wears it every day,she was getting exasperated as she wasn't getting close to her 10,000 steps a day,she's at the gym every day except Sunday at 6:30 sharp.<br/>Then a friend said Have you put it in your SOCK?,my wife said NO,so yesterday she did, and by 11:00 a.m. she was already past 5,000,compared to the usual 2500.<br/>We like it because it's wider and easier to read than the Alta she returned,if  your as serious a workout nut as she is, I would make sure(ladies) to order the large band for your ankles and not for the wrist.
 Over-priced, over-designed version of the Fitbit Charge. I have the original Charge. It's great. I bought two of these Charge 2 to give as gifts. They're loaded with unnecessary features that make the unit too bulky. The old snap-on wrist band sometimes -- rarely -- pops off. But the new style clasp is bulky, ugly, and uncomfortable.<br/><br/>Otherwise, the Fitbit can really change your lifestyle if you use it. I'd never give mine up, though I hope my original Fitbit Charge lasts a while because I really don't want this new version on my wrist! The people I gave these two as gifts like and use them, but don't like the bulk and awkward clasp.
 I received it right away and in mint condition. I have now almost 3 weeks with the fitbit charge 2 and it does all that it says. Keeps me more focus on my workouts which gives me more stamina to workout harder. I have learned more about sleeping habits in many ways. I have add myfitnesspal app to it and helps me on my learning to eat healthy foods, which goes well for a new changing lifestyle. It is great and much more than I expected overall and would recommend to anyone. So glad to get an opportunity for a good price when I did.
 I love the fact that I can track my activity and water intake. Unfortunately, the issues I've had with the wristband drops the overall rating tremendously. I purchased the fitbit in October 2017. It began to fall off my wrist after about 8 months. The company replaced it in September 2018, within the one year warranty. Now only three months later the same thing is happening with the replacement band. I've nearly lost it multiple times in the store. They will not replace their defective product because the original warranty has expired. This certainly impacts my loyalty as a customer.
 I originally had a fitness band without a front screen- I was missing out! Over the past year I have worn it almost every single day! I am very petite and have small wrists but it does not look overwhelming! The color goes well with everything! The heart rate monitor seems pretty accurate and I love all the badges you can accumulate through the app.  The only downside is I have to be careful about getting it wet. Otherwise Perfect!
 The bands don't last very long on these and eventually they run out of warranty.  I went through 3 or 4 bands while under warranty, it was a bit irritating. Hopefully they resolved this issue with the Charge 3; however, I upgraded to an Apple Watch and never had a problem again.
 I have recently started to try and get more active .To lose weight and be healthier.I was already using my cell phone and my fitness pal app.to track my activity diet and set goals Dr recommened Fitbit to coordiate with app.I really researched different bands and prices .Came down to 2 Fitbit options.I chose Fitbit charge 2.decent price .got the best reviews.It came quickly.I love it .charge lasts several days.Easy to charge.Easy to sync with MyFitness app.I wear it everyday .I am rn in busy Ed.I would recommend this to anyone.
 I am writing a bad review only because my FitBit Charge 2 came without a charger in the package. The package was completely sealed and I was unaware what to look for when opening the box. I now have a dead FitBit and do not want to purchase a charger due to it not being in the box like it was supposed to be.
 Has been doing well so far. Waterproof and seems to be quite accurate. Only complaint is the battery life of 3 or 4 days. Can't expect too much from a device that is quite literally tracking your heartbeat 24/7 and counting your steps.
 I love this Fitbit watch, I have a much more expensive Smart Watch, but I wear this instead and around the clock. So far its been about 4 days and I haven't had to charge it since I fully charged it when I got it. I wear it all day and all night, its nice and small, and comfy to wear, it doesn't get caught up on stuff like my other watch does. I like how it notifies me of Text Messages and Phone Calls. Love the sleep monitor part of it, as well as linking up with friends and family to motivate us to walk more... Great Watch
 I like my Fitbit. I don't love it. They have not perfected the technology yet, so it really counts arm movements not steps. For instance if I walk while carrying or pushing something so that my arm is stationary, it won't count those steps. But then it counts "steps" when I'm at the sink washing my hands or doing other tasks where my arm moves and my feet are stationary. Also I've found that it isn't perfect about steps during workouts. The other day it said I climbed 8 flights of stairs during a 1 hour dance workout on a flat floor! Still, it gives a good idea of how much you're moving. My favorite part is the sleep data it provides. It's the first thing I look at each morning!
 I had the original Charge HR for two years and wore it up until the day this one came. Man, what a difference! I love the bigger screen on the Charge 2. I noticed that the size large band is longer than it was on the original charge hr. I probably could have bought a small. I love that it prompts me to get up and move around a bit every hour. I have a desk job and you can lose track of time. I haven't tried any custom bands yet, but am happy to have the option, which wasn't available on the last one. The fitbit challenges with your friends definitely motivates me to spend more time working out. I am very happy with this purchase.
 I love my Fitbit.  It works fantastic.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 stars, is because I got a rash from the band.  I don't have sensitive skin, so this was unusual for me.  I bought a Maledan wristband here on Amazon, and I love it, so now I'm happy with my Fitbit.
 Just upgraded from previous Charge HR. I am an apple fan. But for wearables Fitbit has the best price point and absolutely required features that do not distract you constantly. New version is extremely practical if you can use it. I must admit I do not use primarily for tracking steps, heart rate or sleep. I am more than dependent for Calendar, call, silent alarm and message notifications because with Fitbit I don't have to keep my phone handy all the time. This version has covered pretty much everything I desired in last version. I hope Mr. Tim cook buy this company and release a small form factor, less intrusive wearable in parallel to apple watch.
 Great purchase! It is encouraging me to get more fitness into my day. I am taking the stairs more so I can get the extra steps. I also like the sleep monitor function and seeing how much water I'm drinking daily. You can use this as much or little as you want. You can add your weight and monitor your diet as well. I also like the Relaxation function. You can keep everything private for your own use or add friends like a social network. I purchased different color bands to coordinate with different clothing also.
 This is so great!  I used to have the Charge HR and it ended up wearing out, owing to it puckering at the seams.  This detachable model is amazing because it doesn't do that.  I love that I can switch out the bands.  The heat rate technology is right about 90% of the time but can sometimes overestimate my heart rate.  I love that the beginning of text messages pop up on here because I can discretely see what people are saying or who is calling or texting without getting my phone out.  I have one big issue though: I'm a leisure cyclist and I wish it logged my cycling.  You can turn on and off the exercise mode but other than that, it doesn't recognize the bicycle.
 I can see that this is going to become a permanent thing in my life. I used it to give myself a reminder to get up and do something, but more importantly to sleep track. It's fairly accurate, to my manual tracking of some things I know I did. Then I was more than a little perplexed as to why it told me I did more than hundreds of steps. I'm sleep walking! That explains when I had a cup that I clearly washed and stored yesterday, being in my living room in the morning. It's part embarrassing but funny to learn this.  I better stop sleeping in the nude, in case this sleepwalking thing has me walking outside of my apartment. lol
 I do love it. The notifications worked for a day and then stopped. My last Charge HR did the same thing. Maybe I'll call them--not sure it's worth the trouble. I would have bought it with or without the notification feature, but it would be nice if it worked.
 This was a replacement for the first Fitbit that I actually won in a drawing a few years ago.  That was my "training" Fitbit.  I like this one better because the screen is larger, it sends me text notifications from my phone, and basically, I understand how it all works a little better.  (I'm a senior citizen...LOL)  You can be fanatical about keeping up with how many steps you are walking, what you are eating, how much you are sleeping, and how much fat you are burning.  Or, you can be like me and just want to see what my heart rate is, be aware of how much activity and sleep I'm getting, and get a little vibration to remind yourself to keep moving.
 I'm obsessed! I spent a little extra to get the rose gold, and I felt a little guilty...but when once it arrived I knew it was worth it! I am new to health tracking so I've enjoyed playing with the features like sleep tracking and active minutes. It has definitely made me want to work out more! I like being able to see the trends so I can change them. I wish the app had more and a wider range of challenges, especially solo ones, to keep you more engaged throughout the week. My biggest pet peave is the battery life...it lasts about 3.5 days for me, but I hate taking my watch off and missing tracking steps or sleep! I wish it lasted closer to 7 days, I hope they can get that on the next gen.
 My wife loves this thing. It has a lot of features packed in this easy to use device.<br/><br/>Pros - iphone sync capabilities allowing you to monitor health stats and even view incoming text messages directly from fitbit charge 2.<br/><br/>Con - it's not waterproof which in my opinion makes this useless (for me not the wife - 5 stars from her).<br/><br/>Overall I was extremely happy with the fitbit charge 2<br/><br/>Best buy had the gold plated one for the same price $116 plus tax and shipping.
 The Charge 2 does everything it said it would and is a great motivator to get off the couch and move! It's fun connecting with friends for challenges through the app too. My only complaint and the reason I can't give it 5 stars is that I have to restart my phone (Samsung S7 Edge) almost every day to make the bluetooth connection click so it will sync with the app. It's the only way to kick it back in to gear. It's like when I'm not using my phone at night (while I'm sleeping) connectivity is lost. None of my other bluetooth devices are affected, so I know it's the device and not my phone. Other than that, I'm very happy with the device.
 I use lots of technology and apps. I love incorporating data into my workout. I had the original Fitbit Charge HR, but had to have it replaced twice due to the peeling band issue (Fitbit made it very hassle free though - great customer service). Still it felt like a waste to have to have a whole new unit sent to me just for a bad band. The Fitbit 2 not only resolves that issue with the interchangeable band (and one that does not appear to peel yet), but it gives some cool upgrades, like a bigger screen and much nicer readout. Plus it tracks more data and is said to be more accurate on heart rate readings. Very much worth it.
 I love this fit bit! I did a lot of researching before buying, but I am SO GLAD I bought this!<br/>It tracks my sleep and exercise perfectly. Even if I sleep for just an hour, my fit bit will track it pretty accurately. I am definitely an exercise enthusiast and I feel so excited to work out! I also love the "relax" feature which helps with deep breathing training. I got the purple band because it was one of the less expensive options, and I love it a lot.<br/>I recommend a fit bit to anyone who would like to track exercise, sleep, and/or heart rate! The app also lets you track weight loss/gain, water intake, calories (if you want), etc. One charge usually lasts me 2-3 days. I usually charge it while I shower because it is not water proof. Do not use to swim.
 Works fairly well. I previously had the Fitbit One. It was very accurate.  I wanted something to keep an eye on my heart rate and something that looked a little smarter than the One.  I am pleased with it overall.  The steps seem to be a little off, compared with the Fitbit One. I assume that is because it is on my wrist and is influenced by arm movement.  I walked normally for exactly 500 steps. The Charge 2 showed 481 steps.  I've test the heart rate monitor and it is fairly consistently 2 beats per minute low. I don't have a problem with that.<br/>Not perfect, but none of the electronic pedometer/wrist heart rate monitors are.  I would recommend it.
 Saw the sale on Black Friday so I gave this one a try. I am very satisfied with my purchase! I love the fitness tracker, heart rate monitor, the sleep tracker, and the gps option. It is the first tracker I have ever had and it does all the basic things I want. Very pleased with the features and functions of the watch. I also like the app which keeps track of all my health data. This is a great inexpensive fitness tracker! I highly recommend it for anyone just beginning to gain some insight into their health.
 I looked forward to getting a fitbit for a couple of years.  I wanted the one that would track HR without the extra paraphernalia.  I thought this was it.  And it did track HR and steps too!  However, there was one major flaw.  The band kept falling off.  This was intermittent and more of an annoyance, so I started to look for a new band.  I actually picked out a couple of options and was deciding which style fit me.  But, never ordered as the fitbit fell off while I was walking downtown.  I had walked about 8 blocks from one location to a restaurant.  As I took off my jacket, I noticed it was gone.  I retraced my steps checking with store clerks and looking everywhere.  I was not able to locate it.  I missed most of dinner with my friends who I seldom see - which is really the worst part of this story.  I loved everything about the fitbit charge2 except for the fatal flaw of a poor band connection.
 My husband purchased this for me for Mother’s Day!  I love it for several reasons, my heart beat goes up now and then and when I feel it’s up I can check it on my watch.  I like to check my progresss of sleep.  I can not check my steps as I use a Rollator purchased from Amazon.<br/>Called Amazon and the C S told me it would count my steps using the Rollator, I was disappointed in that respect.  All in all I love my Fitbit Charge2.
 While I like the fitbit itself and wear it daily, I am not happy with it's longevity.  Shortly after a year of having it, a crack appeared in the middle of the screen.  While it is possible there was a mild impact, as I've worn it daily for the last 6 months, it was never hit hard, and in general I have been a gentle user.  The crack has continued to grow side to side.  Customer service offered a 25% discount on a full replacement, and it is not possible to replace just the screen glass.  The function is still fine, so I hope it will keep running,  but I won't be buying another one if the only recourse is to buy an entirely new one when the glass is so easily cracked.
 NOT WATERPROOF.<br/>Ordered the Charge 2 when my Garmin Vivosmart HR quick syncing properly The vivosmart was great when it worked, but was always finicky Bluetooth syncing. I am use to wearing a tracker full time - outdoors, showering, swimming, hot tub etc etc. So that was the first shock, I did not realize the charge 2 is not waterproof. - hence 1 star off. Hopefully the charge 3 will be. I really like the form factor and features of this watch, don't want the ionic etc. The fitbit app/interface is much better and this thing syncs the way they all should. The band is large enough and comfortable.
 I am very disappointed in my Fitbit Charge 2.  I had a small Fitbit that I was always losing in a pocket or left it on the dresser or sink and thought the watch type might be better for me...WELL, it doesn't keep track of going up stairs like it should..they have reset it once...it doesn't even show the window for stairs most of the time...so if you really want to keep track of your steps and exercise...don't bother.
 I got this because my wife got one and she wanted to compare our results. This great because it tracks your daily steps and exercise. It has an app for your phone so you can link everything together. This even displays your heart rate. Only draw back, it doesn't always display when you turn your wrist to look at it, and it also seems to count steps while I drive. It's not a lot, but by the end of the day, the steps are not 100% accurate
 I would not recommend this. At first everything seem to work well, but after a month of use, I noticed that the heart rate sensor still detected  when I take the watch off for several minutes or even longer. Also, it was difficult to track my fitness progress with the app because so much is automated and I found it difficult to manually input data. When working out, the HR sensor does not work due to sweat. The sleep analysis is interesting, but with the other issues, I’m doubtful of its accuracy.
 Overall, the Fitbit is a champ.  I've never had issues &amp; their customer service has always been amazing.  I stepped away from the Fitbits for a bit because moving back to Michigan &amp; I did not want to feel bad for keeping myself in sloth mode over winter haha.<br/><br/>The biggest downfall for me - my wrist always breaks out into rashes.  My wrist is small enough to have the small size, so that is what I had been using.  This time, I ordered a large in hopes that having it be that much more loose may help with that's aspect.  The manual does say to keep it as dry as possible.  Easier said than done in humid, hot weather! Now, even with the looseness, my arm is breaking out in rashes, not just my wrist!! I was hoping I wouldn't have to invest in a different band on top of the hefty price I already paid. If you have sensitive skin, definitely be careful!
 I was ready to return this Fitbit Charge 2 because I thought it wasn’t giving correct stats. One morning it said I climbed 11 flights and I thought wrong, until I counted it up and it was right. I compared step tracking with 3 devices and learned that nothings perfect but, close enough to know I did meet my challenges. I love that when I get messages and calls on my phone the fitbit notifies me. My wrist measured 6-3/4” and I got the small. Fits perfect with 3-4 holes left to adjust bigger. I flipped the band around so the face would rest on the top of my wrist more flat. I cancelled the return and glad I did. Love it.
 Lost my Fitbit charge HR anddespite yavung issues with that watch a few times, I decided to purchase another upgraded version. I haven’t had any issues thus far and the people that I know that have this particular model have not had any issues either. I love that it shows my text messages on the screen and the battery life of over five days. I also love that I can replace the wrist straps if I ever need to. I find it to also provide accurate information on my sleeping habits and steps. The 2 or 5 minute relaxation exercise provided on the watch us such a fantastic feature as well.
 This is a very neat little device. Goes above and beyond the standard pedometer function as it keeps track of several aspects of your daily activity (some of which you need your paired smartphone for). I love the text message previews so I can review messages I receive and determine their priority... this feature is very handy in work meetings and whatnot when the family is blowing up your phone... the sync'd calendar event reminders have also saved me a few times with things that have slipped my mind. But overall, this is a very helpful device in many ways, first a foremost with helping you set patterns to live in fuller and more healthy lifestyle. I definitely recommend it. I did knock down a star because I have had a few technical glitches with it that I was able to easily locate and resolve on the Fitbit website, but they were inconvenient enough events that I feel 5 stars is a little TOO MUCH credit.
 It monitors how you heart recovers after exercise and give you a rating whee you stand in your age group.  Monitors your sleep and graphs your deep, REM and light sleep and hours slept. Of course it tracks how many steps you take in a day...The amercan heart association recommend 10,000 steps per day. The product is exactly as described and was shipped promptly. Love it....
 After around 2-3 weeks, the heart monitor has already stopped working. I tried resetting the watch along with other suggestions from FitBit's online help. I did love the watch before that point, but this is a deal breaker for me. I have never had an Apple product fail on me, and now I'm wishing I hadn't been such a cheapskate and decided against the Apple Watch. The main component I wanted on the watch was the heart rate as it determines zones and can even help with sleep suggestions. I lose all of those benefits with the watch being defective
 This is my first tracker, and I like it a lot.  However, it does not sync well with my Moto Z Play.  It worked for a while then stopped.<br/><br/>Worked fine on a Nexus 5 (my previous phone).  So, I'll be rethinking when upgrade time comes around.  Though at that point compatibility might not be an issue, if new watch has GPS.<br/><br/>So five starts for watch's overall design.  Minus two for incompatibility with a pretty mainstream phone.
 Every night around midnight, the darn thing vibrates and wakes me up letting me know I met a goal of some sort. My notification settings are set to OFF in the app, and on the fitbit itself. I am very knew to this thing, I've only had it for 4 days so maybe I am missing something. If someone could help me turn this OFF, that would be GREAT! I'll update this review if I find a way to disable this feature.--<br/><br/>**UPDATE**<br/>I found the setting to turn this off. It's hidden in the section where you can customize your stats. Phew!<br/>Now to the review. I have a few (minor) complaints.<br/>The band. I find it hard to slide down the little "tab" that holds the band into place when you want to take it off. It has a notch on it that sticks in one of the holes on the band itself. So it doesn't slide down freely when you want it too.<br/>The size. I do think it's bigger than what I had wanted. Maybe it's because my wrists are so small, I don't now. But I think it really sticks out. Also, I find that I need another size setting right in the middle of where I have it now. The size below that is to tight, and the size I have it at now seems to slide around too much. Maybe it's my particular wrist size and not a common issue.<br/>For the first week, it really hurt to wear it. Right in the middle of my wrist where the heartbeat led lights are, it was sore. Like a bruise feels. But I guess I got used to it because it doesn't hurt anymore.<br/>I've had this for a couple of weeks now and so far, only one time yesterday I had to restart the tracker (and my phone) because it wouldn't sync. Weird. I hope that doesn't become a common issue for me.
 Admittedly, I've only owned one other tracker, and that was the Charge HR 1, which I liked. I recently upgraded to this model and I love it. I have a relatively small wrist (I'm a woman) and the fit is much better with this than the first. The watch face is larger, clearer and has more useful functions. I actually slept with it on last night and I'll probably continue to do so (something I quickly stopped doing with the first). I like the Relax feature - it actually put me to sleep the other night. Also, the additions workout choices are an improvement.
 I've had one of these before, and when I broke it I tried all the cheap alternatives before finally coming back to this. WARNING: DO NOT GET DRUNK AND DUNK YOUR HAND (WITH THE FITBIT ON) INTO AN ICE CHEST WITH WATER IN IT. It stops working and you'll hate yourself. But I got smart and made sure I got the protection plan.
 I have been using The original fit bit charge for over two years and found it to be basically satisfactory for exercise purposes and for its low price The charge 2 is a decided improvement  and far more appealing and practically useful than the original one .I decided to get the charge 2 because the Wrist band started falling apart and the design did not make it possible for a replacement to be available  so far after about 3 weeks of use I am tremendously satisfied with the Looks,the comfort of wear,the ease of operation and readability,improved charging mechanism's and the technical support .I will give it a five star hands-down!
 I edited my first response to 4 stars. The Fitbit worked fine for 6 months and then I could not charge it. But after going on to their website I found that you have to reset the fitbit if the battery gets to low. I did that and now it is working fine. It should be written in the directions that are sent instead of having to go online to find out how to reset it.
 I have used it for 5 months now and its just amazing, battery last from 7 to 14 days depends how much you are using it. Personally I am using it daily from 6 am until 5 pm in week days in my working day to track me activity during working hours and gym. I am satisfied with the product except one thing which why I dropped one star, The rupper belt is sticking into my hand when I wear the watch and remove it, somtimes even if I moved it it will stick in my hair but this is not a big deal for me, just want to let you know to consider this before buying (if it really matters for you).
 What I like most about the fitbit  is that it motivates me to get in the 10,000 steps per day, 10 flights of stairs and lets me compare from week to week what I have done.<br/>It's great that it has a heart rate - but it is far from accurate.  I wear a chest strap monitor when exercising and there is a drastic difference often times between the chest monitor and the fitbit.  Chest monitor 135 - fit bit 84.  So I don't rely on this.<br/>Overall better than pedometer for motivation.
 Bought this to replace same model which stopped working suddenly. My only problem is that sometime I have to put it in charger to get it to show my walk on exercise days on the “dashboard”, which was not the case with my first one.  Minor problem and  I am still pleased with it. Fitbit keeps improving their “dashboard” info. I love being able to set watch for a backup alarm.
 yay! replaced my old decrepit 1st generation Fitbit HR with this one. size is perfect. love the different screen choices for time. appreciate in-depth sleep pattern analysis. wish it was waterPROOF &amp; not just SPLASHproof. quick to charge &amp; lasts 5 days with constant updating. recovering from TKR &amp; this helps me get moving...again. wish better colors were available (other than gunmetal or rose-gold for $30+ more).
 I have loved my Charge 2! Recently, I noticed the battery was draining quickly and I wasn't getting a HR reading. I tried restarting a few times, cleaning the sensors with a little rubbing alcohol, updating and syncing. I decided maybe I should just call the company. I'm not one to complain but I figured maybe they could get me on the right track with trouble shooting. I chatted online with a rep and they discovered through my user email that the battery was in fact draining too quickly. They sent me a new one free of charge!! What??!! I figured if anything I'd get the run around and jump through hoops with a BS limited warranty. I am so impressed with their customer service and the fact that they stand behind their product! This just doesn't happen anymore. I decided I would buy one for my husband too based on this experience. Thank you Fitbit 😊
 I had a Fitbit Charge HR for about three years with no issues. Then, I upgraded to the Charge 2 and about 6 or so months the joint connecting the band to the tracker breaks. I was issued two replacements by Fitbit because it was a manufacturing defect, however, it would break. I eventually stopped wearing it to sleep to make it last longer and it still broke. Then I used solely during workouts but it still broke.  Luckily, I bought the insurances for it so instead of buying a new one, I'm buying something else. I've been using Fitbit for years and it is sad to see such a poorly made product. I tried everything to keep the tracker together, Krazy Glue, Gorilla Glue, tape, hair bands, modified watch band worked fairly well but I shouldn't have to do that. If it can't stay attatched to my wrist its useless.
 Was 5 stars until 1.5 years later its screen decided to go crazy and display characters in reverse and having a grey bar right through the middle. Fitbit customer support was no help. Offered a 25% on another fitbit except the ones I actually would of wanted to invest more money on to. Bottom line if you want an activity tracker that will last you 1 to 1.5 years this is it. If you want something for the long haul look somewhere else. These things are disposable.
 I bought this for my husband after he tried to purchase two other products. He wanted something that tracked his heart rate when he exercises. He absolutely loves this. He is very pleased. It helps him to exercise more, by telling him when it time for him to get up and move if he’s been sitting or lying down too long.
 It was great for about 8 months. Then the band started disconnecting from the watch (this was the original band as I’d not used the interchangeable bands feature). Today it happened again, causing my $179 Special Edition Fitbit to randomly fall off my wrists somewhere, lost forever. It’s great that Fitbit added the feature to change bands but they didn’t make it with enough quality to stay on your write securely.
 Worst company ever! Watches stop working, won’t even charge... after many calls to the company, they replaced it and the “new” one and IT also stopped working after 2 months... called Fitbit and there is “nothing they can do, but we are feel to purchase a new watch”  Really!?!? The same thing happened with my daughter’s Ionic AND my son’s Ace..... Fitbit has lost our family as customers and it is really sad because I was a very loyal fan for 10 years
 Worked great for a year and a couple months, but then completely crapped out. (would've given it much higher stars earlier.) Screen wasn't showing completely, and heartrate wasn't being monitored correctly/consistently. And now it won't hold a charge. Says it's completely charged but then screen is blank shortly after putting it on. I fell like a product this price range should last more than the year it's under warranty without having to buy extended warranty. So I definitely suggest doing that if you want to buy a fitbit product. Also had trouble the band and had to be sent a new one after 5 months, then my replacement one broke another 6-7 months after that. So I just used my knockoff band I'd ordered from Amazon. Very disappointed. Should've tried something else.
 Was charging via my computer (with their charging cable) at my desk for about 30 minutes - piece was at 50% and had moved to 60%.  Had a popup on my screen that a USB was trying to connect to my system so I went to grab my fitbit to see what was up and burnt my finger badly on the back of the piece - it was hot enough to start to melt my band that it hit when I threw it down because so hot to touch.  I called Fitbit and they didn't seem shocked and said someone would get back to me via email in 48 hours.  Please be CAREFUL with this piece!  I usually charge mine at night and am so glad I didn't or I could have caught something on fire it was unbelievably hot!  I have the blister to prove it. I just bought this piece in January.
 I love Fitbit step trackers! I was looking for a new Fitbit tracker to also double as a watch. This tracker was on sale at the time I started looking at the different models. I love it!! It is the perfect size on my wrist. My wrist is exactly 6.5” and I bought the small. There is plenty of room left on the band. I buckle it in the 5th hole from the tracker with 5 holes left till the end of the band. I love all the features this tracker has!
 Not happy. I bought the Small size and am a medium-sized woman. The watch is uncomfortable because it's too long across my wrist and bites in, even if I make it looser. The band is poor. It is very hard to undo with one hand - very sticky, and I'm pretty sure it will rip soon. But the bigger problem is that the stats are incorrect. I went downstairs to my desk and in two hours it thought I had walked 1,200 steps. The heart rate jumps around from 70 to 105 - when testing my heart rate against it, it was off by 30 beats per minute. I wear it at night because I wanted it to track my sleep. The bright light comes on periodically and wakes me up - not sure what trips it. This is going back to the store.
 DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY. My wife struggled with and then I tried to help her with her Fitbit charge 2. The problem is that her iphone syncs with other devices but not the Fitbit Bluetooth. This happens way too often and I am beyond frustrated! Their websited is not helpful. And there is no way to contact this company. Every email address for them fails. What is with this company?
 I LOVE my fitbit.<br/>I would buy a protector for the screen though because the screen can get scratched.<br/>No problems with it thus far- and Ive had it since Black Friday.<br/>07/04/2017:<br/>UPDATE- within the first 7 months (few weeks ago) the band came up with 3 bubbles.  I chatted with customer support and after a while I was able to get another band (same exact one) and with no additional warranty.<br/>IF you buy this fitbit DONT buy it with this band.<br/>it forms bubbles on the band.<br/>The fitbit is still great, but that band...NOooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
 Anybody debating whether or not to get this thing....do it! I have another fitness tracker which is good and I like it. But this thing is inspirational. You can set it to remind you to get up and walk every hour. It even sends you congratulations emails if you hit goals both weight wise and step wise. I lost over 5 lbs the first week and increased my steps per day by 500% within 1 week! Easy ap that goes with it. Syncs nicely to your phone.
 After only a week of use, I am officially addicted to my new Fitbit Charge 2! I am extremely happy with all of its features but I only gave 4 stars out of 5 because it stated that this particular Fitbit would track sleep cycles. However, after receiving the product, and doing further research, I found out that this feature isn't available yet! (Supposedly it's coming in a future firmware update) Had I known this in advance I may have went with a different model. Aside from that, I am happy with this one!
 Love this fit bit. I'm not one to have the latest and greatest when it comes to technology and I hate how rubber band watches ok but since I bough this I have not taken it off. I track every work out and keep up with my fit bit friends and enjoy the steps challenge. This watch has been instrumental in weight loss fir me. I've only had it a few months so I can't attest to the quality. I hope it lasts unlike my iPad. The battery on this watch stays charged forever and charges quickly. This is a you need. I would not upgrade to another model. Worth every penny
 The Charge 2 works great and does a good job tracking everything.  My only issue is with the band size.  I am a big guy and could only find small and large options when I ordered the Charge 2.  I could not find an XL option when I ordered, I may have missed it.,.  The large fits, but is very snug.,  It took some looking to fins extra-large bands, and I ended up buying them.  Putting the XL bands on and they are huge.  I had to combine the two - one large band and one XL band to make it work.  Apart from the bands, it works great.  Only time I take it off is to shower.
 So far, so good! My husband and I both got one for Christmas. I've noticed that it will not log your steps unless you are slightly swinging your arms (at least this is what I have found).<br/><br/>We ordered the IQ Shield to protect the screen from any scratches...I would also recommend this!<br/><br/>Also, Rose Gold color is more copper but still pretty.
 There is so much to love about this little 'bit' of technology! The reminders, funny little statements, the keeping of all my steps per day, and most helpful of all, the summary of my sleep patterns! This latter is turning out to be one of the most beneficial aspects of this little gem. One thing funny about it is that it thinks I am riding a bicycle when in fact I am walking a treadmill at a 15% incline with a loaded backpack on my back. Some things even technology cannot account for! But as a training aid, this is really a good companion!
 The plum color is very nice. My daughter started making sure she got 10,000 steps right after I gave her this as a gift. Eight months after I bought it, she told me the band would not stay fastened. I went to fitbit customer service, started a chat with "Mary Ann" and she had me send a photo. They shipped the replacement band immediately. I would recommend their customer service to anyone. It was far simpler than I anticipated!
 This is as promised.<br/>You do have to do some customizing for exercise settings for best accuracy.<br/>Fit is as expected.<br/>Charging is easy, just plug it in each time you are in the shower.<br/>The phone call and text notifications are awesome.<br/>The sleep tracker is great. I know it is not 100% accurate, but it great information for averages.<br/>My wife loves it, and is not a techie gadget person.<br/>This is the best overall fitness tracker for someone trying be healthier, or lose weight.
 I bought this for my grandson. He wanted to track his running, but it does so much more. First off, I am pleased to report the app does work with an iPod. This was a concern before buying, but he said it works fine. Not only can he track his running, heartbeat, etc., but if he wears it while sleeping it even tracks his sleep pattern! Very nice product.
 Love, love, love this, upgraded from Flex, this gives way more information.  Particularly like how it records stairs/inclines, and picks up more active minutes than Flex.  Records heart rate and gives information related to cardio health.  Especially like the feature that buzzes me to get up and move.  Amazon carries rplacement bands and love the selection of "designer" bands to match my mood and outfits.  Highly recommend the Fit Bit Charge 2!!!
 I give it a 2.5 stars. I spent two months researching Fitbits, and I decided on the Charge 2. I'm not happy with my choice. It counts movement as steps. I can reach my daily goal by sitting in a chair and swinging my arm back and forth. Plus burn 3,800 calories doing so. If that's the case, my weight should be shrinking, not expanding. I don't eat 3,800 calories in a day! It's tracking my sleep incorrectly. A few nights it tracked 3 hours of sleep. Wristband is uncomfortable. My husband has the Blaze, and loves it. I have 2 more days to decide if I want to return it. It was a waste of $150.
 I'm living with mine because I like the sleep tracking and all the other misc tracking it does during the day.  It seems pretty useless when I'm spinning because it wants to cut my heart rate in half.  I had to change the settings to workout and did the move it up three fingers from my wrist, but the heart rate tracking is still hit or miss with high heart rates.  Other than that I like it
 I got this for my Father (and one for my Mother) so that they could just have an idea of their heart rate, and see how much or little they are moving.  They had previous versions of the Fitbit but none this nice.  They love it and I see them comparing their steps to each other constantly.  It has also helped them to realize how well or how horribly they are sleeping.  This has been helpful as they can see why they may be feeling run down even though they thought they got enough sleep.<br/><br/>I did set it up for them in the app and did all the set up so that they only had to put it on, and I walked through choosing their watch face that they wanted and made sure everything was to their liking.<br/><br/>I own many fitness devices, and for the money, I feel as though this is the one that offers some of the most bang for the buck.<br/><br/>They love that it vibrates to inform them of a call or text message as they are both realtors and sometimes have to have their phone on silent, also with my mom being deaf in one ear she can now know when she is receiving a phone call without people telling her her phone is ringing.
 I have hade<br/>Fitbit blaze<br/>Fitbit charge 2<br/>Fitbit Alta<br/>Fitbit charge<br/><br/>The blaze is still my favorite Fitbit but the charge is a close 2nd. I find the charge 2 to be better on runs due to the light weight and stays in place far better. If your looking for a sleeker activity tracker I would say get the charge 2 if you want full color and just a tad better overall experience get the blaze. If your looking to almost hide your wearing a tracker get the Alta I wear my Alta with. a watch on same wrist when going to events were I need to dress up
 I owned two previous Fitbit HR Charge and loved them, that is until the wrist bands detached from the face (there's wiring in the wrist band that connects to the face/electronics)!  One lasted 8 months and was still under warranty.  Fitbit's service dept. was great!  They sent me another in no time. However, that one lasted only 18 months!  So having done some researching and missing my Fitbit, I decided to order the Fitbit Charge 2<br/>-- I LOVE IT!  It has all of the stuff that I liked about my old Fitbit HR Charges plus some.  And most important, the wrist band is completely separate from the face (electronics) and I can change it out to fit my outfit. Not to mention, the face is larger and I don't have to put glasses on to read it!.
 This is to replace my original nearly 3 year old Fitbit Charge after the band started coming apart at the device.  I like this new version and its upgraded features from the original.  Bigger display.  Much better band and replaceable if needed.  The heart rate feature I really don't need, but its fun to watch.  The android app migrated all my data from one device to this new one with no issues.
 Loved it for 3 months - until all the vibration notifications stopped working - apparently a very common problem.  Re-setting and other suggested fixes didn't help.  Online help refers you to call in number and it's so backed up with customer problems, you can't even wait - it's just always "all circuits are busy, try again later"  - every time!
 I bought this to replace my ChargeHR, whose watchband was starting to have lots of troubles. From that standpoint, it's great. I like the new band, and I can replace JUST THE BAND when it wears out.<br/><br/>The rest? Not so impressed. Software is still pretty poor, and it still does not reasonably turn on the display when I bring my arm up, but it does most of what it is supposed to do.
 Does what it says it will. I especially like the Fitbit App that allows you to track your activity and your sleep. Nice watch, but it is Big Brother... keeping track of your activity level almost seems creepy. The watch will give you reminders to get up and move... especially nice if you are trying to maintain a certain activity level every day (such as 10,000 steps -- it will tell you how many more you need each hour to maintain your goal for that 24-hour period).
 My old Fitbit One was more accurate - I'm told by customer suppt that all the Fitbits that are worn around the wrist will not track steps unless there is a certain type of arm movement (i.e, won;t track while pushing a shopping cart) -- BUT I really, really enjoy the features!  It tracks steps well enough ... a bit hard to consistently keep up with friends in some challenge groups, but it does motivate me to move.  I really appreciate the bluetooth connect to my phone to get alerts on messages and notifications!
 It works well IF you're looking for an all day calorie tracker or something to remind you to move or give you some kind of sleep tracking. BUT if you're looking for something to give you an instant accurate HR reading during a workout this is DEFINITELY not what you're looking for. It loses your HR very easily and depending on what exercise you're doing can effect it also. I use to use a HR chest strap and thought this could replace it... boy was I wrong! I have done a side by side comparison using both at the same time and the HR reading were drastically different but calorie burn was kind of close.
 This is the best product that I have ever bought myself! The screen is the perfect size and the band is extremely comfortable. I only ever take it off to charge while I shower. I love that it displays your daily data as well as incoming phone calls and text messages- ideal if you can't have your phone on your person. This is my favorite model because of the screen size, GPS tracking, and heart rate monitor. It's also so much cheaper than a smart watch.
 The whole purpose of having a device like this is to track how you have been doing with sleep and exercise. The way it keeps track is by syncing with your phone or computer. The syncing stopped working after 9 months and I tried everything that was suggested  to get it going again. Nothing worked and i tried many different ways and all it did was raise my blood pressure. DO NOT Buy this device.
 I am an apple guy through and through but this Fitbit charge 2 I am enjoying greatly. First the Fitbit is so much lighter than the Apple Watch. Second the battery is still full after wearing the Fitbit for 72 hours. I can track my sleep where on the Apple Watch I really couldn't. Sure it doesn't have apps, free updates, but it tracks what I need, tells the time, tracks my heart rate more accurately and alerts me when my Apple phone does for phone calls texts calander alerts... sadly I do like it better but when Fitbit comes out with an upgrade it will still most likely be cheaper than Apple Watch 3. The only thing that could make it better if it was water proof or resistant.
 I haven't used it enough to give it a detailed review but I like its looks and display.  It was fairly easy to change the band from the included silicone strap to a metal band.<br/><br/>The only issue encountered so far was that the laptop app failed to download and install software updates on the Fitbit.  The update process stalled somewhere in the middle 3-4 times until I installed the app on my Pixel 2 and the update successfully installed from there on the first try.
 I decided to back up my new year's resolution by getting this Fitbit Surface 2. I really like the simple, minimalist design, It pares well with the downloadable app for my iPhone. The black silicone wrist band is good quality, however, it's a bit difficult to easily remove due to the protruding nub that locks the band adjustment in place. Finally, I do question the recording of my walking "steps" and how accurate it is. I sit a lot for my job and the Fitbit shows I've walked hundred of steps. Very generous, however, I think my arm movement is being counted.
 I enjoy the Fitbit and find it very useful; however the screen already has scratches even though I've only had it for a few days. I called Fitbit customer service, but they do not cover these types of damages (so I was told) even with the protection plan. If you opt for this, make sure to buy screen protectors. I'm not even sure how it got the scratch, since I'm not super active.<br/><br/>The app isn't super intuitive to use, but it's pretty nice once you figure out where everything is. Over all the product is and useful, but I wish they made the face more sturdy since it's meant to be used during exercise and basically worn all the time.
 Second one purchased. This one was for my mother. Allows her to track her steps, exercise (although she has to add it manually as she does water exercise so she won't wear it in the water), &amp; food/water intake.<br/><br/>Love mine. I use it for the same purposes.<br/><br/>We did replace the bands with the magnetic band available on Amazon.
 I really wanted this to work. The problem is it would not sync with my ipad 4, which was my main choice of using the app.  In addition, the app for the ipad would not display much of the data it collected, such as heart rate.<br/><br/>After spending about an hour with customer service rep, Paoula G., there was no resolution, then I was disconnected and never was able to reconnect with Paoula.  One would think that since he/she had my email, they would have tried to reconnect or contact me and at least apply closure. So I was not impressed with customer service either.
 I really like this watch. There are only three negatives that I have:  1.  It doesn’t count your steps if you are pushing a shopping cart. 2. The screen turns on when you flip you wrist over. Sometimes it is hard to get it on.  3.  I wish you could swim with it on. My husband’s Garmin is submersible.<br/>Otherwise, the steps seem accurate. Charge lasts many days. I like being able to see my calls and texts on it. I like that you can buy different color bands for it.
 About the product<br/>For anyone who is considering to buy a Fitbit Charge 2 I would highly recommend it! The Fitbit allows the user to track many options in a typical workout and anything cardio. The watch comes in all sizes, ranging from Men’s extra-large, Men’s, and Women’s.<br/>Durability<br/> Durability is a huge factor when looking into buying a watch. Friends have said that they haven’t had any issues of breaking or cracking the Fitbit. The watch is also very easy to slip on and off for quick action. Also, if you would like to you can purchase a screen protector just in case a scratch does occur.<br/>Personal Activity<br/>Throughout the day one might constantly check their phone, with the Fitbit watch you can easily check the time without constantly getting distracted about what is happening on social media. Today you can see a wide amount of people wearing these products. The Fitbit also connects to the Bluetooth of your phone if you are conscious about your steps per day. The amount of steps can also be changed for anyone who is more productive through the day.<br/>Styles<br/>The watch also comes in many different styles for anyone who wants to change up from the basic color of black or pink. There is also different attachments slides that you can put on to make your Fitbit more fashionable. Also, if this variant of the Fitbit product isn’t for you, there is a wide variety of other watches to find any users ideal product. The item is great and is worth the money spent!
 I  F__King love this thing! It's a real motivator. I have workout harder and better since I got it. I love the reminders to keep me moving. I'm over weight. and was scare to workout, but not anymore. I walk everyday. I workout everyday. I drink more water now. &amp; the best fun of all, is the challenges. . Great buy. &amp; no, I did not get this for free. Hey, I buy a lot of things from Amazon, how come I never get anything for free? Just saying. &amp; Oh, did I say that I love it Lol.
 I have a fit bit charge 2 that I received as a gift and even though it took me few days to fall in love with it I find myself wearing it 24 hour. I got familiarized with its features and the apps does a lot for me. While out of state visiting friends I order this as a gift for my friend and got her hooked as well. The motivation to exercise it's constant reminder. The battery charge last for about 3 days and changing it's 30-45 minutes. I like the sleep monitor a lot since I'm a light sleeper. The watch arrived on time as promise.
 I was tempted to rate this lower because it showed me just how out of shape I was and how terrible my sleep was... But that's basically the whole point of the thing.  It's comfortable, intelligent, a bit stylish in this techie age, and very informative.  My one complaint is how easily the front scratches.  If you are regularly working with rough material like cement or metal, find a more durable option or some sort of casing.
 I've used this every day since I received it.  It holds a charge nicely.  It keeps me aware of what I am doing during the day.  Plus, I like seeing the date and time, because I don't normally wear a watch.  I have had some trouble with the wristband falling off.  It does not seem to be latching correctly onto the Charge 2, and this does scare me - I don't want to lose the Charge 2.  I just ordered a different wrist band, and I am hoping that takes care of the problem.
 Works with my iPhone and it’s great to monitor my steps. It’s comfy on my wrist. The Fitbit is perfect for me because I rarely have pockets so I can’t carry my phone all the time. It also monitors sleep patterns but I haven’t used that feature yet. I have rather small wrists but I still purchased the larger size because it’s supposed to be 2 fingers above your wrist
 I have been using this product for about a month. I wear it daily and I feel that it really pushes me to move around more. You can set it to notify you when you haven't taken 125 steps in hours you wish to be "active". I also like that you can set it up to show you who is calling or texting you.<br/>I haven't used the food log on the app, so I don't have an option about that part of the product.<br/>The band is comfortable, and it's nice that it's interchangeable.<br/>The reason I am giving it four stars, is because I really wanted to track my sleep, but I've noticed it's not completely accurate. Example, one night I was up for two hours in the middle of the night, even got out of bed twice, and it only showed me "awake" for one minute. However, it did show that I was restless for about two hours. So if you're getting this product more for tracking sleep and not steps, this isn't the product for you.
 Love my Fitbit - I just love everything that it does at your finger tips.  I had other Fitbit products but it was a pain to have to go to phone to look at the app.  With this one, everything is at your fingertips and you can change display if you want.  Also the extra app features are very cool.  This even has a reminder to get your a** up to walk every hour. If you are looking for an upgrade on your other fitbit then this is the one I recommend.  You can also change the bands, downside is the bands can be expensive if you get from Fitbit but can get some nice ones from Amazon for alot less.  Also, the removable bands seems to get a little looser after you take them off and put back on. The rose gold color is very pretty and stylish.
 This Fitbit is great!  I ordered mine literally hours before the release of the Fitbit Charge 3 was announced.  Even though my grandma preordered the 3, I still loved the 2 and was going to keep it anyway!<br/>But unfortunately, it no longer charged on the mount, so I sent the product back.  I probably had a defective one, but it was nice to see my “active minutes” and the fact that it counted flights of stairs made me feel challenged to climb as many as I could in a day!<br/>Thank you for the easy return and refund on Amazon.<br/>The Charge 2 is for anyone who is moderately active and would like to challenge themselves.
 I purchased this because I'm on my feet constantly at work (I Bartend at a large resort in Phoenix, AZ). I wanted to keep track of my steps and my sleep patterns. This Fitbit is the JAM. I also purchased 10 different colored bands on Amazon too (really great deal - I love Amazon), and needless to say, I love everything about it. It stays charged forever!
 Been almost a year and this has been a great Fitbit. Won't even be replacing this year. Going to keep wearing it as it is like new still and I put this through some tough environments. I bought the screen protector for it and that has been a lifesaver for the Fitbit so definitely do that but this has been my favorite Fitbit and it isn't done yet!
 The first Charge (with smaller LCD) allow you to long-press it's side button to start and end a workout. The Charge 2 attempts to automatically sense when you are working out (heightened heart rates), but only seems to SOMETIMES work. Maybe sweat? I worked out for 40 minutes today, it only captured 11 minutes.<br/><br/>I don't use this for step-counting. Sometimes when I'm not wearing it, it registers steps.<br/><br/>I also don't get how they don't have the ability to add custom reminders. You can add ONE daily reminder with no label.<br/><br/>Going to purchase a real heart monitor. I'd send this back if I had the box still.
 I like the product it works as expected. However I do not like the band that comes with the Fitbit. It is stiff and difficult to buckle even after months of use. It is also not particularly attractive. Will have to order a different band but it is too bad that the band that comes with the product is not up to par.<br/>For the cost of the product, one would think that a more attractive band could be included or at least one that is easier to use. The purple color is ok but the band itself looks industrial and clunky. It is stiff and difficult to fasten. Over all the Fitbit does what it is supposed to do and I am satisfied with the technology.
 Love my Fitbit!!!!!  I love that it tracks my heart rate 24/7.  One of the coolest things is when you turn on notifications it will buzz you when you have a text and/or call.  It will even show who the text is from and what they wrote so if it's not that urgent and you don't need to respond you don't have to dig for your phone.  Considering I am always missing a text/call when my phone is in my bag this is so helpful.<br/><br/>It's so easy to recharge and I charge it once every 8 - 10 days so the battery is amazing.  It will also notify you if you are sitting for too long which is great because sometimes at work you do forget about the time and getting a little nudge to get up and take a breather is helpful.
 Most importantly, this unit actually does work~!<br/>Software was pretty easy to install and understand, which is saying something, since I'm not a techie.<br/>I like that I can set my goals, and it measures how close I'm getting to those goals.  I've ordered a leather band, which I'm hoping will be more comfortable.<br/>I've had other fitness bands, and this one, so far, is the best.  My main interest is in monitoring my sleep and steps.
 Love Love Love my Fitbit! I was hesitant to buy into the fad, but, I am glad I did. I like how it tells me my heartbeat. Helps me get up and move when I am slacking. I like how it notifies me of a text on my phone :-) I agree with some of the other reviews about it not keeping actual count of your steps, but it is close. When walking your arm needs to be moving. Pushing a cart at the grocery store, you don't get most of your steps counted. You can cheat by swinging your arm while you are sitting down. :-) But who would want to do that! Doesn't come with a manual (didn't like that) but you can download one. I did.
 The band it came with was uncomfortable, but easily replaced.  The app is very useful and easy to use and great at putting information in front of you to try and motivate you to improve.  I've had it for almost two months now and have lost 30 pounds and am sleeping an hour more each night.<br/>Besides the uncomfortable band, my only complaint is the battery life.  3 days, yes.  4 days?  Not so much.
 The 1st one lasted a couple years, until I cracked the screen.  I really like this one but it appears they are phasing it out.  Too bad.  I wear it around my ankle (with the Baklit metal band) and it's very accurate that way, unlike the wrist model that skips when pushing a stroller or shopping cart.  Get it while you can.
 Very disappointed after receiving this product.  How the charger attaches is less than desirable, and it only comes with a cord, not a charger that plugs in an outlet.  I don't consider my PC as a power source to charge this item - plug it in the wall and go to bed and let it charge, not run my computer all night. To open the box and have to download updates to make it work is not what I expect.  Having to move the charger clip back and forth where it is clipped on to face to make sure contact is working and charging is disappointing.  First charge lasted about 6 hours?
 I have been using the Fitbit Charge 2 for a few days so this is my initial review.<br/><br/>This is my first time using a heart rate monitor so I have no experience with other watches, but I can tell you that this is an amazing watch.  It was an easy setup.  The watch syncs to my device without any problems and the android app runs smoothly.<br/><br/>SIZING GUIDE:  My wrists were borderline between Small and Large at around 6.7".  Now, I was worried that a large would be too large, or a small would be too small.  I eventually decided to go with the large.  The large fits me well with 4 extra holes from the band in case my wrist size drops.  So, I have plenty of room.<br/><br/>Here's an important factor when it comes to Size;  Fitbit recommends wearing the Charge 2 about 2-3 finger lengths above the wrist bone when doing exercises.  Luckily with the Large size, I'm able to adjust the Charge 2 up my arm so that the sensor accurately reads my heart rate.<br/>I hope this review helps people when making a decision about the size.
 After less than 6 weeks, the upper right quadrant of the display has already gone out.  I contacted Fitbit Customer service and after providing a picture of the failure, they quickly processed an order for a not charge replacement under warranty.  I wear the Charge 2 around the clock.  I am by no means an athlete, but do find tracking my steps and the reminders to get moving a good motivator.  I do enjoy the sleep tracking app, even through I have my doubts about its accuracy.  I do think that over time it is a useful qualitative measure of how things are going in general.
 This worked great for the first year but then started having issues. First, it slowly started to require more charging until eventually it was every day or so. It also started loosing time by a lot. As you might guess, it is now useless since it does not keep a charge for very long and does not tell time. Who knows if you could trust any of the other data on it now.
 We bought this as a gift for our daughter and it is very nice.  It does take some time to get it set up, but she absolutely loves it.  We also bought a different colored band, a screen protector and charger.  We have noticed that it challenges her to increase her activity and/or challenge us. A win all the way around.
 It works as a fitness tracker and as a watch, but I'm not completely won over by it.  Even with the small band, the watch is enormous and I'm not sure I want to keep it. It gets stuck in long sleeves and sticks out way beyond my wrist.  If you're petite I wouldn't recommend it, no matter the band, the tracker itself is very wide.  I don't find the reminders to move very motivating, although I do enjoy seeing fireworks when I hit 10,000 steps.
 I bought my Fitbit not even 4 months and the band came apart.the magnetic part wouldn't hold.I didn't wear it for over a month. I was finally able to get hold of Fitbit and they sent me a new band, after doing a full interview with them. I'm till uncomfortable about wearing it. Afraid I'll loose it. I hope they come up with a better design.
 The heart rate tracker for the first Fitbit charge 2 I received did not work. I tried some of the manufacturers recommendations so solve the problem however the unit was defective. I was able to return it and amazon sent me a new one next day air. The customer service through amazon is the best and I have always been very happy. The Fitbit charge 2 does a great job of tracking heart rate and this is the reason why I choose the charge 2. It is easy to setup and hold me accountable to meet my daily goals. I am very happy with this purchase.
 Had put off buying one of these for some time. Wasn't sure of the value.Really like the function overall, and found it motivated me to 'beat' previous days and weeks activity levels. Had been wearing it often, even wearing it at night. Really was insightful to see my sleep patterns, very useful. Only complaint is that I developed a serious fungal rash and have not worn it for 3 weeks while it healed.
 Love this!!!!! I can’t express how awesome it is to have this hook to my phone. It has a lot of details in the app that can’t be seen on the watch. They work together perfectly. I love that I can keep track of my heart rate while working out in various ways. This lets me know how long I sleep and the different levels of sleep I get. All in all it is a fabulous health reminder/tracker. I also rarely miss a phone call now when I am in another room because my watch buzzes.
 I love my fitbit. I didn't realize how inactive I had become. Sleep patterns with the help of the program are helping and I can set multiple alarms. Although splash proof wish it was waterproof. The vibrating alarm is a little low and sometimes I do not feel it and miss a goal. Overall it is working great and helping me improve my healing and health
 I love the Fitbit Charge 2 from an interactive and user interface perspective.  The readouts, tracking, and graphical interface are user friendly and it is easy to follow and track your workouts and progress.  What I do not like is that the average service life for this nearly $150.00 investment has been just under a year.  Since I got into the Fitbit craze, my initial Fitbit Charge was received broken, was replaced under the warranty, and subsequently replaced another time within the first year.  Deciding to give the Charge 2 a try, hoping for better luck, my initial Charge 2 last 11 months where upon it died which necessitated this purchase.  This WILL be my last purchase of a Fitbit product unless I get a couple years out of it...
 I am not sure that this device is accurate when comparing how it computes steps as my other devices that use apps to calculate steps. It appears to be significantly higher. Also, when I am outside walking, I cannot see the screen because of the brightness of the sun. I would not recommend this product for walkers or runners because of this issue. However, the app that is associated with this device is ok as it connects with other apps that track activity and food consumption. The charts and graphs are useful, however.
 I think this is a fair price for all it can do I mean It can like track how you sleep, your pulse, your steps,  how many calories you have burned and other stuff but what I didn't like about it was that It's not compatible with all the phones which means you can get any notifications from your phone but its compatible with most phones and the other bad thing is that it isn't touch screen its like vibration or something like that so you have to like press it like really hard but you can also use the button on the side.
 Bought this for my middle schooler who wanted to keep motivated on how many steps she could take in a day.  I think it works well for that. But we are keeping the app off her phone.  She's much too young to be concerned about her diet.  It fits her skinny wrist very well, and looks very pretty.
 I almost purchased the original charge when it came out, but I'm glad I waited until the charge 2.  Love that it shows the time and all the other stats quickly and easily (steps, HR, calories, minutes active, flights climbed, etc).  An added bonus is that my wife has the fitbit scale so i can track weight and body fat percentage which has been illuminating.  I also love being able to track my sleep patterns.<br/><br/>Finally, I used to use MyFitnessPal to track food intake, and I think it was a great app but the fitbit food tracker is also great and its awesome having everything in one ecosystem.<br/><br/>Very happy with the purchase and highly recommend.
 The heart rate monitor is terribly inacurate.  I bought this, &amp; paid extra money for this model, for the convenience of being able to track my steps &amp; to monitor my heart rate while exercising without wearing multiple accessories.<br/><br/>Before getting this i monitored my heart rate with a Polar chest strap monitor.  Once i started using this Fitbit &amp; would check my rate it seemed way off based on how i would feel at that same rate with my chest monitor.<br/><br/>I tested it by wearing both the Fitbit &amp; chest monitor at the same time &amp; the fitbit was consistently 10-20 bpm off the entire time.<br/><br/>Had i known it would be this far off then i never would have spent the extra money on this model.  I would have just purchased the basic model to keep track of my steps.
 Just got a new security job that requires a great deal of walking. First day,  I didn't have my Fitbit yet and it didn't seem like I walked very far so when I read the Instructions I set my goal at 8,000 steps. Well I walked the same route the next day and recorded over 14,500 steps or over 7 mi. It lets you know when you're close to your goal, your calories burned and when you get a text or phone call plus, your heart rate. Time and date also displayed.
 I gave this Fitbit Charge 2 to my wife for Christmas and she loves it.  I have used a FitBit One for over two years now and I have been very happy with it so my wife wanted one for her own.  Now it's a daily competition on step count and she cheats like no tomorrow!  The Charge 2 will track steps by moving your hand around and my wife must win!<br/><br/>The battery on the Charge 2 lasts for about 5 days and the heart rate seems accurate.  Overall she is very please with the Charge 2 and that is all that matters to me.
 Only reason for not giving it a five is that turning it up and over to see the time doesn't always show up on the first attempt nor does tapping through the face to change to features, it takes a couple of times sometimes 3. Maybe my expectations are set too high and this is normal of any brand or maybe there is a sweat spot where to wear it so it works perfectly smooth everytime. Other than that, it's amazing all it does. It's lite, comfortable to wear and the sleep app is an eye opener.
 The watch functions are okay, but it has irateded my skin , I found It's quite thick and feel uncomfortable during sleep specially when I put my hand under the pillow. Also the band holder  is not stable , it move frequently and caused a fractions and scratches.<br/>Bottom line: functions nice but bulky size.
 I bought these for myself and my husband. They track every step and with the app, you can journal food, monitor sleep patterns and so much more. They stay charged up for about a week and let you know when it's time for a recharge before they go dead. Pleasantly, I had no idea how many steps I took in a day. It also reminds you to move. These little gadgets are great.
 Purchased this as an upgrade from my regular Charge HR (thought I lost it, but them found it a day later...that's how obsessed I have become with my Fitbit).  This model is AWESOME and suits my needs perfectly: tracking steps, workouts, and sleep.  I was a little disappointed to see that the display doesn't include the number of flights of stairs you complete, but it's on my phone app when I sync up, so it's not that big of a deal.  The relax/ meditation feature is pretty cool as well.  I really don't know how I lived my life before Fitbit.
 I’ve been using this Fitbit now for almost a year, and it has definitely taken some abuse, and it’s none the worse for wear. I should say, I’m really hard on watches. I’ve never had a watch last more than six months, but this thing is built tough, and that’s even before you consider how great it functions. Top notch product!
 I got this as a gift for my mom and she absolutely loves the thing. She wears it all the time, and she's really taking the "steps" to heart, trying to outdo herself everyday, which is important. She's trying to keep herself active and this thing reminds her when she's not. It recharges easily and is quite nice, though the band is a bit big for most women. She got a nice replacement red band and it works great.
 This is my second Fitbit.  I had the "one" before this which was great.  I got this one after that one was lost.  The Charge 2 is extremely inaccurate.  I use a treadmill every morning that was recently calibrated so I know the distance is correct, yet after walking for 4 miles wearing the tracker, it only reads 2.5 miles.  I have attempted to adjust the stride length but it makes no difference. I have walked some distance watching the readout and maybe half the steps are recorded.  I tested it on counting flights of steps and it only recorded 6 out of 10.  If it is not recording steps accurately then it cannot be recording calories accurately either.  Maybe I have a defective product but it definitely is not worth the money.  I am extremely disappointed with it.  I would return it but I was so sure it would be a great product that I no longer have the packaging.
 I had been using another product, a Jawbone UP2, until the rubber wrist band broke a few days past the one year warranty.  When I tried to get it repaired the manufacturer wouldn't offer any adjustment other than purchase a new one at full price.  I now have the Fitbit Charge 2.  More features and ease of use.  One big advantage is I don't have to be near an iPAD/iPHONE to get immediate readings, every thing can be read with a simple twist of the wrist or tap screen.  And the wrist band can be easily replaced.  I'm quite pleased with the Fitbit Charge 2 and would recommend for all ages.
 Really great watch. The interchangeable bands really sold me on it. I wanted a dressier look for mine, and was pleased to see the large number of bands. I bought some metal ones to dress it up. Only draw back if bands are not as easy to change as I expected, but not a deal breaker. One fault: stair count is way off. It over counts my floors, (I'm no expert as to cause, but I promise I do not walk 40+ flights of stairs a day!). I simply ignore the feature since everything else works well.
 Love the sleep tracking feature and the majority of the exercise/step tracking features. Occasionally, a bit inaccurate in tracking steps, but my main concern is with how quickly I already have to reset the device. After a week or so, I am already not receiving text notifications/reminders, despite having it activated in the app. I will have to reset next time I charge and hope it works, otherwise, I will have to get it replaced soon.<br/><br/>Additionally, the standard band is a bit difficult to deal with and the clock face is already scratching/chipping after only a couple of weeks. I would recommend better glass.
 My husband wanted some kind of tracker thingy and I knew nothing about them.  Based on all the reviews I decided to go with this one and I'm glad I did.  It does everything he wanted and more!  He also love that he can purchase different bands and they are so easy to change out he does so almost every day!
 Well this product is great! My charge hr broke, it was given to me by my aunt. So my sister bought one like this and I fell in love with it, so I ordered this one! BUT, the morning I ordered, I clicked on it , and it was $149.99 , and I paid $179.95, was not happy, when I contacted customer service, they told me they couldn’t price match... it was the same item I bought, just that the price had dropped! Anyways....
 I had to removed the wristbands to wash it and ever since it doesn’t “lock”properly and I can’t wear my Fitbit anymore. I wouldn’t expect this type of quality when you pay a hundred dollars for a fitness tracker. I had cheaper ones and they are still good to go and I wore them longer than a month for sure. Very disappointed with the quality of this product
 FitBit has a great brand name and I initially bought their "Flex 2" older model. I found a very cheap deal and was impressed with the technology: tracking your steps and the silent alarm. Everything worked great. However the battery charger was so "prehistoric" it eventually did not work so I had to ditch it. I decided to upgrade to this model and again I am very impressed: great wrist band, advanced screen and they made the charger much more user-friendly and effective. Highly recommended.
 After exactly one year, I started to notice some condensation in the display, and the beginning of the display burning out, row by row. I’m not thrilled with the prospect of purchasing again; I would have hoped this device would have lasted me longer. I’ve found it really useful in tracking sleep and activity, but I’m disappointed with the longevity of the product.
 The device feels as it is made of high quality materials and the trackers seem to be on par with the competition.  Unfortunately, the Fitbit Charge 2s do not appear to be built to last.<br/><br/>Recently, the device just started to fluctuate between screens  vibrating like crazy while I was sitting in a meeting. It eventually stopped, and started, off and on for a couple days.  Support told me to restart, which didn’t work, and then offered 25% off a new device... insulting after lasting only a bit more than a year and a half.  I had fully intended on buying the charge 3, in November, but now I’m shopping Apple watches... I love (LOVE) the app, but $150 should get you more time with a device.  If you decide you want a Fitbit, I’d recommend it with the caveat that you buy a long-term warranty.
 I love having a fitbit, and enjoy the dashboard feature. My previous was a flex. This has more functionality, but I have had to struggle to syn (resync) several times and now...cannot get it to sync. I have tried the suggestions on the dashboard, but just get a red!
 Bought this one on April 20, 2018.  Stopped working last Friday for no apparent reason.  Started working again 2 days later.  Stopped working 2 days later again, for no apparent reason.  Blank screen.  Fully charged.  This is my second Fitbit.  First one stopped working after about a year.  Will not purchase any more Fitbit products.  Too Frustrating.
 This was the 3rd FitBit I have bought (I know I'm a slow learner) and was the LAST I will EVER purchase.  Every one conveniently died after the 1 year warranty period was over.  No option to fix anything, only was told by their support that I could get 25% off a new one.  Are you kidding me?  Never again.
 My wife is a huge fan of the Fitbit and although I don't know much about them personally, she absolutely loves this new Fitbit. Apparently it comes with an abundance of features, including text messages, phone calls and the time just to mention a few. Much like the older Fitbit, I know it also counts steps, stairs and heart rates but I know there are still more features. For those that are accustomed to the Fitbit, I don't need to tell you how great this gadget is. I even know they have an app for competition.
 I had seen and heard about the Fitbit trackers but didn't have any interest in owning one until I wanted to track my heartbeat during workouts. Now I'm hooked! About two weeks after I started using it, I decided to track my daily caloric intake. At age 64 I was beginning to develop a little bit of a stomach and was a few pounds overweight. I had been working out consistently but not losing much.<br/><br/>I received my Fitbit on October 9th and started tracking my calories on October 21st. My weight on October 21st was 173 pounds. By keeping track of my calories and staying within the Fitbit calorie budget, I lost 11 pounds by December 3rd. I am now 14 pounds lighter than I was on September 3rd.<br/><br/>I would not have been able to do this without my Fitbit tracker. I'm so pleased with it that I bought one for my wife. The Fitbit has worked great although sometimes it is a little slow to sync with my android phone.
 I love it! I have bought several FitBits and this one is my favorite yet! I do have to admit I think the price is a bit high for the special edition colors and I did splurge on an impulse buy and even though it is beautiful the lavender gets dirty quickly and I have since then replaced it with a black band less than a year later. If I could do it over again I would buy in black and save the $25
 I had a fitbit before, but it was one that I had to carry on my belt. This one is SO much better. I'm not an exerciser. Period. But I do enjoy doing the "compete with your last best number" thing. Plus, I was used to wearing a watch, so this was a natural.  I don't enjoy having to recharge it so often, because I also like to wear it to sleep to get THAT number (minus one star). I never felt like I could justify the price of an Apple Watch, so this hit the sweet spot. I have added a metal band (not rock music) because my arm was reacting a bit to the plastic.
 I absolutely love it! Easy to set up, walks you through everything. The app is easy to navigate and I'm awful with technology. It let's you pick and choose what you want on and what you want off. There are support groups and reminders to exercize and it will even help balance your diet if you want. It even sets goals for you. I seriously love it, I would get it for Christmas gifts for all my family if I could afford it lol
 Pretty good fitness watch. iOS app is good too.  The band is very poorly made &amp; will only last a few months.  You could easily lose the entire watch if you don't spend extra on a well-made band.
 my first time with an item like this. I love the calorie burned tracker, steps taken, ability to recognize treadmill, walking and elliptical automatically. I love the sleep tracker but do wish that it tracked all sleep with details instead of just 3+ hours. It synced up very easily with my Galaxy S5, msgs are really nice and the ability to alter the reminders and alerts is really nice. I'm still learning all the features but so far I love it. If only it were waterproof so when I swim in the summer I could keep track of that as well.
 I love this thing!  I have the fitbit one but I wanted something to notify me when I was getting a call or text.  I also have a smartwatch that looks like I could put a tablecloth on it and eat off of it because it is soooooo big.  This does everything I need it to do and it is so pretty.  It is the perfect size.  I got the rose gold one since I wear gold instead of silver and it is so nice.  I only wish I could find bands with different colors with the rose gold hardware without the big metal clips on the sides,
 Very pleased. Definitely an upgrade from my Flex. I didn't wanna go all in for an apple watch or the likes right now, I just wanted something simple that could hold up to daily use. Really enjoy being able to read my messages or seeing a call even when my phone isn't on me. I cant respond, but I can tell whether it's something i need too pick up my phone for or if it can wait til later. Bought my brother one as well.
 The sides of the actual fitbit rectangle are black and not silver on this model, which is why I chose it over the regular Charge2.I just like the look of it a lot more. As a tracker, I love it. It is working great, and has a long battery life. My only complaint is the charger for this model seems like it would break easily so I ordered a two pack from a third party seller to have on hand when the time comes.
 I had a Fitbit years ago that I just didn’t like enough to wear. After my sister got one of these I knew I had to have it! It is very comfortable and I barely notice I’m wearing it!<br/><br/>I love all of its features. It’s easy when I go for a walk or a hike to turn the gps on my phone on and off from the Fitbit; I just have my phone in my pocket and go! I used to use run keeper but this is so much simpler. I also love how it tracks my sleeping patterns. The notifications work well. Sometimes texts are delayed a few minutes but calls always come through right away. My sister loves the relax function. I thought I would use it a lot but I really don’t; she uses it all the time though so I’m sure it’s just a individual preference.<br/><br/>The battery life seems really good. I charge it while I’m in the shower and wear it at all other times. I love the lavender color!
 Really like this tracker, it tracks walk, sleep very well, and the silent alarm compare to Charge HR 1 is using just perfect amount of vibration to wake me up, instead of vibrate to the bone like Charge HR 1. Most importantly, the constant software update is making Charge HR 2 a better product days after days. Such as sleep tracking, which it didn't have sleep analysis report until after a few months of the release, as well as the built in mini game you unlock after meeting the daily goals.<br/><br/>However, I am EXTREMELY unsatisfied that my watch had partially stopped working. Screen has distortion, battery life dropped to half in just one day, and heart beat monitor stopped working completely.
 This Fitbit Charge 2 Heart Rate + Fitness Wristband is already lasting longer than my previous Fitbit purchase. It keeps great records of my steps and progress. I no longer have a problem sinking the data to my app. Also, the band remains in excellent condition after daily use over several months. Still looks brand new!
 I absolutely love this fitbit but I am super disappointed in the band. I have done everything I'm supposed to do to clean the band, but it is made of somekinf of 'elastopolymer' and is not breathable. After only wearing it for 2 days I have developed a mild rash on the bottom of my wrist. I always take it off to shower too. I have ordered some new bands so hopefully those will be better.
 This is my 2nd Fitbit activity tracker. My One performed well for 4 years. After a year with another brand tracker, I returned to Fitbit with this Charge 2. While the tracker itself has worked perfectly, in 7 months both halves of the wristband have failed. I received a warranty replacement band in about 4 days. I love the app, though I wish I could integrate my Bluetooth scale and blood pressure monitor. The depth of information I can get from the app regarding my sleep and activity levels is remarkable.
 I love this Fitbit.  The price was great.  I wanted something that would track my steps, heart rate, and sleep.  This does all of those.  It also keeps track of floors climbed which is great since I have stairs in my house.  Another great feature is that when I get a text it tells me who the text is from and then scrolls the message accross below so I can see if I need to reply immediatly or not.  It also tells me when I get a phone call and who the phone call is from so those are added bonuses.  Great product!
 I received a lemon. It lasted about 6 weeks. I noticed it didn't hold a charge for more than 3 hours! The next day I charged it for about 5 hours and it lasted even less time AND the clock was wrong. I called Fitbit and after a lengthy troubleshooting phone call it was determined that my suspicions were right, it had a bad battery. I was shipped a new "pebble" (the main unit....no band, no charger, which was fine because that's what I was promised....and just what I needed). I commend Fitbit for their superior customer service.
 Bought this in 1916 for a gift. My son started with the flex bought June of 2014 that still holds a charge which last about 8 days. This fit bit doesn't charge at all anymore. Can't even buy a new battery! When my son called customer services offered only a 25% off a new fit bit.<br/>I would serious not buy one. My son is very disappointed !
 Love this band so much better than the original Fitbit band. It's pretty, easy to get on and off and matching my lavender special edition Fitbit perfectly. Although it has a small dent/ding on one end of the band :( I don't plan on returning it because it's more of a pain than it's worth. Honestly no one else will probably notice it but I notice it and it's annoying. I would have liked a flawless product. Guess that's what you get for 15.00.
 I’ve been using my Charge 2 for two months and I have to say I’m disappointed.  There are a number of cool features, but the heart rate monitor is really sketchy.  I bought this FitBit to monitor my heart rate during workouts and HIIT runs/sprints, but more than half the time it shows “- -“ and if it does show a number, it’s inaccurate.  It’s almost like there is a 1 minute lag (ex. number still going up when actual heart rate is dropping).  I think I’ll give this one away and find something different.
 Fitbit wrist bands have not been developed completely yet.  Design challenges. My wife has very small wrists, and the resulting angle over stresses the connection, which rather quickly fails.  For my large wrists, this problem doesn't occur.  However, even with my meticulous care, it is beginning to fail after about one year.  Fitbit needs to find a better wrist band solution.
 stylish, fashionable &amp; it does the job! tracks steps, sleep, heart rate &amp; I love that i can customize the exercise options. I use Kickboxing, circuit training, cycling &amp; weights. It's fantastic. And easy to use in between the workouts to start/stop &amp; start a new one.
 Going from a Flex 1 to this was night and day. It's much more responsive, the battery life is even better than the Flex even with a lot of activity going on. The band never gets itchy unless I've got winter gear on and I'm sweating a lot, but a light wash with a little soap keeps it good for another few weeks.<br/><br/>The band is so much better than the old bands too. It's very comfy and adjusts quite well. I got the black band and so far I haven't had any issues with rubbing/scraping/discoloration. Looks very sleek.
 Interesting that it breaks down sleep stages.  Seems to work fine gathering steps and data.  However, the interchangeable band can be a pain.  After almost a year the band kept coming loose.  The suggested fix, tightening a screw in the housing, didn’t work.  I wound up using glue and that stopped the problem.  I was not interested in changing bands.
 The charge 2 is pretty functional.  I miss some of the features my Garmin had, but this seems a little more on the money for stairs.<br/>It also has a multitude of aftermarket bands to pick from and changing them is pretty easy.<br/>I wish starting the workout feature was a little easier; it seems more complicated than it was with my old Garmin.
 I did my research before deciding to purchase the Fitbit Charge 2 in lieu of other devices. Not regrets! This is a great product. I've been using it for about 2 months now. Every single day. The charge lasts about 5 days to a week. its not super bulky, and its chic looking. I love all the features and the ability to sync to my phone app easily and track everything from there. This device has lots of functions. I would definitely recommend this for anyone who is looking for a good way to track exercise, calorie intake/out, sleep cycles, and steps!
 It works but the band is veryveryvery cheap.  I ordered this in  April of 2017 for my wife.  She loved it.  In 1/18 the band broke.  Got a new one sent to me to replace the broken band.  It is now 7/9 and guess WHAT???????  The band broke again.  Fit bit will not offer any product support since it has been a year.  Nice device...….band is crap!!!
 Bought this fitbit on Nov 28 2016, and this morning the band just came off for no reason.  It tried to snap it back by reading the online instruction, and it won't snap back with a click sound.  It came off over and over again on one side, the other band is okay.  I compared both bands to see any missing part, but couldn't see any difference.  One side can snap into the place easily with a sound click, but not the other....
 This Fitbit burned my wrist.
 I purchased this for a cardio class. It has been great to be able to have a record of my exercise, food, water, calories burned, sleep, and HR. It seems to be pretty comfortable and the bands are easy to switch and take off to clean. The workout modes are nice to use- but I have not figured them all out yet. I can set goals and reminders which are fun and helpful.<br/>Negatives: It is difficult to see the display without reading glasses and when I where it to be the display will flick on when I turn my wrist. It is pretty bright and can be disruptive when trying to sleep. I also cannot figure out how to turn it off when I am not using it. I think that it just goes into a sleep type of mode.
 I am in love with this device.  It’s encouraged me to increase the amount of steps I take daily and my fitness goals are being accomplished.  The app and social aspect with the work week hustle are terrific at motivating me along with the individual trail challenges.  I love that it tracks my heart rate and sleep.  The calories burned and food journal aspect also help keep me on task.
 Currently waiting on getting a replacement from Amazon, had to send mine back because it wouldn't set up on my phone, computer or with a wireless dongle. Fitbit tech support was friendly and as helpful as could be, but we were not able to get passed the point in the initial set up where you enter in the 4-digit code. Fitbit tech support sent me the wireless dongle free of charge as a last ditch effort to try all options available, but unfortunately that didn't help, still got the same error - "an error occurred while pairing". Hopefully the replacement will work or I'm afraid I will give up on it. Previously had the Charge HR, which I loved, but it fell apart after 2 years, the back plate broke off so it could no longer hold the charge cord in to charge it.
 This was a Christmas present &amp; at first it would notify me when I got a call &amp; text. Within a week it quit doing that. OK, not a big deal.<br/>At first the battery life was about a week, now I am having to charge every other day. It's not the charger because it will charge complete.<br/>I have started to notice that sometimes my heart rate will display, sometimes it's a flat line.<br/>When it is working correct, it's great.
 Rarely do I make a purchase that truly changes my life for the better- but this gadget-watch did just that. Download the app and you will even get a nightly sleep analysis every morning. Tracks every aspect of health management. From steps counter and reminder, workout, water, and breathing exercises. A bit of a learning curve, but there is extensive information online and via the app to more than get you started. Get it today, get one for you and one for someone you love.
 I have had several fitbits over the years. I've had the flex, one, charge, and now charge 2.The Charge 2 is by far my favorite. I like the readability of the digital display but the sizing isn't as overwhelming as the Blaze. I love that the wristbands are interchangeable. It smart logs my sleep cycle without me having to tell it to start and stop. I have noticed that I get less steps on this than the one, which is weird, however, I don't expect any step device worn on your wrist to be perfect.
 Finally losing weight thanks to this device which reminds and encourages me to get up and move every hour. Co-workers have bought their own Fitbits as well and the competition is fierce! The weekly reports are awesome, as well as the real time reports on your phone! Might, at some time, update to the Fitbit Versa, but for now, the Charge 2 does everything I need.
 Love my Fitibit Charge 2.  Replaced my Fitbit Alta with it as this one has an altimeter to track stairs and a heart rate sensor to track workouts.  Battery life is great, I charge it for only about 20 min a day, and that is all it needs.
 Love my Fitbit Charge 2!  Challenging myself on my daily steps is great.  Also keeping track of my heart rate is another great bonus with this tracker.  The biggest bonus is having notifications : calls and texts...being in the other room and getting a call or text, especially whether if its important or just a junk call, I can either take the call or ignore it and resume activity. This Charge 2 is quite the life saver.  Now, only if it tracked my blood sugar for my hypoglycemia, that would be a hole new development that Fitbit could consider down the road some day!
 The step counter and heart rate moniter functions on this device are not accurate at all. This Fitbit would count me “stepping” when I was folding clothes at work or doing other mundane tasks that weren’t even CLOSE to stepping. The heart rate moniter is also touch and go. It constantly loses my pulse and even following all the guidelines the company lays out to get a better read from it, it does not work. I bought this Fitbit on May 22nd of this year, and its lifespan is already a day and half to two days at the most. Don’t waste your money; find and more reliable brand or wait for a newer, better model from Fitbit
 I’ve been wearing my Fitbit Charge 2 for about 3 weeks now and I love it! It reminds me when I need to go for a walk and I keep track of my sleep.  I always knew I was a light sleeper and this proves it.  This info will be helpful when/if I ever go to the Dr to get it checked out.  The app is awesome! I log my weight and food for the day which helps me stay within my calorie count.
 Its ok. Love how it can track sleep pattern, record resting heart rate, battery life and love the community also for motivation. Hr monitor is not very accurate....tested results with manual and pulse oximeter. Fitbit seems to read atleast 15-20 bpm higher when brisk walking( activity). Tried different placement as well, 1 finger, 2 finger, 3 finger space above wristbone, no accurate results. For the price, I expected more.
 I absolutely love my Fitbit. I imagine there are some times that it may be a bit inaccurate. But, I've owned this for almost 6 months now and I'm still glad this is the one I bought. The battery last just as long 6 months later as it did when I first bought it. I've caught it on things numerous times but you can't see a single blemish on it. I switch out my bands pretty frequently and the snaps are still tight and secure.  This one piece of equipment has helped me be more mindful of my lifestyle and recognize when I've been a bit to sedentary.
 I have had mixed experience with FitBits, this being the third one I've used. I do think it is the best of the trackers, and the app on my smartphone syncs flawlessly. Previous FitBits have had a tendency for the band to separate from the tracker unit, so I'm concerned about quality control. So far, a few months in, this one is very capable and easy to use.
 I've had the fitbit for a couple of weeks.  I highly rate the functions it provides and the app that supports it.  I believe the stats provided in the app (steps, sleep, calories, etc) are very useful and well displayed.  My disappointment is the battery life.  I am charging my device every couple of days.  Since I have to remove the device to charge it, depending on the time of day, I lose information that I would have like to be included in my statistics.
 I like it but anyone of these that you purchase for the wrist does not accurately pick up the steps.  If you are shopping in a grocert store and your hands our own the cart the Fitbit does not pick up all of steps because you have little arm movement.  Samething for a treadmill.  if your hands are on the side rails, Fitbit does not register all of your stems due to lack of movement of the arm.<br/><br/>I put the fitbit in my pants next to the hip, it measures accurately.
 I absolutely love my fit bit. It was wider than I imagined it being - but I have grown used to it and love it. It's comfortable, the display is responsive and I have had no problems syncing this on my phone. It motivates me to get moving - and it's exactly what I needed.
 Love my Charge 2! Upgraded from a flex and it is so superior. I like (and have actually used) all of the features. The sleep cycle monitoring is much more accurate, and the pedometer seems to count up more of the steps i want and less of what I don't (waving my hands around for some activity).<br/>The only 2 criticisms I have are that the battery still doesn't last very long (2 or 3 days of constant wear), and it still doesn't pick up the steps us  moms do so much of: pushing a stroller/ shopping cart. I also wish fitbit would update its app for calorie counting, as the food database isn't sufficient. I have linked my Charge 2 to myfitnesspal app (another nice feature) where I find the food database to be much more satisfactory.<br/>Overall, I'm super pleased with my purchase!
 Overall very happy. Had a problem with it right out of the box but God outstanding customer service from the manufacturer without having to call our warranty in from Amazon. Only complaint is the generalization of data on sleep modern monitoring. Would be nice to get more specifics than just intermittent bars  on a graph without specific times for the interruptions
 Two months old and it no longer syncs with my phone.  I uninstalled the app and re-installed to no avail.  This is my fifth Fitbit product and they just don't hold up.  I'm 65 years old so it's not like they're breaking during Iron Man competitions.  I need a product that will give me basic information reliably.  Fitbit isn't cutting it.
 BE CAREFUL buying this special edition Fitbit. I love the Fitbit itself and the rose gold is beautiful, but the lavender band is already staining black after just 2 days of wear. I haven't been wearing any long sleeves or doing anything particularly grimy. When I asked Fitbit support for a replacement band in black, they only had the black band with a silver clasp so it didn't match the Fitbit that I paid more for to have rose gold, since they only have it in lavender. Also, they wouldn't let me switch to the classic Fitbit instead or offer a refund, only a replacement band with a silver clasp so now it doesn't match...
 Love it!  Have upped my activity since using it.  Makes it kind of fun to watch the increase in steps.  Love the sleep tracking feature and use it nearly nightly. Have a few silent alarms set and they are nice but I never seem to feel the 'wake up' one.  I like the text/call notifications from my cell phone as I'm not fond to having my cell on me all the time...I can garden and still get notifications from my cell in the house.
 piece of trash shipped "brand new" and didn't work, right out of the box. called fit bit and they charged me to send it back to them so they can "replace it"... likely with a refurbished piece of trash.  👍
 This is my 3rd fitbit in 3 years. They don't seem to last despite taking good care of it. The clock flash part doesn't seem to respond well in this set. Always do have to press the button
 I love it! I’m very active at wirk so I wear it to see how far I walk and how many steps . The phone app is fun to use too.I also wear to the gym for heartrate and time of activity. I did buy a screensaver for it. I also put a sweatband over it at work so I won’t break the screen as I’m a merchandiser unliading boxes so I’m really active
 I have been using Charge 2 for one month. Steps and calories are always overestimated (steps off by as much as 200% and calories by as much as 300%). What's even worse is that they have never been off by a consistent amount. It's as if the device and app are spitting out random figures. The Charge 2 is a fitness tracker - it'd be nice if I could use it to, you know, track my fitness.<br/><br/>If I read one more thing about "proprietary algorithm" or you have to remember it's including BMR calories or tell the app you're wearing it on your dominant hand or slide it further up your arm or any other nonsense response I am going to scream.<br/><br/>The thing just doesn't work. That's the bottom line.<br/><br/>The users aren't using it wrong. The device and app don't work.<br/><br/>I can live with inaccurate numbers but inaccurate AND inconsistent numbers makes this thing worthless. Actually it makes it harmful if you are using the information to figure out how many calories to eat or if you're trying to improve your health.
 I was skeptical if this wrist tracker could effective monitor steps, activity, bpm and SLEEP....but, it does a very good job at tracking your sleep and I have learned a lot about my patterns and what I can do to get better sleep.  I started out using the calorie tracker every day but eventually the stats I end up monitoring are the steps, activity minutes, avg bpm, and of course SLEEP...it is the most important aspect of our overall health.  Love my fitbit so far after 3 months....
 I've had my Fitbit since the beginning of September and found that it was not properly measuring my heart rate or calories. On top of this, it stopped working earlier this week and I've only had it for 4 months. I normally don't leave product reviews, but I'm very dissatisfied with this item.
 Although I've only had my Charge 2 a short while, I'm very impressed with the ease of set up via online procedures and the overall performance, fit, &amp; looks of this tracker.  I'm going to monitor the HR accuracy as that is why I exchanged the Garmin Vivosmart HR for this model.  The HR accuracy, at least on the unit I received, was way off the charts inaccurate even after following the instructions closely.
 I love the style of the screen and the fact that I can track so much with it.<br/><br/>My two complaints would be, the sensor part of the watch is a little too bulky (shown in pictures) and makes it uncomfortable to sleep in to track your sleep. The second thing would be the step tracker isn't accurate. I move my arm in a walking motion and it tracks it as a step, mind you this isn't a big deal to me since I use it mainly to give me an idea of what I've done that day, but for someone who really wants to know how many steps they have done it might be a bit of a problem.<br/><br/>I would say over all I very much enjoy my fitbit, its fun to see what all I've done and challenge my friends through the app.
 My Fit bit helps me track steps, heart rate, and with the app, diet, calories, nutrition, water intake. It's great except for one thing. It frequently does not notify me of messages and calls on my cell phone. It should buzz me and then show me who is calling or texting me, along with the message. I am forever having to fix it but in the 5 months I have owned it, this feature is out more often than it is working.
 If you have sensitive skin, this device can cause chemical burns on your skin.  After doing some research, it appears to be caused by a reaction from sweat and the charging port that is in direct contact with your wrist.<br/><br/>My wife was having these issues but she loves her Fitbit, so our solution was to cut tiny strips off bandaids and cover the charging port (the 3 copper dots).  It appears after doing this, the chemical burns have stopped.  It’s disappointing that Fitbit would allow such a poor design that is hurting people.
 It's worth the investment for sure.  I can be cheap sometimes and try to get by with the least expensive thing that will mostly meet my needs.  I went ahead on this purchase and got what I really wanted and it's worth it.  The face is more bulky than a watch but it is no big deal at all.  Love changing to different functions with the button and taps.  It tracks great on all areas and I have been having medical issues with elevated heart rate which this has tracked really well. Came back and bought one for husband and daughter.
 This works perfectly! HR monitor is great, especially when exercising. Has modes to manually track exercise and will automatically log exercise when it detects it. The app works great with the device and the challenges help keep me moving! Another great feature for hiking is the elevation tracking which tells the number of floors you've gained. I've lost over 20 pounds just tracking food and activity!
 I like the Fitbit Charge 2, but the band caused a severe rash.  Took me weeks to get the rash to clear up.  I ordered a stainless steel replacement band and that seems to be working ok.  I researched the issue with the original band and this seem to be a known issue.  I do not understand why Fitbit would not look into the issue and change the band.  It has been an issue for years.
 I love it! This product is great for anyone trying to lose weight, gain weight, improve consistency throughout the weeks, or if you're just simply trying to keep healthy. My friend got one because she was trying to lower her cholesterol and she lowered it 37 points in 3 months by keeping up with her fitbit and logging her meals.  You tell the fitbit what your goals are and it keeps on you throughout the day. You can log your water intake and calorie intake on your app on your phone. It also tracks your sleeping so you can see if you are more restless on some nights or if you wakeup a lot. If you forget to log a long walk or forget to log when you go to sleep don't worry, it already knows and logged it for you!  If you haven't met your step count goal for the hour it will vibrate and alert you to get moving! It does take some getting used to if you are not used to wearing watches or something on your wrist. Besides that it is very comfortable. The battery has never died on me but I just charge it while I take a shower (20-30 min) once a day and it keeps its charge. I would recommend  buying a screen protector for this as I did receive a small scratch within the first few days, but I bought eight screen protectors for $5 so it isn't going to break the bank.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone!
 I am changing my earlier review on this product. Apparently the Fitbit was not completely set up to sync with my phone. After creating the review I got board one night and started playing with it and found it had charged my phone was not acknowledging the charge. I have been wearing it for 5 days now and have not recharged it yet so all seems good after all.  I am still not happy about the short return policy as 14 days is just not enough time with my demanding schedule. I work 7 days a week so it is hard to do errands  as it is. I don't shop anywhere that only has a 14 day window to return.  FYI I did get an email with links as to how I can solve the problem. I did not need them by the time I saw the email but at least there was an effort to help.
 I bought this for my wife and she was tickled to death with it she uses it daily. She is on her feet a lot at work so she gives a good work out.<br/>Goes four or five days with out having to charge it, the fitbit app for android phones is great. If you have a windows phone  their app is not functional, So if you have an android phone then your good to go but windows phone or a pc not so much. Cant speak to the apple phones if they are good or not with their fitbit app
 I loved this, until I upgraded from an iPhone 5S to an iPhone 8.  I can no longer get messages or other notifications on my Fitibit.  I read several community messages about this, and basically we need to wait for a software upgrade from Fitbit.  The messages and other notifications are what<br/>made me buy this.  Fitbit needs to fix this quickly.  Otherwise, my Fitbit is going to sit in my dresser drawer.
 Purchased this product for my 12 year old daughter to keep in touch with her health. She entered all her information,  set her goals &amp; sleeps with it on every night to monitor her sleep pattern. It gives her a clear view of her overall health the next day in both fitness and resting. As an added bonus, the peace of mind it brings me, in being able to reach her (incase of an emergency) while she's in school just knowing she can read a text message is comforting to me as a parent! Extremely satisfied with this product and will be purchasing another for myself so we can take care of our health together!
 I love everything about this tracker. For the price it looks great and as a student I was worried about the thickness of the band. I didn't want something that would interfere when I was on my laptop or typing. The only downside to this product is the screen quality - IT'S HORRIBLE. For the price you pay you would expect a screen that is scratch resistant at the very least. I sit at a desk all day and besides running and light weight lifting I don't do much else. I have multiple scratches on the screen and have never dropped by band.
 Great product timely delivery.<br/>Sent information to Fitbit regarding this product recently and was very disappointed with their response. The screen has developed a crack pretty much down the middle  and I was told it was not a warranted part of the device. I did not drop or misuse the product in any way and this is rather disappointing. In checking online I see  others have had tis issue and they too were turned away.Probably the last Fitbit I will purchase and this was my second try.
 This FitBit refuses to count all of my flights of stairs. If I leave it on my wrist it counts fewer than 50% of my flights. If I put it in my pocket it counts 80-90% of them, but still misses some. If I walk too slow, they don't count. I keep telling myself that none of the stair climbing is going to go to waste but it is annoying that the thing cannot - or will not - count stairs. I also got rid of the hideous band and bought one with a terrifically strong magnet clasp. <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Fitbit-Charge-2-Band-UMTELE-Milanese-Loop-Stainless-Steel-Metal-Bracelet-Strap-with-Unique-Magnet-Lock-No-Buckle-Needed-for-Fitbit-Charge-2-HR-Fitness-Tracker-Rose-Gold/dp/B01LY073TG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Fitbit Charge 2 Band, UMTELE Milanese Loop Stainless Steel Metal Bracelet Strap with Unique Magnet Lock, No Buckle Needed for Fitbit Charge 2 HR Fitness Tracker Rose Gold</a>. Everything else seems to work fine and I love the fireworks and encouragement it gives me. It is a very personable little device. And, of course, now that I have logged my first 250 miles of walking, I cannot possibly switch to another brand, even if I wanted to. The app works well and helps me find the device when I think it is lost.
 After managing to do the setup and using it for 2 days I can say that I love it.<br/>I would improve only the instruction to set it up and to start using it. It is not straight forward and it took me longer than I expected. I wanted to use it during my spinning class and wasn't sure at first how to do it.<br/>Otherwise I enjoy using it and checking the results on the dashboard.
 I had the Charge HR but wanted to upgrade really based on the fact I could change the band. It's honestly not a whole lot different but the differences make it more enjoyable. I like the bigger screen allot and it has better options in tracking exercise. I also personally think The charge lasts longer I don't know this as fact though.The only thing I don't like about fitbit as a whole is they are not water proof. I feel they are getting closer just by the difference in how they charge now. I've tried other fitness trackers that were water proof but that's was the only thing that was good about them. They weren't accurate and they were just lacking big time. I've never been a upgrade person but fitbit just keeps getting better. I'm really in love with the Charge line.
 The face of my Charge 2 cracked after having it for 2 weeks. I expect more from a "fitness" watch that cost $150. I don't even remember it hitting anything. When I complained to Fitbit, they offered to give me a 25% discount on a new watch. No thanks! I've already wasted too much money on this company. I have been a Fitbit user for the past few years.  I purchased this Charge 2 after the charging connector on my Fitbit Alta fell off. Before the Alta was another Fitbit Charge 2 that stopped charging after a year. I've stuck with Fitbit because I like the app and it's connected to various other apps, like my company's wellness program and My Fitness Pal. But I'm done with Fitbit. Time to find something better and then update my other apps.
 Got this in December 2016, quit charging after 6 months. It's just dead and I barely wore it. No rain, sweat or extreme exercise. I bought my mother one also and hers still works. I got a dud.<br/>My first fitbit quit after 5 months... Very upset and feel cheated and ripped off.
 Honestly this was worth the money if you really want to keep track of your fitness goals. The instructions were a little unclear on how to use it so I had to tinker with it to understand it, but besides that it's amazing. Oh!! And it says it's water resistant and "We recommend not taking showers with your Fitbit and swimming with the Charge 2" but I accidentally went swimming with it and it's fine.
 I love it!!! Live updates, easy overview, text messages in screen!!  (Okay, I had to deactivate that feature-- no one needs to see my texts! ;-) ) It feels very motivating to see the steps, flights of stairs and heart rate, etc.!<br/>I wish the scale that's compatible wasn't so darn expensive, but that'/ a neat idea.<br/>So far I've linked the app to the "my fitness pal" app and joined some of my family members. I highly recommend it!!
 This could have been a very good product but it's lacking in all aspects.<br/><br/>First, the build quality is low. Within 4 months of use, the strap should be changed. It didn't get ripped, or damaged. It simply "popped" (detached from itself at the point where it connects with the actual device).<br/><br/>Second, its connectivity to a phone is not reliable. I always place my phone at the same place while riding my bicycle. It manages to sync with the phone in 40-45% of the times. As a result, more than half of my activities do not have GPS data (location, speed etc).<br/><br/>Third, if you forget to terminate an activity, you have limited options to go back and correct it. It cannot be done on Android, it cannot be done on their website. You have to use an iOS device.
 The biggest complaint that I have is the battery doesn't last long at all, and that is beyond aggravating.  All of the information that can be gained from this device is all nice, fine, and great, but I would rather have less features and a longer battery life.
 I purchase this Fitbit in May 2017 to replace the Garmin activity tracker my wife had been using. The device has work perfectly however the band has broken 3 times and I've had to get a replacement band each time from Fitbit. My wife is not heavy in the exercise so it's been used primarily just back and forth to work today and everyday household activities. Evidently there is a flaw in how the band connects to the actual device. I hope the manufacturers get this fixed soon.I
 I wouldn't give a single star to this product. Purchased it on thanksgiving and received a faulty piece. Returned and got a new one which I started using with all the excitement. However, my excitement didn't last even a day!!! Yes, you are reading it right. My hand started paining like hell and I was unable to do any activity with my left hand. The pain was more like arthritis.Up on reading some suggestions from Fitbit community , I wore my watch leaving 2 finger spaces from my wrist bone. Unfortunately that didn't work either and my pain started to aggravate. FInally I returned my charge2. Not worth the hype.
 Charge 2 tracker is a great tool when it works as advertised.  I caution all who purchase to have an expectation that you will experience frustration with the tracker due to ongoing, reported software bugs.  I also recommend that you use your search engine to get an idea of the problems you may experience.  And finally, have NO expectation that Fitbit will provide any assistance with problems.<br/><br/>Received my Fitbit as ordered. No problems there. I love the product WHEN IT WORKS as advertised and intended.  Unfortunately, problems begin once you start using the Fitbit.  There are technical issues that remain unresolved for months after being reported.<br/>Syncing issues are abundant - frequently your tracker will not sync with the Fitbit app on your connected device and this is rarely resolved easily.  Note that using all day sync (recommended setting) can interfere with other Bluetooth devices you might wish to use with your phone/tablet/computer/whatever.<br/>There are issues where the tracker does not reset correctly at midnight - clearing your counts/measurements from one day to the next.<br/>There are issues where the tracker does not count all steps while you are walking or exercising. This is a separate and distinct issue from the lag the tracker experiences when you are still and start walking which is not an issue.<br/> It is frustrating because your expectation is that this device is "ready for prime time" but it is not.  Frankly, I feel that the software loaded on these devices is continuously in Beta test mode.  Which would be fine if you purchase the device with that understanding.<br/>Fitbit responses from Customer Service simply say "their engineering team is working on it". They are unable to provide any time frame for resolution of any issues.  Their customer service is at best handled by folks whose native language is not English and at worst, robots who simply provide canned answers.  I have tried communicating with Fitbit Customer Service via online chat, their user forums, and email.  At no time did it seem as if the person (or whatever) on the other end even paid attention to what I had reported.  They repeatedly referred me to broken or closed links in the online community forum.  It is disturbing that they can offer no help thru any of the resources that was not from their community boards.  Are there no customer service people with technological knowledge that goes beyond what the user community has found by trial and error?  No.  The stock solution is to basically turn it off and turn it back on.<br/>Conclusion (repeated from opening):<br/>Charge 2 tracker is a great tool when it works as advertised.  I caution all who purchase to have an expectation that you will experience frustration with the tracker due to ongoing, reported software bugs.  I also recommend that you use your search engine to get an idea of the problems you may experience.  And finally, have NO expectation that Fitbit will provide any assistance with problems.
 Think allergic to the band I noticed that I am itching and it is bothering my wrist I tried to move it to the other wrist and same thing happens I tried adjusting it cleaning it nothing seems to work I am looking for a new fabric that maybe they have I'm not sure yet I have to update we shall see but anyways I love my Fitbit it is the best thing that I bought!
 I like my Fitbit but am interested in knowing how when I wake up and am walking to the kitchen it says I've already taken 91 - 150 steps?  That little trek is no more than 20 steps. I am also concerned at the heartbeat rate it shows at time??  Makes me skeptical on its accuracy. I do love the fact that I can switch out the bands that I can wear to the office, or gym or to the beach. I absolutely love the way I can see my text messages/calls come over the screen.
 I LOVE THIS.  I have a few co-workers who have been using this to keep track of steps per day and week and am amazed at how many they do.  I bought it for that reason and in hopes it will help to motive me into exercising more again especially after my knee surgery and it has done that in the last 3 days I have had it.  It has little reminders to go for a walk get moving and it is great.  I am so glad my co-workers talked me into this.
 In exactly one month the battery started dying really fast ! Not worth it and doesn’t fulfil the web description! If I’ve to charge it mid day it’s a ridiculous purchase !
 First time FitBit user, and I loved it. Item came within 2 or 3 days and I love it. I didn't even know I could set up to receive notifications of calls and text messages through it until a friend told me. They should give a real instructions guide to navigate, but google help me find the steps to set that up. Definitely keeps me on track and conscious of my health journey on a daily basis.<br/>Only drawbacks is that it will count steps when you clap your hands or if you type hard on a keyboard so misleading on making you think you walked more than you actually did, so sometimes I remove it when I work
 the watch is good looking and unobtrusive. The heart rate is very accurate compred with a polar strap (although it lost track a couple of times). The screen is visible except in intense sun (ok if you shade it with your body). The app is fantastic, and it encourages you. It has cute things: I tried a garmin and every hour it would orde rme "move"; the fitbit every hour says something like "take me for a walk" and a cute guy jumping.
 I have had a fit bit flex for several years and wanted to update with a watch.  I have had the Charge 2 for a few days but so far it is great.  My only negative is the cheap band it comes on.  You would think as much as it costs they would have put a better band on it.  The band is stiff and difficult to take off.  I just received 2 non fitbit bands today so hopefully they will be better.
 I have owned 3, stupid me for continuing to purchase.  All 3 had the band clip break withing 6 months, like clockwork. Fitbit seems happy to replace bands in warranty rather then improve product. 1 broken band caused me to lose the fitbit as it snapped while on a run, and dropped somewhere. No way to get that back. tracker is great, but I`ll buy a new brand as they refuse to solve this issue and insist on blaming user.
 It was easy to set up and sync with my Android phone.  As with any new device, it takes a bit getting used to, but if you go to their website, you can get helpful hints.  The battery seems to hold a decent charge.  Now, if it could only make me get up and actually move, that would be ideal.
 DO NOT BUY the Fitbit Charge 2 if you have a Huawei Honor 6x.  I was really happy with it when it automatically synced with my LG phone.  But then I bought the Huawei Honor 6x on Black Friday and it doesn't sync at all so I still sync it to my LG phone over wifi at the end of the day.  Did some research and found that the Honor 6x is not compatible with the Fitbit Charge 2.  Why?!  The Honor 6x has been out since October 2016 and one of the more popular budget cell phones.  Come on Fitbit team!  Push out an update.  What's taking you so long to make the Charge 2 compatible with the Honor 6x?!  Ugh!!!
 Amazing product, exactly what I expected from a big name at this price point. The only feature that is a little wonky is the step counter and it is definitely not off by very much. The sleep tracker is absolutely fantastic! Excellent new insight into my sleeping habits and patterns. Worth every penny. But I'd recommend a screen protector; it's solid but just like any other screen, it can definitely crack and break with enough of a beating.
 The Good:<br/>Great features<br/>Easy to use<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/>The HR monitor digs into your wrist right between the bones. If you look at the profile of the watch you can really see how this would be painful. I am going to return this for this reason and consider ordering a different one. So far I am looking at a Garmin or the Fitbit Surge, but both are more expensive by a 100, but they have a far more gentle profile that I think will be more comfortable overall.
 I purchased my FitBit in February 2017. I wore it religiously for about 6 months, cared for it appropriately, and then stopped wearing it. I recently charged it, updated it, and began wearing it again. Today, there were "dancing" lines across the screen and no display (however it was still syncing and recording to the app on my phone). I performed a hard reset per instructions from FitBit's site, but that did not work. I contacted FitBit Support who said it is broken. The best they would offer me is 25% off a new FitBit from their store. Needless to say, I won't be purchasing another FitBit. $130.00 is a lot to spend for something that only works for 6 months.
 I was excited to buy this product after reading a lot of reviews for the different kind of devices I could buy in this realm. However, two weeks into my purchase, I am very disappointed. The sleep tracking has been inconsistent and has not picked up data when I take naps. The heart rate tracking is often incorrect. Worst of all, the screen is not scratch-resistant at all. I have already developed two cracks in the screen despite not having dropped it once. Fitbit considers this accidental damage and won't replace it either. Overall, I would not recommend purchasing this device.
 i love this thing. I am trying to lead a healthier lifestyle and this truly helps. it reminds me every hour to get up and get some steps in. i have the app on my phone and together it is awesome. i track my meals by scanning bar codes or manually inputting them. it helps me set goals for weight loss too.<br/>i can read my text messages from my wrist and it notifies me when someone calls. it calculates my heart rate my sleep patterns and is very cute,i am really happy with this fitbit!!
 My Fitbit Charge 2 Heart Rate + Fitness Wristband I had received from you...I love it, and I will not go anywhere with out it. The only time I take this off is when I take my daily shower, and that's when I charge and sync it.<br/>I set the alarm and daily it would wake me up for work. I keep an eye on my heart rate, when its high, I do the breathing to lower it. I watch my steps<br/>and keep up with it. I now exercise more than I had in the passed. I lost my weigh and now maintain it on the Fitbit Site. I drink 64 ounces of water daily now, and I never liked water.<br/>My Fitness, Fitbit Band keeps me going at all times...and I feel good about myself and life. Everyone should own one...especially if they want to stay in shape and care about life.
 I'm not really a watch purchase but bought this for the fitness aspect. I work in healthcare so I also thought it would be useful to see who was calling/texting without pulling out my phone is front of patients. It worked well for those things. I just could not get used to the appearance...maybe just because I am not a watch person. The purple band stains very easily too. It works well though and I haven't had any issues with the function.
 Do not and I repeat Do not buy this if you drive a lot. There is no way to stop the Fitbit from recording steps while driving. Also there is no power button. It cannot be turned off. Very disappointed with this purchase.
 Not Sure I am fully sold on this yet.  It does not track my steps all of the time and always disconnects from the app.  I wore another tracking device on my wrist at the same time and the steps were almost doubled.  I will keep trying for a while but might switch back to the iWatch.
 Having these stats helps urge me to be more active, and while not 100% accurate it's still a great. I use it's alarm feature instead of my phone as the vibration is less annoying and more effective for me.<br/><br/>The call and text notifications seem to be fairly hit or miss. Sometimes they come through and sometimes nothing. Which to be fair might me more Bluetooth's fault and not the Fitbits. This isn't a smartwatch so you have to keep that in mind.
 Okay, so I finally jumped on the Fitbit train! Glad I did it! Love the color and it works fantastic. As a 51 year old heart attack survivor, I love the heart rate feature! I can track my fat burning rate and resting rate. The steps counter is cool and also the reminders to get up and move around since I work a desk job. Added bonus is being able to see incoming calls and texts and also I synced it with my Weight Watchers online app! Highly recommend!
 This is my first Fitbit, I really enjoy the size and the Fitbit app. However I found the band it came with really stiff and uncomfortable. There wasn’t any hole that properly fit my wrist. It was either cutting off circulation or too loose.  It made the Fitbit hard to sleep in for the sleep tracker. I bought a new soft leather band and it is much more comfortable!
 My sister has one and loves it, which is why I sought this model. I did not get an APPLE watch specifically because it said you could see on Fitbit Charge 2 whomever was calling or texting. That feature worked for about 1 week and regardless of the guidebook, help FACs, etc, it will not sync for messages and calls. Extremely disappointing and upsetting for the money.
 I love Fitbit and I have been using one for several years. This is my 3rd one. So far I like this model fine, but I took off a star for the band. I got the small but I have what my daughter calls a First World problem. The band is too loose on the 5th hole and can get snug sometimes on the 6th hole. I need a 5.5 hole! I wish they would come out with an expansion band like I have on my regular watch. That seems to be the only type band that works for my narrow wrist.
 This is my second Fitbit, the first one fell apart after a year and a half or more of heavy use, which I was fine with. This one is terrible though. Blanks out, doesn't record activities correctly - or at all - about 25% of the time. But I was inspired to write this review when I realized that this Fitbit isn't even counting my steps correctly! It's shorting me about 10-15% of steps. Good luck getting help from Fitbit, and I'm outside of Amazon's return window, so I guess I'm out $150!
 This FITBIT Product was very disappointing, it worked for a week and went out.  I called the help line, looked at reviews, etc. and to my amazement everything I found said this is an ongoing problem/issue with this product so why are they still selling it..., I just couldn't believe it.  Do you know how much of your time is wasted when companies sell a DEFECTIVE Product, it's irresponsible.  This is the second Fitbit to go out on me, I'M DONE!  I CAN SAY I AM SO VERY DISAPPOINTED I HAD PURCHASED THE EXTRA BANDS, I WISH IT HAD WORKED...
 Bought this as a replacement to my Charge HR as the face was getting scratched up. So far very pleased with the fact that I can replace the band, unlike the Charge. I also like the fact that I got the large and it fit great. I had to have the XL for the Charge. I was amazed at how easy it was to set up and deactivate the old one.  I am looking forward to losing another 45 pounds with this Fitbit. Great weight loss aid that gets you off your a@@ and walking for your health. It saved my life.
 the features and the color make me very happy. I like the guided breathing, the hourly prompts to get up and move help me with my goals and the look of this fitbit is sleeker than my old charge hr.  the only down side I've found is that the changeable band was coming open on it's own. the upside is that fitbit sent a new band when o contacted them and I discovered on my own that if I buckle the watch upside down that it is more secure.
 This is a wonderful product. It has consolidated my fitness apps into one. No longer do I need to count my steps, log my excersizes, water and calorie intake, and even wake up alarms with separate apps.<br/>I've had this device for about 3 months now and I've had little trouble. Once in a while the heart rate will either spike or disappear but that's to be expected form an always checking monitor. I've also had trouble finding the treadmill mode, as it's difficult to find it in the manual or the answer online. (By the way, if you're looking for the function you need to cycle through the excersize prompts by tapping on it).
 Love this fitbit. I got it back in August and it had been on my wrist every day ever since. It motivates me to get up and move. I didn't realize how little I did move until I got this. And the lbs will fall off if you are eating right and moving more. I was doing weight watchers before I bought this and had some success but this really kick started my weight loss into a second gear. I highly recommend it.
 I waited until this went on sale because I have a hard time paying that much for a product like this as I am not much on exercise. But I am glad that I got this as it helps remind me to get up and move when I am at work sitting behind my desk. I would recommend this. Wish the app could scan labels to automatically enter nutritious info to track for meals and that the get up and move reminders could be more than 14 hours but but other than that it works great!
 Purchased this for my wife, and it is a great heart rate and activity monitor.  The only reason I am rating this as 4 stars is because the brightness on the screen is fixed, so in the middle of the night, a small shift can trigger the screen to come on, and suddenly it seems like aliens are about to abduct someone (maybe a slight exaggeration, but it is quite bright).  If there was a way to dim the display at night, I would definitely rate this as a 5 star product.
 Hi There,<br/><br/>I got this product Christmas 2017.  I love the product itself, but the band seems to be defective.  It just breaks every three months or so.  Customer service is helpful and has sent a replacement band (free) every time (one year warranty).  However, yesterday it broke and I did not realize - the unit fell from my wrist and it is now lost.  Customer service does not cover lost/stolen unit, but I fought a bit and they are making an exception and will send me another unit free.  All that to say, if you have purchased this and the band is breaking, report it asap and request a replacement (don't pay for it).  Stop wearing the unit so that you do not loose it.
 It's a great product. If want a mid-range fitness tracker, this is the one. But there are few missing feature. The first is GPS, yes this is still cheaper than the Apple Watch series 2 but I believe if it was $20-$30 more they could have added GPS. It's really cumbersome to have a phone in your pocket while tracking your run. The second one is a REALLY big problem, Waterproofing or at least having water-resistantance. Sonyou would have a problem going to you sink to clean your hand. If this product had both then this would have got a 5 star rating. So I hope charge 3 at least gets one of them
 The fitbit overall is nice, but it's a bit difficult to view the time without having to press the button when the screen is blacked out after it becomes idle. It requires quite a bit of hand manouvre to activate the screen automatically in response to motion detection. This is a slightly annoying problem especially when you want to quickly glance at the time while your hands are busy or dirty.
 I bought the Fitbit Charge 2 and received it July 1st.  I put it on this morning and the screen is cracked down the middle.  Because it is outside of the 45 day warranty period, I was told it is out of warranty.  It is too bad because I really liked it.  The product is too expensive not to have a better warranty.  I am going to get an Apple Watch instead.
 I love my Charge 2! I used regular Charge for a while and also loved it, but when my band broke I decided to upgrade. This one is so much better. The large display is appreciated, and I like being able to see several things at once (time, date, steps). The only thing that's a downgrade from previous is that the vibrate for alarm is pretty weak, and it only lasts for a few seconds, so it's easy to miss if you're a strong sleeper, which I'm not, but still.
 I’ve had this product for about a year, I was very satisfied with it, but suddenly it only holds the charge for less than 24 hours. I use my Fitbit every single day and exercise at night. I am very disappointed with the quality of this product. In a year,  I pass to have a fitness tracker to have a useless $150 bracelet. I wrote to the Fitness support, and realize the battery test they asked for with bad results.<br/><br/>UPDATE: The Fitbit consumer service is very kind, the battery test shows bad results so they send me a new pebble that works as I spected.
 I thought long and hard about upgrating. I really liked my Charge HR and didn't want to part with it.. But it was worth it. Very comfortable, though slightly larger screen. Syncing is much faster which solves my frustration with the slow HR. Detection is much improved and I like the new menu options for easy tracking. Time to buy some different colored bands.. :)
 I have had my Fitbit Charge 2 for about 8 weeks now and thought it was time to write my review. I wear my Fitbit everyday and use it, along with the Fitbit app on my phone, primarily to track my heart rate during exercise to make sure I get enough cardio. I also use it to track calories burned in conjunction with Fatsecret to record my meal calories. My problem with this device is it doesn't accurately record my heart rate during exercise (and since I assume the device uses the heart rate to calculate calorie burn, it probably doesn't calculate calories either).<br/>I read the reviews from other users before I bought the device and was aware that during vigorous exercise or exercise with a lot of rapid arm movement, the device can't always find a pulse. That didn't bother me because that's not the type of exercise I do.<br/>I walk and use my stationary bike everyday. I walk the same course and either pedal 30 minutes at a constant pace or do a Peak 8 routine for 21 minutes. The metrics redorded during these activities varies wildly - for example, the course I walk is primarily downhill in one direction and uphill in the other. I expect to see a fairly constant heart rate in the downhill portion but on the uphill portion (approximately 1 mile), I expect my heart rate to escalate gradually to a max of about 135. Sometimes I see this and sometimes it bounces up and down without rhyme or reason. I have tried moving the device up and down both arms but it seems to make no difference. I see the same thing in the most simple session on the bike where I would expect a gradual increase to about 125-130. Again, the readings are variable - sometimes dropping to 80 only to return to the 125-130 range. The worst performance is during the Peak 8 exercise. During this exercise, you warm up for 3 minutes, then repeat 8 blocks of intense effort for 30 seconds, followed by a 90 second cool down. You finish with a further 2 minute cool down. I expect to see my heart rate escalate progressively with each block of effort, peaking around 160, then drop slightly during the cool down. My Fitbit will not track this activity with any accuracy.<br/>I have not tried to assess the accuracy of the step count or auto tracking any other exercise. I use the elliptical machine exercise setting to track my stationary bike exercise.<br/>I didn't own a watch prior to buying this device so that's basically what I use it for now. It does seem to track heart rate reasonably well when not exercising (checking it against my blood pressure machine) but I can't trust that I am getting an accurate reading of cardio exercise or calories burned.
 So I had or still have honestly as there was nothing wrong with it the charge hr, bought the new charge 2 thinking it would be sooo much better- I am not that impressed- not enough of an improvement to say hey pay $150 for this because it's so much better- it's cool, but not soooo much better. The band is stiffer and I don't think it's because it's new, slightly bulkier because the face is larger, the new features FOR ME were not really worth buying the next model honestly.
 I'm giving this a 3.5 for right now. I do not think this is very accurate though. I would love to think that I walk that much at work, but when checking it to other pedometers this thing is way high. I enjoy how it tracks my sleep though. I will update this after more use.<br/>A side note. I have large wrist and always hated wearing a watch because they were so tight. I got the xl size and could have used the large size.
 Excellent product. Never had an issue with it. I wish there were a medium wristband available though. I love the sleep tracker. It doesn't count steps while pushing a shopping card, so I have worn it in my pocket before. Love the in-app abilities to turn off the display with wrist motion and like that it is mostly comfortable. Beautiful color of eggplant purple.
 I love the Fitbit Charge 2!  It counts my steps, stairs, heart rate, it will read me my text messages, as well as notify me when I am getting a phone call.  This was definitely worth the money.  It syncs to my Fitbit app when I click into my app on my phone.  But it is nice to be able to see my step progress throughout the day without opening the app.  I previously owned the Fitbit Flex, which was great too.  But I love all the extras this one offers.
 This unit has many great features including step counter, heart monitor, and sleep evaluator.  I also like that it reminds you to get up and move once an hour if you've been stationary too long.  The battery life is great at 3-4 days between recharges.  Since I wear mine at night while sleeping, I usually put it on charge while I am showering or in the car on a longer drive.  It is very light weight.  I am using the Android app with it and that has many great features as well to track calories in and heart, my sleep, and other fitness goals.  Overall, I believe it deserves the five-star rating I gave it.
 I really like the Charge 2.  I gave my wife my old one and got a new one for myself.  It does everything I need it to do and I like this watchband better than previous models.  I would have gotten a Charge 3 but with all the negative reviews I got another Charge 2 instead.
 Good quality fitbit. The display is clear, does everything it says. I specifically wanted to see my HR on display, and this not only gives you that but steps, distance covered, a workout timer, and a relaxation mode that guides you through controlled breathing,<br/>Now the real question is, how did it affect my lifestyle? I can honestly say I am more active than I was, I was by no means sedentary, but definitely upped my workouts since I got it. A big factor is also my family members have it, and we 'compete' daily for steps. It keeps everyone active,
 The heart monitor stopped working about 3 months after I bought this. When I called Fitbit support they said you have to sync it every 7 days, if not then the data displayed can be inaccurate or not read anything like the heart monitor.
 I bought this item because the band on my surge broke. I LOVE this new fitbit. It does everything the surge does and more.  I like the fact that the bands are so easily interchangeable and the fact that this has the battery level on the screen. The letters on  the screen are very bright (unlike) the surge and the screen turns on automatically when I turn my wrist.  I am so happy my surge broke. This watch is well worth the money I paid for it.  Good job FITBIT!
 I don't normally review, but I have to because this product is so incredible. I bought this after almost eight months of researching and thinking. The tracker I used to have was a Garmin Vivofit. After looking through the app once I had my Charge 2 set up, I realized that I made the right choice for my lifestyle and needs/wants. I love this. It's a great color combination (lavender and rose gold). The functionality is as exactly as promised. I'm not disappointed at all.
 I had to send it back, it burned my arm one morning when my alarm was going off! I snatched it off and sent it right back. Unbeknownst to me they had a recall and they were being returned. I really liked my fitbit it was like my little best friend...that all of a sudden stabbed me in the arm with a branding iron :-(.
 I would like to give them a zero.  I recently bought the fitbit and only last for a month. I believe is fake. DONT WAIST YOUR MONEY.<br/>I had a previous fitbit for 4 years..I lost it on vacation, never gave me an issue.
 Bought my Charge 2 HR to replace my Flex.  I was never really happy with my Flex, with just the lights to give some idea as to the percentage of your target daily steps.  Bu this gives actual step count, distance, heart rate, cues you to rest for 2,or 5 minutes with breath rate!<br/>I absolutely love my Charge and will be using it to increase my distance and stamina in preparations for a European vacation this summer... Ths is a great tool to encourage and record progress!
 Have at this for almost a week now, and I am loving it. I originally wanted a smart watch, but decided i probably would not use it that much. This works really well for me.  The step counter is accurate, as is the heart rate monitor. You just have to make sure it is pushed up against the top of your wrist.<br/>Great product will recommend.
 I've been using Fitbits for quite a while (Flex and Alta) and bought one of these for myself and my wife. We are now using them religiously everyday and competing against each other. Seeing the progress that's being made in the Fitbit app has been great and really helps to keep us accountable. I highly recommend this for anyone looking to get a better idea of their fitness and activity level, particularly those who are motivated by seeing data and tracking numbers, etc.
 Just received this today...it won't sync or update.  Tried all the tricks....turned off/on Bluetooth, wifi, phone....it gets stuck during updating and a question mark appears on the screen.  This is going back in the box and getting returned.
 I am totally disgusted. I upgraded from the Fitbit Flex (which worked fine) to the Fitbit Charge 2. The main reason for my upgrade was to access new features, including "Reminder to Move" and breathing exercises. Reminder to move is USELESS. Vibration is so short and so low, that I don't even feel it. This has to be fixed and when it is, I would like my tracker replaced at NO COST TO ME!
 The clock part of the watch is very uncomfortable. It was very hard for me to adjust to wearing it because it feels so thick and heavy. Sometimes it does feel nice to give my wrist a break. The fitness reminders do help me remind me to not sit for so long. the sleep tracker is really based off of movement while you sleep. I have been trying to get into running daily which is why i bought this fit bit. I bought the rose gold because I felt that I could math it more to daily outfits and bought a rose gold band for the nights I want to dress my outfit up. The battery only stays charged for about a week, and take about an hour to fully charge again. The set up process was very simple and the app made for the fitbit is designed to tailor to your fitness goals.
 Absolutely love my fitbit! I work a job that involved a lot of walking and I wanted to be able to accurately track the distance and steps I was walking and this achieves that. I also love that it tracks the minutes I'm "active", and the monitoring of sleep cycles is amazing. It holds a charge for a very long time. I also love that it shows messages and calls from my phone. I have to keep my phone on me at work to be in contact with my bosses, and this allows me to see who is messaging me without actually taking my phone out. This is a fantastic product and well worth the money.
 I had this only 3 months when the magnetic part of the band and the fitbit started coming apart.  In one week it fell off my wrist 3 times.  The third time I was shopping and I never found it even though I backtracked for an hour.  It's extremely expensive if it is going to function only 3 months.
 I love the fitbit charge 2, especially because you can switch out the bands. It works great. I would give 5 stars, but the 1st one I got counted steps erroneously and I had to replace it. I would wake up in the morning and it would already count thousands of steps (43,000 on one occasion). Since I have my replacement I haven't had any issues.<br/><br/>The heart rate monitor is still inaccurate with the Charge 2, same as the 1st version. Oh well.
 This is my first Fitbit and I LOVE IT! Interesting device keeps track on my steps all day, what I love the most is the app, really fun to use and I had no idea that I had so many friends that use the app and we all compete each other on a daily bases. The only one complaint I have about and wish it had that it was waterproof that would make the watch perfect. Overall it's a great device and I recommend it for everyone!
 I love my fitbit charge 2.  We wnet on a cruise and I found that I could not charge it in any of the usb ports on the ship.  I asked other fitbit owners and they were able to charge their's.  When I got home I called the company and they sent me a new charger cord.  It works perfectly and I thank them for their cooperation.  Post cruise I had to have open-heart surgery to repair a leaky valve.  Having my fitbit charge 2 helps me keep track of my resting and active heart rate which is what I was advised to do.  Thank you to fitbit!!
 I am super happy with this purchase. I have had a Fitbit Flex for the longest time, but was wanting something that would do just a little bit more. First off, the standard rubber watch-like band is much more comfortable than the band from the Flex.  I purchased a "fancier" band to go with this Charge 2 and it works perfectly.  I like the features of steps, heartbeat, time.  Also the signals to get up and move and reach certain goals is super motivating.  It is cool how text messages come through as well.  I didn't want to be "wearing my phone" with an Apple Watch--this Charge 2 is just the ticket. I'm very happy with my purchase--easy to use, cool features, comfortable, good price.
 Neat device but BEWARE the face scratches very easily. I left it in my gym bag with my keys and the face got a horrible scratch when I took it out. A real pity because I love the functionality and look (before the scatch).  A real pity. I cannot recommend for that reason.
 I used to love Fitbit but I bought this in September and the band is already falling apart. One of the sides where it connects to the charging part keeps falling off and I have literally almost lost my Fitbit multiple times in a day from this happening. I have NEVER tried to take the bands off and this just started coming off on its own. For the cost of this stuff and the replacements I have had to do in the past with my fitbits I probably won’t get another one in the future. Sad to say because when it works I love it! But I’m tired of them breaking only after a short period of time
 Fitbit user since 2012.  Have used almost every version and even had two Apple watches. The Charge 2 is the happy place between the Watch, which even in a 38mm is too big and heavy and the Fitbit.  It has all the bells and whistles I need.  And I don't need to make and receive calls on my wrist...my name is not Dick Tracy...notifications work just great.  Prior to the Charge 2 I've owned an Alta HR, Alta, Flex, Charge and a One.
 So far good. I gave five stars earlier this year after purchasing. Working is okaybut having problems with the changeable band keeps falling off decided not to wear since I may loose it. I haven’t changed the band but since I have had it kept falling off one side. Not sure I would buy Again.
 this keeps heart rate and the app helps track food and water intake. Great for any type of work out!  The band is no longer lavender, it's a gross grayish color.  The plastic material lost color quickly.  I do suggest using a bit of vinegar/water on a cotton ball to keep the band clean, sweat free.
 i...love...my...fitbit charge 2!  I upgraded to this and love it!  The battery lasts for a little over a week.  It is easy to switch out bands and I love the different choices I have in clock faces and display options.  I use this for daily pedometer, heart rate, exercise tracking, sleep tracking and time keeping.  I also love being able to see calls and texts coming in.
 I love the way this Fitbit works, and the size, but after 18 months, the screen cracked.  Everyone I know with this model has had a similar experience.  Fitbit does not repair or replace, but offers 25% off a product on their web page.
 So far I like my Fitbit Charge 2. It is wider &amp; bigger than I thought. Still like it but wish it was waterproof. Really like the sleep tracker.<br/>I did NOT receive this free to write review. I bought it for my own exercise use &amp; sleep tracker. Add app Fitstar &amp; you get even more use out of watch!
 I have been wearing Fitbits since 2013, and am now on my 3rd or 4th one (Fitbit replaced a couple of them) -- so I am clearly a fan.  I have had my current one -- the Charge 2 --about 3 months.  The problem is the wristband, the buckle style that replaced the old button and slot style.  I have not  been able to get used to it; I find it much more difficult to put on and take off, and it is much bulkier.  I finally called Fitbit to find out if there was anything they could do to help me (hey, it was worth a try).  They were quite nice until they learned that I bought it from Amazon, then they lost interest.  So I looked for an alternative band on Amazon, and found the Swees replacement band.  It is perfect, and now I'm in love with my Fitbit again.
 In theory this is a very nice product but I have owned several fit bits with the charge 2 as the last. If you use it to work out, its going to break. If its just over the warranty period all fit bit will offer you is a 40% discount. Very low quality product. Further, every fitbit I have owned I have had to exchange because defects.
 My wife wears this everyday. Her only complaints are that it does not always give her an accurate "stairs" count, and that if she walks holding my hand or pushing a stroller or shopping cart that the steps are not recorded. Other than that she loves it!
 Auto display works occasionally usually when least needed.  Overall functions are ok so long has you don't mind having to press the side button to see just how fast your heart is beating, or how far you have gone or relay need a decent stop watch function.  Too expensive for the aggravation.
 Came charged enough for a full day, simple enough to set up, I'll update my review after some wear as several comments I've read mentioned band failure over time. I did install a screen protector and a silicone screen sleeve, which covers the joints so that may add protection to band failure. Those were very cheap, I recommend them if you are worried about screen damage or band fatigue issues.
 Battery and band lasted less than 2 years, no easy way to replace battery.<br/>Why don't we have 2 year warranty like European buyers do??
 It is December and my Fitbit is still working well. Wish I could say the same for the Fitbit Versa I bought my son for his birthday.<br/>I would like to get the Fitbit Charge 3 next because I love to swim, but will wait till the bugs are worked out!
 I really did love the Fitbit Charge for as long as it lasted, which was almost a year. I was always careful with it and treated it exactly as the manufacturer instructed. Still, the band broke and, as far as I can see, there is no way to replace it. I tried cementing it with Barge but it still wouldn't hold. I will miss it. I feel like a watch that is designed to be able to be used for running and working out, should hold up a bit better or at least have a way to replace the band
 I purchased a Fitbit Charge 2 last year. Foe some reason, the band's kept breaking. I thought it was because the band's were the plastic kind so I purchased a metal band. When I got the metal band, it wouldn't fit on one side. I then realized that it was the Fitbit that was faulty on the one side. I contacted the manufacturer to get a replacement. They would not replace the Fitbit. They would only give a 25% discount to purchase a new one. Now, I have a brand new band and a Fitbit that works, but can't wear.
 Only downfall I feel is that I have to charge it every few days. I know that's just how the company makes it and I like that it's rechargeable instead of a battery that will fail eventually. It has been awesome having it and glad I made the investment. I don't utilize enough of the functions as I'm lazy but it has so many purposes and you can set goals. Plus it tracks how I sleep when I wear it to bed.
 This is my first Fitbit. Being able to track calories in vs calories out is extremely helpful and motivates me to pay attention to what I put in my body. The main reason I wanted a Fitbit is for the heart rate tracking. Which is turning out to be pretty disappointing. When I am exercising, it tracks my heart rate at a much lower rate than what it actually is. My heart rate will be a true 120 and my Fitbit is displaying 75-90 beats per minute. This is not a one-time thing or I wouldn't give only 3 stars. I am typically exercising 6 mornings a week and the HR issue is constant. I guess I'd rather have it record that I'm working less hard than the opposite but it's disappointing to have it be so far off. I have read all the instructions and have moved the watch around from below my wrist bone to 2-3 fingers above with the same result. If anyone has any suggestions, I would gladly read them!
 I loved my Fitbit charge 2 and wore it faithfully everyday. I am a weightlifter and I work out everyday, so the fitbit is exactly what I needed in my life.<br/><br/>I bought my fitbit December 17th 2016. Of course I did research before purchasing and notice many reviews about a weak band and it breaking before a year was up.<br/><br/>Well, mine didn't it make it a year. It's Sept 23rd 2017 and my fitbit band is broken. Mind you I have never missed with the band, such as disconnecting it. I do wear it alot, almost everyday. However, if it can't live up to the standards of someone that lives a very active lifestyle that should be npted, it's not.<br/><br/>Sucks because this was a birthday present. I WOULD NOT recommend this product.  Save up some more money and buy the apple or Samsung watch.  I have read off brand athletic watches lasting longer than this.
 This is my 3rd fitbit. I was upgrading from my Charge HR specifically for the ability to record weight lifting and the movement reminders. However, this will be returned because the step counting is horrendous...folding clothes = 200 steps. Brushing teeth = 350 steps. Actual walking= 0 steps. I literally walked around my whole house and it recorded nothing. I switched wrist placement and everything. I do not trust this device at all so I will be returning it and going back to the HR. It's a shame because I was so excited.<br/><br/>Oh look 47 steps for posting this review. Uggghhh
 I love it!! Sad that the bands cost extra but that's what it is! Tracks heart rate very well (I did it the old fashioned way and it was exact), sleeping tracker is amazing, footsteps tracker works almost spot on, and the app is wonderful!! I'll admit, I was upset that I had to update my iphones operating system but that's because I had iOS8 and it was a long time coming! (App works with iOS9 or later) Nevertheless, the Fitbit itself is a great product for active people like me!! Worth the investment!!!
 LOVE THIS!! it's more than I expected and exactly what I wanted the Fitbit to be.  got Apple Watch too for Christmas and don't really like it. Much prefer this for fitness and step counting. Love too, that it does floors. I know a lot of folks may not share my sentiments, but everyone has different needs and this band is so much nicer than the one I had from last year.  The Fitbit Rose gold is wonderful.  LOVE IT - and it works great!
 The Charge 2 has been wonderful for me!  I have been wanting to lose weight and the device helps keep me motivated to walk and exercise.  The Fitbit app helps me keep track of my calories each day, in and out.  I have lost 5 pounds in the last two weeks, 35 more to go to get to my goal.  The watch is actually very durable also, which is a must for me because I am always bumping it on things.
 This was exactly as expected and fit wonderfully.  I was torn between the small and large band.  I was perfectly fit for the small band but wouldn't of had much room to adjust...I am glad I went with the larger band to allow for movement. My favorite feature besides the steps counter is that it tracks my sleep. I would recommend this to anyone.
 Awesome fitness watch! I have tried several smart watches (Samsung, Motorola, Asus) and they were always so off on pedometer and sleep tracking. I don't care about text or calls with the watch, so I decided to try an actual fitness watch. I had a Fitbit flex for several years and decided to upgrade to the charge 2 and it's amazing. Sleek, accurate, and top notch.
 I would give this a 5 but the color on the sides of my band are starting to wear away after only a month or two of wear. Love the rose gold.<br/><br/>The interface is great and easy to use. The directions were helpful and step by step. I enjoy the new relaxation feature &amp; the "party" when you reach your step goal for the day! The workout mode with the target HR is wonderful too.<br/><br/>The small fits my wrist perfectly. Charges quickly.
 I love this little motivating tool!  My son is the person that encouraged me to get one of these and I must say that I am not sorry that I did.  It's nothing like having visuals to track your steps, sleep, miles etc. The only negative that I found about it was when I went to their website to view my dashboard, my computer blocked the page informing me there was malware. I have a MacBook running Avast for protection.  I don't seem to have an issue viewing the dashboard on my iphone7 plus or iPad mini.
 Overall, a nice fitness watch with two significant shortcomings. First, the vibrate feature on the watch is weak and not enough vibration to use as a silent alarm clock as I don't feel it on my wrist when it goes off. Second, the automatic sleep measuring doesn't work well enough since it often fails to properly detect when you go to sleep and when you wake up which causes faulty sleeping period measurements.
 The best decision I made to help me reach my fitness goals. I feel like I'm constantly challenging myself to reach the goals I set for myself because the darn thing keeps reminding me to keep on moving! I love how it can sync with my phone and I can read text messages and see who's calling from it. I don't mind that I can't reply to texts, I figure, it's definitely faster to just grab my phone and text that way. Anyway, definitely a good fitness tracker.
 The Fitbit is comfortable to wear and gives you so much information regarding your physical activities and sleep patterns. It sends reminders to get moving and actually praises you when you do well. I like it!
 Love how easy it is to use and how comfortable it is to wear. I do not like that even though it is water resistant they say not to wear it in the shower and swimming. How can my phone be water proof but not a watch...<br/><br/>Update 11-23-18: the band broke on one side and needed to be replaced. Thankfully bands are cheap and easy to replace but kind of surprised they do not last longer.
 This updated Fitbit charge 2 Heart Rate and fitness wristband gives much information regarding steps taken during the day, miles walked, calories used, fat burned, and heart rate and steps climbed. It will also measure exercise completed with a stop/start timer, but is not water proof unfortunately. Hopefully Fitbit will come out with a waterproof version soon.
 I like the Fitbit product line in general. This one has an elegant, modern appearance. It also has many features, but I don’t want to devote that much time using all of them, but perhaps some people do. The Fitbit app is very useful if you want to track your exercise and calorie consumption and lose weight. It also monitors the quality of your sleep, which I find interesting. The latex bands are awful and uncomfortable. Buy one of the Maledan magnetic stainless steel bands instead.
 Nice,<br/>Everything you need, nothing you don't. Just buy it. Wish a smart watch would just do what this does, have a world time function and last for a few days on battery power,  Just like the Fitbit. I can't figure out why that is such an issue. Great product here though. If the distances seem off, just adjust your stride length. I have it wired now and it's perfect.
 I had the Charge HR before my dog got a hold of it, and when I wanted to replace that fitbit, I figured it was time for a upgrade. I had considered going for the $250 version but then I saw that the Charge 2 has all the same features of the big watches in a smaller package. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who like the Charge HR and wants to upgrade to the Surge. This watch does all the same things but isn't bulky or insanely expensive. I also like that you can change the bands, I'm waiting on a leather band to arrive so I can have it look less like a fitbit and more like a watch.
 It works well. The issue is the planned obsolescence.<br/>After less that two years the battery is dead. Fitbit does not offer any type of battery replacement. So you’re out.<br/>Essentially any Fitbit tracker you but is a recurring purchase.<br/>Maddening done the product itself is good.
 I really enjoyed keeping track of my heart rate and steps, but recently I've noticed the the step counting is way off, too high. As an example, when waking in the morning, I put it on and while shaving notice that I've gotten hundreds of steps. This evening I have 21,000+ steps, no way that I've walked that far. Oh well, the return window has expired, so I guess I've learned a lesson, and I'll look for a better product in the future.
 Love my fitbit! Love the app! So easy to use and set up!  Wish they had blood pressure feature, but until then....It is almost addicting and it makes you want to do better in your daily activities, eat healthier, and drink more water, plus it tells time! Truly happy with it!
 This is a great little gadget if you want to improve tracking your fitness and overall health. I have a few issues with the app but the device works great and syncs well with the app.
 Had the fitbit for exactly 1 year with no problems, I loved everything about it.  I purchased on 3/27/2018.  On 3/29/2019 the time went crazy and would not display the correct time.  2 days out of warranty.  Fitbit said basically "to bad, so sad".  After reading the reviews, I'm done with this brand.
 My experience with Fitbit knows some ups and downs. In the course of the years, I bought a few Fitbit models and realized that their wristbands tear after a while. Almost lost my Charge 2. Asked for band replacement but warranty expired. I will probably look for another brand next purchase.
 I am unable to set up the menus using a laptop computer.  I downloaded the software but am unable to communicate with the watch to set the heart rate monitor.  I believe to use this watch and menus you need a smartphone in addition to a computer and watch.  In order to use the watch to its full potential I will have to get a smart phone to complete the loop.
 Not a lot to say...I have been very pleased with the Fitbit Charge 2.  I have owned three earlier versions of the Fitbit and this is the best one I have used to this point.  I charge it about once every 4 to 6 days.  I use the Fitbit App as well as the weight scale to sync all of my data.  I did replace the rubber wrist band with the "Bayite Milanese Replacement Bands for Fitbit" (metal) which provides for a much nicer look.
 So this makes my third Fitbit and ready to quit and find something better. First the positive yes it is easy to setup. I like how it tracks and it is waterproof. But it feels cheap the first I had just started falling apart because I sweat too much and it starts to break down. The band's break so easily and feel cheap. It's not worth it in the long run. And I will be looking into a better fitness tracker. It does its job but at a price
 I upgraded from the Flex and love this one! Just the right size and features. I am an average size woman 5'5" 135lbs, I got the small and it fits perfect with 6 holes left on the strap to make larger. I purchased the Fitbit Alta when it just came out but it had to many syncing issues so I returned it. I've had no problems with the Charge 2, I'm happy with this purchase!!
 I've had this for awhile and it works good. I like being able to track my walks and exercises. I also like doing challenges with friends on it. However, sometimes this is not so accurate.. I noticed while I was driving and at midnight it resets to 0 steps. And while still driving, when I finally got to my location and stopped for the first time, I had over 500 steps while sitting in a drivers seat not walking at all..
 I love my Fitbit Charge 2! Only one problem, does not have dimmer light display and will randomly light up and blind you at night if you rollover in bed. Seems like a dumb problem since it knows you're sleeping (or at least you can tell it your bedtime).<br/><br/>It's a clunky wristband, not very ladylike if that's an issue for you. There are other "stylish" Fitbits but otherwise the features are great on the Charge 2.
 This is the nicest looking fit- watch I found. Got the rose-gold bayite band and have received many compliments.<br/> I sure wish I could read emails, messages &amp; see phone calls received; and have an option to give a short reply. I do miss that. Then too, need to use MyFitnessPal and Samsung Health plus Fitbit app to record different activities. - that is somewhat frustrating.
 Very good customer service.<br/><br/>After only a few weeks I realized that the battery wasn't lasting as long as specs said. Should have been lasting 5-7 days yet I needed to recharge every 24 hours. I called customer service and they rushed me a replacement at no charge and with no need to send in the defective model.
 Monitors your heart rate and counts how many steps you take and how many stairs climbed.  Shows the total number of miles you run and walk;<br/>gives you weekly statistics of your activity level and has a silent alarm.  Very easy to use and well worth it for someone who runs or wants to track their activity level every day.  Also good for monitoring sleep and nutrition and it tells how many calories burned also.
 I hate the band, but I love the product. Tracks my heart rate and various work outs. Text messages and phone calls work better if you have an IPhone. I switched from an android and the phone calls would come up "unknown", with the iPhone is actually shows the contacts name. I like it better than the alta
 Purchased as a gift for my wife.  Setup was easy and the app is very intuitive.  She likes the form and fit of the Charge 2.  I considered the Samsung Fit series but chose the Fitbit given the slightly smaller form factor.  I'll update the review after she has had time to really use the device.  Thus far it has proven to work well.
 Love the Fitbit Charge 2!!! Wear it all the time and enjoy the feedback it gives at the end of the day and weekly activity summaries!!  It took me a while to get used to it because I had been wearing a Vivosmart from Garmin.... kept wanting to tap when I needed to click.  But now that I'm used to it, I really like it.  I have not used it to track my sleep and don't use the calorie tracker but all other functions are used everyday.
 This is great and I love it! I'm very glad that I got it. My only complaint (and pretty minor by the way) is that it doesn't do the best job reading my resting pulse. It seems to track it once I'm up and moving around. Or it will track my pulse when the Fitbit is in my pocket... Not sure how it thinks that works haha. But otherwise I really like it and I would still recommend.
 Nice for short time it worked. Quit syncing about a month ago-after 4 months of use. Can’t get it to sync anymore which renders it nothing more than a poor time piece. 4 months and useless. I was thinking of getting an Apple Watch and decided on this. Don’t waste your money like I did. Wish I had spent the money on an Apple Watch.
 The Fitbit Charge is great. I wear it every day. I wish it would come with more than just the one band, but that's the beauty of extra band sales. Also, do not plan to wear it on your wrist if you push a stroller or shopping cart. Many a day of thousands of steps have been lost, because it reads the movement of your hand, not your steps. In this case be sure to put it in your shoe or pocket. I'd love to have a band option that would go around your ankle.
 Don't know what is happening here. Got the Charge 2 for myself about a year ago and it sync'ed with all my devices, a laptop, a Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime phone, and my good ol' Kindle Fire. Got a Charge 2 for my wife for Xmas and right after New Years only the Windows based laptop will sync with either Charge2. So I contacted support and the chat person could only tell me that my phone wasn't on their list. So why did it quit working all of a sudden? Won't buy Fitbit again.....
 I bought this product because my Polar sports watch died. I am so glad I did because it has become a daily part of my life as I track both my activity levels and also my sleep patterns. I would recommend it to anyone looking to motivate themself to improve their health and fitness!
 Loving this Fitbit Charge 2. I use to own the Microsoft Band until the band literally fell apart from the poor design. I loved the Microsoft band because I would get alerts and see my email messages, text messages and calls. It was like having a mini computer on my wrist. This fitbit charge 2 only does text and call alerts and calendar alerts. It does not do email alerts or show email messages. Other than that, it works great for keeping up with exercise, steps, heart rate and sleep monitoring! I'm enjoying it!
 I bought this to replace my 3 year old Fitbit and let me tell you, HUGE difference compared to the older ones.<br/><br/>I was just going to buy the cheapest wrist fitness monitor I could find but I loved my old Fitbit so much I figured why not<br/><br/>I dont regret it at all
 If you are wanting an acurate HR, this is not for you.  I adjusted this 10 different ways on my wrist and during a workout couldn't get an acurate reading.  No issues when not working out.  To compare i wore a chest strap with my polar watch and the fitbit.  The Polar would say my HR was over 160 doing HIIT and the fitbit said my HR was 112.  I tried this during several different workouts.  Frustrating i really wanted to use the Fitbit.
 I had a Fitbit HR and decided to get the Charge 2. I Love it!! It has move features to get me motivated. I like how it tracks your runs with GPS and your pace. I also like it shows your text messages. I wish it had the same vibration as the HR, it is a bit weaker. I also like you can change the bands. My HR was a large so I got a large and it is too big. They do give measurements, but I just got a smaller band. They change easily.
 This is my third Fitbit.  The first lasted about 8 months.  The company honored their 1 year warranty and sent me another.  It lasted about 6 months. This one lasted only 5 months.  The first two just quit working.  The band on this one will not stay attached to the device.<br/><br/>They are just not built to last.  Think I will buy  something else this  time.
 I've had my fitbit a little over 4 months now and I love it even more now. At first I was a little disappointed that the battery was only lasting a few days but after a few weeks of getting use to it and not checking it every 5 seconds I realized the battery last a lot longer. So far it seems pretty accurate , it definitely knows about the naps I take after work lol and for the most part my coworkers and I are on par when comparing stats with different devices. Great motivational tool to remind you to move, especially on the weekends, where I realized what a lazy piece of crap I am. Thank you Fitbit
 Poor build quality. Not designed to last longer than a year IMO. Bands break frequently and Fitbit will only offer you 25% off a new one. Will not buy again.
 Great fitness tracker. It works perfectly, it looks good on your hand, so you can use it every day at the office, at the gym. Its battery last between 4-5 days, and it is very quick to charge, just 30-60 minutes and it's ready to go. You can recieve alerts from incoming calls, messages (from your message app or from whatsapp) and calendar alerts (from google calendar or from your device's built in calendar app). The only drawback that I found is that this device is not warter resistant. And the screen has to be protected otherwise it will scracth rather easily. Overall great product. Very satisfied with it.<br/><br/>The app from fitbit is awesome as well it displays how did you sleep, how many steps you did, allows to keep track on your meals, and the amount of water you drink, also it allows you to stablish goals of the amount of hours you sleep,among other. It plots how much calories you spent during the day and and shows a graphic where it is displayed your heart beats per minute during the day and during the sports you choose.
 Worked great first day. Since then it isn’t accurate. Many bugs and issues. Would not buy until FITBIT fixed the issues. Only reason not sending back is that other one fell apart after three years. Read other reviews.<br/>Stair, active hours. Not even close.<br/>UPDATE. Junk.  Quirky readings all over the board. Never buy another Fitbit
 (12/13/18) Bought this at the end of June and it stopped working beginning of December. Only wore it on the weekends (sometimes).<br/>Not sure how they plan on taking care of this, but if they back the product, I will edit the review...<br/>**EDIT** (12-14-18) Read warranty, called direct to Fitbit Customer Service @ 8:15pm PST.<br/>Ran a couple of trouble shooting exercises while on the phone. Got an e-mail during the call offering a new Fitbit or 50% off the purchase of another model (excluding Charge 3 and Ace). I don't have to send anything in or fill out paperwork. DONE!<br/>Well done Fitbit!
 The quality of this unit have surpassed my expectations.  Found it actually helps with training by offering different programs for strength, endurance, and so many icons and services that I had no idea existed.  The delivery was difficult as the correct size was miss-handled.  It made the purchase, returns and numerous calls somewhat of a  hassle, but all has been resolved and ended with my daughter getting what she required.<br/>Many thanks!
 Used for less than a month and it suddenly died.  Customer Service promptly offered to send replacement.  Wish I could just have purchase refund.  I guess it is a known issue that these can suddenly fail
 There are bugs with the technology and I have wasted a lot of time troubleshooting them. Right out of the box, it refused to sync to my galaxy s3. It randomly stops syncing during workout and the heart rate varies wildly.<br/><br/>Like other reviews have pointed out, it's too uncomfortable to sleep with.
 Fitbit is still the best activity watch for the price.  Not very practical to use as a sleep monitor though as it is really uncomfortable to sleep with.  But the comp anion app for tracking activity, calories, and burn is absolutely the best in the market a must buy for anyone looking for a great fitness tracker.
 this is so much better looking than the old fitbit charge.  It is more feminine and sleeker.  Having the new band is part of the looks solution:  it does not look as cheap.  If you spring for a leather band it looks even better.  The charger is new so you can throw away older fitbit chargers.  Overall I am pretty happy with it.  I always felt like I should slop the hogs in the old on as opposed to going out for dinner.  Thanks, fitbit!
 I love the Fitbit!  The step count keeps me more active than before.  I go to the gym regularly and am fit, but the Fitbit challenges me to be more consistent on a daily basis. The sleep information was eye-opening!  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the battery.  I would like to have more notice when the battery is low since I don't carry the charger around.  Maybe I just need to get in a groove of recharging on a set routine.  I recommend it for anyone who wants to increase their fitness, even if you are already in fairly good shape.
 I have been a fit bit fan for many years. This is the 3rd model I have owned.  I have updated to this model from the Fitbit one.  WOW! What a upgrade. Love the Charge, the reports, and the website.
 I'm really disappointed with the quality of this product.  I purchased the Charge 2 on June 1st on July 21st I reached out to Fitbit because the band of the tracker started to peal away which clearly is a defect an Fitbit thought so too and mailed me a replacement. I'm a very active person and wear my fitbit 24/7 except when I'm in the shower or if it really needs a charge. I would expect the quality to be much better for the price that you pay and last more than two months another bummer is that the replacement band that they sent me isn't the limited edition band so why pay extra for something that they can't even replace?
 Excellent. I love all the features on this fitbit. I tried the Charge HR and I didn't like the small screen. I love that you can see all your stats on this large screen. I love that you can track your exercise so easily and the silent alarms are great.<br/>I also love that you can change the bands.<br/>It is a little bulky, though. I notice it more now in the winter since it gets in the way of my long sleeves. That is really the only con of this device, but don't let that deter you!
 This watch is beautiful, fairly comfortable and pretty accurate. I loved the display and all the formats. The only downside and reason I had I return is almost all of my communication happens over WhatsApp, which isn’t supported by fitbits and iPhones. That was the only downside as I really needed a watch that could do the fitness tracking along with the notifications.
 I purchased this for my wife.  Although she is not an overly "technical" person, she has really enjoyed using her fitbit.  It looks great, and is not overly large on her wrist.  The build quality seems to be excellent, and I feel that we got our money's worth with this product.  No regrets!
 I love that I can set reminders to stand and walk. I used to be less conscious about how long I sat at my desk. Thanks to the FitBit, I can set reminders and goals. I have learned a lot about how asleep and set goals to sleep more. It's comfortable and the band is still holding up. No issues. I definitely recommend this product if you are someone starting your fitness path or someone already working out. Tracks everything it says it does. Great product. I don't regret the money I invested in this little thing.
 This item was a gift. After I gave it to the recipient, I wished I'd kept it for myself. I have the fitbit one and was thoroughly jealous when I saw this one in action. Needless to say the fitbit one is collecting dust as I purchased another Charge 2 but had to pay more money because it was no longer on sale. Well worth it!
 While I love all the extras that come with the Charge 2 I find that it does not record all of my steps.  Not even close.  I had a Fitbit flex for 2 years and loved it.  I do the same workouts and walks as before  but with the Charge 2 I am always about 3,000 steps less.  If I am<br/>pushing a stroller or carrying a laundry basket it doesn’t change at all.  Very disappointed about this.
 The heart rate tracking has been steadily getting less and less accurate. I constantly catch it 30-50 BPM lower than the HR readings from cardio machines and from counting my pulses manually. It never used to be so blatantly inaccurate, but I began realizing it one day a couple months ago and it hasn't changed since then! Nothing works to "remedy" this: no tightening, no loosening, no shifting it up or down the wrist, nothing... I'm pretty disappointed because I got this Fitbit after my charge HR hoping for quality HR and exercise tracking and it has been consistently failing to deliver on that massive part of its feature set.
 I've owned the Fitbit Charge 2 for nine months and until today I really liked it.  Unfortunately, there is a crack from the top of the screen running vertically 3/4's of the way down.  I don't recall hitting the screen and generally take very good care of the Fitbit.  Others have complained about similar experiences.  In the absence of this obvious defect I would have given a five star rating.  Although it is still functioning, I fear it's on borrowed time and will not last the year.  A fair amount of money to spend on a product that is plagued with a weak component.
 Best Fitbit I’ve ever owned! I love the hourly encouragement to get more steps if I’m caught up in a good book. Keeps me moving and motivated to do so. I also like that it picks up my exercise without me having to log it manually. The sleep information is also very helpful. I bought this to help make some lifestyle changes (mainly sleep and exercise), and it is exceeding my expectations. Soooo easy! I will start using the food and calorie feature at some point when I’m ready too, which also seems very easy.
 Got this as an Amazon gift card present to replace my Fitbit One ... and a great substitute! Keeps track of everything, including sleep, without punching buttons. And the lighted face with time, date, and steps comes on with a twist of the wrist. Also gives nice reminders to "step it up!" when I've been lazy. The only drawback is a need to charge more often (every 4-5 days) than the Fitbit One.
 Sync program is unbelievably  difficult.  Finally gave up but need to sync for new time zone.  No way to manually set time without syncing.  Ready to go back to Timex watch.  Initial set up very easy but decided to stop syncing after four months.
 Compared to my old Charge HR my Charge 2 is more like a Charge 10! It does so much more it is hard to describe the differences. The display screen is about five times larger which allows me to see so much more in a single glance. I am able to check my heart rate so much quicker and easier than before since it is on the main display. I love that I can select and set alarms instantly with the watch instead of having to use the fitbit software. The relaxation mode is excellent when I get stressed out. The other day when I got my 10,000 steps I got a Rocket blasting off which was Awesome! I am glad I decided to step up my stepping with the Charge 2!
 I'm a 70 yr. old female.  I have thin wrists.  I bought the small wrist band.  All that said, I couldn't get an accurate blood pressure reading out of it.  I had to default to using my husband's old fashioned monitor (the one that uses a band around the chest) to get an accurate reading.  I did work with fitbit on setting the watch up.  A lot of bells &amp; whistles I don't need. Customer service is adequate (sometimes the assistants had accents too thick to understand what they were saying).  After working with it for about a month, I gave up.  I'm sending it back for a full refund.
 I'm a first time Fitbit buyer. I needed a Fitbit for an online Phys. Ed. class for college, and decided if I was already spending the money I was just going to get this one. What I like about it is it tracks my sleep, alerts me of notifications from my phone, and counts flights of stairs also. This one has a "relax" mode which basically helps you meditate and breathe into relaxation. Haven't tried that part yet but that wasn't a big thing for me anyhow. What I don't like on it, it's not always accurate on step counting! If I'm sitting on the chair for an hour, it can rack up 100 steps. It's very touchy to movement. The only thing I can see to help this would be buy the next size up and wear it on your ankle if you want true step counting. Size wise I don't find it to be to big on my wrist, it seems proportionate and just the size a watch would be anyhow.
 I got the fitbit because it can track many different workouts including high intensity interval training, which was hard to find elsewhere. It monitors my heart rate at all times of the day, which is starting to become something I focus my health on. It tracks my sleep as well and shows how (not so good) I sleep through out the entire night, even if I get up for periods at a time. I am very happy with this purchase.
 I had charge hr for a year. I was happy with it except band had some problem it started to peal. Fitbit replaced with new one but when new charge 2 came I saw they improved several things including band situation. I order one and metal magnetic Fitbit band with combination it looks great. Battery last longer new functions including reminder to stand up breath exercises (too basic can be better ) Only thing vibration as not strong as charge hr.
 This was a great product until it broke two months after purchased. The metal bar that clasps together like a watch broke even though it wasn't worn too tight on the wrist. Not sure if I can get a replacement part for this because the actual fit bit mechanism is fine but it doesn't do much good if it can't be worn on the wrist :(
 I've had it for about 2 years now and it's still going strong. The wristband that it comes with didn't hold up quite as much, but you can easily replace it with a sturdier one. Great features, and if you connect it with the app on your phone, it lets you see text messages and phone calls that come in. I didn't even know about that until after I bought it. Great product.
 Received this on January 24 and, at first, was very happy with it. About the end of June, the display died, pixel by pixel, over the course of a few days. I discovered while looking for a fix that this was depressingly common. Emails and photos to Fitbit support secured the promise of a replacement which eventually arrived. Overnight charge, then attempted to pair it to my iPhone 6. Also attempted to pair with an Android tablet. I rebooted, reset, reinstalled, restarted at least 20 times. The Charge 2 would consistently reach the point of generating the pairing code, then shut down when it was entered. I'm an IT worker. I read the directions. I followed the troubleshooting instructions repeatedly. No success. Do yourself a favor and avoid the frustration. Just flush $100+ dollars down the toilet and pretend that you bought one of these. After the Blaze that lasted less than a year and now this, I'm through with Fitbit.<br/><br/>7/18/17 Update: Received Charge #3 today and had no problem pairing this one. We'll see how long it lasts. I must say that Fitbit support was very easy to work with IF you have your evidence in hand (purchase receipt, photo of dead screen, attempted troubleshooting). The fact that they were so willing to send replacements and didn't even want the dead units returned is somewhat troubling, suggesting that they do this a lot! Hope this one lasts.
 So I bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas because she had a Fitbit Charge before and it broke or something. Thought it'll be nice since its suppose to be the newer one but turns out she really didn't like Fitbits anymore from her last experience. Something about the rubber and the straps were falling apart within weeks. So now she told me to review this new Fitbit Charge 2 as a 3 star pending a few more weeks of use...
 While the fitbit charge 2 is great.....the band, NOT SO MUCH.  After only 2 months of having it and wearing it daily, the band kept popping off. Eventually he was running one day and it came off of his wrist while running and the screen cracked.  I  unfortunately] did not call right away and my son eventually just threw it away because it wasn't usable any longer.  Fitbit customer care (which is NORMALLY AMAZING...replace my pebble for my blaze before), wants me to send in a photo of the broken fitbit which we  obviously] no longer have.  They did not require a photo of my Blaze when they replaced it so it didn't even occur to me to take a picture of it before tossing it :(  They offered a 25% discount......but their website has it for 149.95 and I paid approx. $124 through Amazon for it....the 25% discount only makes it about $12 less than the original one that I bought through Amazon :(
 I got this for my DH, and myself.  He’s track his steps and he is motivated to reach 10000.  Me, I like the sleep tracker, the watch, and that I get texts and meeting reminders!  Awesome!
 Not happy with this Fitbit charge 2 HR.  It does not track steps accurately at all. It also does not track sleep accurately as some nights it just doesn’t show anything for sleep tracking.  I plan to return and glad I purchased the insurance.  Unfortunately I never received the email for the insurance but I have proof that I ordered it so I am hoping I will get a replacement that works.
 Really glad I bought my Fitbit. It's awesome in the sense that it gets the job done and isn't uncomfortable to wear. Really great for keeping track of steps and encourages you to get a walk in every hour, which is great when you're sitting at a desk all day. I really find the relaxation tool great as it helps me get my breathing down and prepare for bed. My only gripe is that it sometimes loses track of my heartbeat when working out, but other than that it's great.
 I love that it tracks my steps, sleep, heart rate etc. BUT it is not very responsive in lighting up/turning on when you turn your wrist to look at the screen.  You also have to tap rather hard on the screen a FEW times to get it on.  Could use some minor improvements, but it is a helpful tool in tracking your activity levels, time and reminders.
 While I love my fitbit, I will say that today the top band (the side with the buckle) broke.  After taking a look at how it's designed and where the break spot was I believe it is a result of taking it on and off (once a day when I shower).  As expensive as these things are you'd think the band would last longer than a few months.
 Cannot say enough great things about my Fitbit Charge 2!  I love everything about it.  It motivates me to move and automatically tracks all my active activities even when I forget to log it.  From sleep to bicycling, walking, or a simple workout, this keeps track of it all!
 I love this tracker! After an unfortunate experience with another tracker, (Misfit Shine) I am impressed. It is incredibly easy to set up. The step counter is as accurate as they come. You can enter foods eaten, set goals, receive motivational notifications, and notifications from your phone. It is dead on accurate about sleep tracking, as well. A charge lasts about 5 days, and recharging takes only a few hours. This thing does it all.
 This product has several issues.  They say it's "sweat resistant", not water proof.  However, when I work out and sweat, the pulse rate is very inaccurate or doesn't work at all.  (Off as much as 40 beats per minute----MAJOR ISSUE!)  I have to take it off and dry the back of it and dry my arm.<br/>It sometimes switches off the exercise mode during the exercise and I have to manually log it in the app.<br/>You cannot edit any exercise distance in the app. (Big issue)  It never matches the distance from the treadmill.  Also, you cannot edit anything for a stationary bike.<br/>If you work nights, you have to work out at the same time of night.  It resets at midnight. So if you work out after midnight one night, go to bed during the day, and then work out before midnight the next, it all gets logged on the same day.  This may not be an issue for most people, but it kind of sucks for us night people.<br/>I have contacted customer support and I just get emails with instructions that are from the manual that I read before I but it on in the beginning.
 I like it a lot. I like the heart rate monitor and that it estimates how many calories you've burned in a day and in a work out. I think the foot step counting is off however bc I'll be up for half an hour and just went to brush my teeth in my small apartment and it's like you walked 200 steps, no way! So I wonder how much then the calorie burning is off
 I have had this now for 9 months and love it. It syncs great with my iphone, the battery lasts for about 4-5 days usually. It works great. Recently, the tracker stopped working correctly. The green light just always stayed on and it stopped tracking my heart rate. I emailed customer service for the fitbit, and they were amazing. They tried to problem shoot with me, and when that did not work they completely replaced my Charge 2 and sent me a new one free of charge. Not only is this a great tracker, but customer service for FitBit is amazing.
 Looking for an activity tracker that tracks running, steps, stairs, rowing and yoga.  I was also looking for something that would fit and didn't look like I borrowed a linebacker's watch.<br/>Pros- Nice tracker, after wearing for a few days it started tracking better.  The first time I ran it recorded 33 flights of stairs.  The next few times were correct.  Nice app.  Clear lettering.  Floor counting. Automatic tracking of exercise like yoga and rowing.<br/>Cons- Too Big!  I don't believe the models in the pics have the full Charge 2 on their wrist.  There is protrusion in the back that is quite large.  It doesn't sit flat on your wrist if you don't have much 'meat on your bones'.  The tracker was too long for my wrist. If you can wear this large item on your wrist and try to sleep with it on, you might be blinded by the light when you roll over.  There is no way to turn it off.  Phone notifications and texts did not work.<br/>For the same amount of money, there are other trackers with more bells and whistles.<br/>Ended up buying- Samsung Fit2
 Okay, I've only had my Fitbit for 3 days, but I LOVE IT !!!  I know the steps are not 100% accurate, but hey, I love that it reminds to keep moving (250 steps every hour with a reminder at 50 minutes). Love the sleep monitor, heart rate tracker, etc.  It's the perfect color of blue.  I bought the large -- measure your wrist with a  flexible measuring tape to ensure you get the right size.
 I got this as a gift for my boyfriend as an early Christmas gift, he ended up loving it - and he is not a watch guy. The only thing I was disappointed with, was that he could not view the text messages or answer/decline calls from his watch which my outdated gearfit could do. That would have put it at a 5 star for sure!
 Heart rate feature only seems to function properly when arm remains still with the sensor resting on top of the wrist for an extended period of time.  Does not give accurate results after arm has been hanging down by your side.  Takes over a minute to respond with an accurate reading after re-positioning to read.  Disappointing.
 Love this fit bit.  Easy to install and use.  Does help me keep track of my steps and reminds me to move.  I love the app for it as well.  I can keep track of what I eat each day and the app has the amount of calories for each food I eat, which saves me from looking up the amount of calories on a calorie counter.  It helps me lose weight by letting me see the amount of calories I eat each day and allows me to make adjustments, so I don't go over the amount calories that I set for myself each day.  Love that it shows me who is calling me and texting me without checking my phone all the time.  I especially love this option during church,  so I don't have to keep looking at my phone all the time and  I can concentrate on the sermon.
 I upgraded from the Charge to Charge 2 and couldn't be happier. The screen is 100x better, the heart rate monitor is very good, the sports options/short cuts are easy to use and it looks great. I give it 4 out of 5. 5 stars will be given once they make a water proof version.
 I would not recommend buying this product. It is useful for counting steps and tracking sleep patterns, but that's about it. The pulse rate monitor is woefully inaccurate. The watchband is difficult to use and I have gone through two chargers in the last six months. There are definitely better products on the market in a similar price range.
 I had my doubts about this device motivating me to get up at work and walk however many steps that it challenged me to. While I'll admit there are times when I can't, it's not very often and I find myself getting a little excited to meet these mini goals. For people like me who lose track of how long I've actually been sitting, this is very helpful.
 So nice! I get at least five days on the battery. The collector edition is rose gold blending so nicely with the rose gold metal band that I bought. Very classy!  I hope they can make more colors in the bands.<br/><br/>Below is the band I bought.<br/>Vancle Fitbit Charge 2 Band, Milanese Stainless Steel Metal Replacement Accessory Bracelet Strap with Magnet Lock for Fitbit Charge 2
 Had terrible wrist irritation. Replaced the band with stainless steel but the area where the monitor contacts skin was raw.
 Other than the fact that it took me forever to figure out how to get it synced so i could start using it. I am just not very good with computers.  I love it.  I especially love the ability to change the band to the multiple colors i could be wearing that day.  I love tracking my steps and plan on increasing my steps gradually until i reach 10,000 day.  My poor dog is doing the same, he does not have a choice.
 I thought I wanted a Fitbit that allowed me to track my swimming, but I'm so glad I returned that one and got the Charge 2! The heart rate monitor is definitely worth it, as I do arobic, land activities more frequently than water workouts. Only downside to the updated watch face is the light--it is quite bright if it lights up at night while sleeping. I have pretty small wrists but am still able to wear the size small band on the 3rd smallest notch. Very happy with my purchase!
 I bought this lavender/rose gold combo in November 2016.  I paid $175.00.  I have loved the fit bit, but after daily use, the band just tore where it meets the fit bit face.  I am disappointed, for that kind of money, I expected the band to perform better.
 Doesn't hold battery charge more than 24 hours after 4 months of use. I would say that's fine if I were walking 15k steps a day and wearing it out, but I typically get around 1500 steps a day (working from home). Annoying that the light continuously comes on if you toss and turn at night. It lights up the whole room. Then to only find it's died overnight and didn't accurately track sleep.
 This FitBit tracks it all for me. Steps, heart rate, who’s texting/calling. I also love the variety of wristband colors. I wear it every day. It’s great how it reminds me I’ve been sitting too long at work and I need to walk.
 I was so excited for my fitbit to come in the mail, than was shortly disappointed. It doesn't track all you steps, stairs, etc. I'm a single mother that goes to college and work thirds, I'm lucky to get 4 hours of sleep a night and it tells me I had 700 steps yesterday... Yeah right lol. I returned for a refund.  Too bad I couldn't rate with no stars.
 I like it but don't love it. I wanted something to monitor my heart rate that did not involve wearing one of those awful chest bands. This does, but only sort-of.  Often it drastically undercounts hearbeats (like 80 vs an actual 130) and apparently if you're not moving your arms (like on a stairstepper machine at the gym) it doesn't count at all. Still, its an incentive to keep moving.
 I had the old style charge. I wore it for three years before the bad finally fell apart.  I was bummed because I really loved that fitbit.  I bought the new Charge 2 and I am happy to say that I love this one too. It is a little bulkier than my old one, but I like the band on the charge 2 much better.  I also like the heart rate feature.  It is not 100% accurate, but it is pretty close.
 Love my Charge 2!  Keeps me motivated.  I love that the Fitbit connects with MyFitnessPal to help me track my calories and keep me accountable.  It's fun to see all the different stats.  It tracks steps, stairs, heartbeat, sleep etc.  This is my third Fitbit.  I've had the Flex, Charge HR and now the Charge 2.
 I bought one for me and one for my husband and it's great because it does prompt you to get up to move and so on...<br/><br/>There is a slight glitch on accuracy, it logs going up the stairs more easily than going down and it' misses at times, on the steps - then again, it say, I've done 70 steps just waking up.<br/><br/>Overall, if you want to have an idea of how much you move, this is great.
 So annoyed! Had this fitbit for 2 months and I let the battery die while on vacation - and now it won't come back on!<br/>So...I spent over $150 to get 60 days use! Oh...and fitbit is willing to give you a refurbished one for free....so...you buy a new one and it doesn't work - no worries they'll give you a used one!<br/>Very disappointed with this purchase and I will never buy another fitbit product again.
 For how much we paid for these. Im not impressed. I bought 4 and the fitbit customer service blows. They just to run you through hoops and try not to help you. My band is coming apart after a month. My other one has gotten sweat inside of it just wearing it working out. (They are replacing this one). The heart rate doesn't work all the time and its very easy for it to miss read steps
 Works exactly like you'd expect, no let downs! Trust me, get the screen protectors though... don't ask. The app is FABULOUS! Best out there hands down. You can do everything in one place, which is very important to me. Love this purchase
 I love my new Fitbit Charger 2! It helps me want to walk more,and it helps me track my water and calories. I started becoming more active and joined a yoga class. It makes me feel good when I reach the goal of steps I wanted to everyday!<br/><br/>My family all has one and we can challenge each other to walk more. It shows you which of your friends that have one so you dont have to work at it alone!
 Best.Tracker.Ever.  I love this!  Added bonus:  my phone calls and (first few words of) texts scroll across my wrist.  I love the heart rate tracker, I love the available stats, I love connecting with friends, I love everything about this.  I had a Polar Loop for 2 years and I really liked it, but I wanted a  tracker with the heart rate monitor, and so I went with this. I can't say enough good stuff about it. Highly recommend.
 I purchased this for my wife for Christmas. She has had the original charge wristband for some time, but the band was falling apart and you can't replace the bands on the original charge fitness tracker. I don't know how many times we had to superglue parts of the band around the charge that had split open. Also, the USB connector on her old charge was getting flaky and you had to position the wristband a certain way to get the battery to charge. Any vibration or movement would make it stop charging. It was a real pain. What I liked about this new charge 2 wristband is that the bands can be replaced with different color ones and the charging adapter fits the wristband differently by clamping on the side - no USB connector to deal with.<br/><br/>Setup was easy by using the fitbit app you can download to your smartphone, or by logging into the fitbit website and registering your new wristband and setting up the options there. You can set up what is displayed on the screen and what order you want the different items, like heart rate, steps, etc. display on the screen. The battery lasts about 4 days before you need to recharge. The band is easy to remove if you want to buy other colors and replace them according to what you are wearing. Overall, this is much better than the original charge, and I am happy with my purchase and so is my wife who is actually using it.
 It did not count my steps, even at 50%. No matter what I did, or how many reboots. In addition, it left 'burn' marks on my wrist where the electrodes touched my skin, I am thinking I was just particularly sensitive to it, as my husbands fitbit works great and he has no issues. I found it irritating, and of no use to me as it didn't work accurately.
 I do love the fitbit concept, but the thickness of the fitbit makes it gaudy to wear.  I purchased a white leather band and that helps, but still too bulky.  I look forward to the day this is a fraction of it's current size.  Seems to be working well, holds a good charge so far.  Had to turn off several features to get the battery life to be longer.
 Definitely a better quality than the Charge, which only held up for me for about a year before it literally started to fall apart.  I almost didn't come back to Fitbit after that, but I'm glad I did. I like the features on this watch much better and the quality is much improved. One word of caution: I thought I would need a large band because I have bigger hands and wrists, but the large is plenty big. I almost have to use the last holes to keep it snug and in place.
 The FitBit itself is great. Setting goals and monitoring my calorie intake has done wonders for helping me get more fit and shed extra pounds. It is easy to use, to log exercise, you can easily scan barcodes to log your food, and provides consistent reminders if you are idle for long periods of time to get up and walk for a couple of minutes. The only issue that I have is that after approximately 1 month one side of the band started to loosen and I worry that it might pop off.
 I posted last week. 'I liked the product.  But last month it started acting up, where it won't reset. I have to restart my phone and hope it works. Couldn't find a contact the seller button to see if they can resolve it' .. they actually sent me a new one that is working like a champ. Highly recommend them. Customer service is rocking. Thanks fit bit team!
 I bought this as a gift for my husband and he LOVES it!  Very comfortable and charges quickly.  The related app gives him a ton of information about his exercise and sleeping habits.  It is an indispensable accessory for him.  As far as the vendor, the package arrived quickly, even before it was promised, and we didn't have any issues at all  I like that Amazon notifies us if the delivery date changes.
 I love my Charge 2. I've had a Fitbit for a few years but it was sometimes inconvenient to clip them n my clothing and, of course, only gives your steps. The Charge 2 gives tons of information which is helping me become more aware of my activity and diet. I especially like the sleep analyzer and the reminder to move. I'm grateful my husband recommended I buy a Fitbit watch. I gave him a Blaze as a surprise and he loves it. We're a Fitbit family. The only downside on the Charge 2 is that it's not waterproof or even water resistant.
 It worked for almost a year but the device is no longer able to keep accurate heart rate. I have maintained it very well.  For example, on an elliptical machine showing a heart rate of 138, the device shows 73!  I have since tested it multiple times and it is consistently off/wrong.  Giving it 2 stars instead of 1 since it worked for a while.
 Loved this; however band broke after six months.  Bought one for the hubby directly from the company as well - BOTH bands are gone in September after being purchased in February.  Caution any buyer to research band replacement and warranty information carefully before investing in one of these, as this appears to be a widespread issue.  Haven't been able to wear mine for weeks.  Perhaps a total loss.
 I have had the charge 2 for a week. So far it is working perfectly. The setup process went very smoothly. I am wearing it in place of my watch. It syncs with the fitbit app on my iPhone as well as with My Fitness Pal and Loseit apps.It does not take it long to charge. I have been charging it while i shower. It also tracks my sleep. I am very pleased. I last had an earlier fitbit and I never could get it to work right and tossed it in the trash can. But this Charge 2 is wonderful.
 I really wanted to like this but I literally felt like I was using ancient technology. Ugh! Overpriced for what it can do. I ended up returning it. The step count was way off. I use the Pacer app on my phone which is way more accurate than this thing was. I tried adjusting my stride length on multiple occasions ( I know what my length is, I use cardio machines at the gym that I set it for) and it literally didn't help. It was either way too sensitive and would move every time I moved my wrist, or it didn't register at all and didn't notice when I took steps unless I dramatically swung my arms. Looked it up on multiple sites and found that other users were also having this problem. Returned it while I had the time. Until then I'll be waiting for improvements. Was very unimpressed. Back to my Pacer app and Myfitnesspal app.
 To set the watch up just download the app! It was a bit confusing to go to the website and be redirected. Just go straight to the app! This thing is the best! It even recognizes when I've been playing basketball. I'm really impressed with all of the features. The "calm down" feature is a great way to de-stress if you have anxiety! Overall a great purchase.
 I loved my Fitbit. Best gift I ever bought myself. Great features that interacted with my iPhone. Would get notifications on my watch for phone calls, texts, meeting reminders, and even alarms! Loved the step/stair tracking, heart rate monitor, and sleep tracking. Unfortunately, I owned it only 30 days; was ‘mysterious lost’ but I think stolen. Hard to live without. If I had the money I’d buy another one. Well worth the money. The last watch I owned (basis) cost $300 and I liked it. I LOVE this one and it’s less than half the price of the other!
 Loved the product. Beautiful color, looks trendy and stylish. I have a fitbit flex, wanted to present something different and updated in technology so chose this for my sister. She loves it. The different features in it is motivating her to do more steps, eat healthy and drink more water. The fitbit challenge is a big hit. It pushes you to be on top and motivates you to be physically more active.<br/>The only drawback is, it has to be strapped on the wrist all the time. You cannot wear a watch. You also need to buy straps in different colors to match your attire if you are bored with one color.
 Disappointed that FitBit brand has serious Device and App issues. I walk 7 miles, sometimes it says I walked 2 miles. I cut vegetables with this on my hand and it’s counting steps. Stats don’t update properly / very depressing esp when you are trying to motivate yourself to meet your daily and weekly health goals
 Got this for my husband for Father's Day gift. He loved it! It reminds him to walk more, and stand up move your body. It tracks his sleep helping him to find ways to get better sleeps at night. Without the Fitbit, he wouldn't know how poor his sleeps have been. It buzz for text message. For not a very tech savvy person, it's good enough for him.
 Amazing! It's a great device. Things you should consider are that the number of steps are really counted by arm movements. Not your feet. So, any activity you do with your arms will add more steps. (brushing hair, teeth etc) I've heard to take off the fitbit and place it in your pocket if you want more of an accurate step count. The sleeping part is very accurate for me which amazes me every time. You also have to realize you burn calories just sitting and even sleeping. So the calories burn will go up even if you're sitting there. So, don't think it's broken. From what I have noticed is you can't restart anything calculating on your own. It re started every morning at 12 am. It will show according to your weight/height etc. Everything works great and I'm in love with my fitbit. It's worth the money! As long as you are mature enough to understand the common sense of an exercise watch".
 The addition of the heart rate monitor feature made me buy given the reputation of the manufacturer. Had been using other brands with the bulkier heart rate chest band as a requirement and had a Fitbit charge w/o the heart rate capability. The monitor appears to be accurate regarding my heart rate. The device meets all my expectations, am very pleased with it. The monitoring from my smart phone is a nice plus.
 This is my first fitness watch and it's great very easy to use , when I'm hiking I can glance down and decide if pulling out my phone is worth the effort or wait till I'm done.  I took away one star because I'm a little skeptical on weather the steps are accurate or not as well as milage recorded , my husbands phone records the same walks but one mile different.
 Go on line and read the reviews. And determine if this will work for your needs. They all have there negative qualities to them. I like it for what I use it for have had it a long time know and still works well. Neighbor bought the new slim and she is happy with it as well all though it is harder to read because screen is smaller.
 Love my new fitbit. This was to replace an older fitbit that fell apart after a lot of use. I like the features and the tap screen. It's nice to see exactly where I'm at through out the day. The fit bit app is easy to navigate and works well. Fits comfortably and isn't overly large for a female wrist.
 Really nice looking and has a lot more features than the original Charge HR. Takes a bit to get it customized to how you want the data displayed, but it's really not a problem, for someone like me who completely fiddles with all the features of a new toy. If you're more of a plug and play kind of person, that prefers not to fuss too much with bells and whistles, this is still a fine product as the default settings are fine too. The only issue I've had so far is that after 3 months, the battery only seems to charge up to 85%. It's still well within the warranty so I should be able to get it covered, but it's a bit disappointing.
 Very intuitive. I've had it for almost a month now.<br/>It's slightly uncomfortable to sleep with, but you can get used to it. I sometimes take it off.<br/>The only real issue I have with the fitbit is the HR lag when I am doing HIIT sprints on the treadmill. It almost always loses my heartrate at my peak times and only start measuring once I've stopped sprinting and my heart rate has gone down a bit. It's quite annoying to be honest.<br/>I'd love to see the Charge become waterproof, as it's a real bummer to have to wipe it with a damp cloth instead of just hopping into the shower with it.<br/>It's definitely a good starting point for someone who has never had a fitness tracker and definitely keeps you motivated.
 I started working out consistently and wanted to track my progress. What I loved about this watch is that I could also track my sleep. This sleep feature has been the best insight that I wasn't expecting that when I bought it. Very happy with this watch!
 I got this fitbit in June, and I like the functionality as well as the look. It's great that it can automatically tell when I have started working out, and I appreciate the reminder to move every hour. The charge lasts longer than previous fitibits I've had, and the charging cradle snaps on and stays secure.<br/>Unfortunately, the band has already started to fall apart after only 3 months, despite keeping it clean and following care instructions. The plastic peeling away around the screen is ugly and can't be hidden. I was hoping the replaceable band would be better quality than the previous style, but it's definitely not worth spending for the cute pattern.
 I've had my FitBit for almost a year now and really like it. I wear it everyday and no longer wear a traditional watch. I work out about 3x/week and it helps me monitor my heart rate, etc. I also hunt, so, I now know how many miles I walk.
 This is my hubby's dream come true. He's wanted one for ages and I couldn't see buying a cheap one that wouldn't do everything.  This is wonderful and follows his habits and gives info and one of the most important things to us..... it sets up soo easily on the computer. It's worth every penny.
 I'm just switching to the Charge 2 after using a Surge for the last year.  While I miss some of the Surge's features (namely the timer and the GPS), the Charge 2 is a lot less bulky and I like that I can change the bands out.  The charger is also a lot better than the Surge's, which doesn't always work.  Definitely not as nice as the Surge, but the price is better if you don't care about GPS.
 After few mos can't release metal clip- frustrated! Gaget is good BUT band release Not made for senior citizens with weak thumbs! Even tried holding over counter edge and pressing with flat screwdriver- but then pulling down away from clip impossible! They need to make a tool to help us with weak hands!
 Bought it as a gift for my husband.  He LOVES it.  It has given him incentive to "move".  He is pretty active anyway,<br/>but now he's challenged himself to keep moving and increase his total steps daily.  And, send me reports!  Good Buy!
 My old Fitbit finally gave out about 2 weeks ago and I was lost without it. I ordered the purple Fitbit because it was cheaper than the other colors. I ended up liking the color, but if you don't you can always change the band. I have several different ones
 Love this.  I was coming from an alta but wanted more features because just steps got boring.  This this is really nice.  Women may still want an alta due to the slight thickness of this one but for guys the alta looked too small on the wrist.  This is also better than my old garmin vivosmart hr.
 Fitbit is a company to love and trust. I've never had a problem with any that I've owned. HR2 does all that it describes. The reason for the low # of stars: I had the lavender rose gold special edition for only a few days before I noticed the pretty light purple band starting to turn dark blue on the edges. I called Amazon for instructions as to what I should do. I called Fitbit and they are replacing the band ASAP. I have only owned black bands in the past and never had a problem. The 3 stars are for THIS color only.
 Yeah, I could have purchased a much cheaper fitness tracker that does the same things the fitbit does, but I am a fan of the fitbit, especially the app, which is a lot more robust than the knockoff versions.  It connects seamlessly and is a great motivator to get you to be more active.  I had the previous Charge and recently upgraded to the Charge 2.
 I love this fitbit. It keeps me on target for steps. I use the challenges with a group of friends, so we have daily competitions. The only downfall is that mine seems to lose its charge sooner than others. I keep my charger in my car though and charge it on long drives so I don't have to miss out on recording steps.
 I LOVE my Fitbit. I've had other Fitbits and a Microsoft Band and none of them were as awesome, accurate, and customizable as the Charge2!!<br/>I can track my calories, steps, movement, food/water, heart rate, distance, and daily activity. Not to mention sleep!<br/>The app is easy and user friendly. I love getting notifications for calls/texts and to get off the couch!! :)<br/>Great buy
 The time function quit working in less than two months and the step function quit working in less than six months.  My son=in=law went to the troubleshooting web page and could not resynchrinize it.  He has a Masters Degree in Computer Technology.
 This is the third Fitbit I have purchased in a span of two years. Each product has had problems with the band buckling and separating from the unit with normal wear. I admit to wearing my fitbit constantly (outside of the shower) and use it for tracking exercise, sleep patterns, calories etc. However I would think that simply washing my hands and sweat accumulation on my wrist should not warrant the band buckling and detaching within 6 months.
 Bought this item for a friends birthday since she had been wanting a Fitbit. She tried it on a for a couple of days and said it was awesome for tracking steps but didn’t like the band or how big it looked on her wrist. Instead of returning it, I thought maybe I would keep it but realized it was too small for me. Only states the person who texts you but you can only see it once. The only I loved was the step and calorie count. After a day of trying it, I realized it was not for me. It is great for those that are always on the go and don’t mind having something lightweight on their wrist. I’m returning this item because it’s not suitable for me.
 The planned obsolescence of this specific device is laughable. It will fail right around the time the warranty is up if you are lucky. They will replace one of them but if there is an issue with that one you can wrap it up you have two $150 paperweights.  The gist of it is the battery will fail with normal use usually between 6-9 months of use.
 I love this product and I wear it every day. My favorite thing is probably the sleep tracker and heart rate monitor. It's so interesting the data you can gather from your activities, and it's a great motivator to get more motion into your day. So happy I got this! I also got one for my husband and we can challenge each other during the work week and weekends to see who can get more steps in. Very fun!
 So far its been great. Motivates me to push harder everyday. I am a previous owner of the charge HR. I used it everyday. The Charge HR last me about a year and the battery stopped charging. I recommend getting the screen protector to protect from scratches. I also got the extended warranty<br/>for ten bucks in case I have issue with it after a year. I'm looking for a camouflage band for my new charge 2, haven't seen any so far. I've been wearing it for approx. 2 weeks with no issues and the battery charges very quickly.<br/><br/>Only negative is that its not water proof. I will eventually purchase the flex 2 for when I go swimming. I would recommend to a friend.
 I've been wearing a Fitbit for 5 years.  This one replaced my Fitbit Charge HR.  I like the larger screen.  I'm not athletic but I need to be reminded to get moving.  Last week I had an interesting discovery - when I am on the treadmill and holding on to the rail, the steps didn't register.  To fix that, I started pinning my fitbit to my pants and that solved the problem.
 Perfect size, durable, and works well.<br/>I wear it in the shower most days, only requires recharging about once a week, and does what it was designed to do.<br/>Extremely happy with its fit, form, and function.
 I am absolutely loving this Fitbit, even over my old one.  It is accurate and gives me more options of activities to track.  I bought a silver band to replace the rubber/silicone one that comes with it and highly recommend the same.  The one that comes with it tends to rub and irritate the skin.  The metal ones also are more stylish and look more like a typical watch.  I get a lot of compliments that it looks expensive.  I like the reminders to move and get a chuckle when I've almost reached my goal of 250 steps per hour and it buzzes and the screen says "Feed Me".
 Such a fan of Fitbit! However, this one in particular I have only had a few weeks and the band is already discolored. The sides have turned a grey/blue color and it just looks dirty. I have tried to clean it (Lysol wipes and even Cavi wipes) and it made no difference. Definitely thought the band would last longer from such a big company. Pretty disappointed.
 I love the color. I have the rose gold. It does everything I want it to. Only complaint is I synced it with my fitness pal and the app doesn't register it. Will have to look into it. No biggie. It syncs well with my weight watcher app. I think once I get used to it it will do everything it's supposed to. Just have to play with it more. All in all a good purchase.
 Wear it most of the time. Love the way it keeps track of heart rate and sleep - very valuable to me.  Can track your exercise based on type of exercise; such as running, weight lifting and treadmill.  If running with your linked cell phone, will track you movement.<br/><br/>The free software is great for tracking food intake; calories, fat, carbs, protein, and more.<br/><br/>Highly recommend.
 I recently bought my Charge 2 around a week ago because my Charge HR broke unispectingly. I bought it thinking the price was way to high but I still really wanted it so I bought it. The first thing I noticed is the amount of thinks you can do on it! You can do 7 differnt workouts , a stopwatch and alarms! Also the Heart Rate and step tracking is so much more accurate than the Charge HR. I strongly recommend this device!
 I got this watch because I have a desk job and just was not moving around near as much as I should have been. After the first week of casual wear, I realized that I had only been taking 4,000 of the recommended 10,000 steps/day. One feature I really like is how you can set reminders to walk 250 steps/hour and 10 minutes before the hour is up, your watch will gently buzz letting you know how many steps are left to meet your goal for the hour.<br/><br/>This fitness tracker also notifies you when someone is calling and when you get a text message, it will scroll the message across the screen. You won't be able to reply to the text on the watch, but it is nice to see when you get one.<br/><br/>I have an iPhone 5s and the app has worked really well on it and syncs easily. You can add friends who also have a fitbit and challenge them to step competitions or cheer them on. The fitbit customer service is also excellent. I have had questions about different features and they have a community board where you can find answers to nearly any question.
 Did not like the UX. Not easy to use. Maybe good for people who want to wear it all the time but I was looking for something simple for spinning and running that can easily show distance calories and heart beats. Does not do the job. Try to return however by the time I started using it and tried it few times,  more than 30 days passed and could no longer return it.<br/>Will not buy from Amazon this kind of products. Better to go to a store and find the right product. Wasted a lot of time and money researching and buying 2 watches both did not do the job and I can't return both.
 Love this Fitbit Charge 2. It's better than my Charge. It has great features, alerts me to texts, calls, calendar events and tells me to get up and go. The new look is sleek. They improved the connection for the charger and the band is now like a watch strap. It has two ways to ensure it stays on. And the straps are interchangeable! Amazon.com has really nice, inexpensive straps to choose from.
 I like all of the features  it offered, HR, sleep, steps, stairs.  I do find that it does not capture my stairs accurately, I live in a 2 story house and the tracker does not capture every time I go up the stairs.
 Doesn't work when you sweat, kinda bulky, not too comfy. Doesn't really provide that accurate of a reading. Felt like a massive waste of money. Doesn't work when you sweat, probably biggest drawback considering what it's meant for.
 So far I love it!  I have the lavender and rose gold and it's a really muted lavender, very grayish, still pretty. I love glancing at it and seeing my steps and heart rate along with the time and date. I will do my first workout tonight and am excited to see all the stats.
 So I originally bough a cheap knock off as an introduction, which I enjoyed quite a bit until a little bit of water made it give out. So I bought this as a step up, and I am really loving it so far. The only downside it is that it is not as sensitive to tapping it as the knock off. If Fitbit could figure out how to make them more receptive to the tap I would totally give this produce five stars.
 I like this Fitbit Charge 2 -  The app and heart rate monitor have helped inspire me to be more active.<br/>Personally I do not like the buckle band and I changed to the Umtele Milanese loop - small magnet holds band closed!  Fits very well and looks nice.  The app has motivated me.<br/>Wish I didn't have to wear it all the time and could switch with the Fitbit One sometimes, but the app won't sync the two in one account.  Instructions online say you can,  but  each has to be worn separately and synced at the end of each transition.  I could not get this to work.
 Had the Fitbit Charge and the band broke.  Since this is a later model with an interchangeable band, I won't have to worry about that issue again.  Only (minor) issue I have is the vibration feature is way weaker than the Fitbit Charge (1).  I can sleep though the Fitbit Charge 2 no problem where the previous one I could feel and also work up because the vibration was loud as well.
 Less than a year of use and started to not synchronized properly, the time was off, I thought maybe was the app that need it an update, but the issue continue, after it wasn't charging and I bought a replacement charger. Put it to charge and it doesn't work at all. Never got wet or hit, it ran out of battery and it doesn't want to charge
 I was very hesitant about buying this but I couldn't be happier with my purchase. I love it!! Gives me the extra motivation I need to get moving when I am at work as I am sitting at a desk most of the week. Even if I just go for a few laps around the parking lot it is still better than nothing. Highly recommend. Bonus for me is the sleep tracker.
 I think this watch is great. It does exactly what I needed it to. For the people who are stating that it doesn't get every step, you can't be staring at your wrist and thinking it's going to count steps. The steps are counted as your hands are moving to your side, like naturally walking. The color is great I think it looks very pretty. I only have to charge it once every few days, for only like 15 minutes at the most. Great watch definitely recommend it.
 Very disappointed due to inability to sync the HR data to Apple Health app.  Was promised I could do so and even spent about $10 on 3rd party apps was recommended by Fitbit but it was all vey misleading.  All you can transfer is resting HR.  It's comfortable &amp; nice looking but I'm disappointed to have wasted valuable time &amp; money only to find out there exits no solution to the HR data sync issue.
 I love my FitBit.  It motivates me to keep moving by letting you know when you've reached your goals and proving the ability to challenge your friends and coworkers. The sleep monitoring is great too.<br/><br/>I did have a problem with the FitBit that was sent to me, but FitBit replaced it at no charge and the second one has been working great.
 Love it, not sure how it keeps track of my REM sleep but that's the only thing I question about it. I wear mine all the time. I even wore it once in the shower forgetting to take it off and it still works great. I have noticed that the charge goes out of it a smidge quicker than it used to but it's not a big deal to me.
 I am learning so much about myself thanks to this fabulous Charge 2 Fitbit. I know ho many hours resting. I know that as a music teacher that I average 8000 steps just at work. I know that I can burn over 900 calories at out high intensity cross fit trainings. I love the product
 Love the info- some issues with the sleep report but my major complaint is that the band has broken after 3 months! The plastic cracked and it won’t stay attached!<br/>Really like the reports and info on steps and heart rate- very helpful!
 ----Complaint of the selling condition<br/>The product I received is apparently someone's return or display product. All the protection sticker films are teard and placed on random part on the box, the charger is not rolled up and placed in the plastic. Although I didn't find scratches, the fitbit itself doesn't seem damaged or anything, I just feel a bit bummed by that. Afterall it costs me $179, I'd expect a well packed, brand new product.<br/>-----below about the product itself<br/>I've been debating to get a fitness tracker for a very long time, like a year, but never really determined because it's pretty pricey and technology changes a lot, I'm afraid it's gonna be a waste, afterall iPhone got good tracker and apps that I could log data manually. I workout 4 to 5 times a week, mostly cardio and some stationary workout, sometimes I just cant keep the phone with me all the time and forget to log the data very often. In order to give me something to motivate, I made the decision to purchase.<br/>Pros<br/>1. The special edition is very cute<br/>2. It has a lot of features. I was debating to get charge/Alta/flex but after considering that what I need is one that provides auto-log on run/treadmill/weight/elliptical/bike/interval, which I do. I'm still not sure about the precision since I just got it, but so far the app coordinates pretty well.<br/>3.All the good features you've seen so far are true so I'll skip.<br/><br/>Cons<br/>1. I'm not used to wearing watch so this big thing is a little nuisance to me so far. It hurts a little, not that bad but I just feel the presence all the time even during sleep.<br/>2. The step count is not very accurate--I feel it counts when I shake my hand?<br/>3. The calories burned is overestimated, at least I think so. I don't believe I burned a thousand calories just this morning. But it's very motivational, just don't get cocky and eat much more.<br/>4. Battery consumes quickly.<br/><br/>In general I like it and would want to use it more. I'll recommend it to people need to see numbers before they see on their body--tracking motivates you! So go for it if you got a little extra money!
 This is my first fitbit device and I love it. It looks nice and is comfortable to wear. I bought it to help me with my exercise routine and staying active and it has everything you would need. I love how it notifies you if there is a text message or phone call. If it is a long message it will not display everything but I did not buy this device for that reason, so it is a bonus for me. It is pretty user friendly and for the things I couldn't figure out on my own I used the help button that is in the app and/or Google it. You can connect with friends who may have a fitbit device and do challenges with each other and it also offers challenges you can do on your own. A+
 Awesome tracker! Love it. It has made tracking steps, water consumption, workouts much easier.  The heart rate monitor is very accurate and helpful.  The move reminder keeps me from sitting too long without getting in a few steps.  Very easy to set up.  Only needs charging about once a week.  My only complaint...the online food tracker for Fitbit is not as good as My Fitness Pal, resulting in in four stars instead of five.
 Same as the other 5 or so Fitbits I've owned, this one a little faster.  After 4 moths the battery drained faster.  After 5 months it wouldn't take a full charge.  Fitbit has replaced units after the Amazon return window in the past.  We'll see if they do this time too, I just sent them a note via Amazon.  I'll update if they do; won't if they don't.
 I had charge HR before this. definitely an upgrade. bigger screen, much longer battery life, and more user friendly. heart-rate is accurate as long as you wear it kinda tight up your wrist. I just read an article about how their calorie burnt is up to 92% inaccurate (not just FItbit, but all brands). so keep that in mind. unless they admit it first and send an update to fix it.
 I really love everything about this except the fact that it doesn't track all my steps when I'm walking with a shopping cart or stroller (which is most of the time). We went to the zoo last weekend and walked around for 6 hours and it only counted about 4500 steps. My friend that wasn't pushing a stroller like I was had a similar tracking bracelet on and hers said we'd walked double that.
 I really like the device itself. It's fun that you can change the face of it, and there are so many different tracking options. It got 4 stars because 1, it didn't come with a plug, the charger just ends as a USB- I had an old plug I was able to use, so it wasn't the end of the world. And 2, the charger is qiute fussy- I clipped it into the charger for an hour or two the other day, only to come back and find it wasn't ever charging. I had to play with it a bit to actually get it to start charging.
 Replaced my Alta with This latest Tracker From Fitbit because of Heart Rate Monitor! I have Afib.<br/>Battery Life is better than Alta and HR Monitor works well!<br/>Why I didn't give it 5 stars is Glance look doesn't work Very Well!<br/>80% of time I need to tap it to view Tracker info!<br/>Other than that works as advertised!<br/>Nothing Special but does have about a 5 to 6 day battery life.
 This replaced my Fitbit Charge, WOW!  They've made so many improvements.  It has move features, and does a better job overall I think.  I went through 3 or 4 (give Fitbit create, they replaced them all for free) of the original Charge because of the wristband bubbling on me.  This one you can just snap on a new band if you like.  I put on a nice gold band and love it!
 While I've only had this for a short time, I can say it's a BIG improvement on the previous Fitbit Charge HR.  The battery lasts (so far) the whole week, even with vibrations turned on, the screen is easy to read, having text messages scroll across is handy, the little motivational messages are useful as are the reminders to move.  All in all, if you are wondering if it's worth upgrading from your old Charge - I'd say 'do it!'
 Got this for my wife, and she wears it every day.  It does a great job of tracking our steps and heart rate.  I love the detachable wrist band and ability to change out the colors as well.  No reliability issues at all.  Easy to pair and set up on phone.
 Piece of Junk.  Buy at your own Risk. Purchased Sept. 2016 so Not even 2 years.  Yesterday it just died.  Won't charge, won't turn on, Nothing...Nada...just a dark and dead screen.  Upon further research it appears this is a common issue.  Bottom line:  this is a piece of Junk.  The company stock is also now down to near worthless so it's obvious this company won't be around much longer.
 Wife likes it, was given as a birthday gift.  Checked against my map app which uses phone GPS.  I know we could Bluetooth to GPS but then that uses more battery on both devices.  Real motivator for fitness.
 My wife's previous Fitbit Charge HR had a shelf life of 2.5 yrs (as did my Surge!) and just died, so I picked this up for her. She seems to love it but hopefully the connector isn't as flimsy as the previous one was. The build and display appear to be a step up and switchable straps are a nice touch.
 I already have a charge HR, which i use for work as it gets beat up from time to time but still works. Got the charge 2 in the mail today which i will use for more of a workout non-work use. Day one its pretty much the same as the charge hr but way more refined. Also my wife has the alta which has the same design aesthetic and text message functions which now the charge2 has which i like. All in all very happy with purchasing.
 The jury is still out on this for me. The delivery was perfect but the watch can be fussy. My friend turns her wrist and there is the time. I'm having to do an arm dance to get the time. I do like the tracking and spoke to many owners before making the purchase. Will spend some time learning more about the features. Love the sleep tracker.
 I have been using the Fitbit Charge 2 for about a month now. I like most of the features and they work like advertised. The heart rate monitor works most of the time - I wish it was a bit more reliable! I wish there was a way to modify calories burned from any activity and also add stairs climbed (when a Stairclimber is used) after the activity is done. Some activities totally underestimate the calories burned (as indicated by the exercise machine readout) vs. what Fitbit calculates. A new glitch I noticed today (12/27/16): The latest hardware upgrade (Ver. 22.48.14) seems to have done something to the battery charge indicator. Even though it showed to have medium level on the iPhone app, the battery level was really about 10%. The heart rate monitor did not function well today (perhaps due to low battery?).
 My only issue is that it counts steps that I do not take. For example, if I start off with 200 steps when I get into my car, I get out of my car with about 45 extra steps added. Otherwise, I'm satisfied. I charge the battery every 7 to 8 days. I have to open the FitBit app for it to sync, but the app and the watch work seamlessly together. It's excellent at tracking my sleep! No real complaints here.
 While it worked, I loved my Charge 2.  It was simple, and it really did motivate me to get moving.  However, it had one fatal engineering flaw:  the battery started to degrade after about 6 months of use, and it failed completely after just over a year.  You might think that wouldn't be so bad, for a small battery, but, unfortunately, THE BATTERY CANNOT BE REPLACED, even by the manufacturer.  So, into the landfill it goes, another piece of junk!
 Wife gets good HR readings and likes the info.  I get horrible readings.  Tried every tight/loose within reason.  No good.  Seems like a physiological issue.<br/>Also, the screen turns off VERY QUICKLY after pressing button, etc.  Very annoying.  Plenty of others complain of this issue online.<br/>Wish there was a better product for the 24-hr HR tracking.
 Fitbit was not counting steps correctly. I was waivering on Fitbit or Apple Watch series 2, and the malfunction of the Fitbit made my decision for me. I'm sure they are great when they work, but I didn't have that experience.
 I love this upgrade of the Fitbit Charge.  The sleep information is very helpful to me with sleep apnea and I love the guided breathing exercises.  All the other great things are here too - stopwatch, run timer, bluetooth connection to my iphone so I see texts and caller ID on my fitbit when my phone is nearby.
 I do dig it...motivates &amp; inspires activities to water consumption to adequate sleep.  Can notity &amp; show incoming call/texts and link to other fit bit friends.  Only downside for me is needing glasses to read the screen but I like the slimmer design so the tradeoff is worthwhile.
 Do not purchase this device! I have been a loyal fitbit customer for many years, so I was excited to move into this newest device. However, the charge 2 does not hold GPS. It's all over their forums. All of the "fixes" they recommend do not work. Again, all over their forums. They will not stand behind the product, though, which is a huge disappointment. Do yourself a favor and go with another company.
 I just got this a couple of days ago.  I upgraded from my fitbit charge HR and most of the new features are nice but I'd rather get a charge HR again.  This one seems bigger and bulkier than the charge HR, which I can get over but the alarm/notification feature was changed and I HATE it!!  The strength of the vibration is so low I can barely feel it.  I used my charge HR as an alarm in the morning which I can not do with the charge 2 because the vibration is so light it does not even wake me up.  I barely notice it when I am awake.  I am so disappointed in this product. I contacted the company and they told me that this is one of the features they changed in this model.  I hate it!  They should change it so that you can set the strength of the vibration.
 THIS WON'T WORK WITH WINDOWS 10 UNLESS YOU BUY MORE  HARDWARE. You'll have to buy a Bluetooth dongle for another $20, even if your computer already has Bluetooth. They sell Chinese gear with Chinese truth.
 Beautiful and versatile. I bought a fancier band and a shield. It's great and seems to be accurate enough for my needs. I am a little disappointed that it is SOOO hydrophobic because I used to wear my Charge in the shower (just so I didn't have to remember to take it off) but this one is a bit more sensitive. Other than that, it's great.
 Got as a present for wife she loves it and the fact that you can change bands she had another make which was very expensive and the rubber band broke and it could not be replaces, and company wouldn't honor warranty so we blackballed that make your right as a customer, Fitbit is awesome and you can pick up accessories on this web site at a reasonable price!!!!!!
 Cheaply made! Charger did not work out of box! At that point it continued to go down hill. After I got a friends charger, I simply didn’t like how the watch worked. Hard to use. Unresponsive touch screen and took multiple lifts of wrist to activate screen.
 Fantastic upgrade from the simpler Fitbit we had earlier.  My husband needs to monitor his health rate for health reasons, and nothing could be easier with this tool.  Syncs easily and has maintained his motivation to exercise.  Hooray!
 Great product. Until it's not. Died less than a year after I bought it, second one that has done this too me. In the middle of a November 2018 trip to Europe where I really wanted to count my steps - all of a sudden, after I had just charged it, it completely lost all power in less than a day - then just would not take a charge, turn on or anything else. Didn't drop it or get it wet or anything - it just completely died. Will never buy another fitbit.
 I love the fact that it tracks my sleep cycles and my heart rate all day. I can wear it for about 4 days without charging it which is pretty good. I am definitely in love with my fibit.<br/><br/>After getting one I got one for my mom as well so we can do challenges together and compare our sleep which is cool.
 This little device really make me move by reminding me to do so.<br/>The most useful for me is the heart rate and sleep data so I can go to my sleep doctor and my heart doctor with data . Now I can tell my heart doctor that my heart rest rate sometime is as low as 48 BPM. Very useful
 Works great. You know what you're getting when you pick what level of Fit Bit you buy. I would get the screen protector as soon as you get the Fit Bit and plan to get some new wristbands down the line.
 So far I'm loving my fitbit charge 2. I upgraded from the model before it and it's so much nicer. I love the way it charges as I had so many charging issues with my last fitbit. I also like that you can switch out the bands.
 Watches should tell the time without having to reach over and touch the screen. In the Fitbit family this function of no-touch time only comes in more expensive models. Garmin does this at a much lower price.
 I love the fitbit charge 2. I have used it so much in my life and I can't imagine not having a watch to wear. It did give me itchy and irrated skin but I switched to a SWEEZ band and I havn't have problems since!
 My Fitbit quit working and I sent it back for repair or replacement using the shipping label Fitbit provided. They said it would take 5-10 days. I called Fitbit today after 13 days. They received my Fitbit and said they are still processing and it would likely be shipped in another 2-3 days.
 Lasted five months before it stopped holding a charge for long and woukd not sync.  I'm waiting over a week for a replacement.
 It wouldn't connect to my phone, I have a note 8 and it wouldn't sync correctly.
 I love the watch and it's function.  Extremely disappointed with the durability of the band.  After 5 months of normal use and activity, the band began to detach from the face of the device.  Called Fitbit for a replacement device.  After explaining the problem and sending a picture, they would only agree to send a replacement band.  Despite explaining multiple times this was fully broken and through research, a chronic problem, they would not replace the device.
 I purchased the FitBit right before I went on a cruise in July. I knew I needed to do more walking, so this has helped me to physically see that fact. I like the notifications. When I feel the vibration I always, "Uh oh, FitBit is yelling at me to move more!" and I do. I would highly recommend this product.
 I feel naked without my fitbit these days.  I used it as a flashlight in the dark when I have to go pee at night time...it's nice not stubbing your toes when you have to move around in the dark at night.  Oh and it also works great doing what fitbits are supposed to do as well! lol  The flashlight part was just an added bonus
 I love it and find it motivating. However, the face scratches very, very easily.  After a month I have scratches so bad it is hard to read numbers.  Disappointed in quality of face cover.
 In 3 months of normal use, the screen has deep scratches.  Worst durability and a pathetic device.  Feel ripped off wasted $120 on it. The one star is only because I cant give a zero
 Not touch screen.  You have to use the button on the side to turn on and etc.  heavy on my wrist and slightly painful.  I might be sensitive to it.  I like the sleep pattern features and HR more than anything.  Not really reliable in regards to your steps as your hands/arms moves it adds steps even while your sitting.
 This is my second Fitbit. And I have been pretty happy with it. However, the charge two does not hold a charge as well as my first one (different model). I get 3 days out of it and have to charge it again where as I was getting 5 days with the first.  The other thing I do not like about the charge 2 is that you do not have the option to remove the clock from the display. My have a watch that I love so I don't need two. I want the Fitbit for the fitness parts not the clock. Otherwise, I am happy with it.
 Horrible.  did not even make it one year.  the battery will no longer hold a charge for even a full day.  working with fitbit.support.com but not getting very far.  this is simply ridiculous for the price.
 So far I am liking my Fitbit.  I am a nurse and I bought the Charge HR to see how many steps I get in a 12 hour shift, as well as how much my heart rate fluctuates during the day.  I am a little unsure about the accuracy of the steps, but I've only had it a few days now.  I like the silent alarm option for my morning alarm so that I don't wake anybody else up.  I also like that this device is not big and bulky the way that some fitness watches are.  So far I don't have any complaints about the product.
 Received in a nice protect box and a plastic .  I got it on time.  Set up was a breeze.  The only problem I had was. I wasn't getting the notification on the watch. It took me a Lil while to fix. Instructions was easy.  . Definitely would recommend to my family and friends.
 Sent it back.  It DID NOT record my heart rate correctly.  It was off from 5 beats to 15 beats.  This is probably a great item for the active young person.
 I had a Fitbit Charge HR which broke after 2 years of use at the end of the year.<br/>The new Fitbit Charge 2 HR is great and went on sale when I just needed to replace my old one. I am happy that the bands are changeable. I have gotten several bands to play around with.
 I've had this for 3 days &amp; love it. It's user friendly, &amp; I can easily sync my "my fitness pal" app to it. It's a great device. I'm impressed with how easy it is to use. And I consider myself technology challenged. I had wanted a fitbit for 2 years, I'm glad I finally splurged on this! I love the goal setting &amp; little announcement when you hit a goal!
 I love this thing! I have forgotten to wear it twice and felt like i left part of myself behind! I love seeing everything right there including texts! And my sleep pattern on the app! I seriously need more sleep!
 Really good for my purposes. Helps me track my exercise and my sleep, as well as my heart rate. It is very comfy and I make sure to wipe the sweat off after workouts and dry off properly dry off before putting it on. Have not had a problem with redness or rashes on my sensitive skin.
 I'm enjoying my Fitbit Charge 2 tracker, I only wished I had ordered the limited edition pink/gold rather than the one I brought. The pink/gold is much more softer and much more feminine looking. I ordered the black thinking it would go much better with different band styles. Nevertheless, my charge 2 is working just fine.
 got it today and I think I am going to love it. easy to use. the website a bit confounding but I will get comfortable with that in time. will see over time how well it works for me. I plan to wear it all the time. I am hoping it will work for my biking activity. time will tell.
 I have been using the Fitbit HR Charge but recently bought the Charge 2.  I love it!!  Specifically, I love the ability to configure the Fitbit face view, and love seeing time/date, heart rate and steps without scrolling through, it's like having a watch and exercise feedback in one.  Also love the improvement in battery life; don't have to charge everyday anymore!!
 I bought this for my son's birthday.  He had one for years and it finally broke.  He desperately wanted another one.  His birthday isn't until Sept. 23, so I don't really know if it works okay, but I'm sure it will.
 Can't comment on the actual accuracy of all the tracking functions, but I think day to day consistency is pretty accurate.  Overall it helps to keep me motivated to attain goals (steps, cals burned, distance, flights of stairs, active min etc) that I have set for myself.
 I'm only one month in but this seems to work great so far. Not such a big issue that it isn't water proof. It is a little annoying to take it off everytime I wash my hands or do the dishes but it gets the job done.
 I switched from the Surge to the Charge 2. As a female it was much better size for my smaller wrists and looks a little nicer. Had trouble the first day using the connected GPS feature while running but have since figured it out. Love the new watch!
 I love this product.  I use it to track steps, sleep and to get text messages while I am at work.  The battery life is lengthy!!  The best product I have bought in a long time!!
 Excellent for runners. HR monitor is not as accurate as chest strap. I love the motivation it gives me almost like a competitive motivation to move more.
 i love this as a watch and a fitness tracker and a stopwatch and everything else. it does so much. and i also like the fact that you can buy separate wristbands to switch out colors very easily.
 One of the worst purchases I have made in a long time. From the poor setup support to the complete lack of user documentation. Not to mention I could not get it to sync with windows 10 or an apple ipod which are advertised as suitable app control. I am a embedded software engineer an understand a bluetooth connection as well as most but this one never sync'd. No where but community web pages for support. Beware.
 I love my new watch!!  I ordered this so that my activity can be tracked into my weight-watchers AP and this syncs up nicely.  Setup was super simple and the watch is very comfortable to wear.  Only thing is that the color is more purple in person that how it looks online, but since I like purple it doesn't bother me.
 I purchased this item 7 months ago because the gym I belong to awards health points that sync with Fitbit steps.  I liked that extra perk, and the features of the Charge 2 HR were helpful, but the screen cracked down the middle after about 6 months of use. I don't do extreme sports, and I don't even wear the Fitbit to bed. In fact, in 65 years, I have never before cracked the face of a watch. I suspect that the charging unit---which clamps onto either side of the face screen---may have caused the crack.  An internet search revealed that a vertical crack down the center of the face is a common problem, and many other customers have been unhappy with the company's response.
 I ordered the small and it fits perfect with room to spare.  I'm a medium build female, 5'6" and about 150 pounds.  Install the app on your smart phone and set up is very easy.  It reminds me to move if I haven't in the last hour.  Also tells me who is calling or texting.  I can only see 1st line of text but phone is near by anyway.
 I purchased this item for my husband. He loves it. This size is perfect for his wrist. It tracks steps, sleep, and heart rate. We did purchase a screen protector to prevent scratching on the screen surface.
 I am very disappointed with the accuracy of this product. I tested this along with my phone GPS and my jawbone UP3, the charge 2 is way off on my run mileage. I would have rather spent the extra money for the Surge. The notifications are not working either.
 Considering returning. Had to turn off heart rate monitor , it gave me arm pain. I switched wrists and turnt off heart rate monitor to see if the problem still continues.
 Love the color and the 5 day battery. The actual readings are WAY off, however.  I walk 10 steps to the bathroom and it counts 26.  I have over 1000 steps by 8 AM and all I've done is drive to work and make a pot of coffee.  The heart rate monitor shows me in fat burning stage (95+ bpm)even when I am sitting and resting (68-72 bpm actual)...totally bogus. If you really need something accurate, this is not it.  If you want a nice looking band to record and chart with, it works good for that.
 Very inaccurate!  Said I was doing between 100 and 400 steps before I got out of bed each day.  I'm a court reporter.  I went over 12,000 steps sitting in the courtroom all day.  It logged my hour-long aerobic class as 30 minutes. It was uncomfortable and bulky.  It wasn't very responsive to tapping to get it to come on.
 Very useful with both the steps and the heart rate, plus other functions available.  You do not have to pair it with a smart phone or computer for these readings - only for things like counting the number of hour you slept. Good battery life. Great look with the gold &amp; lavender.  Also you can buy separate bands in various colors to change the style.
 Loved the Charge 2 but hated the band.  It constantly came undone and finally fell off my arm and lost it.  My old Timex had a nice secure band and this would have never happened with it.  So, great unit except for the lack of security in terms of the band.
 Gives a gift my husband and it was perfect.  He actually had a fit bit for a couple of years and lost it! We had problems with the band separating from the face.  The face of the watch is much better now and the strap seems much stronger. He’s very happy with it
 I was SOOOO excited to get the new fitbit charge...I previously owned Fitbit Charge HR in Plum, so I got this special edition as a gift to myself for my birthday.  Today is the 1st day I've worn it and it ALREADY looks dingy.  It hasn't even been 24hours.  I know these bands are replaceable, but why pay extra for the Rose Gold and lavender to get a different color band? I haven't even had it long enough to rate anything else, but I'm so upset when I look at it now, that it changed my whole attitude towards it. Don't get this color band, you'll be disappointed.
 Basic fitbit the battery is a bit lacking and when it tells you it run ing low you dont have a day left of charge in my case its a few hours the app is best part about it  ur I am very active with both hands so my results could differ
 Not impressed. Accuracy is riiculously poor.<br/>I have steps in my home, 15 stairs from 1st floor to second floor landing. For every 10 times i go up, it registers about 7. Sometimes I walk 30 or 40 steps before it registers.<br/>Untrustworthy results.
 The Fitbit Charge 2 is pretty awesome!  Finally, I found something to motivate me to be more active.  The controls are pretty intuitive if you're trying to get updated on things on-the-go.<br/><br/>Things I like:<br/>Quick switching through different info screens<br/>Very long charge time..  It seems to last about 5 days<br/>Getting reminded that I need to move around<br/>Celebrations from the Fitbit when I reach my goals<br/>Walking..  Surprisingly<br/>Finding out what different things do to my heart rate<br/><br/>Things I'll have to live with:<br/>Something on my arm constantly<br/>Getting reminded that I need to move around<br/>This one isn't waterproof<br/>The price of different (Fitbit brand) bands
 Bought two fibit charge 2.  One for me and one for my wife.  Afyer about 6 months my wife ran her Fitbit battery down to zero.  Upon recharge, the screen went blank.  Unit kept registering activity but display did not work.  This unit was under warranty and Fitbit replaced the unit no questions asked.  My unit, 1 1/2 old, had the same exact thing happened to my Fitbit charge 2.  This time fibit said it is out of warranty and they offered me a coupon for 25% off.  This condition is a known defect and Fitbit will not do right by the consumer.
 After setting a reachable goal for steps, the Fitbit helped me push myself to achieve the goal.  Also, I have a pacemaker and am interested in my heartrate, both exercising and at rest.  The Fitbit allows me to observe these data as needed.
 I loved this so much when I first got it.  But it will not send text notifications to it.  Fitbit Trouble shooted it for weeks and can't figure it out.  The only reason that I haven't sent it back is because I don't want to go 2-3 weeks without it.  But I did buy it for the reason that notification and phone calls come through it.  Mine has yet to do that.
 It’s used.. nothing stated I was buying a used item, screen is scratched, has dried possibly lotion on the bottom part of it, someone’s hairs tangled in the charging cable. Really disappointed seeing how it was bought for my girlfriend for Christmas and she has to see scratches on the screen and another females hair in the charging cable.
 I've been wearing this daily for the past few months, and while it is fairly good at counting steps, the GPS for this device is terribly inaccurate. I run a 3 mile route that is heavily shaded, and the GPS could not locate my device multiple times. Or if it did find it, it only showed a small part of my route and did not give me credit for the entire distance ran. However, my phone tracker was spot on. This is a device for casual fitness, not a substitute for a running tracker such as a Garmin.
 I would love to give it more stars, but the HR monitor is just to inconsistent. And that was basically the primary reason why I bought it.  I do love the data it gives on your sleeping habits thought
 Since I started the Fitbit in January I have been holding myself accountable to my physical activity and food consumption. I am proud to say I am 33 lbs down and am still on my journey to achieve good health.
 He loves it. Tells me all the time how many steps he has made each day, what his sleep time was for last night, etc. Maybe I will get one as well except I wish they had an ankle band for it because I have to type on a computer a lot and don't wear a watch because the band drags on the edge of the desk. This one probably would do the same thing.
 I have used this everyday since March 1st. I sync the fitbit app with Myfitnesspal app for calorie counting. Down 30 pounds in three months. I do not know how I would have guessed my calorie burn without it. It would have been too much trouble for me to log.
 My husband and I both have the Charge 2.  Since we're in our 70's, we enjoy being able to check our heart rate as we exercise.  I walk every day with my dog.  However, my husband does not particularly enjoy walking, but knows that he needs to get some more exercise.  His fitbit has motivated him to get moving more and strive for those 10K daily steps.
 It's a Fitbit.  There are several areas that need to be addressed, but it is the same areas as their other fitness bands.  How stairs are counted, counting steps correctly, etc.  Nothing bad, just a different design of their underlying technology that needs to be revamped.
 I love using fitness trackers but just after my warranty expired, it stopped working. Upon contacting Fitbit the offered a coupon to use on their website (which makes the cost about the same as it would be to purchase somewhere else). I can't afford to replace the annually so I'll probably go with a different brand this year.
 My daughter has loved the Fitbit and it has worked properly, however, the surface is easily scratched and it is hard to pay this much money when their is no protection for the surface or screen of the item.  I know that they are small but a different design with a replaceable surface would be better.  Once you scratch the surface you have to spend another $150+ to replace it.  This product still needs some work.
 Bought this specifically for the heart rate monitor and this does not work consistently or at all sometimes. Ended up getting an Apple Watch Series 4 and I love it
 I used a Fitbit HR and loved it. I replaced it with this. It looks great and keeps track of my heart rate accurately. However, The HR had a way to manually start a session just by pushing the side button. The Charge 2 is supposed to do this automatically. But it doesn't. I have worked out 3 day for a full hour each day and so far one day it said I worked out 43 min. One day 14 min. and one day not at all. Why they took that feature away is beyond me. I used to be able to show my doctor what my heart rate was like during each session. Now, We have look at each 24 hour day and try to figure out when my workout too place. If they ever fix this feature or create the ability to manually start a session as with the HR my rating goes to 5 stars.
 Love, love, love my Fitbit Charge 2.  Fitbit makes a very nice product, however they only seem to replace once and then you'll either have to have an extended warranty or just buy new, which is what I did.  Fitbit is still a very dependable product and easy to use.
 It thinks I'm walking when I'm on my scooter. I get 2000 steps for every half hour ride. One must jump through several flaming hoops to subtract the bogus steps. The single star is generous. VERY disappointed.
 My excitement quickly changed to disappointment after repeatedly trying to set up the FitBit and getting the "an error occurred while pairing" error. Checking the FitBit site resulted in the following suggestion "First I turned off all BT, phone, computer, IPad. Then shut off phone (being used as connected device)plugged in fitbit and restarted. turned phone back on, turned BT on phone only, finally was able to sync and update.,then turned all other BT devices back on.", which was praised by FitBit support.<br/><br/>No thanks, return submitted.
 I've had this Fitbit Charge 2 for about two months.  Some my favorite features are:<br/>(If this review helps you, please select "yes" below - thanks)<br/><br/>1) The app is very good; user friendly and allows for customization (goals, tracking preferences, walking/running stride, etc.)<br/>2) The sleep tracker on the app has been updated.  The Fitbit Charge 2 uses the heart rate monitor to enhance sleep tracking.  Heart rate is affected naturally by sleep patterns.  The Charge 2 combines movement detection with changes in heart rate to track and estimate time in "light sleep," "deep sleep," "REM" and "awake" patterns.  Any fitbit without heart rate monitoring may track sleep but will not be as advanced as the Charge 2. Without the heart rate, only "awake", "restless" and "asleep" patterns will be tracked.  The Charge 2 does not track sleep patterns during naps (you have to sleep more than 3 hours before it can accurately track).  The sleep tracking is significantly better (detailed and accurate) than any fitness tracker I have used in the past.<br/>3) Heart rate monitoring is fairly accurate.  I see no obvious discrepancies.<br/>4) Silent alarms.  You can set silent alarms in the app which will sync to the Charge 2.  Silent alarms vibrate and are strong enough to get your attention without disturbing others.  I use this feature at work.  Very useful.<br/>5) The clasping mechanism works well.  Some fitness trackers have clasping mechanisms that seem to be designed more for aesthetics rather than functionality.  There has been no problems with the Charge 2 staying put.<br/><br/>Your standard stats are tracked (steps, floors climbed, distance, calories, active minutes) as well as progress towards goals set (daily steps, daily sleep, days of exercise per week, etc.)<br/><br/>My only problem so far is... sometimes when you drive slowly (like through a parking lot) the Charge 2 can mistake the travel as steps taken.  I estimate anywhere between 50-100 steps per day are not actual steps.<br/><br/>Also, I forgot twice to take this off in the shower.  I remembered after a few minutes and took it off at once.  I dried it off quickly.  There was/is no damage caused by the water.
 I LOVE my charge 2!!! It has motivated me to get and keep moving. I really like how it interacts with the Fitbit app.  If you are on the fence about size I would say go smaller.  I have an average size wrist (I wear 7" to 7-1/2" bracelets) and the small fits great.  I wear it on the 5th hole and there are still six smaller holes.
 There is a known issue with many Fitbit Charge 2 trackers where the battery dies completely - mine after 26 months of regular use.  Although Fitbit is well aware of the problem, they won’t acknowledge it and will only offer a 25% off coupon on purchase of another Fitbit.  Invest your money elsewhere.
 I really like the features this fitbit has and it is still small enough to be comfortable to wear all the time.  I would recommend this Fitbit to anyone who wants to track steps, sleep and have notifications of text messages or phone calls.
 It's decent. I shouldn't say it's all bad but I'm having issues and had them right off the bat. A lot of the time I have trouble syncing it to my phone. Like when I go on walks or runs, it won't sync to where it shows me in maps where I've been. And the charge does not, at all, last 5 days like it's supposed to. More like 3. Thankfully it's a quick charge.
 Love the Fitbit but hate the strap. 💓 rate seems accurate (same as the elliptical I use at the gym). I also enjoy the other features.  I find it motivating and fun.
 Bought this for my husband and he is in love with this little trinket.  He uses it daily and relies on all the features.  Highly recommend.
 I love the color. Yay yes I had to get warranty just incase it give out on me. This will be the 3rd Fitbit that I upgrade to cuz I can't get enough.. Next I'm. Buying their scale
 I absolutely love this Fitbit!  I used to have the Charge HR, but it died on me, so I upgraded myself to the Charge 2.  I like the added features like the reminders to move every hour.  I also like that I can see the time, date, and my step count all on one screen.  Now, I am looking forward to buying some pretty new bands for it!
 I bought the fit bit charge to without doing a lot of research I just knew that it was the newest Fitbit out there and since this is my first Fitbit I wanted the best fit bit money could buy.<br/>now once I bought my Fitbit I saw there were a couple different styles other than the charge2 that I may have preferred with a bigger face on similar to an Apple Watch but the fit bit charge to is very narrow and has a small footprint so you hardly realize that you're wearing it which I do prefer over a large clock face.  I definitely use the application on my phone more than I use the watch itself as far as keeping track of my progress  but you really can't have one without the other.<br/>Overall worth it!
 Does what I need. Great for tracking calories burned, quality of sleep, miles walked, and steps.<br/><br/> I’ve had this for a little over a year, and there’s a crack forming on the front. It’s not so durable, &amp; cheap. My one year warranty is over, unfortunately.]
 Just received it today it synced perfectly with my iPhone6 I bought a new band to go with it. I will update this after a few workouts.<br/><br/>Keeps up with all my steps and workouts. No complaints I will be gifting this to my daughter since I have purchased the charge 3
 BIG PROBLEM..bought this for our daughter for xmas 2017.. it works great but once it's on extra bands we bought her it doesn't fit in them, it doesn't click in. She says it fits fine in the rose/gold band and fits fine in her friends bands but won't fit into the original band it came with nor the 3 extra bands we bought. She will be calling Amazon and hopefully they'll fix the problem for her asap.
 I've worn a fitbit for 1.5 years straight now. I'm glad I updated to this from the Flex. The sleep tracker is so interesting to see. And I appreciate the heart monitor. Definitely inspires you to try to increase your fitness score! Also, this is just a cool looking watch.
 I had a problem with a crack in the screen of my Charge 2.  The Fitbit representative was very efficient &amp; helpful.  She sent a replacement immediately.  I give this company five stars &amp; an excellent recommendation.
 Fantastic and easy to use..get app on phone and it practically sets itself up..now I know my resting heart rate ,how many steps I take in a day and how many hours of sleep I get..turns out I average about 6 hrs..ha! I'm a middle age woman and this is a great tool ...it has many more features not mentioned here..i won't be living without one from now on..
 I've had the <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Fitbit-Charge-2-Heart-Rate-Fitness-Wristband-Black-Large/dp/B01K9S260E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Fitbit Charge 2 Heart Rate + Fitness Wristband, Black, Large</a> for a couple of months now.  Setup was easy, it paired to the Fitbit app on my Android phone, and I was off and running.  I wear it on my dominant/right hand, and keep it on most of the day.  It's comfortable enough that I don't have any problem sleeping with it on.  It has been fine with (sweaty) workouts.  I generally don't like plastic wristbands but the one in the box is ok.  It does pull out some arm hair when I'm sliding along the "keeper", but that's the only negative so far.<br/><br/>I've been on a trip to a different time zone where my phone was off and I didn't have Internet access - the Charge2 stored information for over a week and restored it when I next synced.  I'm also happy to see Fitbit updating the app as well as the device firmware.
 No clear indication that Windows Phone currently has no notification or connected GPS support despite their sales website giving the impression everything is good. I feel lied to.
 We love our FitBit. This i our first time owning the name brand. We have used several off name brand ones, I have to say nothing compares. The functionality on wrist is nice, but the app is outstanding. Both my wife and I love the metrics we can keep up with and the little competitions we can have. I say its a must for keeping up with your activities.
 I hesitated to buy this because of my experience with Fitbit Charge. My first one lasted 6 months before the band separated and it stopped working. The company replaced it, but the same thing happened with the replacement.  But I bought the Charge 2 anyway because they changed the band.  That aspect seems better but the sleep tracker is awful.  It's hours off.  One morning I got up, fixed and ate breakfast, and it still showed me as asleep. I have tried both sensitive and regular setting, reset it, made sure the app is up to date.  It just doesn't work.  This feature of the device is important to me do I will likely return it.
 I can't believe I lived with charging the Apple Watch nightly when I know realize a fitbit Watch does the same fitness functions I need and I only need to charge it practically once a week. I also love the sleep tracking with Apple Watch didn't do for me because I had to charge it at night!
 I got this item quickly. I just need to figure out how to receive my txt messages and calls. It a great purchase. I have real bad anxiety, and it helps me calm my breathing. It also allows me to know when i have gotten my heart rate up to high. Highly recommend this fit bit. Just need t be patient if you are not tech savoy like myself.
 * the biggest issue is the alarm vibration is too weak. - I loved this feature on the Charge HR and used it all the time<br/>The vibration is so soft I don't feel confident that it will wake me so<br/>- either have to set another alarm negating the reason why I bought the Charge 2 HR<br/>- my sleep is interrupted as I wake frequently scared I will miss the alarm<br/><br/>I have been on the help website and despite this being an issue for a long time there seems to be no solution or improvement.<br/><br/>* The combination of tapping &amp; / or pushing button is confusing - Im still having trouble learning this
 I was a skeptic for a long time and thought I didn't need one of these. Boy was I wrong, how convenient and great it is to have one. I don't have to lug my phone along to see how far I have walked or how many steps I've taken, no separate heart rate monitor needed for my runs. I am happy with this and just ordered one for my daughter too.
 I never knew how sedentary my life was until I got this. The Fitbit gives me motivation to get up and move, and allows me to track my progress. I am hooked!
 First time ever to purchase a FitBit of any kind. I decided after researching I wanted a larger screen and switchable straps and easy to use. BEWARE THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT SIZES STRAP (SMALL WRIST TO LARGE WRIST) I have smaller wrist so I have the smaller size. Doesn't matter which smartphone or PC uses. I used my Android and Laptop to view, adjust and do whatever I want. You can chose which wrist you want it on on the setting. Your Dominant arm I chose the right arm. Some chose the left. I bought a screen protector due to easy to scratch (Illumishield 2ct) (There are much more varieties of screen protectors and lot more than 2 ct go with what customer are saying positive reviews). Once you get it you have to charge it first than  first time I use it I had to turn the watch to the bottom of my wrist due to the size of it &amp; can be uncomfortable first time wearer. Only have it to 6 notch on my strap. On my Android I can change whatever I want. I did try to wear it while I slept and it was tight therefore I got a swelling on the bottom of my wrist just because I had it too tight. 6 notch so I took it off a the whole day break from using it and the next day my wrist was back to normal. I now just wear it to 5th notch and I do not care to monitor my sleeping pattern ( If you plan on monitoring your sleep pattern lighten notches from the strap Its pretty cool features tells u how many times I am restless and wakeup ). It is now much more comfortable wearing it on the top of my wrist and no longer get the swelling. So don't freak out that just allergic reaction to having it too tight . Some people have gotten rashes of because of the plastic strap I haven't had that yet because I am not allergic to plastic. They do say to take care of it clean it and give your wrist a break and not wear it all day long also if you feel your not going to be active one day just don't wear it at all (mostly due to bad weather or too sick). There a charger that charge to your Laptop or some sort of plug in you.  need to buy separate in order for it to charge. The screen protector that sometime you see when you first get this you don't need to get that one I got one that was low affordable(Illumishield 2ct) had a lot of positive reviews and only two surface protection screen and very easy to put on by watching youtube video. I enjoy the GPS feature in which you can setup walking, Running or hiking and Just click go and the exercise I don't watch it just put it in my pocket and when I come back from my walk I stop it and tells me how long and mapped out where and also maps your pace and how many calories burn it's a cool feature. You can manual put in your walking strides or if you are like me just let the Fitbit Charge 2 do it for you because my walking changes especially if you are in the winter season and the roads/ woods aren't too great. I love the different cardio but I wish they had the Stairmaster selection so I put that under workout because basically it does your heart. I also timed myself at weights and any other cardio workout at the gym it tells me everything from heart rate to how much I burn and so much more. You can chose how many days you want to workout and how many steps and water intake ( water couldn't figure that one out had to check other site to find out how much water I was to take in) and food intake and heart rate, weigh in and how much you want to weigh and so much more. I get plenty of fun badges that tells me I succeeded in making it to 10,000 steps and other successful achievement. They offered Friends challenge and FB other social Platform to show off your success I don't participate that. They offered workout video on your smartphone I have yet to use that feature. There a relax mode you can chose to do 5 or 2 mins breathing inhale and exhale for those who are stress out. Also notification for your texting on your phone. Your fitbit charge 2 will let u see incoming text you can shut it off. Touch screen is very easy to use I watched Youtube and witness a lot of people showing how to use and what you can get out of it. Very interesting and I do not regret my purchase. Another thing on Prime its cheaper than in the local store and if you have Amazon Reward card and rack up a lot of points you can use that and gets lower price than ever. Of course gift-cards you get works too.. I didn't bother with warranty I read other people's comments about it and found the warranty not worth it there already a one year on it and I can just go on to the fitbit site and extend it a little longer. It arrive on time came in a box and protective. I chose black because it matches everything. I can switch it down the road to whatever I want and they offered leather for those who want to take it classier or just causal  and many other different colors. This watch isn't water proof but that fine I don't wear watches in the water anyways &amp; protective by my sleeves of my jacket. U can adjust to making u move all the time I don't let it control me yet so I decided when I want to move take it off and I do try to get 10,000 steps ( adjust the steps to less or more) even though it winter time and like 19 or low digit degree out there I just walk inside go to the gym and go up my many different stairs.. Good luck to those who are interested in buying first time wearer or upgrading to something different you will not regret it!! So far I only had it beginning of this year Jan 2nd 2017 and now this is my 9th 2nd week of use. I am so far very happy with the progress. I am still learning everyday about what my fitbit charge 2 can do for me.
 Bought this for my wife for her birthday in June. She loves it, but there are issues with the band on this model! She's not an agressive wearer (she doesn't wear it running, just daily activities) and she's had a band fail twice.<br/><br/>The band that came with the watch broke off about 2 months after she got it. Fitbit gave her a free replacement. That one just broke again in December. So, two failed bands in about 6 months. That's not right!<br/><br/>Fitbit community website has tons of posts of this issue, but so far Fitbit is not acknowledging this as a fundamental issue.<br/><br/>I'd recommend a different model so you don't have to deal with this.
 I ordered this for my granddaughter for Christmas and the one she actually opened Christmas morning was faulty and  wouldn't work even after being left on the charger over night which was a big disappointment. Returned it and had the replacement within a few days with no problems (in time for her to take back to school with her).  She really likes it now and is always finding more  things it is capable of.  So in spite of the initial problem I give this 4 stars.
 I'll never understand why so many feedbacks are positive on this product. All I can say in worthless and inaccurate, a piece of junk. Wow, wish I were Fitbit and making millions on a worthless product. Must be nice.
 I love my Fitbit - the problem was the guide they gave you to order which size you wanted was completed wrong - I ordered the XL based on the chart.  I really could of used a medium.  I had to go and purchase bands at an extra charge to me.
 Absolutely love the watch! I upgraded from having the charge HR. I purchased the watch mainly to receive text notification at work since I’m unable to have my phone on me. &amp; it’s great! I do have to say that the band is a tad bit bigger than the usual small. My wrist is super tiny &amp; its hard to find watches that fit. It’s not a deal breaker but could’ve been a little more snug. Overall I still love the product!
 So far loving  it.  I bought it mainly because it syncs up to the weight Watchers app.  I was using a Bella Beat before, but the sleep tracking on this Fitbit is so much better, the graphics in the app so sleep patterns much better.<br/><br/>I also bought a leather band  &amp;  a beaded band so I could switch things up look wise, and also because I'm not a fan of the rubber band that comes in the Fitbit.
 This is amazing. It counts my steps, calories, sleep, and flights of stairs. You need to conect it to the Fitbit app every once in a while but it unlocks other features. I like the fact that I can challenge my friends to the race. It is not waterproof so if I were a swimmer I would buy this and the flex 2 so track swimming and keep the fetchers of the charge.
 The software interface is cute. It's good for about ten minutes os fun. As a monitor of any kind of activity, or body function it is a sad joke. It's step count is roughly three times the actual number  - I suspect it counts every letter typed on a keyboard as a step. It's heart rate monitor is anything but. If you're interested is a step counter stick to Fitbit's One.
 I love it. I've had it for a month or two now and it's great. It tracks everything exactly as it should and gives me notifications when I want. I keep track of all my activity and this definitely does it and it fitness focused as opposed to smart watches
 Few products in life actually change your life.  For me this has been a real eye opener with regards to my sleep patterns and caloric intake.  I am making changes in my exercise, sleep and eating habits and have already seen a 10 point drop in my resting heart rate in just 3 weeks which means my heart appreciates the effort...
 Greatest fitness motivator ever!! Tracks all of my stages of sleep at night and helps me keep track of my water intake, steps, calories burned,  etc.during the day. Sends subtle but helpful reminders throughout the day if I've been sitting too long or need to move around. Since I bought this a month ago I've lost 10 pounds and have almost tripled by daily step intake. My only complaint is that it's not water proof, but other than that, definitely recommend this product.
 I like it. To me, the pulse is very accurate. When I check my BP I get a heart rate and I compare it with my Fitbit and it usually on or off just 1or 2 points... very seldom more. I say it was 90 to 95% accurate. I'm very pleased with it.
 Just want to say I love this fitbit.  I owned the previous generation equivalent and although this doesnt offer much more in the way of features, the ability to swap bands, its MUCH improved charging port, and the cardio fitness addition based on your VO2 max are welcome additions.
 I bought this for myself but now my 82 year old father wears it and loves it!  Great health stats to keep him aware of his heart rate and physical activity throughout the day. Climbing 17 flights of stairs and walking 3 miles a day is not bad for an 82 year old man.  Looks like I will be getting another one of these!
 The fitbit strap has come-off - after an year of use. So not much to complain, I guess.
 It seems like a nice product. I haven't even had it for a week yet but ive already had to charge it up three times. It's annoying to have it randomly shut off in the middle of the day. The battery lasts for one day and one night then cuts off the next day.  👎🏽<br/>I'm going to return it, maybe I just got a bad one.
 The metal clasp fell off after a week of gentle use.  Also, when I wore the band on a stair master, the heart rate reading would never be able to get a reading even though I placed the watch in the place and alignment that the instructions showed.  I feel like I wasted a lot of money of this product and am extremely unhappy.
 I tried this unit and it is so bad.  I compared the results to my iphone application for tracking distance and two different treadmils and the results from the Fitbit is not even close to the two other sources.
 I love it.  It's sturdier than my previous Charge HR, and the screen is much brighter and easier to read.  Battery life is excellent.  If you get the latest firmware upgrade you can have an on-board battery meter, which is something I've been waiting for for years.
 Love love love this watch. I bought this on January 2, 2018 and I’ve been using it every single day since then. It is an amazing watch that has helped me stay on track with becoming more active. I definitely recommend this Charge 2 to anyone looking for a user friendly and super light weight smart watch to start working on their fitness goals.
 I bought this for my dad for his birthday. He loves it and wears it every day. He loves seeing how he slept each night and monitoring his heart rate when he is active. I like that he can see his steps as a reminder to get moving.
 All the functionality and software app support make this an outstanding tool to help with fitness and/or weight loss goals. I play piano, though, so I have to remember to take it off before playing, because it will count non-walking activity in the daily steps...
 Bought as a raffle for a benefit. It was one of the top going raffles that night.
 It did not track steps. It tracked arm movements, coughs, burps, etc. Very disappointed. It did not live up to all the hype.
 My wrist broke out in a rash or something after 4 months of wear.  I do not use it anymore, use the arm band type for working out since its waterproof and elastic band doesn't cause discomfort.
 he loved his gift.. it has been great.. we compare our steps daily
 I love my new Fitbit Charge 2.  I bought the silver band to wear with it and it really does dress it up.
 I was a little disappointed with the product, the small band fit nice and plenty of room.  I wasn't impressed with the step tracker, every time I moved my arm it counted steps. The looks and fit are great.  Sad that it didn't work the way I wanted especially for the price.
 I bought this for my wife in January. In June its fried. No longer tracks steps and the date changes throughout the day. I wouldn't recommend paying this much for something that lasts 5 months.
 Great gift, this is a great item without going into the Gear-like territory. Lots of functions and a longer than expected battery life, plus changeable bands make this a must-have or a great gift to give to a gym goer or pro-health person.
 After reading reviews i decided to go ahead and get it despite the negative reviews of issues.  Well i ended up being a customer who has issues. It tells time great and i like the sleek look however is doesnt take accurate heart rate at all ands ometimes doesnt take  it at al reay sucks when in middle of my workouts.ive tried all different positions and both arns and still no luck. It also has issues syncing with my note 5 and will say it cant find devuce when its right in my hand next wrist. I threw the box away and was so happy to use it but now i cant return it.maybe i got a bad watch
 I generally like the Fitbit Charge 2 but there are certain things I would change if I could.  First, it seems to take forever to sync to my Smart Phone.  I sync every day or every other day, so I don't know why it takes so long.  It  can take up to 3 minutes.  Also, they suggest wearing it at night, but if you're the restless type, and you move your arm, the thing lights up like a flashlight. I wish there was a setting to dim the display or turn off the feature that turns it on with movement during certain hours.
 I am totally obsessed with my Fitbit ! You can link up with friends who have one and do challenges. I didn't realize how much I actually walk each day. Plus it makes you want to walk and do more. The app you download you can track your water,food etc. the Fitbit also tracks how much you sleep a night. Great product!
 I wear this every day and really love it! Never had any problems and am especially happy with the bluetooth connection so I can see who's calling and texting me since there is a no phone rule at my school and work.
 So far so good. This is my fourth fitbit. They seem to last for about a year and then the battery cannot hold a charge. For now, I love the watch feature and the fact that my text messages come on the screen.
 Unfortunately, this item requires bi-monthly syncing to my laptop. Also, the band broke last week; within the first year! I'm sad:-(
 I really love my fit bit and it works perfect! The only problem is the wristband keeps coming on hinged. One side pops off unprovoked frequently. No matter how much I lock it into place it randomly comes apart. I am just afraid I’m going to lose it and not realize it. If replacing the wristband would help I will try that, has anyone had this experience and found that to be the solution? I don’t want to buy another wristband only to have the same thing happen
 Love this Fitbit. I had the 1st HR but had to throw it away when the band ripped. Interchangeable bands are awesome with this wristband and will extend it's life.
 It's OK, I found the heart rate monitor to be inaccurate during workouts however. Also didn't like that it is not water resistant. It did do an excellent job of syncing with the app though, and was always up to date and problem free in that area.
 Definitely not happy with my Fitbit charge 2. Bought it in March for a 2 week trip in April abroad. Wanted to track our trip. Got it out last night, charged it, and ready for a walk this morning. Thought I would compare it to my walking app. on my phone. Fitbit - 2.86 IPhone app - 3.5. Very dissatisfied. Only gave it 1 star because I had to for this to post!
 Perfect upgrade from charge hr. Larger screen. Shows texts. Looks like upscale watch!. Charger much simpler. Shorter charge time. CONSUMER REPORTS best buy of all fitbit. So far  excellent investment.
 Vast improvement over the original Charge HR, and the perfect amount of battery that I never have to think about it. And just enough notifications as a "smartwatch" - Calls, Texts and Calendar alerts only. Really the only improvement I'd want is for the text to be faster/easier to read. Perfect otherwise.
 I have had two other Fit-bits, the clip on and the Flex and the charge 2 is well worth the money. I hope it lasts for a long time because my Flex didn't hold a charge after I had it less than a year.
 Continous heart monitoring and auto exercise detection are nice.  Mobile app makes it easy to see how your heart rate fluxuates.  Has left/right handedness setting so the button and screen are oriented correctly.  Easily links with MyFitnessPal to report activity and calories burned.<br/>Screen can be non-responsive when trying to select using touch/swipe.  Screen isn't as tough as expected but I'm a lefty and wear the unit on my left arm so that might account for some of the damage.
 I've personally had no problems with my strap, as seems to be the problem with some; The strap has two locking pieces for double insurance on you not losing it.<br/><br/>Functions as expected, neat app as well, only problem is more of a slice of life feature; Turning your wrist doesn't seem to always activate it.<br/><br/>I'd also recommend the self repair screen protector for it, the screen seems delicate.<br/><br/>(Going on using mine for 3 months)
 I would return it if I hadn't missed the return date.  It just doesn't stay charged long enough.  There are fitness devices that have an actual battery in them that lasts (forever) until the battery needs to be replaced.  I also haven't understood some of the sleep information it has reported.  It's ok.
 I knocked off one star because the band gets dirty very quickly. My wife works in an office and by the end of the week you could see how dirty/discolored the band was.<br/><br/>Note: Most bands come with a silver clasp, and it doesnt really go well with the rose gold bezel.
 Great price. Great product. I upgraded from the FitBit flex and couldn't be happier for the price. The Charge 2 has a longer battery life between charges, syncs with the Aria scale great and has a few extra bells and whistles not to mention has the time to eliminate the need for a watch or checking your phone.<br/><br/>I religiously wore my flex and was monitoring steps walked but had to rely on my phone for a map/distance gone. With the Charge 2 it integrates with the GPS on my phone as long as it is close and allows me to track other activity as well.
 Very easy to set up after you download the app. No instructions came with it.  I like the fact that I can change the bands (bought separately) to go with my outfits.  It was a little bigger than I expected, but that makes it easier to read.
 Failed within a a couple of months to sync to phone.  Followed instructions but to no avail.  Fitbit still works as a stand alone unit though. Just wont sync to phone.
 This is the 3rd Fitbit and seems to be the best designed so far.  Very pleased with how easy it was to set-up and I like the new charging mechanism which makes charging the device much easier.  Like the various functions and so far seems to be working accurately based on the number of steps it is recording.  Nice user-interface as well.
 Awesome step up from the old charge HR. Lots of new features. Great big new screen! Bought it for my wife as a surprise when her last one was about to die and then we ended up buying one for my mom for Christmas too and they both love it. Even tempted a few friends to make the move back to Fitbit from an Apple Watch.
 I primarily bought this fit bit to keep track of my heart rate, however, I have noticed how I'm paying more attention to how much sleep I get, how many steps I take, and of course howy heart rate changes during activities. I was hesitant to buy this, but super happy I did.
 There's no way to turn it off so it wastes power (even though it enters a sort of sleep mode if you take it off and let it sit for a while, it's still draining battery). Has to be on pretty tight to accurately measure heart rate.
 The step counts are inaccurate.  It added 30+ steps while I was standing still, just based on the motions of my wrist while washing my hands.  I'd also wake up in the morning already with several hundred steps.
 the new charge 2 doesn't lay as flat on the wrist as the old one, i love that the screen is bigger, that is probably why the fit is different, all in all it does what it should. And i noticed that i have to flip my wrist over 3 or 4 times to turn on the screen sometimes, not always.
 I bought this to mostly to monitor my sleep pattern...I always feel tired. Come to find out my sleep is disrupted by a fat cat and 2 dog (not to mention a 6’3 Husband who snores, LOL). I also found out I have a good heart and reasonably good steps per day. Highly recommend for an average person, an athlete or someone looking to improve sleep.
 Love it! Easy to set up. Easy to use. Food log is great, exercise is recognized and tracked automatically, sleep monitor is really interesting.<br/>My wrist measured right on the cusp and so I ordered a large band but probably should have gone with small.  If/when I replace the color I will order a small.
 My wife got this for an X-mas gift, she loves it and the size vs the larger ones and Apple watches.  She uses it and with the notifications for either making the # of steps or that she has made it - these help keep her going.
 It only comes off my wrist to charge.  I have gained so much muscle tone in my stomach and legs which is priceless to me.  I went from not working out to working out 1 to 3 hours daily just by lightly jogging in my home to just walking in my house.
 This product does well at keeping track of steps, heart rate, exercise etc. But, the magnetic bits holding the band on are low quality. I've had other fitness trackers that I've loved and have worn into the ground. This one loses it's ability to hold the wristband on after 5 months. Do yourself a favor, and buy a better quality watch that will stay on your wrist.
 The wife loves it, very good design. I cannot complain. The Charge 2 is perfect for anyone wanting minimal watch body and full features. Changing watch bands is very simple and easy. I highly recommend this Charge 2 to anyone looking for a healthy start to the new year.
 CRAP!<br/>FIT BIT SUPPORT...CRAP!<br/>Won't charge after 1 month. Customer support wanted me to power it off and restart!! HOW DO YOU DO THAT IF IT HAS NO POWER?! Battery icon flashes when I try to power off or on... hence NO battery power! Clearly, tech support was reading from a prompter! She couldn't answer the questions I asked and kept going back to POWER IT OFF!<br/>CRAP CRAP CRAP!<br/>I won't EVER deal with them or Fit Bit again.
 Didn’t have as many analytical features as one would expect. It works well but the battery can die quickly after a while. With that said I think it was a great purchase because I can compete with a friend as to how many steps we do every day
 I've had this monitor for a few months now and have been wearing it every day.  It had the main features I was interested in - pedometer and heart rate monitor, but some of the other features were a bonus such as sleep monitoring and calorie estimate.  My company also has a health rebate for physical activity and this device was one which was approved for use to get the rebate.<br/>The pedometer seems to be fairly accurate.  Others have noted that they think it's way off since they'll take a short walk and the steps aren't correct, but when I'm on my treadmill the numbers seem to count up pretty much in step.  I also take long hikes where the distance and steps seem reasonably accurate.  While it may not be an exact count of steps, I think it fills it's requirement as a monitor for general activity.<br/>While it has many great features, I've had a number of issues with it.  The main complaints include:<br/>- Heart rate monitoring doesn't always work.  It seems to be fine when resting or doing light work, but when doing a workout it either has no reading or one which is obviously not correct.  I've read all the tips on adjusting it properly, etc, but when walking on a treadmill for example, the watch often isn't able to read my heartrate (display shows "--").<br/>- The app doesn't work very well.  The dashboard often doesn't show the heartrate even when it is displayed on the device.  Oddly, the graph view which shows the heart rate throughout the day seems to show the data so I'm not sure what's going on there.  It also often loses communication with the device.  I'll need to restart the watch to get it to sync, and on one occasion I had to delete the profile and start over again.<br/>- The strap is difficult to adjust.  When I go hiking or walking sometimes my hands get swollen. The strap is made out of a rubber material, presumably to keep it from slipping, but it also prevents the end of the strap from sliding very easily through the loop after it's buckled.  I often struggle with getting the strap out of the loop and feel like I'm going to end up breaking it.<br/>- The device is supposed to recognize when your arm is twisted to read the watch and should come on automatically.  This only seems to work about half the time, so when I want to look at the device I usually end up having to press the side button for it to come on.<br/>- Made in China
 This watch band broke the first month I wore it.  I heard from others that this is common for this particular watch.  It separated where the watch and band connect.  I glued it with super glue which lasted another month but then broke again.  I should have sent it back immediately.  My bad.  I'm not going to order another one because I'm concerned it will break like the first one.
 Not impressed.  Does not calculate steps correctly even after I adjusted my stride multiple times.  I can be sleeping and it says I walked 500 steps and no i wasnt sleep walking lol. I loved my fitbit hr but this one was a let down.  Would love to return it but it's too much trouble to return.
 This is perfect for those who want a few smart watch features while still wearing their watch on the other wrist. I get fitness tracking, texts, and nice reminders to walk every hour.
 Glad I chose the Fitbit Charge 2. It's comfortable and I like the messages it gives me to move! Heart rate monitor is excellent as is the relaxation module. Only thing is I'd like to get a different band. The rubberized band bothers my skin a bit, but I'm still wearing it!
 This is my second fitbit. I really like this one. I had a flex at first. I really like how this one can also be used as a watch. Also love being able to scroll through and see my progress so far. Also love love love that I can get alarms and text alerts through it!
 Use this thing all the time in monitoring my activity… So far I am 35 # lighter. It can be a monitor or a tool.... to me it is a tool in losing this 100+ lbs I put on over the past 23 years!!!
 Looks great but does NOT work as efficiently as my old Charge HR. After 2 firmware updates, it is still undercounting steps by 10-30% and will not sync properly. Additional features are nice but overall useless if device is inaccurate. Waiting on final assistance from fitbit but currently planning on returning &amp; going back to the HR...
 I don't like that I can't just replace a bad battery in my 22 month old Fitbit.  The one I just ordered will replace it. Make sure you use a screen protection, they scratch and scuff very easily.
 I love my Fitbit! I've worn the UP2, however it kept snapping off my wrist. I've recently switched to Fitbit and I love the reminders to move and positive reinforcement messages!
 My first entry in to the wearable technology category. I like it so far. It does take a bit to get use to but it works nicely with the cell phone app. The only thing that is rather annoying is it pops on when it thinks you turn your wrist towards your face. this is great during the day but really annoying at night as it might "flash" you.
 Best Fitbit product I have owned. I have owned a Surge, Force, Zip, and Ultra, and this one is the absolute top. Being able to change out the bands is a huge improvement - both my Surge and Force bands started peeling with no way to replace them. The separation of the tracker and the band was a wonderful idea.
 Today when my son slid his arm across his pillow, the watch fell of and he noticed the band on his watch unglued itself from the mechanical part of the wrist band.  It seems the glue simply did not hold and it just slipped off.  Can it be repaired.  Other than this cosmetic issue, the watch is great.
 1 star for fast shipping. However, the FitBit doesn't work. I have a new iPhone 7. Went to my cell phone provider thinking it was a problem with my phone, they couldn't add the device either. We tried connecting it to an Android, no luck. I reset the FitBit, I tried turning my Bluetooth off and then back on, I tried restarting my phone, I tried to set it up on my laptop but couldn't because the Charge 2 doesn't come with a dongle and I tried to setup the Device on a Bluetooth capable tablet. Nothing. Very disappointing.
 I purchased it as a way to keep tabs on my heart rate (I have afib but can't tell if I am in afib or not).  Not sure how accurate it is as I have found that it reads other activities incorrectly.  I ride a motorcycle to and from work - for some reason it counts that activity as stairs, and you can't edit the log to remove them.  Once at work friends and I do the stairs 4 or 5 times a day and love to compare how many we have for the day.
 Close, but no cigar. Purchased this based on many positive reviews. I wish I'd have done a bit more digging before buying. This device is notoriously inaccurate at step counting. In particular adding an unacceptably high number of steps/stairs while driving. Depending upon the length of drive, it can add 1,000's of steps. It appears this is a known problem which is anything but new. There have been a couple add-on app's to manually stop/deduct data while driving. Unfortunately, the bogus/inaccurate data generated is an issue most all other devices acceptably address. Very disappointed with Fitbit. A fix/acceptable solution is long overdue. The Charge 2 is one extremely large zit on their reputation. <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Fitbit-Charge-2-Heart-Rate-Fitness-Wristband-Black-Large/dp/B01K9S260E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Fitbit Charge 2 Heart Rate + Fitness Wristband, Black, Large</a>
 I love fit bits. This is my second one (I upgraded) I bought this to try it out but now I am keeping it. The only thing I wish fit bit was a radio built in with Bluetooth so when I go to the gym I wouldn't have to take my phone with me. there is other products that have that function but I don't like the design of them.
 I love this Fitbit but wanted something I could use in the pool.  When I researched this model, it mentioned it was waterproof.  They only meant for sweat during activities.  If you are looking for a Fitbit while swimming, this is not the product for you.  Otherwise, it's been great.  Very sleek and stylish.
 Just got the fitbit charge 2 in the mail today and took it out of the package only to find that the watch band is broken. Very frustrating. Call fitbit and they said they will ship out a new band and should have it in a week or so.
 Very disappointed. As a heart rate monitor it is pretty good. Steps: not accurate, not even the same as my Fitbit One. Stairs: don't make me laugh: I have 3 stairs into the house and it counts THAT as a flight of stairs. Syncing is an ongoing problem with Fitbit. No longer usable on Windows 7. Won't synch reliably with Android (Samsung Galaxy 5) or iPad Air 2. For the money buy something else.<br/><br/>4/18/2017 Update: Even worse than I thought. Still not accurate, but the most frustrating is the inability to sync without running through a checklist that includes force closing the App, disconnecting Bluetooth, uninstalling the App and a variety of other time consuming steps and half the time even that doesn't work. I spend more time fooling with this thing than using it. UNACCEPTABLE. Repeat DO NOT BUY.<br/><br/>4/24/207 Update 2: Won't sync at all without going through a whole list of steps every time I want to sync. JUNK. If I could give it negative stars I would.
 This review is intended for recent adopters of 21st centuries technology:<br/>Some of us stubbornly with older but still viable laptops  refused to upgrade to Windows 10 because we'd heard warning that from others that it would wreck our laptops. You can't set the Fitbit up with an older operating system unless you have a wireless dongle. Your Fitbit Charge 2 will not come with a Dongle.

Set up with using<br/>This is my first Fitbit. PROS:<br/> *It's been reminding me to move as I type this review. My reasons for purchasing it was because of the feature that monitors sleep but the reminders to move will either be helpful or provoke a "You're not the boss of me" response.<br/>*One criticism of Fitbits I've heard from earlier adopters was that they kept losing them. "I'm on my third one," one mourned. I don't have the find of disposable income to keep replacing things, This bit of info kept me from buying one for a long time. But the strap that came with this Fitbit is as sturdy as a watchstrap and it's not likely to fall off as easily as the ones my younger friends described.<br/>* The features are a big selling point: I look forward to using the features to reach fitness goals, get a better idea of my sleep patterns, and get healthier overall. Plus, it can multitask as a watch with the different wristbands you can purchase.<br/>* There are apps for Fitbit on a number of devices - in my case, my Kindles and my Android phone.<br/>  CONS: It's not as slender as a watch and is a bit heavier. If you're looking for a watch with "other features and have a thin wrist (as I do) , be aware of this before purchasing.<br/>My rating is based on this and the dongle issue. I ordered a replacement wristbands so I could feel upgrade the look of this for dressier occasions.<br/>this item.
 Love the Fitbit Charge 2.... Has just enough options for my everyday needs for tracking fitness, sync to IPhone easily, like the option of turning on/off notifications...  Have a apple watch, however I prefer the Fitbit Charge 2, I always have my phone so no need to have it on my wrist.  Sturdy, seems to be fairly accurate, battery life last for 5-7 days depending on settings.  Easy to charge, tons of band options, this is a must purchase!
 Fitbit is a valuable tool.  It monitors and records a number of important measurements - even graphs most of them - that I find very helpful.  Wearing a Fitbit is a personal decision - if used properly, Fitbit info can be of great assistance to improve health, fitness and quality of life.
 The heart beat tracking and steps tracking is reasonably accurate - and did most of us that is huge!<br/><br/>What I am frustrated with - I can’t change the amount of time the screen display stays on. Therefore the stop watch feature is pretty much useless to me.
 I really like the updates that the Charge 2 has from the original.  But when the alarm vibration feature is so soft I have to rely on my phone as an alarm clock thats a disappointment.
 The fitbit charge 2 is very comfortable and very user friendly, however the end item is not calibrated to correctly identify how many steps you truly walk a day. I called customer twice and performed a system reset and after all that my step counter is still very inaccurate.
 Product would not charge, asked for a return pickup on 2/28 and it has not been picked up yet.  No number to call for help.
 Under no circumstance should you buy this. The wrist band will be worn out within 6 months, and Fitbit won’t care.
 I would give this a solid 5 stars EXCEPT it scratches so easily!!! I don't even know how the scratches happened because I'm very careful. You MUST purchase screen protectors, which I find ridiculous. They should be included. If you already bought this and want to wear it without waiting to get a screen protector, do yourself a favor and put a piece of clear tape over the screen until your screen protectors arrive.
 OK, I spent the money now this thing is actually getting me off my backside and I'm walking more. The idea, for me, isn't to lose weight but if that happens I'll be thrilled. Nope, this gadget reminds me to get up and to move. And the good news is I am moving more than I use to move.
 Bought for myself as a birthday present, I had a Fitbit and I wanted the one that told me my heart rate and stuff, I love it. I wear it everyday, the only thing I'm a little upset about is that the battery dies really fast and the charger doesn't seem to charge it, I have to play with the charger to get it to charge.
 Frustrated that this product doesn't track my sleep or heart rate as indicated. I love Fitbits, I had the original Charge HR and loved it so I had to get the next one in line when it came out. Now it does everything like it's supposed to such as tracking my steps, how many stairs I climbed but it fails when it comes to tracking my heart rate or tracking my sleep. To be as systematic about this as possible I used my iPhone to detect changes in sleep and it would indicate that I would get 6-7 hours of sleep which is also consistent with the data from my studies at sleep centers by actual sleep scientists. My Fitbit tells me that I get one hour of sleep. It also can't seem to detect proper elevations in heart rate when I am working out and to double-check I will use my iPhone to see whether or not it can detect my elevated heart rate. And guess what? It can.... Just really disappointed that this product hasn't lived up to its claims.
 I purchased my Fitbit Charge 2 as a Christmas 2017 gift to myself. I wear it all the time taking it off for showers and for charging.  I use it to track daily steps/stairs.  Recently the screen developed a crack down the right side.  There was no impact to the screen.  At this time it is still working but I'm very disappointed that the screen didn't hold up.  I will wear it until it stops working.  I wouldn't purchase another because of this issue.
 Called support after my daughter used this for 2 months. Band buckle fell off but the pins are still there.  Googled it and it is a know issue. Calling their support is like pulling teeth.  Lots of silence as if they dropped off the call.  Constantly saying 'hello!' to see if they are still there.  Ridiculous for an American company.
 Love it, tells me my steps through the day. Also when to take a breather,sleep, and more. Great for motivation!
 I love this new and improved Charge HR. Still super comfortable to wear. It has so many settings and bells and whistles. I can't wait to use it more. I just wish the strap came in orange. Also, compared to the original Charge HR, the metal clasp feels a tiny bit more flimsy. Hopefully that won't be an issue.
 I like it! Keep fit and keep track of any workout! And the most interesting thing is to feed the 250 steps per hour in daily life, which is a good getaway from your work for office people who used to dwell before a laptop for a whole day! Btw, remember to charge it!
 Love the watch and the features. Something I just can't stop thinking of is the discomfort in my wrist when I wear it. I've tried wearing it tighter, then more loose but neither seem to solve. It feels like there's an actual current surging through my arm each time I wear it. Can feel it big time when it is synching right before bed- so much so that I end up taking it off every night. Once it's off wrist feels strained but slowly goes back to normal.<br/>Wish it didn't have this effect on me cause I love monitoring everything and it does give me motivation to work out more.
 I'm still figuring out the features of this tracker! You can read text messages and it alerts you when you have calls too. I added a new band that makes it look so much better and like a nice watch. The sleep tracking system let me know I had a mild case of sleep apnea! I've only had it a short time, but it's great!
 I loved my Fitbit!<br/>Two months using it and I couldn't wish for more!<br/><br/>It easily tracks all your steps and greatly counts all calories burnt!<br/>The smart exercise tracking, tracks if you start moving -ALMOST- immediately!<br/>The app is great and so is the sleeping tracking!
 Love my Fitbit 2. It helps motivate me to move and stay active. None of these devices can be totally accurate but they definable show you when you're slowing down or really doing an awesome job working out and walking your 10,000 or more steps. Like to review the sleep patterns too. Highly recommend this fun device to help a person push the envelope and stay motivated.
 This is so great, I don't know why I did not get this sooner.  I love that I can see if I need to be more active and even get a notice reminding me.  I also like that I get my text messages displayed and that I check to see if I feel unusually tired it it was due to a restless night's sleep or lack of time sleeping.
 Bought this in Dec. 2017, just stopped working in May 2018. Paid $150.00 and had a return window of one month. Now I know why...
 After 2 other sport band/watches this 3rd time is a charm.  It is a terrific watch.  We got two of the.  One for my husband and one for me.  We track our sleep along with everything else.  The app is great and we love the Fitbit Charge 2s.
 Works great!! Design is sleek and cool. Not bulky at all, yet provides a big enough screen. Love the text and call feature. I now always want to track my steps, which then make me walk more. Highly recommend!!
 Had for a few weeks now. I really like it. No issues! I like that I can link it to my phone with the Fitbit app. I like that it tracks my steps, heart rate, and sleep patterns. I like that it sends me reminders to be active!
 I bought this for my other half and he loves it!  I also own one in purple.  A great, easy to use, very helpful accessory to stay on track for a healthy way of living.  Highly recommend.  This item is not waterproof in that you can not wear it in the shower or a swimming pool.
 I haven't had it very long but so far is very comfortable and sometimes I forget I have it on.  This was purchased to replace the Fitbit Charge and I like it a lot more.  I especially like the breathing exercise it has as well as the reminder to move.  It's been very beneficial.  As I learn more about the applications, I am sure I will like it even more.  I just hope the band holds up better than the band on the regular Charge.  It appears to be a lot more sturdy.
 This is my 2nd HR, seems these are designed to break at roughly 1-1/2 yes of use.  I like the product, but disclaiming to keep them dry and clean is hilarious considering it's a device used to monitor fitness which is inherently a dirty activity.  I will continue to support FitBit products but more enhancements to durability and screen resolution would be nice.
 The HR2 is an amazing device.  It helps to motivate me to move more, drink more water, work out off 5 days each week, and tracks my yoga which was the most important to me!  You won't be sorry.  The plum purple is a lovely shade too.  It doesn't clash with anything and its even comfortable to sleep in.
 Heart rate is off by about 50 beats per minute.  It basically does everything EXCEPT Heart Rate Monitoring.
 ordered this unit &amp; an original one, both were defective (1st one could not hold a charge, the replacement unit arrived DOA. FitBit advised me I could return both to Amazon for refund (.....or the replacement one back to FitBit). Now FitBit will not refund me for the replacement. I realize this is not an Amazon issue; just a terrible overall customer experience.
 Love it! It's very cute and works great. I do think paying a bit more for this design was worth it for sure. It is something I use and look at everyday, and I believe that's worth the extra bit.
 This is just want I needed.  I had knee surgery a few months ago and I need to walk more now than ever.  This really help me get moving.  I love the reminders that it gives when I have been sitting to long and says "lets get moving".  It is worth my money.
 I like it, but my experience with any Fitbit is that it only lasts about 1.5 years.  Band wears out or stops tracking and syncing correctly.  I bought a 3 year warranty on this one.  I am happy with the tracking and don't want to have any interruptions or unexpected expenses any more.  Really wish I could wear it for water sports.
 I really do like this Fitbit but the main reason I bought it was for the sleep function. I wanted to learn more about the type of sleep im getting. I have tried to wear this several different ways, loose, tight, high on arm, different arm, but nothing helps. I always get the simple results instead of sleep stages. I'm thinking it may be defective and that I need to return it  for another style Fitbit. Anyone else haven't this problem?
 Just returned two of these. Both of them are ridiculously inaccurate.  When it tells you that you climbed 100 floors and got thousands of steps when barely moving - something's up. Their product support page is full of recommendations to "adjust sensitivity settings" - yeah, there are none. The only sensitivity setting is for sleep. Other comments say change the setting for which wrist (non-dominant).. if you have to trick the technology to get it to halfway work, it isn't worth it.  This isn't worth it.
 The Charge 2 provides the necessary information related to health conditions.  The stopwatch feature is great for timing walks/runs and it's great for timing what is being grilled.
 I bought my Charge 2 in Sept 2016 and it worked as promised until Dec 2017. I like the display better than the original charge. I track steps and sleep. I’m constantly amazed how it knows when I am sleeping (it even knows when I take a 30 min power nap). Now the battery will not hold a charge more than 2 days. I’m torn whether to buy another one. To me a year is not long enough for the money spent. I’m going to contact Fitbit and see what they say
 The watch doesn't always pick up your heart rate, so your exercise tracking is never accurate. Also my screen cracked when I dropped it. So now I basically have a shattered watch. For $150 I would expect technology that picks up my heart rate more accurate and offer less delicate hardware.
 Love this thing.  I worked out a lot before but this thing has pushed me to meet or exceed more goals than I ever dreamed of.  Plus, it's interesting to see how many steps I take on a daily basis.
 Love this fitbit. I haven't used one for year but got this for myself for christmas. It is always on me and I only charge it once every maybe 4 or 5 days. Charging is fast, I hook it up to my computer if I know ill be sitting around watching tv.
 This is my first fitness tracker. I love the fact that it is a visual reminder to get up and move as well as it vibrates on your wrist if you haven't gotten your steps in that hour. It cheers you along and allows you to have fun challenges with your friends or against yourself. Sleep tracker is nice too.  I don't like that sometimes I can walk and watch my step count not change. It also won't count my steps if I'm holding something with that arm or pushing a shopping cart.
 I bought this one to replace my Charge HR 1. My 1 was about a year and a half old and suddenly couldn't hold a charge more than a few hours.<br/><br/>The 2 has some big improvements. There's a much larger screen that shows more info at once. I don't have to click through as many times to see what I want. The heart rate monitor seems to be more accurate than the 1. My 1 had problems measuring my heart rate during vigorous exercise, which kind of defeated one of the main purposes. There are some times the 2 doesn't pick it up, but it seems to be less.<br/><br/>For new functionality, there's a relax breathing program that helps you take two minutes to calm down that's nice. It vibrates your wrist so you know when to inhale and exhale with your eyes closed. There's also a reminder to get 250 steps in the hour. It'll vibrate and say I need to take X number of steps in Y minutes. For me, I'm working on the bigger things for fitness like getting to the gym more often and picking up sports or hobbies, but I also need little extra nudges through the day to be less sedentary.<br/><br/>The screen is much bigger, which I think makes it look nicer, but also more room to get scratches. My old 1 got pretty beat up, since I would wear it everywhere except the shower or pool. I got a screen protector and it seems to be holding up nicely.
 An increasing number of times it is not only the product. The service behind makes a difference. Now, there were problems which could have been a dealbreaker (those wristbands), and they were fixed at such a professional level that I feel it is imperative to recommend fitbit.<br/>I will buy from them again because their staff is awesome, solving issues at midnight, in less than 15 minutes. This is a record for me. You can reach staff, they know what they are into and solve it, right away. Done. Three points, not covered by the rest of the field. New models worth supporting.
 My second fitbit, this one is even better with more onscreen info.  It motivates me to exercise, helps me track calories burned and consumed, water, exercise, heart rate, and sleep.  I like the sleep functions, as I was feeling tired all the time, and after getting Fitbit, realized I was losing several hours due to wakefulness. Now I strive for 6 - 7 hours and feel so much better.  I got my Fitbit on sale, but I think the cost is not high anyway, and well worth it.
 Definitely one of my most favorite buy! I have been a user of Fitbit products for a few years and was in the market for something other then just a step counter. The Charge 2 goes farther than just counting the steps, it automatically tracks exercises like basketball, biking, hiking, running, and my favorite, weights, workouts and interval workout, which is the reason I picked the Charge 2. I'd give it 5 stars if it was waterproof (it is water resistant) and if the data upload was immediate versus the 10-15 minute lag time.
 I LOVE Amy Fitbit HR 2, it’s really helped me get back into my fitness routine/lifestyle AND has helped track my sleep and I’ve been sleep training myself. I’ve been able to set real, attainable goals for myself. I LOVE doing the challenges with friends too, helps keep me motivated. You can do everything with Fitbit HR2 (sleep tracking, food intake, water intake, menstrual cycles, heart rate etc). I recommend this above all over fitbits. It’s also so easy to charge and only takes a few minutes to charge fully.
 Absolutely love this. Holds a long charge, durable, and love that I can easily change the band colors. Keeps me motivated and have already lost 10 pounds, just by staying active and challenging myself to increase my steps. I highly recommend.
 Easy to set up and comfortable to wear. The band changes easily, I immediately replaced the stock band with UMTELE Milanese Loop Stainless Steel Metal Bracelet Strap with Unique Magnet Lock. This band is easy to take on/off and because it is magnetic it is easily adjustable. Good combination.
 Really like the functionality. But the wrist strap broke after 6 months. Frustrating. It’s a sports unit so I expect better durability. Gonna shop around before going Fitbit for the replacement.  Have gym friends who report similar issues.<br/><br/>It’s litetally 15 mins later and I gotta give Fitbit a nod.  I called them and they’re sending a replacement. Helpful. Easy. Ok. I’m a fan again.
 counts my steps. Tells me my heartrate. it's a good fitbit. And it has a nice band that is less likely to allow the fitbit to fall off. Unlike the smaller version I had at first. Lost two of them Grrrrr.
 I use this mainly for the cardio function. I a slight arrhythmia and a couple of aneurisms.  With the charts I can keep track of my heart rate spikes at rest and while active and during rest periods (sleeping especially).  Not a replacement for a cardiologist, but a tool to help keep oneself healthy.
 Much nicer and many more features than older fitbits.  my only real gripe is that the heart rate monitor disconnects a lot.. expecially if you're jogging.. on the treadmill or just plain sweating a lot.
 This is a good idea however it keeps losing its sync with my smart phone. While searching the internet for a cure I find many other people with the same issues. That being said, the problem could rest with my smart phone. Who knows. Functionally it does what it says it will do.. Its a good way to motivate yourself.
 Wife loves it.  I have an Alta and wish I had the heart rate monitor since it grades your sleep.
 After I got over being pissed-off about having bought a very expensive but disposable Fitbit HR, I bought this Charge 2 to replace it, and I love it.  This is much better than the HR was (when it wasn't falling apart).
 Pros:<br/>I bought the Charge 2 because of the sleep monitor. However, I really enjoy some of the other features. Being able to take a quick look at a text, seeing my pulse, and counting my steps make the Charge 2 a great watch. I even use the "Relax" feature to help me settle in for the night.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Not waterproof.
 Just gave this to my mother for Mothers day. She is absolutely thrilled! Loves the Heart rate, activity monitor  features for her exercise class. Now we can swap info because we both will be wearing these!
 I love having this and keeping track of how much I walk. The only bad thing is it feels like it's so sensitive that I walk a few hundred steps when I am walking in my car.
 I bought this for my wife as she destroyed her first one in the Ocean while vacationing in Cancun. She had the original fitbit. Now she loves this one. She is a runner so she constantly is showing me her time, heartrate etc. She is happy so I am happy. I would definitely recommend.
 The Fitbit charge 2 is a good device. My wife has one and it works great. She loves it. However do not order from amazon. The first one we received was not even the right Fitbit. Someone must have ordered a Fitbit 2, taken it and then put their old Fitbit in the box.<br/>Amazon sent a replacement overnight but when we received it, it was obviously in used condition. Missing parts and Fitbit showed some wear.
 I loved my Fitbit flex and since I wanted to have more features, I decided to upgrade. It’s very handy for finding out your heart rate, and tracking your steps.  I greatly appreciate having the ability to sync to my phone so I can see who is calling and read texts on the Fitbit. However, I have had one disappointing. In the few months that I’ve had my Charge 2, the wrist band has already cracked and broken and now I can’t wear it because the band no longer works. My flex lasted way longer!
 I went in half with the Fitbit for a coworker of mine because she wanted to track her fitness journey. She loves it!! She even convinced other coworkers to buy one. Fitbit was my first fitness tracker and I highly recommend it to everyone.
 Love my Fitbit!!  Love the features especially the sleep cycle because I don't sleep well - but I was shocked when I found out just how much I don't sleep and my restlessness!  Like the challenges - it's a keeper!
 This watch is superior to the last fit-bit watch my husband owned.  The watch part is much easier to read and he likes the heart-rate part of it.
 My wife loves it.  Wears it all the time.  It motivates her to keep walking and has kept her involved in several fitness challenges.  The Charge 2 HR is just the right size and it doubles as a watch as it shows the time as well as the other information like steps, heart rate, etc.
 I have used this for several months now and enjoy having my texts and calls sent to my Fitbit.  I have an LG Stylo - which is sadly not compatible with the Fitbit - but fortunately it does work most of the time with alerting me of a text or call.  This was my main reason for getting the Fitbit.
 I'm so glad I got this fit bit. I had the old school one where you had to log into your phone to see your steps. This one is great! It's fun to do challenges with friends and this keeps me motivated.
 This device offers some good features. However the heart rate feature performs poorly during an actual activity. Very sporadic detection. Seems to do fine while resting. Also the auto activity feature seems to confuse activities easily. Records a walk as an elliptical session for example. Also poor on an outdoor bike ride. Holds a charge good and seems to track sleep well. If I had to do it again I would probably opt for the model with out the heart rate feature. The heart rate tracking is a disappointment. I am back to my Garmin with a heart rate strap for cardio activities.
 Very disappointed in this product. Many false steps were recorded while I was driving a vehicle. If all I do is walk, the error is within 10%. However, other actions made it less accurate. I was informed I could adjust the results but why spend all that time correcting an action that should be correct from the beginning. Also climbing steps was extremely inaccurate as well. It with record steps when I did not make them, and when I would climbing steps, it would not recipes them. I returned this product since it was so inaccurate. Needs a lot of improvements.
 I am so obsessed with this little tracker!  I compete with my friends for steps and it gives me such a motivation to get out and start walking and going to gym.  I am so happy with this purchase.
 Love this thing so far. I've only had this thing a few days &amp; have learn alot about myself. It syncs with other apps too.  Its eary in my fitness journey so, we'll see if I still loke it over time.  I bought a new crazy band for it too, as you can see  in the picture.
 I bought this a gift and the User can not stop raving about the features, function and fashion.  My friend needed to keep track of the exercise level for health and fitness reasons.  But one of the key things was sleep pattern.  Fitbit does all this and does it well.  It was on sale for a price, that couldn't be refused.
 This is an excellent upgrade to the older charge. It is easier to read, more accessible and much prettier. I highly recommend the rose gold. Also, the band is more durable where the older charge was easily cracked!
 Gave it to my brother for Christmas.  Exactly what he wanted and exactly like my own that I really like.
 Its fine. But they fall apart quick. Not waterproof. Strange bluetooth connectivity..<br/><br/>The Band comes apart from the actual device. Looks gross.<br/><br/>They catch on every shirt you put on... even rips them sometimes. So take care.. lol
 I love my new Fitbit!  It’s the 2nd one I’ve owned and it’s easy to use and keeps me motivated to get to the gym or walk more. Perfect!
 I have had mine for less than a week (Tues-Sun) and am returning it. I've had to charge it four times so far, the tap feature is spotty to see the watch/other functions and the watch rarely pops up when I turn my wrist - I even tried a more dramatic approach with no improvement. I'm very disappointed, the reviews I read had me stoked
 Only counts steps half of the time. Competely unreliable. The Ulta HR actually works. Don’t waste your money.
 I think my favorite part is the Relax guided breathing feature.  Great just before bed. Worth the money:  great stats.  I also like the sleep quality reports.  I obsess on those far more than getting the step goal fireworks.
 I have been using this for a while now and I am pleased with this product.  I love that it reminds me to get up every hour to walk.  I have a desk job and it is important to take a break; I can set the goals of what is most important to me and it has been accurate so far.  The only problem I have is the sleep function I find that it is not that accurate but I can get a picture of how much I am restless during my sleeping.
 Really motivates me to stay active. I use it monitoring workout and my food consumption. The apps is really great to have. I used Fitbit old version before. The watch is a great add on. I have hard time to see the time with flip my wrist though,have to press the button to activate the time screen. Also awaiting more workout choices on the menu list. Strongly recommend it!
 I love my Fitbit!  It’s helping me get moving again; monitors my pulse; my steps; my sleeping; gives me challenges to choose from; wakes me up; so much more.  Plus the warranty was so much cheaper on Amazon than on Fitbit website!
 Cool watch. It is the perfect size for my little wrist and I love getting the text alerts on it. It's fun to connect with other fitbit users on the app and compete with how many steps you get each day. It has helped me get in shape for sure after having a baby.
 Only had it for 3 days. Did not measure my steps correctly, even after I troubleshot it according to FitBit's website and FAQ. I tested it by walking and counting my steps. It stopped being accurate. Would not recommend.
 I love tracking my sleep and my steps.  I like getting replacement bands on Amazon so it's like having multiple watches!
 This is my first Fitbit and I am in love. The app has great capabilities like keeping track of sleep, nutrition and other goals you can personalize. I used to refer to my health app on my iPhone for set and count, there is a huge disparity in the number of steps between the two. I am going to look into the accuracy of the counters.
 It would be better if it were waterproof and if it didn't die before it's a year old. I love it except for the dying part oh and the part that it starts holding a charge for shorter and shorter periods of time. It would also be great if it came with like 2 or 3 bands so u have options straight away w/o another expense.
 LOVE this Fitbit! I'm so glad I purchased it. I feel so weird now if I take it off. My favorite part about this watch, is that you can track your sleep as well as how you slept. It does so much more... step tracker, exercise fracker, alarm, test notofications, etc. Great buy!
 I've had other Fitbits but I love this newest one!  I can change the band when I need to be dressed up, or just to switch things up.<br/><br/>I've put a screen protector on it to ensure I don't scratch the face, which is something I wish I could have done with my Charge HR.  But the improvements are great!!
 Like: sleek low profile design that is simple and neutral. The app gave valuable data about heart rate, elevation change and sleep pattern.<br/>Dislike: None! =)
 Quite the upgrade from my original fitness monitor I received as a gift a few years ago.  Easy to use and record exercises.  The silent alarm works great as well so as not to wake up your significant other when you have different wake-up times.  Also, a huge fan of the weekly progress reports that show improvements or areas that are not improving.  I will definitely purchase another when the time comes.
 I love the Fitbit Charge2! Excellent product. I do like some of the other replacement bands better though. (the softer rubber kind are more comfortable and less stiff) The app is excellent as well. The only problem I have is sometimes the app keeps telling me to connect to Bluetooth, when my phone is already connected to the Charge2. (I usually turn Bluetooth off and on several times, and about the 3rd time the app recognizes it).
 So much better than the previous Charge HR it replaced. Much longer battery life. A straight forward clip on charger connection that will last. Looks like It won't have the flimsy band problem we had with the first model. Very pleased so far after a month of use.
 Received a refurbished Fitbit that would not charge. Fitbit support tracked the serial number. Disappointed that this is an Amazon Choice.
 This is terrific. I wish it was a little more sophisticated (it can't tell if I'm racking up steps on the treadmill, but it does seem to count steps on the elliptical). It's really good at tracking sleep and real minutes of exercise.
 The Fitbit Charge 2 HR has been most helpful in my weight loss journey in keeping me on track and accountable with water intake and exercise. Love the features of an alarm, notifying me of incoming calls and messages. Love it!
 Same problem as the regular Fitbit,  intermittent charge contact-  very  frustrating.  Calling Customer service 877 623 4997, as I write this 13 min. of my time.  Final resolution is George said they will replace my Fitbit Charge 2. Stated I will get it around 8 days... To be continued...
 I bought this to track my fitness and help me lose weight. I can't say that I have lost weight but I can say that it's a great watch and an amazing tracker. The weight loss part comes down to you and your internal motivation, a device on your arm will not make you lose weight.
 this was a Christmas present for my boyfriend.  I wasn't sure how well he would like it at first.  but he has been wearing it everyday. there is an app to download so you can go into more detail with this.  it keeps track of how many steps you've taken, your heartrate and even sleep.  he really likes it.
 PROS: The face on this is great. Nice and large. The extra details below the clock is nice to see without having to scroll through to see steps<br/>CONS: VIBRATION intensity is weak to extreme faint. When working out, do not feel it. When using it as a morning alarm, not sure if I feel it. It is way to faint to rely on it. I hit my goal walking and it doesn't buzz (at least I dont feel it). I do see the fireworks letting me know but WHO looks at the watch all the time... Increase intensity and length of vibration!!!!
 I replaced a recent charge hr with this upgrade as a Christmas gift to me. I wore it and the prior purchase for a week and found them comparable in the heart rate and the steps. The upgrades are worth the switch. Being able to switch out the band is fantastic. The charger is easy-peasy in comparison to the charge.
 It’s a gift for my mom who is NOT techy at all... but all her girlfriends all had one and being able to track your steps was astounding to her so it was a great gift for her after all.
 I bought this as a gift for my husband who wanted to upgrade from the simple Fitbit One. He loves it. I have the Fitbit Charge HR, which is the prior model. This one has a larger screen and can show more information eliminating the need to scroll through screens by tapping. It arrived in two days.
 Had a fit bit for four years and loved it until it broke then my daughters bought a charger 2 and they loved it and this is why I bought one! So far it’s great! Even the alarm is more quiet!
 ordered the small for my wife. still pretty large and bulky on her wrist.  That being said the new features of this fitbit make up for a lot of that.  she really likes that it tracks sleep and sleep quality (deep, light and REM).
 This was the best gift idea I ever had for my wife. She have been using it for over a year now She really use it and keep tracking of everything she can on it. Plus, the fact that the bands are very easy to replace, she just change the bands to combine with her dress.
 I had the "One" model for a few years and really like it. I got this one for a gift and it's pretty good. I like the features and the fact that I don't have to turn sleep monitoring on/off manually. My only complaint is that it does not accurately count stairs. For every 10 flights of stairs, the device counts about 7 or 8, but never all 10. Other than that, it's a good device.
 The heart monitor and step counter stop functioning randomly. It has become progressively worse over the few months I’ve had the Fitbit. Approximately 6- 20 times a day that I notice. Probably double that or more that I don’t notice. Fitbit says this can happen during exercise and to adjust the location on your arm. However it happens any time for no apparent reason. I’m sick to death of monkeying with it. I doubt the overall accuracy especially with all the nonfunctional time.
 Bought this for my husband who hates wearing watches but a) his Fitbit One was dying and b) he wanted a good heart rate monitor.<br/>The original unit shipped to us was defective; it died after 3 hours of use and couldn't be charged.Fitbit was extremely helpful and shipped out a replacement. That one worked great.<br/>The device has good battery life and works well. Lots of helpful features and my husband has gotten used to wearing it. Transitioning from using the Fitbit One to this was simple on the technology front, too. Just updated the Fitbit account with the new device and everything just worked.
 I don't know yet if this product is good since it was defective right  out of the box.  There is no documentation on how to set it up.  I had to go to the website to set it up and some of the documentation was wrong.  Tech support very poor.  Had to chat twice with tech support.  First person I chatted with gave me incorrect information.  Second tech support person had me clean the charging contacts and a brand new device.  Finally Fitbit decided to send me a replacement.  First impressions are poor product quality, poor documentation, and substandard tech support.
 I used to have a Jawbone Up4 but the band broke on it and they don't allow you to just replace the band like a FitBit does. So my husband bought me the Charge 2 for an early Christmas present and so far I love it. There are dozens more features on a Fitbit than a Jawbone. It syncs quickly and I like being able to see where my step count is at on the band rather than having to open the app to check every time.
 Was purchased a gift for my husband. He had a hard time keeping his fitness and food on track. So glad I got this for him. Showed him how he was severely under-eating, hence always having head aches. Love it.
 Love it!!  Best purchase this year!!!  Battery lasts 3-4 days,  keeps me moving.  Wore it at the waterpark and still work fine.  No price on health.
 I bought this for my wife for Christmas. It replaces her original fitbit. She wanted this to upgrade to be able to monitor her heartbeat. She really likes it. Her only problem is syncing it  with her phone, but the problem is her phone, not the fitbit. Evidently the fitbit cannot sync with a windows based phone.
 Too many bugs. Gave me a marathon badge one day. I am in my sixties and spent most of that day on the couch. Counts way too many steps. Counts floors that do not exist. Battery lasts three days, not a week.
 Been great. Love the software. Annoyed that I can't sync my watch without phone internet though. It's especially annoying because I use it out backpacking for long periods of time.
 A Christmas gift my daughter really likes. One night she was at a club and I had to text her several times for directions. She didn't miss a single text since the Fitbit Charge2 notifies you of texts. Otherwise her phone was buried in her pocketbook and she never would have received my messages.
 Only thing keeping this from 5 stars is that my monitor occasionally has difficulties capturing my heartbeat over 120bpm. Everything else works amazingly and after 2 months wearing it I am very pleased with my product
 I love my Fitbit. I love this model too. Had it for two months now and works amazing. I love everything about it. Just had to order smaller bands, which is a good thing.
 I had the charge hr for about a year until it finally started to fall apart. I upgraded to the charge 2 and holy cow the improvement is amazing. I love being able to use the GPS tracker on my runs, have text and call notifications on my wrist, and this gives a way more accurate heart rating than the hr ever did. Very glad I upgraded!
 I bought it primarily for the heart monitor and it seems to be accurate.(have worn it to my doctors and usually within a beat or two) as for the rest of the features I don't  bother much with them. But it does do a good job with time and date.
 This fitbit is the BEST accesorie for your everyday life. You can enter the amount of water that you drink, it tracks your sleep, you can also add food to know how many calories are you eating and so much more things!! I absolutely recomended this!
 Love it!! It is so much better than the original Charge HR! It feels much Iighter and it looks great on! The Charge HR 2 also feels like it is made with better quality materials! I highly recommend that you upgrade to the Charge HR 2! You won't regret it!
 So cool &amp; Loving it! Couldn’t be happier! Amazing little “watch”!
 Great gadget for your exercise/walking program. I hardly use my regular watch anymore.
 erratic, unreliable heart rate monitor.  Finally found manual (which is does not ship with) and did get some improvement by placement, however it would not reliably, consistently read my heart rate over time.  So that calls into question how any of the other data can be relied upon.
 This is my favorite Fitbit to date!  It tracks my steps, stairs, and gives my heart rate too.One of the fun things it does that I didn't know about until I got it is the Relax function.  It walks you through 2 minutes of relaxation breathing techniques to calm you down.  Wow!  It is great to use at work.
 I debated between this one and the slimmer version but it really came down to the screen, I wanted to be able to just tap it and see what time it is just like I use to do with my charge HR and with this one I can do that. oh but just FYI to future buyers, my wrist is a LARGE for my charge HR so I got the same size for this one and I have to clip it on the last hole, it is much bigger than the HR.
 I ware it all the time.<br/>Only needs to be charged about every 5 days.<br/>The best part is the online challenges.  I regularly compete with others.<br/>My normal steps (on a warm day) is 15,000 to 23,000.
 First time buying anything like this but got it to track my heart rate, workouts etc.... I'm really starting to like it very much and like the fact you can change bands on it.... it has a lot of features and I'm sure I will use most of them. Good product and enjoying my purchase from Fitbit!!!!!!!!
 Received my Charge 2 last night and do not regret buying it at all. Not uncomfortable to wear but definitely doesn't feel as nice as the Apple Watch Sport band. It does feel cheap compared to the Apple Watch but not cheap enough to wear it will break easily. It is easy to turn off alarms and cycle through the different modes with the side button on it which is a plus. If you are looking for a product that is cheaper than a smart watch and keeps track of what you are doing, I would recommend this 100%. The app is also fantastic (reminds me of my old UP bands app).
 It works fine except when driving. I would consistently pick up 2500 steps each way on my way too and from work.
 App keeps getting dropped and is a pain in the neck to set up again.  Recording of stairs and steps taken are not really accurate.  Finally reached a point of frustration with the app and just returned the fitbit.  Continually having to adjust, re-download, set it all up again is just more trouble than it's worth.
 Thought the face/display would be too long for my wrist but it's OK. Strap is mire flexible than "original" Charge HR. Deducted a star becaise instructs could have been simpler.<br/>I think you can just exercise and not tap or set anything.<br/>Tracks treadmill steps "better" than original and counts walking backwards!<br/><br/>Picture on my small wrist (5" around under the Fitbit)<br/>Thanks Amazon for great post-Black Friday/Cyber Monday pricing!
 Just awesome, you can change the bands if there is an issue or just want to change the colors and no issues with it at all.  Much better than the other's I had.
 This model is perfect. Combined with the app, which was very easy to sync &amp; set up, I can easily check activity, meals and hydration. The app has a great calorie "in vs out" chart that I use to make eating choices throughout the day.  The weekly dashboard is an awesome compilation of my weekly data too.<br/>Fits true to size on the band. I prefer loose fitting things on my wrist so I got a large. In hindsight a small would've been better to get more accurate heart rate monitoring during exercise. Love the heart rate function but if you're looking to accurately track your heart rate, a chest strap model is a little more consistently accurate. I use it to trend activity which works fine for me.
 This is a great update from the charge hr!!!!! The screen can show all stats with time and date which is a great plus for me. Also... no pushing a button to view the screen. Just turn your wrist!!!! I am loving it so far!
 Got it for my hudsband and he absolutely LOVES it! Its light weight and provides him with everything he needs to keep on track with his fitness.
 I have used my Fitbit about 2 months now. I wear it 24/7 and track steps and sleep. It reads my text messages and buses to tell me my cell phone is ringing.
 I don't see good info about the fix on the band replacement. "Once one falls off all future straps will fall off"
 Worked perfectly for the first few days but now it occasionally has issues sensing heartbeat and maintaining heartbeat and the floor sensing is variable.<br/>Overall a good piece that provides a lot of useful information.
 I have a desk job which requires me to move my hands alot. Everytime I pick up a piece of paper or use my ten key my fitbit is counting steps. I wish there was some way around this. I eventually tied it to my ankle for a more accurate reading while I'm at work.
 I like the sleep monitoring displays on the app.  I wish it would update faster to display the sleep stages.  Its hard to read in the daylight but I wear it everyday.
 Much better than previous model. I wear it all the time.  Software to sync the unit works fine.<br/><br/>It would be nice if the user could modify the readings that occur on the screen, but every reading is available on the I pad.
 I have been wearing it religiously. It works well. I find that I sleep longer...maybe because I want to reach my target number of hours. Recommended
 Computer programmers' wakeup call. This gets me out of my seat and gets me moving. I actually accomplish more because my mind is refreshed and no deep vein thrombosis from sitting too long. For me, this is a life saver.
 Bought this for my husband for Christmas.  He loves it and has used it non-stop.  Great way to motivate an inactive person into getting up and moving.  Great item.  Now I am going to order a leather band for it.  The plastic band is the only thing he doesn't like about this Fitbit. Also, great price at Amazon.
 This is my 4th Fitbit. I started with (and still have the original Flex). Then, I upgraded to the one that was recalled, I really liked that one. Then, I got the Surge. It is HUGE on my tiny wrist. I wound up giving that one to my daughter this fall. I received this for Christmas... I really like it. Very easy and intuitive to use... love it! Looks great when I wear it!
 Not as nice as I expected.  Paid so much more for the limited edition, honestly not worth the extra money.  It is adequate, works as expected however I still thought it would be more accurate.  Still searching for the perfect fitness tracker.
 I miss the size of my Fitbit HR that died but this is a solid second. I purchased the large, as my wrists are big. Easy to use and set up with my phone. Has all the items I need such as time, steps, and stopwatch. Will sync to your phone and even receive notifications.
 Do not spend the extra money on a Fitbit product. Buy another brand. Fitbit's customer service is bas. I have had this less than a month and noticed some scratches on it that unless angle just right you don't notice them. Talked to customer service today and was told it wasn't covered. I baby this thing because of the price and it is worthless.  They said if I wanted to buy another one they would give me a discount.  What a joke
 Very good product and easy to utilize health info in conjunction with my cell phone. Wish there was a way to adjust sensitivity lower so that when I turn my wrist the clock and data would show more easily. Find myself pushing button to get clock and data to appear. Overall good product though!
 Always wanted one and I'm happy with the purchase.  Although I find that sometimes it doesn't always get my steps right it does most of the time so I'm happy.  Love the workout tracking functionality.  Love the teal color
 Purchased it for my mom for Mother’s Day. She loves it and the aqua color was exactly what she hoped for. I ordered the Fitbit last Thursday and she received it Saturday the day before Mother’s Day. Thank you amazon for prime membership that guaranteed shipping date was on point.
 I love fitbit. This only gets four stars because sometimes the notifications automatically shut off, which make that feature difficult to rely on.
 Just what I needed to get me started on my way back to a routine fitness regimen! I love the size of the watch perfect for ladies who don't have small wrist too. The mobile app works perfectly with the watch and keeps me in the loop on my current stats while encouraging me to get moving !
 Awesome- really helps keep me motivated to get my steps in.  A really neat feature i love that i didn't know it had before I bought it was that you can look up food from all sorts of restaurants and grocery stores... similar to the weight watchers app and with it calculating how many calories you are burning a day, it calculates how much you are in-taking as well. Overall very happy with my purchase! - plus, the pink is super cute on the edges ;)
 I bought this one for my girlfriend. We each have a Fitbit Charge 2 and we both love them. Awesome tool to keep you on the move, set goals, track sleep, etc. I can't live without mine now!
 The Charge 2 does well as a fitness tracker but if you are choosing it b/c you also want notifications from your phone it is pretty frustrating. I get calendar notifications but not texts. I have tried to troubleshoot but no luck. It says you may get interference from other bluetooth devices, but I need those connections as well. I don't want to unpair other bluetooth devices like my car so that I can receive text messages on my Charge 2. I may return it for one of the other trackers with less bells and whistles. I do like the sleep tracker and the heart rate monitor. It is pretty versatile as far as tracking activities.
 Love the new design of this Fitbit. I specifically bought it for the heart rate tracker and everyday steps. My only flaw for me personally is the longer screen size, kinda makes my tiny wrist feel constrained.
 I love the new display, and the ability to switch out bands BUT...the accuracy is completely off. I switched to the charge 2 from the original because it broke. I have yet to hit my steps even though I always would with my original. I'm very active, especially at work and it's completely off. I tried messing with the settings and nothing seems to work.
 Works as expected and always have mine on my arm.  It tracks by arm movement which isn't always the greatest but you can adjust your goals according to your wishes.
 Much better than the first generation Charge whose band broke leaving me with a watch that couldn't be fixed. This version of the Charge is attractive, has great features and WOW! I can replace the band!!  The features seem to be reliable. I really love mine!
 Love, love, love my Fitbit. I'm one of the weird ones who still wears a watch everyday. So having a watch, heart rate monitor &amp; fitness tracker that looks good all in one is great. I'm not 100% sure how accurate it is because one night in my sleep I kept waking up &amp; looking at my watch for the time, well it started counting my steps in my sleep. I suppose I was tossing and turning too much?!?! I also have a long stride (tall) &amp; I walk fast, but I noticed at some points it wouldn't count my steps while walking &amp; other times when I came to a stop it continues counting. Maybe it was just playing catch up. Overall I absolutely love it....Especially when I actually remember to set it for my workouts
 This is better than the regular Charge HR. The display is actually usable and I like all the new features, like mapping walks and runs. The heart rate is extremely accurate, I would say much improved form the Charge HR. I can't live with out it.
 This is a very good and reasonably priced fitness tracker. The band, screen and button are far superior to the fitbit HR I used to own. Fitbit has updated data regarding sleep and heart rate beats per minute and improved the app.
 I had an UP previous to this. That AP kept track of your food as well. It breaks down your carbs, protein, fiber, sugars and fats. Fitbit makes you pair with a separate AP. Then if you want any details you have to pay a monthly fee. The UP also has interesting articles, and ways to keep you motivated. I wish I could push them together, then it would be perfect.
 good quality, but sleep sensor is not accurate, and can't wearing gloves of most kinds, like boxing, UFC type trying. but it counts steps well, and is also a watch.
 I like how useful this device is for fitness and it's interesting to see your stats all day (especially sleep, for me) but the biggest problem is my wrist rotate function doesn't work so I have to push the button or double tap the screen to see the time. That makes it frustrating.
 I absolutely LOVE my Charge 2!  It does everything I need it to do and more.  I bought it as an upgrade from the Flex, which was great, but I like knowing the time and I wanted to keep track of my heart rate.  I also like the ability to track my sleep.
 I'm addicted to my fitbit charge 2!  it's small enough that I don't feel like it's too bulky and wear it all the time (except in the shower).  The band is pretty comfortable and it provides nice motivators.  Very intuitive and easy to use.  Great to see summary on my app on a regular basis
 July 29, 2017<br/>I'm upgrading this review to a 4 star, since my earlier issues have been resolved.  The tracker syncs with my phone immediately most of the time, and with a slight delay occasionally.  I enjoy my tracker.<br/><br/>Earlier Review<br/>I was so happy to get this.  Loved the screen, the heart rate monitor, and all the things I could do with it.  I had a flex before, but this one gave me more information.  Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be all that accurate.  It doesn't give me credit for all my steps, the floors are often inaccurate, after just a few weeks it no longer shows me the time when I twist my wrist.  I'm also having difficulty getting it to sync with my phone (it did it fine at first, but is now having difficulty).  I've tried restarting both the tracker and the phone, etc. but it hasn't helped much.  It will sync with my computer, but it's a pain to have to do it that way.  The phone is more convenient.  I would have given a stellar review on day 1, but these difficulties showed up after just a few weeks (less than a month).  Disappointing.
 As usual fitbit is good.  Good quality, good strap.  If straps from other vendors could be bought that has holes in them or the steel straps, then it won't leave mark on the wrist.<br/>It is good. Battery life is more than 4 days for now.  Good good.
 Absolutely loved the aesthetics of this fitbit. Loved the features &amp; functions. However, I realized I needed more of a smart watch and this fitbit was more limited to fitness. Definitely a great fitness tracker but if you want functionality beyond fitness, you'll get bored quickly with this.
 I love this product because I am able to track my fitness where ever I go. I have recently managed my exercise with my heart rate. And, for the days I don't work out I am able to see that I am still productive and I reach my steps usually.
 Wear it every day.  More charging necessary than the Fitbit but it works.  I don't track my sleep as accurately as I did with the Fitbit either and I had to replace the band but got a better one in the deal.
 What can I say it's Fitbit. It does what you'd expect from Fitbit. And one of those is being way over priced. You can buy way better exercise bands from Amazon and for a lot less money, but if the wife is pocket then fork out the cash buddy, cuz your. Using a fitbit
 I bought this model for my wife on her birthday. It has plenty of features but it is not durable, it stopped working after a year. She only used it for long walks not even intense workout.
 I had to replaced a old Fitbit charge that fell apart after 18 months.  The band is a great improvement and the ability for the fitbit to track exercise such as walking is a nice feature
 We bought this on Jan17th and on Feb 20 it stopped working. We called the manufacture and they said they are having trouble with the Fit Bits that are coming from Amazon. It is being investigated. They are sending a replacement.
 Great device! I like it a lot and the program/app it goes with. It really allows me to keep track of things. The ONLY improvement I could think of is to make it water resistant. I've had water resistant watches all of my life and now I panic every time I wash my hands without remembering to remove the FitBit first.
 Arrived quickly and looks great. Have already bough several other bands to change on it to match my outfit of the day. Band is a little stiff but gets soft and more flexible as you wear it. Was a little confusing how to set up the notification for text on the band, my phone, and fitbit app but not brain surgery
 I had an Alta and when it died I upgraded to the Charge 2. It's great. Definite improvement over the Alta. The only thing better about the Alta is it's design. I wish the Charge 2 was just a little bit narrower.
 I just got my tracker today and really like it. The lavender rose gold is better is person. My only complaint about this watch is the vibration for the alarm is very soft and it's hard to feel if your not focused. Hopefully that will be fixed during the next update. There is no fix for it now per support at Fitbit.
 3 weeks in and I like the quality.  Heart rate seems to be quite accurate.  Fitbit app is good too.  The display is bright and easy to read.  It's a keeper.  I only wish it was waterproof.  Then it would be perfect.
 The lavender color is very pretty. For being a first time fitbit owner I simply love it. Keeps me going with the notifications.  The app is fun to use.<br/>Would recommend.
 I'm writing this review two weeks after I got it. Let me tell you that this is the best money I have spent! It keeps you accountable gives you challenges and it does so much more then I could even imagine! I can't imagine living without it now
 Love it.  No complaints.  Great Product.  Screen (face) large enough for me to read without my glasses on.  I love the reminders and encouraging messages.  I was so surprised when my incoming text messages and phone calls showed up on my Fitbit, I did not even know it had this feature!
 I did a lot of research on which Fitbit was going to be right for me. I decided to go with the Charge 2 for the updated Heart Rate monitoring and workout features with GPS. The price was decent and I love it so much I probably would've paid more for it. The goals are flexible and easy to achieve. I like the reminders to move. It's helped me get more sleep, log my food and water, and exercise more. Definitely glad I have it.
 loved it worked perfectly how is was supposed to. i enjoyed having it. but it's been 8 months and it has stopped working.<br/><br/>first the screen stopped lighting up and now it won't pick up steps or charge. bad.
 I love my Fitbit!!! I am a mom of 3. I'm just trying to learn how to eat right and the right amount of exercise for me. This is such a fun, easy way to keep track of everything. One of my surprise favorite features is the text/call alert because I never know where my phone is.
 I had been using an app on my phone to track steps. The fitbit is much better, I wear it all day so I get a more accurate count of my steps. and paying $99.95 on Black friday didn't hurt either.
 Very usable. Gives good information. Does everyone it says it will. It is a bit bulky on the wrist (height) but I'm sure to be expected. The band gets a bit sweaty.
 I love this Fitbit! It has everything I was looking for. I don't have a good conditioned heart so the continuous heart monitor is great to look back on at the end of the day and see what time it started beating faster and think about what I was doing at that time. I also needed something I could see my texts and calls. I cannot have my phone out at work so I can see if it is an emergency text or call. The sleep tracker was also something I wanted and it works great! It keeps its charge about 3 full days when fully charged.
 Only had it less then a day and I love it. Pulse monitor is right on the money compared to my certified BP monitor and finger monitor.  Really enjoy the relaxing exercise. Had a Chinese knock off that was junk.
 Bought this for my husband and he loves it. Has everything he wants and he loves the 'watch' type clasp on it instead of the traditional clasp. He feels this is a lot more secure with the activities he does and doesn't have to worry about it falling off his wrist.
 This is the best fit tracker i have owned.  Dont waste your money on cheaper products.  This is the Cadillac of trackers
 I love my fitbit.  I didn't like the band, so I bought the stainless steel mesh band to go with it.  Works well, and helps me track everything from calories, and steps, to my sleeping habits, or lack there of. lol
 My fiancé has the previous version and after joining a 6 week challenge group I decided to order this one. I love it. Only things I don't like are software issues and not anything that has to do with the product itself. Senses heart rate well and stays charged for days. Wonderful product.
 Charge 2 was great for a while and had everything I wanted, but the HR feature died two weeks ago and all the resetting in the world won't bring it back. I would be more angry, but it also didn't keep good pace.  It kept jumping forward by a half to a third of a mile on walks.  It's only 9 months old. Very disappointed that it didn't last a year.
 I bought this in March, and the face cracked a couple of months after that.  Now in December the band separated and broke.  This is the 3rd fitbit I have had and none of them have lasted a year.
 I like that the Fitbit has a vibration that lets me know when it’s time to walk every hour. I like that it vibrates to let me know when I have made my goal. What I don’t like is I don’t get that same vibration when the battery is going dead! And, yes, I did sign up for an email, but, I don’t even get that.
 Loving my new Fitbit charger 2!! Synced it with my iPhone 6S .... love getting text message and phone call notifications.  Also love being able to see everything with a glance at my tracker.  Use it to remind me to take my pills during the day. Feel so organized and motivated to get back into shape!!
 Great fitness tracker.  Like the fact that you can change the band's fast and easy.  Links to your phone to let you track you calories in versus calories out. Great tool to help in weight loss.
 An improvement over my original Fitbit Charge, both in features and construction. Battery lasts about a week before needing recharged.
 Fits my wrist perfectly! Plenty of different to adjust the size as needed. Can withstand a decent amount of pressure on the screen which is nice. The heart rate monitor seems to get inaccurate though if it gets too much sweat between the sensor and your wrist. Sometimes at work on really hot days it will just display "--" for the heart rate which doesn't tell me anything. Could be that it's not tight enough though. Either way, great product! Would recommend.
 I decided to return this after about two weeks. I was disappointed in the heart rate monitor as it was unreliable and inaccurate at most times. If you’re more interested in the steps and sleeping, then this product should be good for you. But I have to find another heart rate device that can accurately read my heart rate during intense cardio work outs.
 I love this Fitbit. Don't have to worry about batteries and it gives me the time and information about how much I'm using. Price was nice, too.
 This was a present for my husband and he loves it! He wears it almost every day with no real issues.  He does find that it doesn't fit under dress shirt cuffs well but, he just puts it slightly higher on his wrist and it doesn't seem to be a issue.
 I don't get too excited about too many things enough to write a review, but this product is fantastic! Gets me motivated to track my daily food/water consumption, make sure I'm walking often and enough, and to make sure I am consistently working out. So many cool features! I only wish I had bought it earlier!
 I love all the features this model offers. It motivates me to push harder and I love watching my progress on the Fitbit app. 100% happy with my purchase.
 Bought it because I thought it’d be a great addition to my workout routine but it’s stops tracking heartbeat when you’re sweating. And that the time when you really need it. Bought it couple months ago and didn’t realize it until now. It’s great for running but absolutely useless for hiit workout.
 I love it!  I'm a life-long couch potato and now I sometimes do 10.000 steps a day.  Somehow having that daily, weekly, etc. record encourages you to keep going.  It's like getting a gold star in elementary school.  The support staff is very helpful.  Was not put on hold once.
 I really like this item and was really happy to get it, used it for 2 days and developed a skin rash on my wrist were the band was. Very Disappointed have to return item and have to pay shipping don't think that is fair, Just wanted to warn people with sensitive skin might night not be the best thing to use
 If I could give it a NO star that is what it would be.  Received all the packaging and no fitbit.
 My husband likes this Fitbit so much because it is easy to use and doesn't have to be charged as often as his previous Fitbit HR.  He likes to set remind alarms to get certain activities completed.
 Love my new fitbit,awesome to keep track of your fitness
 After a month of wearing it's really pretty useless. Do the same thing with a 2 dollar pedometer, Heart rate monitor is totally off. I ran 20 minutes on treadmill heart rate 101?
 Screen cracked within 3 months of purchase. Have heard this can be a problem, will be talking with Fitbit to see if they are willing to do anything about it
 I would have given it 5 stars, however I do not like that your GPS must be on for it to work properly. That is not the case with Apple or Samsung watches. Other than that, the Fitbit works as advertised.
 I love my Fitbit Charge 2.  Wear it 24x7.  The HR monitor is top notch!  I had both the Charge and the Charge HR of the previous generation, but was disappointed in the quality on the strap.  They have addressed that and much more with this version.  I just bought another one for my wife!
 I really liked this watch when I first got it a month ago. However, now the watch is barely keeping a charge.  And when I go to charge it it’s only charging 1/2 way. 😞
 Absolutely LOVE my Fitbit Charge 2!  Only wish it was more activated to touch (touch screen), but for everything else I love it so far.  Only had it a month, but so far, it is what I wanted.  I ordered more fashionable bands for it, which I like better than the basic black band.
 Comfortable to wear and works very well. The app works well. I like the food tracker and the sleep tracker. The calorie burned functions seems a bit suspect to me though. I use it to track my runs and it uploads to Strava with no issues. Battery lasts a week. Overall very pleased.
 Love it! Very motivational! I feel like it tracks everything accurately. May not be perfect but I'm ok with it being really close and for me this is working just like I need and want it to. Love the color and that I can change bands! Needs to be waterproof not just splash proof.
 I want to start off by saying that I’ve never used anything like this before. I like that it keeps track of steps although sometimes it’s not so accurate (counts steps while on a bumpy car ride) but for the most part it’s fantastic. Really keeps me motivated to hit my daily goal which I set to 20k. It has great features like stopwatch and relax. Paired with the app it’s fantastic for keeping active and hitting your fitness goals.
 Bought it for my wife's birthday. Third Fitbit she has owned. First one wore out, second quit working. She seems to like it. Battery could last longer but okay. Have to change rating. This band also broke and sooner than any of the previous ones. Not sure I recommend.
 I like my Charge 2 but.... I have a horrible mark from wearing it.  Anyone else?
 Didn't work out to the box.  My fitbit didn't connect to my iPhone after many tries and running down the list of troubleshooting options.  After two calls to customer service, who were very helpful, I'm returning my device for a new one.  I'll update my review once I receive the new one.....
 So far, I am very satisfied with this product.  I do miss my old ONE but it seems there is something new on the horizon.  I use it daily.  Quite good marker and wonderful support (not for this product, I shall add).
 Doesn't count steps super accurately. Reminders are a bit off ("let's go", and "get active" when already active and doing things).
 This product turned out to be a huge disappointment.  I bought it for its Heart rate monitor to use during my interval training.  The heart rate monitoring of this is not accurate to use for fitness tracking purpose.  There is at least 5 to 12 beats per minute discrepancy, which makes it worthless for interval training.
 Ive been a fit bit use for close to 9 months now. You can use this for a variety of goals such as weight loss, weight maintenance or just for fun !<br/>There are countless reviews and literature on these things and they really do work. I guided myself with its assistance into a 20 lb weight gain over a course of 4 months.<br/><br/>My only quarrel with the product is:<br/>1) The plastic face seems to be a little fragile, so if youre like me and will wear this while doing anything (like working on your car) you will get the face scratched up and it will stay that way. A solution would be to purchase a screen protector like <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Fitbit-Charge-2-Screen-Protector-2-Pack-Full-Coverage-ArmorSuit-MilitaryShield-w-Lifetime-Replacements-Anti-Bubble-Ultra-HD-Screen-Protector-For-Fitbit-Charge-2/dp/B01LWEBX78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Fitbit Charge 2 Screen Protector  2 Pack]  Full Coverage] ArmorSuit MilitaryShield w/ Lifetime Replacements, Anti-Bubble Ultra HD Screen Protector For Fitbit Charge 2</a><br/>or anything similar to that<br/>2) As far as the interaction with the fitbit via tapping on it or viewing time/stats by twisting your wrist can be spotty so patience is key here not to get frustrated at it.<br/><br/>Other than that, great product.
 My husband loves his! While it tells him his pulse, steps, time, and everything else it describes, it’s extremely nice that you can connect it to your phone so you know when you receive a text or phone call.
 Works like a charm, clockwork, .. activity tracker. The best one I had so far. Just get a screen protector. Battery life is questionable, certainly works for 3-4 days (with my constant checking on heart rate), but charges fast too.
 I love my Fitbit Charge HR 2. I only take it off to shower and charge it. It tracks pretty darn accurately, and it is super comfortable, even to sleep with it on. I had an Alta first, and I am so glad that I exchanged it for this.<br/><br/>My only critiques:<br/>-My band has started to bubble. I doubt it will last another month. So if you're a serious user, be prepared for a six month lifespan on the band.<br/>-The software is very good. The only issue is that when you log your food, it doesn't show macros. This would be a useful addition.<br/>UPDATE: App now shows macros in a percentage breakdown. If you are tracking more closely, this is not super useful (see photo).  I still have to manually calculate my net carbs and such for Keto.<br/>-It is super accurate (way more accurate than the Alta), but it does sometimes struggle with mileage on the treadmill. It will occasionally be off by 1/10-1/4 of a mile over a distance of 3-4 miles. So not terrible.<br/>-To log your run outside, you have to give Fitbit app access to your location always, or switch it on every time you want to log a run. The option of letting it track your location only when using the app isn't good enough for it apparently. A minor annoyance.<br/>-Tracking a walk is difficult when I'm pushing the stroller. I could track it as a run with GPS, but this would negatively affect its assessment of my health since I'm not actually running. They should have a walk option for logging exercise with GPS - this way it would be able to more accurately track my steps when my hand is on the stroller and not swinging. As it is, you can log it as a walk then later categorize it on the app. Again, a minor annoyance.<br/>-Stairs!!!! I do the stairclimber at the gym several times a week, but since the Fitbit uses an altimeter from my understanding, it won't count those floors for you. They should write some kind of code to make it give you credit for those floors when you log an exercise on the stairclimber.
 Just wanted to say that I woke up one morning with a racing heartbeat - technically Tachycardia - of 149.  Ended going to the ER and was held overnight for observation.  Fitbit Charge 2  heart rate was always within one beat of what the hospital equipment was showing.
 I love this gadget! I work out daily, but the fitbit has really made me pay more attention to how sedentary I can be throughout the rest of my day!  My  only problem is that it doesn't always register my active minutes, but other than that the product is exactly what I expected!
 The only thing it does accurately is keep time. Heart rate monitor is worthless, exercise time was way off the mark, steps are not recognized consistently. Save your money. Use a chest strap.
 I love my new Fitbit! I upgraded from the Charge HR, and this is a huge upgrade. I was getting bored of my old Fitbit at one point, and now it's just like when I got my other Fitbit for the first time! The fact that the bands are interchangeable are even better!!
 I had worn a previous version for over two years and upgraded to this one because I could make a setting that would get me up and walking. I can't imagine being without a fitbit.
 Awesome little watch! Wear mine almost 24/7. I got very into using the calorie tracker and sleep tracker. Really handy and it gets tons of information for just being a tiny little watch!
 I have been a fan of Fitbit for a few years now. Customer service has always been awesome and responsive. For the most part, this is pretty accurate for steps. Not sure the HR is completely accurate but it's does show increases and decreases.
 Still getting use to the features. My husband likes the email notifications as I don’t always catch on my cell when it’s in my pocketbook. I like the steps and heart rate just wish it gave day of week.
 I love the Fitbit, but this is the SECOND ONE THAT THE BAND BROKE.  My first Fitbit ("Charge HR") band broke right at a year. I replaced it immediately with the "Charge 2". Its band broke right at a year also. I am now using the second band that came with it, although I do not like the color (plum), and none of my friends at the gym will trade bands with me :(
 me and my boyfriend both got charge 2's. after looking at comparison of all of the fitbits this one is probably the best. it has the most features. its lightweight, battery last about a week at a time for me. i would just recommend getting a screen protector because i do notice myself bumping it around sometimes
 It's beautiful! I love my special adition fitbit. Love the purple with rose gold colors. Works great, I've never had a fitbit and I love it!
 Good for counting steps, but the heart rate monitor is a complete joke. It simply doesn’t work.
 I'm disappointed in the Fitbit Charge 2. I started back at the gym and wanted to get the steps from the Arc Trainer and Elliptical. My band didn't pick up either. It did pick up my 2 1/2 hours drive!!
 Purchased this for Christmas for my mom. She's a teacher and chases kids around all day. She loves it! Lots of fitness tracking options. Very comfortable and stylish. I'd definitely recommend.
 Heart rate seems pretty accurate for me and even if it's not I know what my "normal" RHR is via this tracker and can track when it's higher/lower. Great reassurance if your heart seems to speed up, etc. Steps are accurately tracked, stair levels not so much. Color is nice clean.
 Very happy with my purchase. Haven't had any issues some of the reviews prior had posted. Ordered a small and it was fine, a large would just give you more of a band. I am having a lot of fun with this, step counts are very accurate as well as my pulse. It's interesting tracking my sleep and am getting alot of tracking calories as well. A plus and fun side it links with your FB friends and can challenge each other to earn badges. Definitely recommend.
 There are not activity trackers without huge numbers of detractors, so I spun the wheel and got the Charge 2. I've been very happy so far. The sleep analysis is right on target. The only problems are the ones I knew about, the display being impossible to read in the Colorado sun and the font being tiny (to my middle aged eyes) and hard to read. When there's a model that fixes those issues, I'll upgrade.
 This has helped make me accountable to get out and walk! It keeps track of my sleeping also. It does a lot of other things that I have not tapped into yet. The only problem I have is it doesn't turn on when I rotate my wrist toward me like it says it does.
 I love my Fitbit! I can monitor my sleep as well as my 8000 steps a day goal. The design is simple yet classy, and I like just how easy it is to charge and use. I hope someday, they could include a BP monitor as one of the features. Eitherway, I am very pleased with my purchase.
 Innacurate. It measure steps while driving, while seated at work,  while seated during flights. and even during walkings it counts more steps than I really did. Heart rate does works sometimes, but in some periods it just got lost and keeps measuring rates much higher. And configuration for dominant hand and wrist side being used is correct, so the company reccomendation to fix innacuracy on step counting just not fix the problem.
 Wife liked it but it tends to over count steps. We desensitized it in the settings and it works a bit better but not as accurate as my Garmin vivoactive HR. On known walking distances.
 I'm so addicted to my Fitbit Charge 2! I hate to take it off to charge it. If you want to bring awareness to living a healthy lifestyle, wearing the Fitbit Charge 2 will help you achieve your fitness goals all the while having Fun doing it! I only wish you could swim and take a shower with it on.
 Find terrible to use...HR is grossly incorrect...I use old Polar with chest sensor for true readings and my iPhone is more accurate for steps. This product is a joke for serious exercisers, difficult to use and very inaccurate.
 On huge drawback - cannot set it to not illuminate at night (at least as far as we could find.) So, if you wear it to bed, you could wake up to a blinding LED readout in the middle of the night.
 Works in general, but the connection between the device and bracelet is poorly made and contains small plastic detail. It just broke suddenly after couple of months of use.
 Works great, this was for my wife for xmas and she loved it... There are additional  bands you can buy in many diff colors that are very easy to change out.
 I love the functionality of the Fitbit Charge 2, however it actually hurt my wrist and I am returning. If you like watches you may be ok, however I found this to be quite large.  The screen is easy to read and seems very sturdy. It pushed down on my wrist and hit by wrist bone in an odd place that was painful (even after reading how to wear it).
 Both my kids are happy with this watch.  They had no issues syncing the watch with their Samsung phones (unlike my husband and his Gear Fit 2).<br/>The only problem is that my daughter experienced tingling in her arm.  This seemed to have resolved itself.<br/>My son is a software engineer and gamer and does a lot of sitting.  He was home for the Holidays and I saw him actually get up and do some walking and stairs in response to the reminder.  Success!
 This is my 2nd Fitbit, the first one was the Fitbit Charge HR. I love this Charge HR2 with bright display and the ability to show notifications like text messages. .. I'm just hoping that it would last because the 1st one that I had only lasted 1year and it doesn't sync anymore....
 I purchased the Charge 2HR back in November. I have been using it daily and wearing it nearly 24/7. It still retains a great battery life and I generally only need to recharge it every 4 days. I haven't had any issues with damage, be it to the screen or band, and it still works as great as it did out of the box.<br/><br/> It accurately tracks both my steps and heart beat. It has a very intuitive interface. I highly recommend purchasing it.
 I only had this product for a month when it died on me. I'm upset that I spent so much money on a product for it to last barely a month.
 Has helped me get back to exercising. Interfaces well with my other devices. There are a number of apps that work well with the<br/>Fitbit. I did not like the band that came with it but there are hundreds of replacement bands available and it is easy to switch bands.
 This thing is awesome! Does everything a Fitbit should do with a perfect sized display! Track sleep patterns, steps, app is fun! Go on adventures around the world, challenge buddies, pair with other apps for weight loss and fitness.
 Liking this Fitbit more than my previous Charge.  Hoping it is more durable and seems to be so far.  The additional sleep data is very helpful.
 I love using this.  It makes it so simple and it really has encouraged me to get up and walk.  I like being reminded if I haven't done my steps for that hour.  Using the app you can do challenges and see pictures of places like Yosemite.
 LED screen died at 14 months. Because it was not warranted anymore, I was only offered a 25% discount on a new watch
 This fitbit is great.  I like that it's more waterproof than the previous one, and the screen is much bigger.  I also like the breath exercise thing.  All-in-all, I think it's a great purchase.  I upgraded to this from a Fitbit Charge HR gen 1.  Highly recommended.
 Love this thing.  I recently started running and have been using my phone to track my time/distance. This is so much easier to use and I love that it tracks me sleep and daily activity.<br/>I had some trouble pairing it for phone notifications but I just re-paired it and it worked fine.
 Bought the fit bit charge 2 for my husband and now he is always getting his steps in.<br/>Great talking device,  still some cons but for the most part, well worth what you pay for the charge 2.
 I had the Alta before the charge 2, and I overall enjoy the charge 2 more. I like being able to access more information from the band instead of having to go to the app, and I like being able to easily set it to whatever workout type I'm doing. Great motivator! The only downside of it is the heart rate monitor (which is cool to have), it's a little uncomfortable at first since it doesn't sit flat against your skin. I got used to it though and don't really notice it anymore.
 Love this fitbit. The metal bands make it more like jewelry than the rubber. Perfect for counting steps, workout, burning calories. The app is great. Input your food, water, and excersise.
 The battery does seem to wear down fast and sometimes it's hard to get the face to turn on so I can see the time.  I do wish there was an option for military time as I'm an LE and that's what we use.
 It's just a regular fitbit but I love that it is a little fancier looking. I work at a church and this is great because I can dress it up or dress it down. Definitely a great find.
 Great fitness tracker but you can't wear it durting fitness. The face scratches easily and can't find a solution without replacing the entire unit. Didn't find the screen protector until after scratches occurred. Its unreasonable to not have a repair solution for a month old unit.<br/>Will be looking into other devices for sure when I can't read the screen any longer.
 Had the Flex for my first. this one measures my sleep like I wanted and much more. Easy to use screens found it easier to tap the wrist band than the unit itself to change screen. Works with my desktop with donger from Flex. All in all very good product.
 Gets me to move my ass!  Gives me incentive ! I’m partially paralyzed very hard for me to walk but it keeps me motivated  Plus it registers my heartbeat
 My husband bought us Fitbits for Christmas.  We get a kick out of looking at how well we sleep at night. lol It's a little on the big side but not too big that I feel uncomfortable wearing it.
 Heart rate within ~30%.<br/><br/>Turns on/off randomly but doesn't always turn on when holding up to look.<br/><br/>Counts typing as walking.<br/><br/>Bluetooth pairing works fine.<br/><br/>Charges fairly fast and battery life is a few days (when new).
 I love the sleep tracking and silent alarm features! My partner and I are on very different schedules so it’s nice not having to wake him up hours earlier than he needs to. It’s not as comfortable as I would like; a bit clunky and boxy. My wrists are pretty small and boney so maybe that’s why it doesn’t feel comfortable. I will often take it off during the day and just use it for the silent alarm.
 Love my Fitbit.  It helps me track my calorie intake and out.  I love that it tells me how many calories I burn during work outs.  It’s comfortable to wear and works great.
 I love my new Fitbit. I had the original for about 2 years and the band started to break...you can't replace the band in the original one! I'm happy to see they changed the design and I'll be able to replace the band on this one.
 Love it.  Worth the upgrade from the Fit Bit Charge HR.  Looks nicer and the display is easier to read.  Recommend the bayite Replacement Metal Bands for Fitbit Charge 2, Rose Gold Style C to go along with it.  Really turns it into a nice looking watch, rather than a typical fitness tracker.
 I have been using a stationary bike with a heartstrings monitor to stay in a certain range, and during this I have been trying to record my work with my Fitbit. I have only had 1 workout out of the last 7 so far to accurately pinpoint my heart rate through the whole thing. Otherwise, the watch is either around 60bpm or not monitoring during my workout when I check.  I am hoping this is just a singular product issue, and I have make an exchange because I really like the rest of the features.<br/><br/>Other than the previous mentioned issue, notifications seem to work well and battery life is good. Charging is pretty quick. Syncing is pretty easy. I just keep my phone on mute anymore and let my wrist do everything. Even my morning alarm.<br/><br/>Another thing is that my girlfriend has a Garmin activity tracker with the GPS built in, she claims she's getting less distance despite being smaller than me. I'm not sure if the accuracy of the pedometer is off from a settings standpoint on either device.
 My husband loves it (I have a more feminine model), and it has lived up to its promise of motivating him to keep moving.  I did find that Costco offered it for the same price but included a spare band.  Oh, well!  Shame on me for not checking there first...
 This Charge 2 version doesn't actually link to mapmywalk which is my favorite app since I can walk out in the country and it will provide a satelite image of where/how far I walked.  And even using the mapmyrun app (which is the only under armour app that works with fit bit - it still only pulls in the 'steps'.  Using this Fitbit model still requires your phone to be on your person for GPS to work.  I was really hoping to get rid of my phone on my fitness walks and strictly use this device.  The one thing that works really well is the heart monitor.  I now just consider this a heart and sleep monitor device as that is primarily what I use it for.  I prefer seeing miles walked rather than steps so that isn't a feature I will use and the 'relax' feature is pretty cool but I find that I don't really use it (even though I probably should).  It's also still really bulky and can be uncomfortable when I wear it for long periods of time - like all day at work then at night for the sleep monitoring.  I do really like the charger though - I don't have to take off the straps to charge - it's very easy to clip on the charger which I do every morning while getting ready for the day.
 Does not come with a dongle and not effective with Windows 7.  I have to reset my watch every week or 2 because it stops syncing.
 Very disappointed in 3 phase sleep monitor.  No where does Fitbit say one needs to sleep 3 hours before this enhanced feature can be displayed.  It's important to know sleep stages in early hours.  If I sleep 2.5 hours it only shows sleep or awake.  All the pitch of enhanced sleep measues needs to disclose this upfront.  One is getting performance of original Fitbit Flex but at a higher price.  Misleading claims by Fitbit.
 LOVE IT!!!!! it's soooo awesome and it has helped me with everything. The only thing I didn't like about it was it isn't waterproof. Though it is water resistant. I also love the app. You can log all your activity and it will sync your Fitbit with Bluetooth. You can change anything on it, from goals to clock faces. So far I haven't had ANY problems, and the battery life is super long it will last for about three days!
 Great features! I had the Charge HR which broke after about a year of use. Fitbit sent me a new one at no cost, but that one stopped charging for no reason. I was really considering switching to a different product all together since I was frustrated by having two fitbits break on me, but I am so glad I got another one.<br/><br/>This watch has a stopwatch (which I was needing on my original Charge HR) and many other useful features. I was wanting to get an Apple Watch but I am pretty content with this!!
 Great product. The battery lasts a long time and it does what it says it does. The band is also more comfortable then most watches out there. The accuracy of the device is decent, but it could use some improvement.
 Great piece of technology. Unfortunately the screen cracked within 3 months. I bought my parents one each and they had the same problem. If you get one, just be gentle with it. Probably not the best for sports.
 I purchased the Fitbit Charge 2 in January of 2017.  By April, the band started to come apart, in May the screen mysteriously had two cracks.  I've seen both of these symptoms on every charge 2 I've see with any use.  I stopped wearing because it just didn't look good in July.  Went to Disneyland in November and thought, what a great idea to pull this out and track my steps.  Half way through day two, the fitbit stopped working.  Overall, the features are nice, but durability makes this device worthless.
 Didnt have this a whole six months before started having battery problems. Not even a year and it no longer works. Worst purchase ever!
 Compact with lots of features. Sync with kindle fire gives so many more goodies. Wish it was water resistant. It's like having a personal trainer. It makes me more aware of my habits or lack thereof.
 Love this Fitbt!  My daughter gave me her old one, I guess it was the original that came out, and it finally quit.  I needed one that was larger so I could read the numbers and this one works for me!
 The Fitbit arrived on time, well packaged. The large band fit perfectly (I measured my wrist and decided on large according to the directions) - It's easy to charge using the charge clip - I read online to plug it into the USB port of my computer - as opposed to using a USB charger that I could plug into a wall - so that is what I do. It charges quickly, within 2 hours - and the charge lasts quiet a while. I charge mine every 5 days or so. I had to "reset" it several times the first few days to get it to continue to track my steps - but that did the trick. I now find that If I reset it each time I charge it - it keeps tracking my activity just fine. To be safe, I reset it quickly before I begin an activity I really want to make sure it's tracking. Updating to my first review - after using it for about a month, I'm finally learning all the features. The weekly exercise tracking feature was the hardest to understand. It might help others if they realize that "active minutes" that will appear in the app (after you've reached the set amount of minutes you choose when you set it up) but these are NOT really related to the "weekly exercises" that the Charge 2 will automatically detect and "credit" to you - the confusing part is that it *sometimes* does detect some activity and show in the 'weekly' activity area - it drove me mad trying to figure out exactly what Is as doing to get the Weekly Exercise to detect. Then I went on my first walk - it immediately detected this "different" activity and counted it as fulfilling one of my weekly exercises. As long as I do one of the activities under that area - it will detect it and show up as a day that I met my goal. Just consider it a coincidence if it somehow appears to detect an exercise if your "active minutes" area also triggers the weekly exercise detetion.
 My husband got me the Fitbit in March and I’ve loved it! But for no apparent reason the notifications for phone calls stopped working a few months ago and now the alarms notifications stopped working just this week! Very disappointed :(
 My son purchased this with his own money.  He really likes the watch, but the band is already broken and my son is NOT hard on his stuff.  Kind of disappointed in the quality as far as the band goes.
 Duh, love it
 Great idea if it worked properly. The big issue is that it does not count your steps accurately which is the main reason I purchased it. If you strap it on and go for a walk or run the steps are reasonably accurate. However, when working a desk (writing this review as an example) it will rack up steps from the movement of your arms. Yes I have adjusted the dominate arm setting essentially lied to the device in an attempt make it less sensitive.
 Item new.  As described.  I purchased this on as a back up because I really like the one I already have.
 Awesome gadget, it helps me keep track of my steps, heart rate, water intake, and much more. I highly recommend this product if you are considering definitely buy it.
 Love my Fitbit; I didn’t want all the bells and whistles this does exactly what I need it to no more no less
 My wife was very happy to get this for Christmas! It does even more than what she expected. It has phone call and text message notifications on the screen. Allows you to switch between jogging, exercising, walking, etc to accurately keep your steps to meet your goal(s).
 I was hesitant to get this as I was on my fifth charge HR in fifteen months but so far this is proving to be a far superior product.  No matter what I did with previous bands I got bubbles and spent a fair amount of time supergluing the band back together.  The band is fully removable now so that shouldn't be an issue
 So glad I upgraded from my charge to the Charge HR 2! It's much easier to read and I can't wait to change the bands when they arrive. Seems to be pretty accurate on the heart rate might be slightly off.
 I wore my charge he out. I had to get a new one so I got the charge 2.  I really like it.  It still gives me information on steps, fluid intake, and sleep habits but with updated info.
 I work as a nurse on a cardiac unit and needles to say, I am a bit obsessed with being heart healthy. I have compared the heart rate tracker with the vitals cart at work and also me counting my own heart rate, it's pretty accurate. If you're in the health care field, this is easy to sanitize.<br/><br/>The app that is available with it is also useful for helping to get the right amount of calories, water, sleep, steps, etc. It's easy to use, navigate, and has links to further your education about your heart function and living a healthier lifestyle.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this product. I have had mine for a few months now and I love it.
 Sizing according to the size chart is wrong. Once I got the right size, it was perfect. The battery doesn't last as long as I thought...and I can't determine if it's what is draining my phone battery or not. Excellent wristband for keeping on track!
 Attractive but too many features that aren’t needed or useful. Buy the additional bands offered by other sellers.
 I got a pretty good idea of the time I spent sleeping and my heart rate. I do keep track of my steps every day as well. The weekly summaries are great! Using the Charge 2 motivates me to workout, keep lowering my resting heart rate and sleep better. Not sure how accurate all this is.
 I use this everyday!  The feature that allows it to connect to your phone so you can read your messages or see who is calling you without looking at your phone is a great bonus.  I’m very impressed!
 Display cracked after about a month, frequently had trouble syncing it. Charger is difficult to connect. Stopped working entirely after about 3 months.
 The fitbit itself is great, but the band is not great. The rubbery band is hard to buckle and unbuckle, and it tends to rotate outward on my wrist. When I turn my arm toward me to read it (it is supposed to turn on when you rotate your wrist), it does not turn on.
 Great design, fits great, only issue is that these devices are very prone to incorrectly counting steps. I've noticed I can pick up as many as 30 steps in an hour of just sitting on my couch and occasionally reaching for my phone/drink/remote.
 Very happy with the Charge 2 and really like the notifications function. The heartrate monitor can provide some extreme readings if at all off wrist positioning, but directionally it's a great tool to monitor work outs. My biggest wish is that it was waterproof, as I like the smaller size if the Charge 2 vs waterproof models.
 I really like the fitbit and it has been fun having challenges with my spouse and daughter.  It has helped my get up and walk more.  The bigger face is easy to read.
 So far so good. It is a bit heavy on my wrist, but I am small, 5'2". I've gotten used to it and feel odd without it on. Works as advertised and the synched data is amazing to track. Helps me with my fitness and dietary goals.
 We have had a Fitbit before this previous order.  It meets our expectations except the one drawback we found is it only was good for a little over a year before the plastic style band starts breaking and pulling away from the watch portion.  If this happens again we will look into another device for ourselves.
 While I like the technology for this product it frequently just shuts off and loses not only the time but my steps.  I would give it 5 stars if it did that but this is no better then any other pedometer I have purchased in the past.
 Bought this for my wife and she loves it. It was bought to replace her Charge HR. She says it has more features and she loves the reminders it gives. She said it's "a slave driver". The only thing that bugs her is that it doesn't show when the battery is getting low. There's nothing worse (according to her) than having the battery depleted when you are on the way to the gym!
 DAUGHTER loves this and uses it everyday for the past 7 months
 I've only had this for a few days but I can already tell it is a definite upgrade from the Charge HR. The screen while small is clean and crisp. The tracking seems to work a lot better and the customization is great. Plus this one is a LOT easier to change the band on than the last. I ordered a small wrist charge 2 because I am blind to reality and it was too small. I went ahead and ordered the large band and it just snaps right on. Really great product.
 Got it 20 minutes ago and back in the box it goes.  Pixel 2 isn't supported???? What a bunch of crap!  Way to go Fitbit.  Your device doesn't work with one of the most popular Android phones on the market.
 I previously had the Fitbit Alta which I really liked, however, I lost it!  I went to the Amazon site to purchase a new one.  I found that the Fitbit Charge HR was on sale for $10 less than the Alta.  The Charge HR does so much more than the Alta.  In addition, it is a larger.
 I’m so happy I bought this. I never buy things for myself but am happy I got this one. All the added features are worth it and help keep me on track of goals.
 Battery isn’t holding a charge for more than a day and band cracked already. Less than 8 months old.
 Love this. Works great . stays charged 5 full days and very accurate. A little pricy but worth it better than buying it in a store
 Works very well especially when combined with my iPhone. It certainly is a good motivator and the metrics viewable from the phone app are very good. I even see that my sleep is restless some nights and the total hours can easily be tracked.  It's fun and meaningful data.
 This new Fitbit Charge 2 stopped synching properly within 5 days of receiving the product.  Received on May 5th, stopped synching properly on May 10th.  Every time I try to synch it never seems to completely find the tracker even though I show connected on my WP 10 Mobile phone.  It hasn't rack any of my sleeping since I received it nor my active minutes as did my previous Charge HR.  Have tried resetting the Fitbit, re-installing the software, installing it as a new device all to no avail. I will be contacting Fitbit to try and troubleshoot or send me a replacement. Not at all happy with the product at this time.
 Liking my Fitbit, wish it counted stairs better. Also be great if it were water proof. I had a different one few years ago, they did a recall so I sent mine back for refund. This one is much better, the band is secured better. It was hard to get used to at first but now its fine.
 I bought this for my husband's birthday - he's not really a "trendy gadget" man, but he is loving it! He walks a lot with our dog and also works out in the mornings. He has been amazed at how many steps he gets in everyday. Additionally, he likes to track his sleep and how many sets of stairs he does.
 Lost of money I have been experiencing horrible accuracy when running on treadmill with my charge 2!! compared to my polar i will go back to my polar watch A360
 vibrate feature does not work, emailed fitbit they say it is well known and there are lots of post on the forums.  They will not warranty direct because it was bought from amazon...
 Love my fitbit but anxiously awaiting for them one day to get a fully water proof one and one that takes a battery that I don't have to recharge.  Otherwise I love it.
 I got this as a gift and my boyfriend loved it. We can't figure out how to get text messages to get from his phone to his Fitbit, but he loves it and wears it all the time!
 I've had my fitbit for a month now. I really like it. It is a little tough to change out the band but once you get use to it then it comes more easily. I suggest keeping a penny or dime around to help depress the latch. Once the latch is closed it stays locked. That's one of the best features for me. I don't have to worry about the band slipping off my hand. The band looks very exquisite in the lavendar. Its a neutral soft color that blends well with clothing colors that you're wearing. The operational part of the fitbit is good. The only downfall is it counts driving in a vehicle as steps so if you drive alot the fitbit may not give you an accurate reading of your steps.
 I love my Fitbit and all the different features. It has become a part of my everyday life, especially now as I have begin training as a half marathon. I love comparing my steps and distance with my friends and families.
 Exactly as advertised. Would buy these bands again. Fit great and basically the same as the original except he locking knob isn’t as tight but it’s not a big deal
 I love it! Being a male I Was worried it would look too small on my wrist but it's about the size of a rectangle men's watch. I've not had a single issue with it and the HR is awesome. Even my female doctor has it.
 I have a fitbit blaze and I love it and the magnetic bands that are optional.  I bought my husband the charge 2 and the magnetic band and he loves it.  The charge 2 is water resistant and more durable than most counters.
 I love this Fitbit!  New to using one but it is highly motivating to move more and sleep better/more regular hours.
 Bought it for the wife.  She loved it.  Word of advice is to NOT spend the extra money on the rose gold wristband.<br/>The wife got on Amazon and bought a bunch of other wristbands for cheap and uses them more than the rose gold that I'd have thought she'd love.
 I purchased this for myself for Christmas last year. Now April 2 it is not working. I have tried charging the Fitbit Charge 2 twice but it does not turn on. I have also tried my wife's charger but it still does not work. Up to this point it worked well and had no problems. My wife received hers for Christmas when I got mine and hers is working fine.
 This is a great way to monitor your activity - and seems to do what all fitbits offer. The app is a great bonus and easily syncs. It stays charged for nearly a week. And I love the added features - like vibrating when my phone rings and changing bands.
 Best gift ever, my wife see how many steps you've taken exercise she's doing is also a Watch great for the person who is going back to the gym getting back into that fitness click plus it was a Mother's Day gift and she thoroughly enjoys
 I haven't taken it off since I received it! I wear it to sleep and it tracks my sleep patterns!  I absolutely love this Fitbit. I just wish I had ordered the screen protector at the same time because I bumped a wall and put a few scratches on the face.
 This is the second one I bought for my mother-in-law. She used the other one up and hope that she will do the same to this one. She loves it and has attributed it to her over 40lbs of weight loss and not having to take her Diabetes meds any longer. It is a great motivation tool for her.
 I love it.  I've never had anything like this before.  I'm not one to exercise and this is tell me how much i DON'T do.  It has given me incentive to get more active.
 Fits my small wrists great! Band is a fun color and does not rub or move during my workouts. Looks sporty and still fun with plum. I'm still learning all the features of the Charge 2, but love it so far! App works great on my android device and I get lots of info! Love the challenges available too! Completely happy with this purchase!
 Bought this Fitbit for my Son and he really loves how it keeps track of all of his daily schedule of work, exercise and sleep.  He never seems to take it off.
 My wife loves her Fitbit Charge 2. It works just as expected and she wears it in the shower and in the pool as it has s water resistant. The color is perfect for her with the rose gold finishes.
 I bought Fitbit in December and have been religiously wearing it and was really happy with the features it offered me. I was recently dissapointed when the connection between the wrist band and dial broke. It does not look irreparable. This bad quality has really dissapointed me. I had bought Fitbit for all my family members but now I am a dissapointed customer.
 This fitbit was wonderful for a while. The special color of the band was beautiful for about a week, then it was in a constant state of dingy, no matter how often I cleaned it. After about 4 months, it was nearly impossible to get it to sync with my phone, and then towards the end of last year, the clips on the band broke. So now, I cannot even wear it on my wrist. I am just going to upgrade to a smart watch at this point instead of replacing the bands.
 The Charge 2 HR has worked as expected.  The wrist band keeps breaking.  I bought a new band and it just broke on the second side.  I  J-B welded (epoxy glue) the first break and now the other side.  The bands are the weak link and aggravating enough to me that this is my last Fitbit.
 I've been using my Fitbit Charge 2 for a couple days and I love it. It's nice to see that I am more active than I actually thought. It has even encouraged some friends to get one so we can do challenges. We'll all get in better shape and stay in touch even while thousands of miles separate us!<br/><br/>The sleep analysis is so fascinating! And I've been using the meal section to track my meals and all the preloaded nutritional information is fantastic. I can easily see how well (or not well in some cases) I am eating. This will really help me make progress is my journey to become healthier!
 Once I figured out how to use it, I love it!!! Hubby likes it too so he asked me to order him one too! I had bought the Polar A360 and I returned it because this one fits so much better and the display is just the right size for both of us.
 Absolutely Fantastic except the Charge 3 came out and now it's like the 2 never existed.
 This Ftbit is great for runners! It’s light weight and is easy to program settings. It also serves as a watch, gives heart rate, steps, and mileage!
 Do not waste your money.  This heart rate monitor functions accurately maybe 10% of the time.  Wish I would have had better experience because I have enough garbage to take out on a normal basis ….
 I like the fitbit except some of the bands are hard to change, and it sits up high andgets caught on your coat or sleeve.
 My mother is very happy with product, some times it fails to calculate steps, but for the price I'd say is fare enough
 much better than the original Fitbit Charge. Goodbye to the peeling wrist band. I like the excellent features they have incorporated particularily in the sleep analysis.
 I like the ability and functions of this.  I don't care for the size of the unit.  It sits too tall and wide.  I  bought on for my husband and it looks good on him.  I have tried other bands but its not the band i have an issue with.
 I have been wearing this for about a month now.  Very pleased with this product.  App on my phone is informative and easy to navigate.  I would recommend to others.
 Love this thing so far.  It does exactly what it's supposed to do. I researched the crap out of activity monitors and chose the Fitbit based on price and features.  The Fitbit app is by far the easiest app I've used on my phone for food tracking and and keeping up with steps, heart rate, and sleep. Good job Fitbit! It's too bad that their stock is not doing so well.<br/><br/>One glitch I hope they fix: iPhone SE heart rate syncs just fine with app, but won't always show the full heart rate history until I fully close the app and re-open it.  Then shows full history.
 fiance loves it
 The best thing about the Fitbit 2 is the screen face is larger. I had a Fitbit 1 before it served its purpose. I wear it to sleep, as you should. I hope it holds up better than the 1. I bought the warrentee just in case.
 I've had other fitness trackers but this is my first Fitbit. I love it. It does excellent tracking of my heart rate, exercise, and calories burned. With the Fitbit app on my phone im also able to keep track of the macronutrients and calories I take in with each meal and much more!
 Love this gadget.  The rose gold is probably not worth the extra money on the actual watch when all you need to do is buy a rose gold band for a fraction of the price of getting the "special edition" but oh well.  So far so good!
 This fitbit works well. I like the optional colors too. I wish that they made an ankle strap to just count steps.
 So far I am liking my new Fitbit,  I purchased the Fitbit as part of a bundled offer, delivery was right on time. I am hoping the Fitbit will motivate me to be more active. I thought I was having an issue with it but found I was not syncing my Fitbit after I made a setting change. I would recommend it to others.
 I received a dirty  band with my supposed new charge 2. Now I don't believe either one are new now but yet I paid full price for both. Very unsatisfied
 I have had this for about 2 months. I wear it every day and it is very comfortable. Keeps track of all my diet and fitness goals. I did a lot of research on various brands and finally decided on the Charge 2. Got a great deal for black Friday!. Worth the money and looks great.
 I absolutely love it! After having a flex and one for quite awhile it’s refreshkn to have one that does the job of both!
 First off, I really love the lavender rose gold color. It's just beautiful and pretty enough to wear with casual and dressy outfits for work.<br/><br/>I wasn't sure if I'd really like this Fitbit after the original Charge I had performed poorly (inaccurate step counts). I do however like that I can adjust my stride length with this one and once I did that, it seemed to be pretty close to accurate. I'm only 5'1" and I take really short steps, so it was only counting half my steps before I made the adjustment, which was a letdown originally.<br/><br/>The heart rate monitor doesn't always seem to be accurate though. I mean do I really have a 106 pulse by just getting up and walking 10 steps? It seems a bit high and it may just be because it's not sitting properly on my wrist. I'm not sure how accurate the sleep tracker is. It's pretty close, but it definitely missed some times when I know I was restless or awake. I don't always wear it at night though, but when I do, it's nice to see that I really do sleep as poorly as I suspected...<br/><br/>I like the text/message notifications. They're nice to see when my phone isn't within viewing range. My old Fitbit did this, so it's not really a new feature for me. The reminders to move are nice as well. The battery life is great on this thing and I can go days without having to charge.<br/><br/>What I don't like is the fact that I have to turn on my location to even connect the thing to my phone to Sync. We didn't have to do this before in older Fitbit's. I've read that Fitbit says it's required by Google Play now. But it's annoying and battery draining nonetheless, so I'll never leave it connected to my phone all day.
 Have had this for 2 months....Works great....easy to use.  Had one bout with it nor syncing automatically, but haven't had that problem again.  It has lots of great features and is easy to program.
 The product was well priced and offered well, and received as presented.
 Fits perfectly and holds up well.  You do need to put a screen protector on the device as the screen will get scratched.
 I bought these for my teenagers for Christmas and the love them! They immediately became competitive to see who could take more steps. They synced them to their phones easily!
 I purchased this item as brand new to be gifted to someone. The gift recepient noticed right away that the glass of the Fitbit had multiple scratches. The device works fine, however the scratches are annoying and embarrassing.
 This is the  3rd or 4th Fitbit I've owned. It serves as a motivator for me and helps me to keep active. Just now it reminded me to get up and start moving for this hour. I just wish it was water resistant
 if you don't have a fit bit - get one.  Best thing I ever did for myself.  Works with apps in stores and charge lasts a week.  No need to by the cheaper one or fancy one.  This is "just right"
 I love Fitbit so much. I highly enjoy the app and how I can track steps, exercise, sleep, food, water, weight, and calories burned all in one app. The challenges make it so fun as well. The Charge 2 fits perfectly on my wrist, I am a hige fan of the rose gold and lavender. Its a perfect mix between the Alta and the Charge HR. I would recommend the Charge 2 to just about anyone who was interested in a fitness tracker, it has everything that I want and need!!
 Got this yesterday.  Love, love, love it already!  The only thing that I am not used to, is the "owners manual" was either available through my phone and start up steps, or I had to google to figure out how to do.  But awesome!
 I'm very competitive, so this fitbit allows me to exercise and get motivated by my friends and family that are also trying to stay fit.  A watch that keeps track of steps, heart rate,  run time, has a stopwatch, and helps with a 2 minute breathing exercise.  Love it.  The smartphone app is easy to use too!  Samsung or iPhone.
 This works great.  Actually has more on it than I need,  but I find this other things helpful.
 I enjoy my Fitbit.  I track my steps, set reminder alarms, and monitor my sleep.  I really wish my notifications we're more reliable.  That would earn it that 5th star.
 After 8 months of use it stopped working. Called support and they were absolutely helpful.  I got my problem fixed with a replacement.<br/>Awesome support
 It's a lot more comfortable to wear than I though it would be.  The battery does last for a few days (depending how much you fidget with the screen).  The various alarm functions are great.  Some to remind you to get up and move (especially nice at a sedentary job) to even a wake up "alarm".  Using this and the app can really help you get healthier.
 I really like the features of this fitbit but I personally find it a bit uncomfortable.  This is because the part that sticks out on the back that reads your hear rate is not flush with the bottom.  You don't see that in any of the pictures.  Even if I wear it loose then the buckle part sticks out.  I've not figured out all of the features yet like the call alert, nothing in the instructions for that.
 Great and simple to use, I just wished the battery lasted longer. Also great and user friendly for first timers. My dad loved it
 My Fit bit Charge HR helped me lose 30 pounds, but it broke right before I got pregnant. Now post pregnancy I am using this one again to help me trrack calories in and out to help me loose weight. This one has features the HR didn't have on the screen display, plus the charging system is much better.
 great product. a bit pricey though
 I really liked the Fitbit Charge 2. Right size, right features. Used it every day, steps, stairs, runs, workouts, etc. Unfortunately the battery only lasted 19 months. Went through tech support, followed all the instructions. That works out to approx $75 a year for this. They need to design this with a replaceable battery. With only a one year warranty, Tech support says it can now go into the electronics recycle bucket.
 I love it and I wear it all the time. Except to bed. I can't handle sleeping with it on my wrist, but that's me. Good for tracking different activities, setting reminders, and so much more! Love it.
 Love my Fitbit Charge 2. Gave me goals to reach, log meals to keep track of calories, log exercise, heart rate monitor, sleep stages and so much more. Gave me motivation, lost 50 lbs thanks to Fitbit. Great buy!!!
 Unfortunately I did not keep this Fitbit. I found it to be very inaccurate with steps. I was putting on my makeup and it was registering many steps taken. Also I could not get the face to sit in the center of my wrist and did not like the way it looked on me. Not for me.
 I upgraded from a zip fit to the Charge 2. I really like the features from time, heart rate, etc. I haven't wore a watch for years and it has been easy to adjust to. LOVE IT!!
 Love this! Works as described. Steps aren't always accurate (got a 150+ steps while in the car for 3hrs+). Regardless it's a good way to keep track of your health. There are so many features I have yet to figure out and use. Only complaint is that the box (NOT Amazon packaging) came dented. Good thing it was pretty decent quality, otherwise the Fitbit would've been damaged and I would've been pissed!
 Been helpful getting into shape. It has been challenging myself and husband to get more exercise. I highly recommend this product and company.
 I bought this for myself and my daughter saw it and confiscated it! Worked great the two days i had it. She uses it all the time and is happy with its smaller form factor. It's ok though I upgraded the next day to the Blaze.
 This is the latest in my search of a very useful fitness tracker. I purchased the Fitbit Charge 2 based on reviews and style. I had a Nike Fuel band (loved the form factor, but I bought and returned 5 because they were completely inaccurate) and an Apple SmartWatch (cool, but I wanted to wear my "real" watch).<br/><br/>Here are my assessments of the Fitbit Charge 2:<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>1. Sleek design. For women, it just looks like a cool hip bracelet.<br/><br/>2. Notifications and cool graphics when you hit your goal.<br/><br/>3. Syncs well with the iPhone.<br/><br/>4. Does a reasonable job tracking sleep - not perfect but pretty good.<br/><br/>5. The graphics and the interface on the iPhone are well done, simple to use and very intuitive.<br/><br/>6. Definitely good to use to measure your activity (with the exception of spin bikes) relatively. That is, it is good to see how you do against yourself on a day to day basis, but I do not believe it is good at accurately tracking your activity on an absolute basis.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/><br/>1. It is not accurate with heart rates. I have worn it and tested it against both my Apple SmartWatch, two different Peloton Heart Rate Monitors and using the heart rate handles on treadmills at gyms...and have done this for a couple weeks. In each case, the Fitbit reports heart rate much lower than the other devices.<br/><br/>2. It is not accurate with "steps" on treadmills. I have run for 3.0 miles on a treadmill and my Fitbit reports 2.2 miles.<br/><br/>3. You can't "trick" it for steps on a stationary bike. If you spin or do Peleton, it won't give you "steps" credit. It will give you exercise time credit. So you  can have a crazy workout day and miss your 10,000 steps.<br/><br/>4. Syncing the the Fitbit scale does not work. It will work for ONE user but every one else is a "guest". I tried setting it up again probably 8 times before I gave up. I am going to test this too against another scale because my weight fluctuated a pretty big range daily, which it is unusual for me.<br/><br/>5. It's not very accurate with stairs.<br/><br/>6.Somehow, if you are playing a card game and shuffling cards, you can earn a massive number of steps.<br/><br/>For me, it is not an effective fitness tracker, particularly in the winter when much of my exercise is in a gym, on a bike or treadmill. I can have big work out days and not make my goal. On the other hand, I can sit and play cards all day and exceed my  goal. And that can be frustrating if you rely on it to be accurate. I've heard the Garmin is good with indoor activity and the Apple SmartWatch is better with most exercise - however, I resisted going there because I wanted more of a bracelet than a watch. The Fitbit was much better than my experience with the Nike Fuel Band (I had two of them - one for me and one for my daughter, I could wear both at the same time and get completely different results!).
 Connected and functions properly with Moto Z2 Play. Asus ZenWatch 2 continuously disconnected. No issues with this Charge 2.
 This is my second Fitbit. It is the second to fail after a year. My first Alta stopped charging just outside the warranty period.<br/><br/>This Charge 2 has the screen starting to split, causing brightness and pixel loss. For $150 a product should last more than one year. Won't be duped into buying another of their products.
 The thickness of the bracelet is more than I thought it would be and it digs into my arm . I have it as loose as possible without the bracelet being able to turn. I think I just have to get use to it. Other than that, I love the color and how the fitbit helps to inspire me to stay active!
 This is for my wife who is very fit and very active. She was't sure how much she would use it, but she does much more than she thought. Absolutely LOVES it. Being an awful sleeper, she especially is in awe as to how much info she gets about that.
 This is my second and last Fitbit product. My first was a Charge which lasted about 18 months before the silicone band was unusable. This Charge 2 lasted 10 months. It fell off my wrist in the airport and it's lost. Expensive way to track steps and fitness
 Love it!! Upgraded from the Alta and love the Charge 2!!!
 This Charge 2 is a replacement for my old charge HR which died. Works great &amp; talked my brother-in-law into buying one also.
 The strap of my Fitbit broke after a couple of months. I am so disappointed. It keeps popping off.
 I'm obsessed. I was only getting around 3,000-5,000 steps a day apparently. Knowing how little I was moving before has really motivated me to get up more. I love that I can track my work outs, and do step challenges with friends. Definitely worth the money.
 After 3 months of VERY LIGHT use the battery won’t charge!
 I loved my Fitbit Charge 2. But, 17 months after purchase it completely stopped working. It wasn’t damaged in any way. One day the display stopped working and the next day all functions stopped. This product should have lasted for years, with good care. Absolutely unacceptable.
 The rose gold sides is perfect!! I love this one. Changed the band to more feminine looks and now I have a rose gold bracelets watch.
 I love my Fitbit Charge 2! I have had other fitness trackers, but this one is super easy to use and slender. The battery life is long and the band makes the fit feel secure.
 Bought this for myself on Black Friday -- an early Christmas gift to me. I'm having fun with it. Works well. I like the way I can personalize the goals and what shows up on my watch via the Android app.
 Love everything about it.  Only wish I had gotten the face protector as it scratches easily.  A little frustrated with the app for the iPod touch.  Doesn't always connect and I have to reboot my iPod in order for it to sync.
 Distract some interesting stuff – I don’t know how accurate it is because it credited me with 500 steps while I was sleeping, but who knows maybe I kick a lot.
 I really wanted to love this product. But unfortunately it just doesn't work accurately. It registers steps while not in motion and doesn't register while in motion. Secondly the the face of the watch isn't as responsive as it should be.. I have to manually press the side button to get the information,when advertised that forward movement of wrist will show display. And lastly it's uncomfortable. It's going back.
 I am a unhappy camper, I have had my Fitbit since September, yesterday it fried on the charger . Dead 😰😡 didn't even last a year,  200.00 bucks down the drain
 Girlfriend loves this. she monitors everything from sleeping times to workouts and loves it. It also has the text option so she can read a text when  she gets it right on her wrist.
 So, I needed a heart rate monitor device to check my heart rate during exercise. Fitbit seemed like a good option considering the alternative, the more cumbersome chest strap option. The devise is attractive, comfortable and high quality. I was glad to get it and ware it in the beginning. However, very soon the problems started to appear. Constantly, I had to twist my arm in order to get a reading and even then the information stayed on just for a couple of seconds. While running, I could not make out the heart rate, because by the time I could see anything, it disappeared. The same goes for the stop watch function. WHAT IS THE POINT of a stop watch if you cannot see it after a few seconds. How can I keep a plank for two minutes if I don't see the time only if I  twist my arm {which is definitely hard during plank exercise).<br/>Also, the device cannot be turned off. So, either I ware it constantly, or leave it turned on. That means, when I need to put it on again, oh my gosh, it's dead!! WTF? It felt I was a prisoner of this product. Guess what! I don't like to be a prisoner!<br/>Pros:<br/>-High quality<br/>-Simple way of showing heart rate<br/>-Customization<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-Hard to see heart rate during exercise such as running {it disappears fast)<br/>-Constant twist of hand to get a reading {even then the screen doesn't always come on)<br/>-Information stays on the screen just for a couple of seconds<br/>-Cannot be turned off<br/>-Very few options to adjustt<br/><br/>After using it for over a week, I was so annoyed by these shortcomings, that I decided to return it. I really don't like to return items after I use them, but I felt, that the product developers should really take these reviews into account and create a better software for their otherwise amazing product.
 Great product until it fell off my wrist! The wristband detaches easily so now I have to buy another one! Smh...fix the wristband and offer a refund or a discount when this happens to customers
 The watch itself is very good. I love it. But I am disappointed with the bands, which are too easy to break. I bought this Fitbit Charge 2 eight months ago, now both bands are broken at the connection end. I tried to glue it, but it looks ugly.
 I Love my fitbit! I try to reach my step goal daily and it keeps me moving. The app helps me set realistic goals as well as track my water I take and calories I eat per day. It's also my motivational tool to workout and I also use it to earn rewards  through other apps simply by walking. Only downside is it doesn't seem to hold a charge too long but I can handle that.
 The wife's Fitbit Surge needed charging every two days after about a year. The charge 2 has been working for 7 days without needing a charge, she is loving life again!! Of course it is brand new, but her Surge never lasted that long when it was new, so!! We'll see!!!
 I’ve had this for two years and have had zero issues with it still. I’ve hit it against a million things, wear it everyday, and the battery life still last a solid 4-5 days. The app is what really makes it worth while tracking lots of things in addition to just steps. Even with newer Fitbit models I would still highly recommend this product.
 I am sleeping more because Fitbit sends a text tracking hours slept. If it's too low, I work in a nap. No more accumlating sleep deficit.
 Amazing device. Working with the Fitbit app for my phone, and PC, this device provides a wealth of useful information to help you improve your overall fitness, and track your progress.
 What a life saver this device is. I got it on advice of my doctor. It has changed my life
 i absolutely love the fitbit with the fitbit app. since I've bought this, its kept me motivated to workout, i can log my hikes, my distance, tells me if I'm in shape or not, tracks my sleep and not to forget the rose gold is super cute.
 This fixed many of the problems with the charge HR, which was a good product:  the wristband is now replaceable, it has a nice large, bright display, and the recharging cable is easy to hook up!
 I have worn this now for several months, and I love it so much more than the original. My only regret is that is seems to have a little trouble syncing up my exercise. Thank you!
 There's a few kinks I need to work out, but except for one server hiccup, it takes all my stats. I'm pleased. Also since I am loathe wearing watches, I purchased the thin metal band to go with this unit and am very happy with it.
 I agree with other reviewers the Charge 2 fixes the issues of the original fitbit.  A great idea allowing the band to change, I believe the graphics are able to be viewed better.  I'm very satisfied.
 As with all fit bits this  has been a great motivator for my husband to get his steps in.The band adjusted comfortably and the directions are easy to use to set this up
 The Fitbit was defective and I had to send it back to the manufacturer.
 I bought the Fitbit to measure distance walked.  Little did I know that even when I am standing still and move my wrist that it is counting distance.  It doesn't accurately measure distance, or how long I sleep at night.  I don't care what my pulse is or how much water I drink in a day.  I would not waist my money on this or any other Fitbit item.
 This has been my best product to use to record my daily steps as I continue my activity journey!
 I bought to track steps. I’m pleasantly surprised it tracks steps in HIIT class and eliptical machine. However after owning for 10 days battery doesn’t seem to be lasting. I read 3 -4 days between charge; I get 2 and today about 6 hours. Might be getting returned quickly.  App sometimes synths to iPad sometimes not for hours even if I’m near it. Same with iPhone.
 I LOVE my Charge 2!  The larger face and text messsge reading is a plus, and the charge connection is much improved.  I went through two of the older models that broke and Amazon replaced.  Very happy with this product and Amazon's exceptional service!!
 This is basically your standard fitbit, nothing outstanding or special about it, it does not offer an changeable band so if you do not know specifically who you are buying for, the band size could potentially cause an issue. The price is great, however, you get exactly what you pay for, a basic fitbit, nothing too fancy.
 My mother-in-law loves her fit bit and the band's that go with them. She was showing them off in church tiki myself and husband,  because she was so happy with her gift
 I wasn't sure if it would be too bulky on my skinny wrist, but I LOVE this thing. It's WAY better than my Jawbone Up3, and the software is better too. If you are worried, just get it. You'll be glad you did. I can even use the display as a flashlight in a pinch! One thing I had to figure out was how to get the tab of the strap out of the retaining band. Just squeeze the ends together when you want to take it off. Otherwise you'll be battling with it for awhile. Maybe everyone else figured this out already.
 I received it yesterday and I really like the features this has and it’s helping my workouts and water intake. I don’t like the feel of the band it’s rough on my skin and a bit irritating.
 Easy to use and helpful.  I had a garmin before but I like the app on Fitbit better.  Great to track my walking during my knee surgery recovery.
 Band is faulty. Contacted Fitbit support several times to find out that the rose gold and lavender band does not have a replacement.  I have to send back the whole tracker. I was really excited for this tracker but it really is not worth the hassle.
 This has been a big help to track my exercise at age 70 with chronic back pain, arthritis. The sleep tracker is the only disappointment for me. Otherwise, I find it to be very accurate on treadmill and daily activity trackng.
 This was a gift to my daughter, she loves it.
 This device stops connecting to fitibt app/phone after a year or so. that is soon after the warranty expires. I see in there community discussion forum that many people faced this issue.
 I give this a two star because everything worked great minus the step counter. That effected all other stats which made this item useless to me. I returned this item simply because of that reason.<br/><br/>The steps are counted with arm swing which isn't good. It would be an accurate device if you only wore it while you walked and immediately took it off. I couldn't do it anymore after the device counted nearly 300 steps while I folded clothes. I will get an I watch that utilizes GPS for its distance calculation.<br/><br/>A major plus, the Fitbit app is great
 Love this watch it does all i want it to without the hassel
 I'm disappointed with the battery life of this watch. the maker claims a 20 minute charge will fully charge the battery, I'm lucky if 20 minutes gets me a quarter of my battery back. the watch is comfortable, and tracks sleep well which is the main reason I need it, but the battery constantly flat lining for me is frustrating.
 I love my Fitbit. I like the way it monitors my sleep. I like the way it inspires me to get those 10,000 steps so I can see the fire works. I like the way I can tell what time it is in the dark. It has just become a very important part of my every day living. Only wish it would not get scratched as easily as it does.
 Bought it as a gift for my wife, she loves it since it offers more feature than the previous Fitbit
 Had to return twice in two months. First one had battery issues. Had to charge daily even after turning off all notifications. Second one stopped syncing after a week and also had battery issues. Attractive tracker but too many issues. DO NOT BUY.
 Nice flexible lightweight band<br/>Great change for my FB HR2<br/>I have a large wrist I cd have taken it down a size to medium<br/>Runs large,
 I bought two of these on black friday, one for my brother and one for myself. Although the one i bought for myself works perfectly, my brother's broke from the strap on his first attempt to go running with the watch. The metal piece on the strap fell off as he was running; the only reason the watch didn't fall off was because of the plastic lock. Unfortunately i didn't buy any warranty for the watch so i am unsure if there is anything i can do to replace my brother's fitbit.
 Great device . I love everything about it. You will probably have to buy extra bands though as my first band broke in about 2 months.  Also my screen recently cracked right down the middle and it is past the return policy time frame.
 Love the watch but have been having a hard time getting it to sync. These problems may be caused by poor Bluetooth operation on the PC. The fitbit will also not accept an update.
 I have had the Charge 2 for 4 days and like it so much better than my other brand tracker I had for 16 months before it died.<br/>Setup is straight forward from either by smartphone, tablet or computer.<br/>Fitbit doesn't send a Bluetooth dongle for those with only a computer. That is the only thing I can say negative about the Charge 2, but those dongles are very easy to find and are not expensive.<br/>The charge 2 is more accurate and the dashboard read out has everything a person would need to know about their activities. It is very easy to understand.<br/>Being able to change bands is a huge plus for me as I have problems with plastic or rubber bands making my skin blister under and around the band.<br/>Bought a metal band that adjusts and locks by magnet and have no skin problems with that.<br/>The price is a little steep, but as my son says "You get what you pay for" He is a 100% right on this purchase.
 This is my third Fitbit and I love how they all work. The tracking works great for running/biking and the heart rate tracking is very accurate. I really love the rose gold on this model, but it's permanently stained on the band from my blue jeans. The staining started on about the 2nd day after I got it and no amount of scrubbing will get it off. I am disappointed that the pretty lavender color is now a weird blue.
 Actually, my wife loves it!  Bought it for her for Valentine's Day.<br/><br/>She enjoys all the features -- including the reminder to get off your @$$ and go for a walk!  (Not exactly those words, but it will remind you to get moving!)
 First, this is NOT a medical device. I can't believe some purchasers are comparing the Fitbit to a medical quality heart rate monitor. The device is comfortable, easy to charge,  and does a great job tracking health related exercise.
 I am not sure I like this yet as when we received and proceeded to set up found out that we needed Windows 10 or a dongle to set up.  It would be nice  to see these requirements prior to purchasing.  We are now going to update our operating system and try again.  I will update comments on how it works once we have successfully been able to use.
 I had been using the Fitbit Zip for a few years and this is a great upgrade. The heart rate monitor feature is great and the gunmetal color is a nice touch. I really like being able to receive text and call notifications through it. Overall I'm very happy with this tracker. I almost bought the Fitbit Blaze because they were both on sale, but decided on this one instead. Been using the Charge 2 for a week now and really enjoy the sleep statistics.
 The tracker has worked flawlessly and exceeds my expectations.  Very easy to use and provides a wealth of information that I am finding very valuable in managing a healthy lifestyle.  The ability to track workouts; treadmill, weights, running, is really great and easy.  The connected GPS works perfectly and is not a hassle as I would have brought my phone on the run for the music anyway.  The stats provided in the app and having one place to manage calories and exercise is perfect.  I would highly recommend this product.
 Love the fit bit.  But the band broke in less than a month so had to buy a new band all ready.
 I am not sure if it's the Fitbit, or my metabolism.  The count of steps that register on the Fitbit doesn't make sense, I shake my hand and it counts steps.  I stand in one spot vacuuming and it counts steps.
 This model fitbit really is hard to beat.  It's not much larger than my HR, but has a larger display area.  This one is my wife's and she wears it daily.  The text notifications and caller ID info is a nice, but would be better if it displayed quicker and more consistently.
 I love this because it has a wristband with a buckle and it has much more info that I can see and interact with.  The Fitbit Flex I had was fine but I get more interaction and enjoyment with the Fitbit Charge 2. So far everything works great.
 Love it. I use it every day to track my exercise and food. I was debating between this one and another because I didn't like how big the face was, but I went with this one because of all the extra stuff it provides.
 Amazing. I highly recommend it. It really encourages me to get up and get moving which we all need a little push every now and then am I right??
 I had the Fitbit charge but I’m in love with this new model. The screen shows so much more than what I was working with. I like to see how lazy I am during the day. An expensive watch for me. Plus everything thing I can manage on my phone that it records for me.
 This was a gift for my wife. She loves it. She's uses it as a watch, to stay in the cardio zone when she walks, and to evaluate her sleep pattern. I think I will order another one for me.
 The novelty of this toy has worn off.  Overpriced gadget.  Save your money.  I would not purchase again if i could go back and do it over.
 Has been working great so far. App can't be beat. Not yet anyway. It's the best deal in terms of pricing and features.
 I love this version of Fitbit, it is easy to operate, app is very resourceful!!! I’m setting goals &amp; achieving them! I also love how it syncs with my IPHONE-like a Apple Watch previews my messages &amp; alerts my phone when I hit my benchmarks!
 First time user of Fitbit. Used for 5 days and returned.  It's gigantic on my small wrist. I'm petite at 5'3" and 125#.  I never got used to it.  I didn't feel it motivated me in a way that I need.
 I got this for the heart rate monitor, and it's nearly useless. Walking on a treadmill, with the treadmill's monitor reading 150BPM, my Fitbit reads anything from 90 to 130, or just shows dashes.<br/><br/>I was perfectly happy with my Alta, and comparing this to the Alta, they're about equivalent -- the Alta doesn't have the HR, but this one may as well not have it either.
 This fitness watch is amazing. I love the heart rate monitor, the step counter, and the fact that it keeps track of calories burned is great. The companion app is the best i have seen. It helps you keep track of your water intake, the number of hours you slept that night, and helps you keep track of the calories you have taken in. and there is no looking up calories on the internet. Fitbit has a database of food that makes it easy to keep track of everything you eat. I was debating on buying this watch or an apple watch and I am so glad that I bought this one.
 So far I do like this unit. Been through some firmware updates, app updates, they seem to address items they are aware of quickly. I have had an issues with battery life, but I generally throw it on the charger every couple of days.
 I love the charge 2! It's slim &amp; the screen is the perfect size!<br/><br/>I love all the color options available and that the band's are easily able to be switched!
 My wife loves hers, so I got one for myself.  This is just the motivational tool I needed to get more exercise.  Displaying call and text notifications from my phone is icing on the cake.  Highly recommended!
 I was excited to track my "steps", and believed the fitbit was somewhat accurate until I walked around my house (about 35 steps) with the steps changing by 0. I walked around several more times, keeping my eye on the watch, seeing my steps increase by 0-6 a lap. I was furious that my brand new fitness tracker wasn't working. To make things worse, the iOS app syncs infrequently, so it would often show differing results. The fitbit would also regularly jump by 10-30 steps all of a sudden. I thought maybe it was tracking all my steps, but there was just some latency. After playing around with it some I realized that if you don't swing the wrist that the fitbit is on, then you haven't taken a step. If you just sit down and swing your arm up and down though, you can get your steps in at no time flat.<br/><br/>Needless to say I don't trust this fitness tracker at all. I don't recommend it, and I won't buy another fitbit product again.<br/><br/>Also, the screen is supposed to come on when you lift your arm up to look at it. This functionality seems to only work about 2/3 of the time. I've only had it for a day, and I'm extremely disappointed.
 We love these. Bought as a set with the wife and now we are always competing for steps and other stats.
 Returned as it was difficult to set up AND stated that you could see face in sunlight and you can't.  Not. happy with this product.
 I like it a lot, though I think they could make it better. The only things that could make it better are if it was slimmer and water resistant. Battery life is good, I get about 3-4 days on a full charge. The Fitbit app that you download, is good but there are some things that are tedious to get to, I won't hold that against the fitness band though.
 My fitbit Charge 2 stopped working after 6 weeks for wearing.  I called the customer service and went through a lengthy evalution on the phone. The customer service rep finally agreed it was a defect product.  They were only willing to replace the Pebble portion of the device.  They shipped the part but did not include an instruction or tool on how to replace the pebble.  I still don't have a working device since it stopped working 3 weeks ago.
 I love Fitbit. As someone who has now owned a Fitbit One, a charge hr, a blaze, an Apple Watch, and now a charge 2, I can state without a question of a doubt that I would take the charge 2 over all of them. Whereas the extra features are nice on the Apple Watch, they aren't used often enough to overcome the necessity of charging each and every day. I also love the sleep tracking on the Fitbit as I have found to be not only accurate but informative.
 I love my FitBit! I wear it all day, at night when I sleep to track my sleep cycles. It is sleek and I can wear it with workout clothes and when we go out for a date with the changeable bands. I recommend this Fitbit to anyone who is looking for a sleek fitbit. It is not bulk and looks delicate on the wrist, even though it is tough.
 Much better than the HR -- give more tracking information and syncs better with other applications, e.g. Weight Watchers. Also like the interchangeable wristband.
 They don’t tell you that whatsapp notifications won’t work with iOS. No plans for adding it though they have it with android.
 I was loving my Fitbit until couple days ago when it stopped working.😢<br/>I’ll still give it 5 stars but I’m so disappointed.
 I bought this Fitbit Charge 2  Sat, Jan 14, 2017 at 1:27 PM. I recieved it on the 16th. After 1 week of wear the Heart rate tracker no longer works. I haven't even put it through any rigorous training, just light jogs and walks. This is a complete disappointment I was really looking forward to all the great tools in the app and advancing my cardio health, but without the heart rate tracker this is just a fancy watch that allows me to discretly read my text messages in class. BEYOND DISAPPOINTED!!!
 W A R N I N G - Does not work with Windows 10 PCs.  Fitbit's Customer Service is a joke.  in hours of being in chat with customer service there were multiple gaps of three minutes or more for them to answer a simple question.<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Fitbit-Charge-2-Heart-Rate-Fitness-Wristband-Black-Large-US-Version/dp/B01K9S260E">Fitbit Charge 2 Heart Rate + Fitness Wristband, Black, Large (US Version)</a>
 I absolutely LOVE my FitBit! It's keeps me motivated to move, offers heartbeat and sleep patterns, you can log what you eat/drink. The app is very easy to use with the FitBit. It fits comfortably, holds a charge, and the screen is the perfect size.
 Works great, bought it for my wife, she loves it. Gives notifications when you get a text message. You can only see a few words of it though, but it's a nice feature I didn't know about. Battery life lasts a while, several days or more it seems.
 This is the second one our family has bought.  This is for our pre-teen son.  It’s keeping accurate heart rates and steps even on someone with small wrists.
 This was my first Fitbit and first fitness tracker ever. I am a big believer in a healthy lifestyle, exercise and fitness, but not a big fan of gadgets. Since everyone seems to have some sort of a fitness tracker these days, I finally broke down, primarily interested in tracking my heart rate during various types of exercise and getting a better insight into my sleep.<br/><br/>My first reaction upon opening the box was, "Ugly!" The Charge 2 is big and bulky and it doesn't lie flat on my wrist - not something I'd want to wear for a dressed-up occasion. I'd expected more refinement from it, but OK, let's give it a try. My heart rate appeared pretty accurate - and I don't care about ultimate precision. Steps and distance seemed accurate as well, but my iPhone is pretty good at measuring all that. I'd been really curious about measuring my heart rate and caloric burn during hot yoga practice. I wore it to one class and found it very uncomfortable - with all the sweat and movement, it wouldn't stay in one place and I had to adjust it constantly. The calorie burn it recorded was on the lower end of the range. As with all types of exercise not involving distance, it may not be very accurate. As for tracking my sleep, something strange happened - I'd put my Fitbit on my wrist the day I received it and kept it on, other than when taking a shower or bath. The first day I put it on, I slept poorly, and it went downhill from there. For 5 nights I was utterly miserable, tossing and turning and constantly waking up. And yes, the tracker recorded my awful sleep. I was in despair - I normally sleep quite well. Tried sleep aids, but nothing helped; I became a zombie. Finally, I asked myself, "What has changed in my life?" and the only answer I could come up with was, "the Fitbit." I took it off my wrist... and since then have been sleeping blissfully. I don't think my loss of sleep was caused by the mere presence of the Fitbit on my wrist; after the first several hours wearing it, I got used to it. No, it was something else - I must be sensitive to whatever waves it emits.<br/><br/>Given this experience, I have not been able to bring myself to put it back on, even during the day. I am not prone to panic, but I am very fortunate to be in good health, and I am not willing to jeopardize it for the sake of knowing how many steps I take in a day - I have a pretty good idea. And something else has happened that's very curious. My Fitbit has been sitting on my kitchen counter for a week now, and when I occasionally pick it up, I discover that it has burned over 1000 calories on any given day - yes, sitting on the kitchen counter. That has made me doubt the accuracy of any readings it gave me while I was wearing it.<br/><br/>On the positive side, the battery lasts quite a long time and all the functions seem to be functioning; the app is easy to use, although I never had a chance to use it extensively. I couldn't decide whether to get a small or a large band. My wrist is pretty small, but when I measured it with the strip provided by Fitbit, it was right on the border between small and large. I got the small, and it was the right choice - it fits comfortably and has plenty of room to loosen it or put it higher on the wrist. The large would have been way too big.
 Already had the charge HR. I love the charge 2 due to the bigger screen and ability to change the band. I'm very happy to be a second time customer! For the few weeks first Fitbit wasn't working, I was very unmotivated. My Fitbit holds me accountable to the gym. Now the whole family has them, and we can hold each other accountable. They make great Christmas gifts. Only downfall with the HR was that it broke after about 8 mons. I have the warranty for the charge 2. I would recommend spending the $11-12 for the 2 year warranty.
 This is awesome!! I'm still learning how to use it.  It has so many trackers on it.  So glad I gave this to me!
 Photo shows true color. Like this so much better than my Fitbit HR, which didn't quite make it to the 2-year mark.
 Does what a guy wants it to do.  No frills, just facts.  Good battery life, great band won't fall off like the others.  Accurate and does away with my watch.
 My Fitbit worked well for 3 months and would keep a charge and everything. I tried a couple times within the last month to try to charge my Fitbit. I was able to charge it but it died in a day and now it wont charge at all. I spent the money and was expecting to get a quality Fitbit that lasts a long amount of time. I do not recomend this product to anyone. I'm very displeased on this.
 Bought this item for my son and he loves it, best feature for me as a parent is the add on of visually seeing text messages or calls coming to his phone. I can get his attention through the vibration at any time without having to rely on him having his phone turned to vibrant or ring.
 LOVE IT! it has been amazing, I work as an OTA and the stopwatch has been a life saver, i love the color, it fit perfectly it works great. Best decision ever, not too small or bulky perfect size
 Very happy I bought this.  It looks sleek, easy to read, and motivates me.  One of my best purchases.
 I love all the features it offers.<br/>The only thing I would have liked differently was if the base was thinner, but I've gotten use to it.  It was hard getting use to sleeping with it.  I have no regrets about getting it.
 After buying and using the up3 for a couple of years (made by Jawbone), I wanted a tracker that tells me stats straight from the screen (up3 has no screen). I bought and returned a fitbit-like item for a lot less ($25!), but it was really bad and did not do anything it advertised. So, I went with the real deal and couldn't be happier! You really do get what you pay for!
 Love this new HR! It's a great device so happy with it. The band has nickel so if your allergic order a leather one from Amazon.
 You can't trust the step counter. The wife and I sat down with a bowl of popcorn to watch a movie. I somehow walked 110 steps sitting there eating popcorn. I mainly got it to monitor my sleeping. I ended up giving it to my son.
 I love this thing so much. I have had it for one month and have lost 10 pounds. Also seeing all the stress I was putting my heart under was my final motivation to stop smoking. Haven't smoked in 3 weeks! My resting heart rate went from a 99 to a 76. Fitbit is a great tool to aid fitness. This one works great and was shipped fast. I can't wait to start buying different bands!
 The tracker is definitely a 5 Star device, however, my wrist broke out in rash where the heart sensor pulsates!<br/>I returned the item!
 Love this - never thought I'd want one, but after having it for 3 months, it has motivated me to walk more than I ever have in the past. I love the heart monitor so I know if I'm meeting my target heart (fitness) rate - important for optimal health. It also includes sleep info - hours slept and the number of times awake and restless, which helps me monitor optimal sleep for me. Of course, the other fitness goals, climbing stairs, water consumed, food diary, and calories burned is also very helpful. Everyone should have one! Thanks for such a great product!!
 I love it.  This model is the best.
 I got this as an upgrade to my first Fitbit.  This Fitbit Charge 2 is great. Better battery life than my first one. It performs as expected. In addition, I also purchased the magnetic watchband which is also very nice.
 I love how it tracks my sleep and my steps however at times I feel like the number of steps is off but it definitely gives you an overall picture and a goal to meet even if the number of are slightly off!
 I love the Fitbit Charge 2.  The phone app that goes along with it is awesome with the ability to track steps (miles), calories, water, sleep, exercise.  It is accurate most of the time.  I have issues with tracking steps on a treadmill on occasion but I can add the steps (mileage back) if it is off.
 really like fitbit, this one i bought for my dad, he actually had me return it to get the ionic, much nicer display and a plus with the extra features but this one does what its intended to do, might get it for myself.
 Charge 2 did not pair with my One Plus 5 (Android Oxygen OS 4.5.10), looks like it is not compatible. I also tried setting up with HP EliteBook 840 laptop, it failed. Fitbit support confirmed that it is not compatible with One Plus, and similar reason for laptop also. I had to return the device. Without using do not want to give less rating. So, giving 3 stars, neutral.
 Quit working after a very short while. Have no idea how to fix it. My other fit bits worked forever.
 Love it so far - it makes me realize how well (or how not so good) I do during the day.  I like that the display has the time and date as well.  Syncs with phone easily with app.  Like it better than the original Fitbit.  It seems more accurate.
 Unfortunately I had the same issue with this fit bit as the one a purchased a few years ago. I had it for a few weeks and it stopped charging. I haven't even had this 3 weeks and it's already broken. For $150 I would expect this to last longer.
 Good product but the new ones are better and have easily replaceable bands
 The band holds up a lot better than the original HR. The screen tends to get whacked against more things because it's more exposed, but I like the larger screen. I invested in a basic screen protector and the fitbit has sustained zero damage for a month or so of daily wear despite my clumsy tendencies. Doors, walls, corners, bumps and brruises and it works like a charm.<br/><br/>Cannot stress how much of this depends on having a screen protector though. My original was scratched and fuzzy at the end of a year.
 Love it!<br/>***Update 13 months after purchase Fitbit stopped keeping its charge. Went through all the troubleshooting and did a full cleaning as advised by Fitbit team member. No help. Eventually never turned back on. Fitbit customer service said nothing they can do since the 12 month warranty has expired (now 13 months). Think twice before you buy because you may have to buy a new Fitbit every year.
 This is the best Fitbit for fitness tracking. They have incorporated the best features of the other recently released models. A big step forward from the Charge HR. I also like the interchangeable bands. I only wish it had built-in GPS. Well worth the price.
 Is a little bulkier than the first Charge, but definitely more accurate. You can track more exercises and has a better sleep log, tracking light, deep, and REM sleep cycles. The heart rate monitor is personalized to your heart health, so it's definitely worth the investment.
 And it is uncomfortable on my wrist. I really wanted it to work for me as I like the reminder to get up and walk since I have a desk job. Unfortunately, it does not record my steps accurately, nor my sleep hours. I think it works well for some people, but not everyone.
 Much better than my previous Fitbit. Love that you can make the display as you want it - I wanted to be able to read the time in sunlight and without reading glasses - mission accomplished.
 I upgraded from the first model of the firbit line. I’ve been wearing it a few weeks now. I only have to charge every three days and I average 8,000 steps a day. I love the heartbeat monitor and upgraded sleep detection.
 First, i must say i am not much of a reviewer and prefer positive reviews as opposed to negative reviews.  However, this product is the exception. This Item does not work as advertised with iphone 5s. I was able to originally pair the device and sync it with the app for 7 days. After 7 days i lost sync and was not able to "re-pair" the device inspite of following manufacturer instructions. The notifications aspect of the device never synced.<br/><br/>After a lengthy customer service internet chat wherein it was implied it was my fault the item was not working and being referred back to the failed web support page, i have decided to return the product and get something that might actually work with responsible customer support.<br/><br/>I would avoid this product and personally will avoid the manufacturer in the future.
 My first smart watch of any kind. I am most satisfied and would recommend it. So far no complaints. Syncs readily with My Fitness Pal and iCardio.
 we alll have them and love them
 I'm not confident in the step count. Works well for sleep tracking and heart rate.
 Love this product. I have had Fitbit's in the past and did not love them like I do this one.
 This was a gift to my daughter who had lost her previous Fitbit. She loves the ease of recharging this model.
 Charger for the Fitbit HR is cheap and usually doesn't charge after multiple attempts to match the charging pins. Won't purchase another.
 After a couple weeks of use, the rubber wristband doesn't sit flush with the metal housing of the unit, making the whole thing look funky and feel weird.  I recently purchased a replacement wristband, metal this time so hopefully it looks and feels better.
 I'm a fitness coach and very satisfied with the accuracy (not that much different overall compared to chest straps) and the app is phenomenal
 I really like it. I wore a pedometer for years and this keeps track of so much more. The only trouble is once and awhile it doesn't show my exercise for the day on my phone. I am not sure the sync did not happen.
 I love this watch! It's excellent, I'm always wearing it. It tells you everything you need when you are working out. Charge immediately and it's very comfortable.
 Gave as a gift and it works! I gave this to an older person and he is able to monitor his heart beat and adjust his exercise regime accordingly
 Bought this for my wife to replace her older Charge HR and she really likes this one. The bigger screen and being able to change out the band is a nice option. She also likes the fact that her text messages show on this one.
 Love the features and insights. Sleep quality factors have been interesting and helpful. I also enjoy the various activity tracking features.
 Not compatible with LG G6 per the support service. Useless junk for me
 Great Fit  I'm rather surprised that its not all scratched up as often as I run into things. Great quality and has plenty of activity selections. The app and watch is really easy to use. Couple other people in my family now want one.
 I bought this as a gift for my son and he loves it.  He has been using it everyday and enjoys all of the features.  It connected easily to his iPhone 8 and we have had no trouble with this fitness tracker.
 Bought as a gift, Husband loves it!
 Simple and very very complete data obtainer, I'ven using it for a year now, and I'm very impressed. Totally recommend to buy it.
 Does exactly what it should! If you just want something to track your steps and work outs this is perfect! It does notify you of calls and messages, but you can’t answer them.
 I like the product itself, however, having left for work with it charging, I came home to find it dead as the proverbial doornail. As the warranty doesn’t extend beyond 45 days, I’m kind’a screwed, and unwilling to spend that much for a product that only lasted 5 months.
 this Fitbit works really well, my only complaint is that a little while after I bought it, the rubber started coming up around the screen. I tried to push it back into place and it just pops right back out. It’s not super noticeable but I worry about water potentially getting in there.  Also, I paid good money for it so this shouldn’t happen.<br/><br/>I had the previous model of the Fitbit charged and the same thing happened with that one.
 Had it for three hours and sent it back as it wouldn't sync with Mac - though that was the least of the problems (yes, I read all the instructions and set it up correctly). If you look at it, the dial is on the left hand side of the face. I am right-handed so wear watches etc on my left wrist. This means that the dial is on the opposite side from where a watch dial would normally be. So, when you have to press the dial to change functions, you can do so only with your thumb and then the rest of your hand covers the rest of the face so you can't see what is happening (the face does not turn).  Yes, the dial would be in the correct position if I wore it on my right wrist, but then I can't do it up with my left hand and it takes me ages to run through the programmes. I also have small hands and it's really uncomfortable on the wrist - felt as if I was wearing a brick. Finally, I was very specific filling in the "quiz" on the Fitbit site and specifically said I wanted something I could wear when swimming. This item was suggested but when it arrived it said it is NOT suitable for water. One other thing - I used up more calories struggling while trying to get it out of the ridiculous packaging than I do in the gym.
 Has completely changed my daily fitness awareness.  Comfortable. Easy to set up and use. It was so great I bought another one for my husband. Now we compete for fitness.  And we're in our 60's.... rock on!
 I tried everything, ALL the troubleshoot steps, tried with a different phone and ipad. The device is broken and now I have to return it.
 The Fitbit measures up to more advanced exercise equipment measurement for pace, speed heart rate steps and more. A comparison between Fitbit and gym equipment gave similar if not the exact same readings as the gym equipment.
 This is one of the greatest pieces of technology I have ever owned. It is comfortable to wear, keeps me focused on reaching my goals for exercise and has world class software support. I would definitely buy this product again and again. It has helped change my lifestyle to become more active and aware of my health. Fitbit rocks!
 Love it for monitoring sleep and exercise.  Great battery life - more than a week. Analog watch display is unusable though.  Can't tell which hour the hour-hand is pointing at.
 I walk dogs so this Fitbit keeps me in target to reach my daily goal. I definitely like that if a text or call (on silent) comes in my iPhone 6 plus, it vibrates to let me know.
 A vast improvement over the previous model (the Charge HR).  It's much more accurate at counting heart rate when moving my arms vigorously, like when doing circuit training.
 Best Buy of the year! It links with my phone and gently vibrates when I receive a text or phone call. It tells me who is calling and texts roll across the screen! NO more digging for your phone! It is awesome. Working out is great also!
 Purchased this as a replacement for my first Fit Bit Charge which had broken...so glad I purchased the protection plan..fully replaced for original purchase price..such great customer service.
 Ordered this as a Christmas gift for my son, he has spent all day trying to set it up &amp; it isn’t working.  He just spent 30 minutes on the phone with Fitbit to find out that we have to send it to the factory because “something is wrong with the tracker.”  Ugh
 Love! I upgraded from a Fitbit Flex and so glad I did. More accurate tracking, notifications and long battery life. I was afraid it would look too big on my small wrist but I don't think it's any wider than my runners watch.
 I have enjoyed it, it encourages me to get up and walk. Glad I got it. There are times I think it is not accurate with my steps, but close enough.
 Great functionality.  Keeps me moving throughout the day.  This model has a face large enough to read texts from my phone.
 I wanted this mostly for the step counter and sleep tracking. I've tried all their supposedly "solved" solutions when doing a search on how to correct the probem. Here are just a handful of fixes (excuses)<br/>1.Where it on your non dominant wrist but change the setting to dominant so it supposedly knows, that arm move on you dominant wrist and the fitbit would be less sensitive to motion.<br/>2. There is no way to delete or reset your steps, so when you wake up and already have over 400 steps, you could essentially delete it and start over. It tells you to go to your settings, log in "driving" as an activity and that's supposed to wipe out the steps for that time period. It didn't work for me.<br/>3. Put, in your stride length<br/>4. Take it off and let it sit awhile. Blah blah blah. They state that the counter will ever be 100% accurate but I racked up over 360 "steps" rooting around my nightstand drawer for chapstick. This issue has 100's of posts all marked solved. Not true. Oh and the last one, wear it on yout ankle. I could buy a $1 pedometer for that. I really wanted to like this. Bought an extra charger,  bands and screen protectors but just can't bring myself to keep this fit it charge 2.
 I do not recommend for someone seriously looking at the heart rate. I do not think it is super accurate. I do love the fit bit. Wear it daily and love the color.
 I love the Fitbit Charge 2.  I particularly like the reminder to move each hour.  I am really bad about remembering to move, so the reminder is particularly helpfull
 I love it.  I found as I got older, I just couldn't get motivated.  A young man I work with, purchased a Fitbit and has made amazing progress with weight loss and an improved, healthier life style and he told me about Fitbit.  I got one and I now push myself each day to make the goals I have set for myself. Overall, I am feeling better, breathing better and have lost some weight.  Thank you, Fitbit!
 I bought this to replace my Surge, but returned it. You have to press the button in order to see the time, there's no option to have the time on all the time, like the surge.
 excellent upgrades from the HR charge - and works with cell phone.  the increased blood pressure tracking is wonderful.  Good deal for the price.
 This is a replacement for my Charge HR!  I loved my Charge HR and this one is better beyond compare.  Great features, looks good, replaceable bands.  Make it water proof and this becomes and unbeatable product!  Keep up the good work Fitbit!!
 I work night shift and bought this purely for a vibrating alarm clock so I can wear ear plugs while I sleep and not miss my alarm. It has the weakest vibrate that goes off for approximately 6 seconds before it silences itself without any input from the user. Otherwise as far as fitness tracking it is inaccurate well over half of the time for pulse calculation. It vastly miscalculates steps and stairs. I don't see any real value in buying this unless you think a piece of technology will help you stay in better shape than a gym membership. Overall this was a relatively large waste of money for me and I can add it to the useless technology pile. The concepts behind these are cool but they are so inaccurate and based on "social networking" instead of actual practice I would never recommend this to anyone.
 This Fitbit should be called the Unfitbit.  The first device I purchased stopped syncing in 3-weeks.  All attempts to resolve the issue failed.  I sent the item back to Amazon and was sent a replacement.  Unfortunately, 6-weeks later it stopped syncing.  Makes me wonder if the item was refurbished and sold as new.  No more Fitbits for me.  What a waste.
 After 6 months with an Alta, I decided to upgrade to Charge 2. Love the features--especially the heart rate monitoring and specific exercises besides walking. Not crazy about the band, so ordered another.
 I have been using my fitbit for 2 months.  It has only successfully tracked my heart rate doing exercise one time.  I have viewed all the troubleshooting videos about adjusting wristband, etc and this has not resolved the issue.  Sometimes during normal activity it will display that my heart rate is as high as 125 when it is closer to 55.  I would not recommend this product.
 I upgraded from the fitbit flex since I wanted an activity band that tells time with a stopwatch and heartrate monitor for exercising. It's very lightweight and easy to wear. I love that I can get other color bands to changed things up.
 Button stopped working after two months, got a replacement from Fitbit.
 My husband bought this for me and I absolutely love it will buy again with this one breaks. It is very much better than the original HR
 Luvvv this thing. Have only had for a few months; had an AHA moment in the gym today (stumbled on functions for different exercises -weights/elliptical/X-train) - - -da-uhhh! LOL! Could've been chronicling that data.....Oh well! Now I know! ;-)
 Why did my new Fitbit not come with a dongle. Can not set it up without one and can't find the $5 thing anywhere!!!!!!!
 It’s fun to use this. I’ve had it nearly a year with no problems except that the band is too big. I ordered the small size but it’s still too big
 A nice improvement over the original Charge HR.  I really like the interchangeable bands, although FitBit's are *way* overpriced.  The tracker itself feels well-made and durable.
 Not accurate. Counts my arm movements as steps. I just use it to track my sleep and for time. Not worth the price.
 Pros<br/>Large display. Built-in continuous heart rate monitor. Automatically tracks activities, calories, distance, steps, stairs, and sleep. Delivers idle alerts. Relax mode leads deep-breathing exercises. Supports interval training. Interchangeable bands.<br/>Cons<br/>Somewhat faint screen. Attracts fingerprints. Not waterproof. No GPS<br/>Bottom Line<br/>The Fitbit Charge 2 does everything the Fitbit Charge HR can, along with new idle alerts, automatic activity tracking, guided breathing sessions, interchangeable bands, and the option to connect your phone for GPS.
 Able to wear in Boot Camp....because it has a watch....Stretching the rules a bit, but it worked.  Sleep mode is very informative  5 day charge and does work with Android  Desire 526 even though it's not listed
 Pros:<br/>Well Built<br/>Good Mobile App<br/>Good Heart Rate tracker<br/>battery life.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>steps tracker did not work as expected. I see a lot of times it either over counts or under counts my steps. It does not count when I have my hands in my fleece pocket or on shopping cart. Sometimes I saw that when I took 10-15 steps it counts more than 50.<br/><br/>My smart phone app is a lot more accurate than this. expected a lot more accuracy from a dedicated fitness band.<br/><br/>returning mine.
 I love it.  I was concerned about getting it because I'm very (very) allergic to nickel and any ear rings that are not silver or gold will make my ears swell.  But after wearing this for 2 full days now, not one rash nothing bad.<br/>As far as tracking I know that this is NOT a medical device.  Doing electrocardiography is not what this is for.  For me it tracks well enough for my heart beat as well as my workouts.<br/>And I really like the little breathing experience you can use with this device without having to have your smartphone in your hand (okay I realize that smartphones are now part of most people's bodies and are taken absolutely everywhere).<br/>I also like being reminded to go for at least a short walk.  I get deeply involved with work and can sit for hours.  Now that will change and 250 steps takes very little time.<br/>The only thing that I've found confusing it how it tracks activity.  My other fitbit is a "One".  It tracks things wonderfully and updates activity immediately.  Not quite so with this and not the same activities (I think).  I'll go for a fast walk 1/2 mile to get my mail.  The fitbit one will track it and log the activity immediately.  This did not.  BUT it did show up maybe 10 to 20 minutes later.  Very odd.<br/>That said it does track it (I think... &lt;grin&gt;) well enough that I don't have to manually log it.
 Sadly the band on my Original Charge HR bubbled and came off from the unit. Luckily the new Charge 2 was being released and I quickly picked on up. I really enjoy the challenges and the tracking the old HR did. The new Charge 2 seems to do it better. The display is easy to read and you can quickly see the options by pushing the button instead of tapping the device. So far I am very satisfied with my purchase.
 My wife loves it. It's awesome.
 A nice step up from the previous Fitbit Charge HR. We love that the bands are interchangeable and fashionable, as well as the screen.
 I've had the Fitbit flex for 5 years and this is the perfect step up in the right direction. It works better than expected. Thank you Fitbit!!
 I had been looking at purchasing a Fitbit for a while, finally did. I basically wanted to keep track of steps, heartrate, calories burned and my sleep pattern and this does all of that and more. So far so good.
 The band is uncomfortable and difficult to use, but I could deal with that if it worked. In just two months it has stopped taking a charge and the battery is dead. Amazon return has expired so now I have to deal with Fitbit and their 1 year warranty process. I would highly recommend against buying this product through Amazon or any other retailer.
 Works as advertised. Extremely cool. Works well with my iPhone (I'm selling my Apple Watch). I'm able to sync it with MapMyHike and my insurance company  (I get discounts from them for using which will pay for the cost of the device).
 Love it! Very comfortable  to wear and put on after I change it. Easy to read when I'm working out. Cheaper that an Apple Watch even though I love Apple products.<br/>I've recommended it to friends and they're happy with their Fitbit.  I love setting goals with friends. It's exactly what I needed.
 I love this purchase! It works very well and was a great purchase decision. No complaints. Was brand new in the package and easy to get started as the packaging in the box walks you through step by step instructions. No regrets!
 Had to return it. Never was able to connect to smart phone with blue tooth. Bummer as I was leaving for a walking tour of Italy the next day.
 It's fun and motivational, even though most people I talk to say they take it off after awhile. I like mine a lot. The one serious drawback- it will give you steps in the car, and a lot of them.  Like hundreds a day! What?
 Returning. Everything is inaccurate, and it doesn't track most of my steps. I'll be trying a different model next.
 Better than its predecessor, the HR2 is awesome!!! Nice viewing capability and not too large for my wrist. The FB app is also a plus with many more additional features as well as, it works with your GPS to track your run.
 Not as good at getting heart rate as one might like. The underlying app isn't as powerful as one would expect this year. But it's good and works as advertised.
 My mom loves it. The color scheme is very pretty
 Bought this in March 2017 and the screen no longer turns on. It still keeps track of my steps but it would be nice to see that info on my wrist.
 I moved to the Charge HR2 after about a year with the HR model. This is much better in the build quality and battery life. The replaceable wristbands are an added feature but I'm happy with the one that came with the device.
 Love this. Very motivating, plus peer pressure made me do it. I have found myself doing laps around the house before bed to get that last 100 steps in. I like most of the features, the strap could be improved.
 Working well. Challenging to set up. Recovering from bypass surgery and a help in looking at progress.
 Works great for my wife.  She has a pacemaker and it's great for her to be able to monitor her heart rate throughout the day.
 I love this new Fitbit Charge 2.  I use it to track my movement throughout the day and it keeps me on track for completing my goal of 10,000 steps per day.  Nice touch of setting off a fireworks display on the Charge 2 when you complete 10,000 steps for the day.  😃
 Had a Charge HR years ago that finally had the tracker discinnecting from the band and needed a new activity tracker when my Withings did not sync anymore. I love the style and how the screen comes up by the turn of the wrist. I love the color and ability to change tge face to a real clock. I only wish the would make these water proof.
 Ordered it for my wife she been wanting one, and that's her favorite color. I made a lot of brownnie points.
 I replaced a Fitbit Charge with this model.  Huge improvement!  The face is much easier to read.  Easy to switch out different bands.  Keeps me on task for walking and exercise during the day.
 I loved my Charge 2 but I've only had it since June and it has stopped vibrating and doesn't seem to be counting or syncing properly anymore. Might be a glitch, but my original HR lasted way longer.
 The built in Heart rate monitor I love.  Get a discount with health insurance at work for tracking my steps so paid for itself.
 6 months in there is a long crack in the glass. I have had multiple Garmins and they were more reliable. I would not recommend this for active people. It looks nice when you wear it.
 Ive only had it for 5 days but I love it!! It does everything I need it to do and its sleek.<br/>The only thing I'm not happy about is that it didn't come with a dongle, which means I cant sync it with my computer. So Im stuck doing everything with the phone app. You would think for the price it would have one!
 The band on this is horrible. I can see why there are other wrist bands to buy. It is difficult  to get this band on and off due to the texture/ stickiness of the material. I think, for the price, it could have a better wrist band.
 I upgraded from the Fitbit Flex. This one is awesome! It does so much stuff! It’s realky helping me to keep on track with my sleep,staying moving throughout the day, and keeping track of my water consumption! I love it!
 It looks like a nice product, and you'd assume it suppose to work and pair with your smartphone, after all, just Bluetooth? Well, no. Didn't pair in the beginning, after few hours and after updating with a different phone, it was kind of ok, but during the first run didn't synchronized at all. Doesn't worth it.
 Love it!! It was ordered to replace the one I killed 😂 it’s been my favorite watch/activity tracker for yrs. never leave home without it!!
 I got the order in a timely fashion. The Fit bit was nicely packaged and I really love the Fit Bit. I bought extra bands so I can change the color up.
 Love the real thing. Bought a cheaper knock off and was not satisfied. It’s worth spending the money to get a quality Fitbit.
 I love my Fitbit Charge 2 it is a great product and reasonable price. I am glad I bought it. It shipped very quickly.
 Do not waste your time buying this Product or the extra insurance from assurion, I purchase this Fitbit because I like the way it looked and the quality looked well built, I paid $141.00 after shipping, I purchased the Fitbit and the insurance the same day January 28, 2017 , when I received it happy as ever to monitor myself, the first bit no exaggeration one week good , it died on me. I thought it was the battery, I had surgery scheduled on February 7, 2017 on the front of my neck and the back, I hadn't no use for the fit bit because I was in the hospital for four days and when I did come home , I decided let me charge it , it never came back on! No light no not anything, I have decided to return it and let them send me another one or refund my money! I wrote to the insurance company no response called amazon and they send an email, no response called amazon after three days of waiting on a response, Amazon emails a hen again, finally got a response and the response was ASSURION returning my fee of $12 what I paid for them to insure this company's product is GARBAGE and the Insurance ASSURION is TRASH too people don't have money to throw away, I am so mad because I had suggested two friends to buy this one the same day I purchased and one purchased the next day, but she send hers back because sh said the tracking wasn't correct! I didn't believe her, I should have send mines back for that .
 Gift for my lazy husband who refuses to exercise.  He wears it every day and has begun to realize how little exercise he gets. I think he is going to walk more so that he can accumulate more steps and get more exercise.  I will let you know if that happens!
 This was a gift. My son really likes it.
 While happy with how this device works for the most part, after only a little over a year, the band broke off of the screen on one side. There always seems to be some issue that forces a new purchase. On my last model, the charger was awkward and actually broke off forcing me to buy a new one. Lastly, at times, the unit "freezes" and does not record steps.
 I love this device.  It took the place of my Samsung Gear watch.  So far it has been much more accurate and the battery life is superb. The only down side is the lack of set up instructions with the product.  Fit Bit wants you to go out to their web site to get them and then to set up their app on your phone.  Had a hard time learning how to challenge friends to fitness competitions.
 I could not get the Fitbit Charge 2 to charge or to power on.  I connected it to the charger, pressed the power button, held it for a few seconds and nothing happened.  I allowed the Fitbit Charge 2 to stay on the charger over night, still nothing. I did this process several times before returning it.  I am disappointed.  I really wanted to keep my Fitbit Charge 2.
 I know it is mostly will power and desire to better but having this device gives you encouragement and makes you want to do more! Including inputting my water and food intake -  kind of makes me feel more accountable to my life style! The receiving of messages from my phone added bonus!
 I've had it for a week and I absolutely love it. Of course you have the cheats where you can swing your arm around and get a step count, but I think if you're willing to spend $140 bucks on this device you wouldn't cheat. It has a harder time reading my BPM when I'm sweaty, but that is warned and suggested to move up your wrist. Sometimes I have a hard time opening the screen when I lift my hand, but I just twist my arm again and it will light up. Minor, MINOR problems I'm having. Overall happy with my purchase.
 It was fine but only 4 months after warranty expired it just stopped working altogether. When contacting fitbit they said they cant fix it, its not on warranty so there is nothing they can do. They offered me the same discount everyone is getting for mother’s day. Im never buying any fitbit products ever again.
 PRODUCT IS TRASH. TOO HARD TO SETUP...YOU MUST HAVE A NEW DESKTOP/DEVICE OR IT WONT WORK. I WOULD HAVE GIVEN THIS PRODUCT A ZERO IF I COULD HAVE. NOT USER FRIENDLY UNLESS YOU ARE A COMPUTER GEEK.
 I returned it because it would not read my heart beat correctly, or would not read it at all.
 Love my Charge 2 Fitbit! It does everything! Even in my pocket, it keeps tabs on my stats! I feel lost if I ever forget it!
 After just 35 days my Charge 2 has a crack in the screen and Fitbit refuses to replace or fix the product. The customer service is horrible!!! I will never own another Fitbit product.
 I’ve ordered 2 Fitbit charge 2s. Both, within a month or 2, no longer connect to my phone. I wear it high on my wrist and keep it dry. I’ve wasted so much money on this product, very disappointed
 hated!! it just doesn't work! shows the heart rate wrong (if im working out and my heart rate is on 170 or more, it shows 120 and sometimes doesn't show nothing at all). And, just now, not using the watch it was showing 110.. then, when i put it back, it didnt show for a while.. really not what i expected.
 After wearing the Fitbit for a couple of hours, I found my wrist was sore, even after loosening the band.  Also, I though the online instructions were difficult to navigate. I spent a considerable amount of time trying to learn how to switch the clock face and could never figure it out.  I would have tried calling customer service but the wrist pain meant sending it back anyway.
 I bought this due to the customer reviews, however within a several weeks it stopped working. It will hold a charge and that's it, it will not stay on. I have tried resetting it, restarting it, nothing works. I would not recommend this to anyone. Find a more reliable fitness tracker.
 Great for tracking activity, diet and other aspects of health.  It's good to keep me motivated and works for me.  I would recommend it to people who are motivated to life change and want a tool to help.
 I love it, it does need to have the back sword down with rubbing alcohol daily. If it get slightly smudged it doesn't pick up all ones steps.
 Good Fitbit, but not as many features as I thought. Definitely better than the original Charge HR. Once went to a friend and she was ecstatic.
 Well I love this product until the battery died. The Fitbit died in December of 2017 just 11 months after getting it.<br/>I just got around to calling for support in May 2018 and they told me the  warranty  Has expired. Now doesn’t this just suck!
 I actually bought this for my dad and he loves it.  In fact, this thing actually saved his life.  While out shoving snow, he saw that his heart rate jumped up considerably before starting to feel bad.  My mom rushed him to the hospital and he had emergency surgery that night.
 Got this for my girl , she loves it a lot .
 It simply doesn't work. I purchased two.  My works most of the time.  My husbands doesn't register flights of stairs correctly. Both of ours has stopped buzzing when texts are received and phone calls come in. Doesn't always register active minutes. Have only had since Dec. 25. Not happy with them.  Was very excited when we first got them when I realized how much it could do......but it actually didn't fill the bill.
 Love my fit bit. I'm not to techo savvy and this was super easy to set up. I love seeing my steps and tracking my sleep patterns. The breathing exercises are fun as well. I would definitely recommend this product! It looks stylish as well, with the rose gold accents.
 I have been looking for some time for a heart rate monitor that I could wear on my wrist and not spend a fortune on.  I was excited when I received this, but the feeling soon faded.  I will say that for the purpose I purchased it for, monitoring my heart rate, it has been right on the mark.  I had hoped to enjoy all of the other features though, for the amount I was spending.  My large disappointment is the step tracking.  It would appear that the swinging motion of my arm is how it determines steps.  So, I can walk around and none of the steps count if I'm not swinging my arm (who does that all the time?).  I can also have steps counted that I never took, if I happen to be moving my arm.  I did 3.25 miles on the elliptical machine and my charge said I'd only gone half that distance so obviously the steps were not counted correctly.  This all means that the calories burned are not going to be anywhere near accurate either.  I'm not sure if I'll be keeping this as I don't know if it is cost effective for what it does.  I will see if any adjustments can be made for counting steps before I make a decision.
 This is the first Fibit I purchased and I'm really impressed at how it tracks everything with the Fitbit app that you download on your phone. A couple of things that I don't like are if your arms and wrists get really sweaty from working out, the heartbeat monitor sometimes doesn't record properly. An example is when I am on the elliptical at the gym, I use the provided heartbeat monitor on the machine itself. At the peak of my workout when I heavily winded, my hb would be around 165~175 which the elliptical will display. My Fitbit would sometimes read 90~105. Perhaps its highly dependent on how tight it is on your wrist, but I noticed if sweat gets between the green LED's and your skin, it will skew the reading. However, this can all be fixed easily by wiping your sweat off and continuing your workout.<br/><br/>Other than that, I think this Fitbit is amazing for it's purpose and really helps you get on track with being fit (with the app). If you purchase this Fitbit, Ir recommend purchasing a screen protector for this. If you have any extra phone screen protectors that aren't made from tempered glass, you can easily trace an outline with an exacto knife and save yourself a few dollars.
 I bought this as a gift for my wife and she loves it. She had the previous Fitbit Charge HR and all her gripes with the old one were addressed with this new model. Plus this new model has text and call notification which is great!
 I bought this as a spur of the moment gift to myself to celebrate getting a new job but, it works way better than I thought . I use it every day it does so much and is a great tool and encourages me to move and be active !
 will be returning for a different fitbit because it's too large and the sensor makes it stick up to high, however notifications do not work on the tracker as well as the heart rate tracker is off. unsure if this is the device or all of fitbit, i will surely find out with the return of this one and the purchase of a different model
 Love my Fitbit charge. We bought one for my boyfriend and one for myself. Love the changeable bands and larger screen. My only little issue with it is sometimes it does over calculate your steps. Not a big deal to me though.
 I've been using Fitbit for almost 2 years now, I started with the Charge HR and now this - I am DONE with this company.  My charge HR crapped out a few times but I got replacements for it under warranty, once the warranty ran out I decided to try this one.  Several tracking features didn't work. Sleep tracking was completely inaccurate, distance of my runs was way off.  I've messed with the settings on this to no end, adjusted stride, sleep sensitivity, reset the device, reinstalled the app, etc.  Contacted tech support with the list of things I've tried and they had nothing else for me.  They agreed to send a replacement which I got yesterday.  The replacement is just "cpu" if you will and does not include the band, I have no idea how to take the band off the old one and put it on the new one. Just one more hoop to jump through in getting this crap to work.  Bottom line is these people can't seem to produce a reliable device, and sending replacement after replacement is not a solution.  Make something that works!
 I am a para parapelegic that can't benefit from all the features. I still find it helps with my heart rate . I hope to find more appplications and hope the mmanufacturer will continue additional R &amp; D and  not forget the wheelchair population.
 Love it. I never realized how sedentary I was until I saw the proof through this Fitbit. It encourages me to move more and in just over a week I have lost almost 8 pounds. It is a great motivator and it honestly makes me motivated to make better choices (park farther away at the store, take the stairs instead of the elevator, etc).  I also love the sleep tracker feature.
 I bought this product in March of 2017. I've been a Fitbit user for many years. This is probably my fifth Fitbit.<br/>It died in May of 2018 after fourteen months. It's out of warranty and the best Fitbit will do is provide a 25% discount on a new device. They used to stand behind their products. Every company has lemons, but there are MANY instances of this happening with the Charge 2.
 Seems awesome so far - actually beyond my expectation. I use it to monitor my heart rate and for that it is perfect. Also funcitons as a great watch. It is a bit bright at night when it comes on....but thats a detail.
 So many improvements. If you're reading this in 2017, this is the best health/weight tracker.
 Fitbit is not accurate..it will count steps even if you are just moving your hands..I returned it and got an Apple Watch instead.
 The classic black band is of a very low quality. Ended up replacing with an aftermarket due to their warranty department being hard to work with. Hopefully, their Product Design department is better than their Warranty/Customer Service department.
 Will not sync with Galaxy S8 phones. Customer support states "we are working on the a fix"
 Just a warning for anyone wanting to use the heart rate monitor when exercising.  It's wildly inaccurate, off by 30-50 bpm!  It works great when at rest or just walking around the house or work but at the gym it was useless.<br/><br/>That being said if you don't need or don't care about the heart rate monitor during exercise, then it's great at everything else it is designed to do.  Monitoring your steps and the sleep tracking is really cool.
 I like being able to track my activity. It really prevents me from being completely lazy. I liked it even more when I bought a different wristband. :)
 Having issues with syncing.  Not sure if these FITBITS on AMAZON are the real deal.  Sent back.
 Love it. My first fitness tracker ever. keeps me focused on my health and activity. App is simple to use in a dashboard. Delivery was fast and the product was exactly what i ordered. set up was easy and it is fun. thumbs up
 Great activity tracker. Good value for the price. It has been inspirational in motivating me to lose 30+ lbs. Also love the sleep tracking and ability to see your statistics easily on the app.
 Very disappointed in quality. A week after I purchased it completely stopped syncing. I tried to reset it several times but to no avail. I use it only for daily stats, but am unable to even do upgrade. It starts  to upgrade and then dies out. It looks nice and is easy to use on my wrist that is why it earns a score of 2 stars, am seriously thinking of the Apple Watch 2,as I have never had a quality problem with Apple products
 It's an awful amount of money for something that only last 8 months, but I did love it while it worked!
 This Fitbit is a huge upgrade over my original (non-HR) Alta. I've only had it for a couple weeks, but it's great.
 Ok so I really loved this watch, I loved that I could go walk n have text notifications n not have to dig into my bag. BUT after about 4-5 days of wearing when I started to sweat I noticed my wrist hurting, like hurting so bad I couldn't even turn it. The pain was right where the watch is like on the bottom part of my wrist (in the veiny area) and up my arm.  This freaked me out and I took it off and haven't really worn it again bc I've been reading similar reviews. The pain took 2 days to go away. And i am a mom of 3 and one is a baby and I could barely hold him with that arm. Super weird, so I'm not taking any chances with radiation or whatever things r being sent thru my wrist and I'm returning it. 2 stars bc I did love it, I had the original one and this is def an upgrade but not if it's bad for your health. FitBit we need one like this that's flatter and not radiating bad things into our body! Oh well
 The device cannot catch high HR correctly (compared side-by-side multiple times with several devices like resistance-based HR monitors of cardio equipment or Polar H7). It cannot monitor sleep phases and there is no smart alarm.<br/><br/>But it lives on my wrist for six months already. I don`t like to wear anything, but this device definitely found the right place and usecase with me.
 Good looking, but painful to wear :(<br/>Heart rate monitor seemed to dig into the top of my wrist even when it wasn't strapped on tightly (ie. at night).<br/>Too bad.  Hope the Alta HR works out, as it has (almost) all of the features of the Charge 2.
 Got for his birthday! it is light weight, works well. highly recommended.
 It’s counting steps when I’m not even wearing it. Apparently, I walked over 36,000 in my sleep. Who knew? I’ve tried the tips I found online to resolve the issue. Didn’t change anything. I understand there might be some discrepancy but 36,000 steps worth? I’ve contacted Fitbit directly. Hopefully there is a fix for it. Will update my review if they do.
 Love it! had one of the earlier model Fitbits and hated that the bands couldn't be changed when they went bad. these give you so many choices on bands at great prices. also battery life is about five days between charges.
 I ordered three of these as a gift. It works perfectly !!! Such a better price on here than Best Buy and it works perfectly.
 Where all day to motivate me to move more. I work at a preschool and wad afraid it would either be to bulky or to dainty, but it's great.
 Piece of crapola.  Very disappointed  -- it only lasted a few months and stopped working.
 I love this.  Loved my old one, but finally killed it.  Ordered the new one and the different way charger attaches fixes what went wrong on the first one.
 Felt a little disappointing to see that this fitbit was not counting my steps. I did several tests, restarted it, updated it and still had the same problem. I double checked all settings and everything was correct, but even after all that it still doesn't count steps properly. I had the Fitbit Charge and it worked 10x better then this one. Never had a problem with it. I went to the Fitbit community to see if someone else was having the same issue and there are many many people with the same issues.
 Great product. Would have given it 4 stars (5 if water resistant) but only deserve 2 stars because of Product quality issue. See the middle of 3 in the picture for dots that wouldn't light up.
 My wife is very happy with her new Fitbit Charge 2.  I own the earlier version of the Fitbit Charge from a year ago and the new one has better features and the screen is bigger so it is easier to read.
 Did the research on wearables based on needs and current experience of previous types/different devices. I really like this one.<br/>Ordering/receiving/packaging of the product was flawless.
 This FitBit has a nice display and integration with SMS messaging, plus good battery life.<br/><br/>BUT the HR monitor works best when at rest. It is very inaccurate when actually excercising (off by 30-40  bpm).<br/><br/>Took me a week to convince FitBit that there was an issue, and then they agreed to an exchange. Unfortunately they use FedEx Ground and wont send replacement until they receive original, so shipping time is almost 3 weeks from East Coast.
 I especially like the new charger. I accidently pulled my last fitbit apart trying to disconnect it from the charger. That won't be a problem anymore.
 The full functionality of this watch stopped working only a few months in. Doesn't track detailed sleep or heart rate. No solution from manufacturer.
 Amazing product!!! My wife loves being able to see messages on it.  And the endless possibilities for after market bands is where it’s at!!!
 I haven't had any problems with my Fitbit for the few months I've had it now. It's a wonderful device for tracking my fitness and helping me keep track of staying active. I've gotten it wet a couple times and although the sit doesn't advertise any water resistance it holds up well against accidents under the sink and rain. Don't plan on getting a different fitness band anytime soon
 I had the flex 2 for 2 years before upgrading and the Charge 2 is amazing. The heart rate monitor is accurate and the relaxation option is very helpful. A great purchase for someone who is slowly becoming more active.<br/><br/>Only trouble I've had was figuring out how to connect the charger when I opened the package. The fitbit comes already connected to the wristband and is not charged.
 This model has lasted me longer than others in years past. I wear it everyday, basically as a watch. Nice to have, it gives me motivation from tims to time.
 Couldn't be more pleased with this fitbit...  particularly like the heart rate and sleep information.. amazing1
 I love my fit bit charge 2. It makes me motivated to move more, especially to walk up the stairs more. I like that with this one you can change the bands. I also love that you get notifications for texts, call and calendar notifications. I use these settings for work. It reminds me when I have meetings. I have also had great experience with fit bit customer service. I had problems with a previous fitbit of a different style and they sent me a brand new one. I'm glad I made this purchase.
 I do not like the sleep pattern option.  If I sit still too long it records as sleep.  When I get up in the morning it does not recognize that I am awake when I take it off to shower.
 When I got it the step count was so off. I called the company and ran some test and replaced it. It took awhile for the new one to come in and it was a little better but not much. Also I always have the worst time getting it to sync with my phone and it is always disconnecting. And I never get my notifications.
 Great product. The wrist-band is a bit hot when running so if you are exercising you may want to look into a lighter band but overall I've been very happy with it.  Sleep tracking is surprisingly accurate on wake up time - I've tried to 'fool' it a few times and haven't been successful. :)  When it comes to the app - it seems to be hit or miss for people I know but for me it's been rock solid.
 Loved mine, got one for my wife.<br/><br/>She is a bit competative so now she is exercising with me and my numbers are up too.
 I use this all the time and it's super helpful in keeping track of my fitness. I would definitely recommend this as I have never had any issues with it. It also has a great battery life!
 I previously had the One and the Charge 2 blows it away! Everything is more automatic as it's already on my wrist. I love the heart rate function and how it monitors peak exercise. Oh, I did set up in under 5 minutes-including the update! Best Christmas gift ever!! I lost 40 pounds with the One; can't wait to have the charge 2 hold me accountable and see what 2017 holds!
 Great product.
 I absolutely love my Fitbit 2. It does exactly what it is supposed to do. I have never had a problem with it. I never take it off except to shower. Nobody better try to take it away from me.
 gave some as gifts this year at christmas. One of them wouldn't sync to the phone. he called fitbit and they walked him through the fix. very satisfied
 The charge 2 is great. Has most of the functions you would want. I would like for them to upgrade it with a gps feature while keeping the same style. I am disappointed by it's construction. I wear it constantly and they last around 1 1/2 years before the screen cracks or something breaks. Also, why isn't this water resistant??? That can't be too hard.
 Love love love it. Stairs count is off, like way off. Counts stairs when I'm on the treadmill for example. But I don't mind that function. Step counter is pretty accurate but if you shake repeatedly or wash you hands aggressively it counts steps. It's for reference, not exact. The app is the best part for sure. The sleep tracker is AMAZING! 10/10 would buy again.
 This is a fun toy.  I don't rely much on the calories burned or even the heart rate.  It does keep track of calories consumed if you are honest with it.  It works with either Android or Apple, but it won't synch with both.  The best thing it does, for me, is remind me to get up every hour and move around.
 My wife's fit bit 2 work well for six months now it does not work at all can't even get it to turn on not real happy
 I would give it 5 stars. Although I have had it about 7 months, never dropped it, hit it on anything, etc., it randomly cracked at the edge of the display and bevel. Not sure if it's a pressure/humidity thing or just quality control issues with the screen itself, but it's a shame it couldn't have lasted longer.
 it's great. Exactly what I needed for this price.<br/>2 issues - band has bad quality. lasted 3 months until I had to buy a replacement. A couple of times it disconnected and fallen so I almost lost it.<br/>The screen is quite easy to scratch, so I recommend you to buy a protector.
 it does not pick up my steps right away.  I can walk around the room 3x before it registers.  I do a lot of walking all day but it doesn't show it at the end of the day. I do like the sleep recorded, that can be interesting
 Very comfortable and I really love how it looks. Not suitable for large or XL man sized hands. The bracelet doesn't completely open and you need to slip your hand through the loop.
 Here's y it's better:<br/><br/>1. You can see ur hourly steps out of 250 on ur watch.<br/><br/>2. It's made better. The plastic around the screen &amp; button that always breaks, most likely won't now.<br/><br/>3. The screen is brighter, bigger n there r more adjustable notches in the band.<br/><br/>Here's y it isn't:<br/><br/>1. It's a little bulkier and a little heavier.<br/><br/>2. It's more sensitive. My Charge 1 tracks my steps very accurately. My Charge 2 tracks my hands motion very accurately. So u could hit 10,000 steps brushing ur hair, sewing or b4 u even get out of bed in the morning ;) It's funny the 1st time but if u depend on an accurate # of steps, u gotta take it off for a lot of hands on stuff.<br/><br/>Additionally, pushing a stroller or cart at the market etc gets u nothing. Since ur hand is steady it doesn't count ur steps. Some ppl r okay w that saying it balances at the end of the day but I walk around the store way longer than I brush my hair so for me it doesn't balance at all.<br/><br/>If I went to the store today to buy either 1, I would probably still get the Charge HR 1. The accuracy is better and  it's lighter n smaller.
 I love lists and this and the dashboard App it came with are helping me with my new lifestyle.  The step monitor is not perfect but gives you a great idea of what you have done for the day!
 Birthday gift my daughter loved it never takes it off I’ve purchased 3 and out of all of them broke not this one it’s the best give only the best!!!!!
 I love it can see texts on screen once, but its okay and whos calling on screen and everything else is awesome💜
 I love the features and the accuracy but after only a few months of gentle use the band is coming apart...I have talked to several of my friends who have experienced the same thing
 Love the Fitbit Charge 2. Finally a well made item at an affordable price. Has so many "bell &amp; whistles"! Would highly recommend. Seller also gets high rating... shipped it out quickly and received it perfect condition. Did take the extended warranty... always do with electronics.
 I love my Fitbit. I wear it 24/7 except during showers when I usually also charge it. The battery lasts a long time and during the time I've owned it I've never had it die on me before charging it. I feel like it is real accurate showing pulse, sleep, steps and so on. I use it as an alarm clock in the morning and the vibrations on my wrist are so much more pleasant to wake up to than my other alarm clocks.
 Upgraded from the original version of the Charge HR. This has some great new features, such as detailed sleep analysis, reminder to move, and different clock settings. One of the best features is being able to buy different straps to easily coordinate with clothing, or replace worn straps without having to purchase a whole new Fitbit. Easy to set up and sync with your app on your device. Very happy so far.
 One of my main reasons for getting a FitBit was the heart rate monitor.  I had a health scare with my heart about a year ago. The heart rate monitor gives me a way to correlate how I'm feeling at a moment against my pulse rate. That does not mean I am using the information to avoid a major health issue - it is simply a way for me to make possible correlations with my health.<br/>I am not a very naturally driven person so I felt I needed something to keep me accountable. FitBit has revealed what I already suspected - I'm not moving enough. But how much more did I need to move? That's where FitBit has helped tremendously. On a number of occasions, in order to reach my daily step goal I only needed to go for a twenty minute walk. Other days, as a homeschool stay-at-home mom, I simply cannot get in as many steps because we sit for school or our day is so busy. There is no way to fit in a long enough walk to make up the steps. But that's ok. It helps me to see those short-comings and think about other ways to exercise my heart or how to make a way to get more time carved out for a walk.<br/>I haven't used the other features much yet. I am making healthier lifestyle choices bit by bit and don't want to be overwhelmed by entering calories or knowing my sleep patterns. In time, I hope to use all the features on a regular basis.
 upgraded to this from the charge HR and couldnt be happier, i love how the straps are replaceable (the reason i had to get a new fitbit after 2 years) and the you get so much more info on your wrist.... Love it :)
 I love this Fitbit Charge 2.  I basically wanted it as a reminder to get up and walk and to keep track of my steps.  Awareness is the key to healthiness.
 Love it, no problems with it. I’ve had it almost a year. Easy to charge stays charged for approx. 5-6 days.
 Gift for my husband.  He loves it!  For a busy hardworking guy it works great!  Holds up for yard work or with a band change goes with a work suit!!!
 This is the first Fitbit I have owned. My only complaint so far is that it won't sync with my phone because it is "too old". I have a Samsung Galaxy S3 which still works perfectly well and suits my needs - except the version of Android it has apparently (according to Fitbit customer service) and the current version of the Fitbit app don't work together. They said I would have to contact my phone carrier about updating my Android version on my phone, which basically means buy a new phone. I had to use my newer Kindle Fire to set up my phone and to sync it. The Fitbit app on my phone does show updated info after I have synced with my Kindle. It would just be simpler if my phone did it, I don't always have my Kindle with me! But I am not buying a new phone until I have to, so I will live with it. Also, I couldn't set up the Fitbit using my laptop because I needed a dongle - yes, my laptop is "old" too...I swear all techs have a conspiracy going that makes up have to upgrade even if we don't want or need to! Anway, other than that so far I haven't had any real issues and hope I don't. I have been using this item for almost a week now.
 After my daughter set this Fitbit up for me it has worked wonderfully.
 purchased as a gift
 After over a month of wearing it 24/7, other than showering, it has accurately registered steps, sleep, and heart rate. Sometimes the heart rate sensor doesn't register but this is mainly because of improper placement on the wrist. The notifications are noticeable in my opinion and the alarms are very useful.
 Does not properly track heart rate while exercising. That's the main reason I purchased it. What a waste of money.
 Love the Fitbit Charge 2. Came quickly and works even better than the first Fitbit
 Been using the charge 2 for about a year and a half was working great, but since the last update I haven't been able to get the Fitbit to sync with the Android phone app, hope they fix soon or I will have to look at other brands.<br/>Update:<br/>Called tech support yesterday, and they helped me solved the sync issues. So I'm giving the 4 🌟, hoping it won't happen again.<br/>Thanks.
 Girlfriend loved it. Got it for a great price on here and like all fitbits, they have good reliability
 I love my Fitbit Charge 2 fitness tracker, but the Fitbit forums have a problem with scammers!  Women are not safe in their forums!  Unsuspecting women users are deluged with "Romance Scammers", and although we have complained, Fitbit hasn't done anything about it!  It's  problem!
 Pros:<br/>- Small and comfortable<br/>- Easy to use<br/>- Nice simple display<br/>- Has just about everything you would need and the apps break down your workout nicely<br/>- Great battery life (2-3 days)<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- The screen will scratch<br/>- It does not have its own GPS. You will need to workout with your phone in order to accurately track a workout distance.
 I LOVE THIS WATCH! I have a garmin, a polar, a tom tom and a moto 360. The Fit Bit Charge 2 is the best. The battery is unparalleled. The software is the best and I will never go back to the other watches. I love it.
 Wow Fitbit 2.0 upgrade. From charge HR to this new charge 2. High recommend this. Replacement bands, five day battery,
 Actually really love this. Its not water proof but thats alright. It tracks my sleep and breaks down the stages which is exactly what I was looking for! Tracks bpm, RHR, and keeps its charge for quite a while. Only gripe is that sometimes when Im sweaty the sensor wont pick up my heart beat but its literally only sometimes. 9/10 would recommend if youre looking for the above.
 It does what it says it does. My husband wasn't a believer until I bought him this. It's waterproof and it tracks swim so that was a winner for him since he loves to swim.
 This has been very fun to wear and use.  I have increased my steps and I pay attention to my activity level so much more.  Fits my wrist well and I like how it is fairly waterproof.
 Got this for a Christmas present for my wife.  She seems to love it, especially with the bigger screen than the old model.  She has begun using it for sleep tracking, and is happy with the reports from it.
 Purchased Charge 2 to replace FLEX that lasted several years -- FLEX will no longer charge in it's thingy.  Looking forward to catching up with my friends steps!!!
 Love the new Fitbit, but the wristband is larger than what I've been used to.  So if you've had a Large in the Alta, get the Small in the Charge2.  I made it to the very last clip.  So be very cautious on which size you're buying if you're changing Fitbits.  Otherwise than that - - can't wait to start using this during my Zumba classes :)
 I like it, aside from the fact that the band broke within 6 months.  I contacted Fitbit and I still don't have a replacement band.
 I had this Fitbit for just over a year, and now it won't turn on anymore. I liked it while it was working: the HR monitor was a great feature, but it is not worth $100+ if it only pays one year. I will probably look into a different brand for my next fitness tracker.
 Perfect tracker for me. Love the continuous heartrate, sleep tracking (now with stages) and floors. The app is first rate, everyone loves the app.The more I use it the more I love it!!!
 It works great.. The  glowing lights is an issue at the night and during sleep.Especially those sensors underneath the device they emit light. I am hoping there is a way you can stop the lights.. I still havent figured it out
 I love this fitbit!  It tracks my steps, shows my heart rate, texts, and incoming calls. I use it everyday and couldn't live without it now. Only downside is the band gets dirty pretty easily since it is a light color.
 In short, the heart rate monitor just doesn't work well.  The step counter is great.  The app is mostly good.  But as a fitness tracker, this falls short.  When I bought it, I just was tracking steps and looking at heart rate occasionally out of interest.  Since then, I dropped over 30 lbs and got a Concept 2 Rowing machine and want to watch my heart rate more closely to ensure what zone I am in and that sort of thing.  I am up to 30 minute rowing exercises.  This thing has tracked my heart rate exactly once for the entire time.  The last 3 sessions it works for about 5 minutes and then the "not reading" symbols.  At about 10 minutes into the work out, it comes back on and gets up to about 120 to 125 bpm then blips out again.  Then at about the 15 minute mark, it reconnects and says I am at 70-75 bpm (a resting heart rate).  It pretty much stays reading the rest of the time at the 70-75 range.  The entire time, I have been rowing at about 24-26 rows per minute (2:35 / 500 meter)  At the end of my exercise, I have done 5700 to 5800 meters of rowing and as I get up and "walk it out" the monitor part suddenly gets out of its 70ish bpm daze and goes OH, Your at 135bpm or some such thing and tracks me mostly until I am fully cooled down.  So, it seems to me, its a resting tracker more than a fitness tracker - since it doesn't really track for poop during fitness, but tracks pretty good during cool down and resting!<br/><br/>I have contacted Fitbit via their chat.  They "understand my frustration" or "hear you" and all kinds of flowery words, but in the end, all they did was direct me to how to put it on my wrist.  I've of course read that already.  I've put it from 1 to 4 fingers from my wrist.  I've tried others suggestions and put it on the bottom side of my wrist.  I've put lotion on the contact area.  I've cleaned the contact area.  I've done the "charge/reset".<br/><br/>In the end, the frustration around trying to get this thing to track and stay tracking is high.  So if you are thinking of getting this for the heart rate monitoring, I really would suggest against it.  Get a real heart rate monitor.  Use the fitbit for what they do exceptionally well and track steps with it only.<br/><br/>Regarding other features, they mostly work as advertised -- sleep monitoring works when heart rate works mostly, so don't expect exceptional results except for the point I made earlier that they track resting pretty good, just not fitness.<br/><br/>And for me, if fitbit can't track heart rate on the $140 unit as advertised, then I ain't gonna spend more for their "better" monitors no matter how flashy.<br/><br/>Anyhow, my 2 cents.  I really just want it to do what it says it does, but it doesn't do it well enough.
 Great product.. Was a gift from his list.. Love the HR monitor and sleep pattern. Bands are easily interchangable.
 I love it so far. I find it to be a little uncomfortable but, thats probably because I hate wearing things on my wrist. I also find that I force myself to get up and take more steps since owning it, over all I love it
 Bought this to keep track of my heart rate while exercising. Had an Alta previously, and was OK with that.  My only objection is that if you wear it to bed to track sleep, it lights up when you move your wrist in a certain direction, which is disturbing if you are a light sleeper.
 My first Fitbit was a charge HR. When it died, I decided to try the charge HR 2. I've been using mine for 4 days now and the battery is at 40%. I like it. I like how easy it was for me to change the band. I like the notifications when I am getting a call or text. I didn't give it 5 stars because of the vibration feature. I can barely feel it and can't depend on it to wake me up like the Charge HR did.
 So far I love this. Tracking workouts, sleep, water, food..... The only issue I have had is that the band (rubber) has started to separate from where it connects to the fitbit.
 Like that the watch itself is small simple an practical. Anything more complex can be accessed through the app. It is a great help in being more aware of your lifestyle in regards to your health and a motivator to be healthy. Recommended, especially to those whom don't actively consider how lifestyle affects their health.
 I love the FitBit Charge 2.  It tracks my exercise, sleep, heart rate, etc.  I used to own a FitBit ZIP but found that I kept losing it because it was so small.
 I love my Fitbit Charge 2. I was skeptical at first after reading reviews, but I've had zero issues with it! It holds a long battery and tracks my heart rate during work outs and counts my steps pretty accurate to my other step counters. I highly recommend.
 Love my Fitbit!  Easy to use, love being able to monitor my steps and heart rate and also check my battery level!
 Stopped keeping track of steps
 All of my family  wear theses fitbit's it really does motivate me to get up and move or go for a walk.
 I wear this daily...its great and I love it!
 Wasn't as dark purple as seen above so I ordered another magnetic band which I like better
 I love love LOVE this Fitbit!! I had the charge hr first and switched to this one about a year later and, let me tell you, it's a major upgrade! If you're having any doubts about getting this model, just do it. I promise you won't regret it!<br/>Oh and the interchangeable bands is an awesome feature!
 I had bought a cheaper version of a step counter and was so disappointed.  I decided to go ahead and pay for the FitBit because I had heard great things and I am so glad I did.  It has so many features and is so accurate with steps, sleep, heart rate, everything.  I will never wear a different brand, FitBit is it!
 Bought as a gift, so didn't get to personally try it out, but the recipient is thrilled with the item and is utilizing all the features the fitbit offers.  It's working as described--no complaints at all.
 I was really excited to get this for my dad as a gift and when we received the Fitbit charge 2 there was no charging cable :/ the box for the cable was empty. So there is no way to charge it.<br/><br/>Update:<br/>Sent Fitbit an email got a resolution with in 72hours and free of charge. Product is also really nice and comfortable
 I love this product! Such a good buy. The band lasted just under a year but the replacement was only about $7. Highly recommend!!
 Product strap connection point broke after 2 weeks of use.<br/>Screen scratches easily had 3 scratches before strap broke.<br/>Not water resistant,<br/><br/>Bought the wife one as well, hers is still works but has several scratches.<br/><br/>I have traditionally had Polar products and have never had an issue, wanted to try out the wrist based heart rate.
 Bought this for my mom.  Perfect fit.  She is 84 and she loves it.
 Bought it for my sister as a birthday present and she loves it. Sure the heart rate might a little off, but it gives you a good reference and step counting has been perfect. It gives you a good overview of how active your day has been.
 The metrics this thing tracks along with the app take all the legwork of calculating calorie intake/burn along with analyzing macronutrients. Automatically tracking my sleep is also an amazing feature, I didn't realize how many hours of quality sleep I am short of each day. Amazing work Fitbit.
 I'm new to the Fitbit family and I love mine so much! Works as described and has def been a motivator for my health journey. The challenges with your friends makes working out fun and motivating. Glad I paid more for the lavender rose gold series, I love it!
 Does lots of things. Love the activity tracker and asleep tracker. Also pulse info is great. Thanks AMAZON you rock. Thanks for help on refunds on other items. I will probably order anther watch for my wife.
 Very painful deep in wrist lots of complaints on line must be an issue with this Fitbit!
 Works like it says, set up was easy and easy to follow directions. fits great, size small fits like it should. linked to smartphone well.
 Got it on sale black Friday and I'm very happy with it. It holds a charge well so far about 8 months later. I love how the price i paid for it is still a deal compared to what it's priced now 8 months later considering how technology/pricing often work.
 Love it. Love the notifications for calls and texts, and prompts to move. Sleep and heart rate analysis truly beneficial.
 This has really done great! It's great for keeping up with your heart rate, steps and exercising. Along with the App keeps up with sleep and calories burned, much above what I considered.
 Bought it for my wife because I wanted something that was easy for her to use.  Off to a bad start.  No user instructions. She had no idea how to set it up, so I jumped in. Fitbit locked up on the battery screen after charging.  Can't reset the device without having it hooked up the charger - just plain dumb. Thankfully the reset worked. Now tapping is a problem. Sometimes it takes 3-4 taps on the edge of the screen or the edge of the case, and light taps don't seem to work at all. My wife is frustrated with the whole tapping process.  Chatted with Fitbit support.  They were very gracious and helpful, and they said they would send out another Charge 2.  Hope it works. My wife is presently an unhappy customer.<br/><br/>Received a replacement Charge 2 on 12/29/17. Very good customer service completely offset by poor quality.  The replacment unit did not work. Will never buy another Fitbit product.
 Very Easy to install new Band on Fit-bit Charge 2.
 Haven't even had this item for a month and it is already not charging... SMH... And it was not cheap
 I guess it’s ok if you just want to track your sleep or want to have an estimate of how many steps you have but when it comes to using it for running all it’s good for is keeping track of time since the mileage and the pace is completely off the heart rate is never actuate either
 I would not have bought this but for the great reviews and the fact that my Flex died of unnatural causes (run over by a car). The Charge 2 seemed to offer many more features in a relatively small design. It did 'offer' features, it just doesn't deliver. Slept is the issue. Start times are off most of the time. And sleep stages has worked exactly one time since I've owned it. I have been on chat and on email with Fitbit support to no avail. Done multiple things multiple times, but still no stages and times continue to be irregular unless I do a manual start-step, in which case stages won't record anyhow. I have given up.<br/>Tried in vain again today to get some help with the sleep feature, again with no success. Back to try this, read that with nothing new. Still maintains rate of inaccuracy reported previously, no real help/solution forthcoming. Will no buy or recommend another FitBit product - EVER! Would have based on the FitBit One.
 Very impressive device overall.  Battery lasts upwards of one week.  Heart rate sensor is very accurate (I have compared to Polar, etc).  Step counter is accurate.  Sleep metrics are very useful too.
 I had the charge for a year, and decided to upgrade finally. I wouldn't have any other fitness watch -- it is the best!
 Finally received order from Amazon. I am very pleased with. Product having a hard to download the software for fitbit to work
 I received my fitbit on December 29th 2017. on December 30 2018 it just quit working. no reason, no abuse. I basically leased it for $12.42 per month.
 Purchased for a gift basket. Arrived as expected and came in tact. The winner loved it!!<br/>I would order again.
 My daughter loves this.  This one will sync to her phone, has a watch, and will also display phone messages on her Fitbit (which I didn't know it would do).  This is the one to get - 2017.
 Overall is a great fitness and every day tracker, but it lacks multisport modes which is a great flaw. It also lacks connection to google fit and only syncs steps and sleep to endomondo which isn't enough for me. I think i'll switch to the Garmin Vivoactive HR. The app is awesome.
 I love my Fitbit.  It meets my needs.  I like the trends and statistical information that it provides.
 This is great. The size is even perfect. I bought this to replace my hr2. It was size large and tight, this is size large and I actually have tons of room. Also great with tracking.
 Bought this for my husband for Xmas.  I like it better than my regular fitbit.  A bit bigger but it looks more like a watch.  Lots more info on the display.  He loves it as now we can compete on number of steps!
 Bought it for the wife. She has skinny wrists and it's almost too big. She likes it though and that's what counts
 I like it, bought some extra bands, very comfortable to wear! The only thing I'm noticing is basic arm movements I believe it's counting as me walking....I am going to give it some time to see if it's just what it's doing or if I'm walking that much I'm a office manager and didn't think I walked that many steps while at work lol. But do like that it shows me who's calling and when text come through! Going to definitely give it a few days and see what happens
 Great battery life, wildly accurate with my workouts and heart rate. I was between this and the Alta, and the Charge 2 (same price) was DEFINITELY the better option!
 I received it.  It would not charge.  So didn't work or set up.  Contacted Fitbit-took weeks and got new fitbit.  - hah looks like its the charger which they didn't replace as it still won't charge.  Oh wait its charged for half hour and it shows sliver of battery,  its probably going to be returned
 Bought for my husband and he is very happy with it.  Wears it all the time, great features to encourage staying active plus lets you see who is calling or texting you.  Long lasting battery.
 Good quality and price
 Husband has enjoyed being able to have a constant check on heart rate. Would recommend to anyone that has heart or pulse issues.
 Great watch for fitness. Band separating after 8 months. I like this fitness watch overall. Pretty much does what I want. Cheaper options for the price though.
 I wear it every single day and it has definitely made me become more aware of how inactive I am hahaha. Great purchase!
 The Fitbit Charge 2 does everything that it claims to do. I'm very happy with it.
 I had the Fitbit Charge HR before this. I love the Charge 2. The display is awesome! I am still getting use to all the features! Definitely worth the price! The whole band seems to be sturdier than the previous Charge.
 I wish there were an option for how long to leave the screen on. I wouldn't mind charging every day to be able to have the screen on longer. I want to be able to watch my heart rate without having to turn it on every time I look. I thought wearing the watch would be more convenient than wearing a Pulse Odometer. Otherwise, I love my watch, and love the Sleep Information and Step Goals and Tracker Function.
 I thought it was weird when I slid the box open and the seal was broken, so when I opened the box, the actual product wasn't in there! Just the papers/instructions it comes with. And I know it wasn't the mail carrier because the package it came in was not tampered with. I wish I had read reviews on this product before purchasing, because apparently I'm not the only one who had this problem. I was very disappointed.
 I love the device but regret buying the lavender band. So far i have cleaned the band as per the instructions I.e using rubbing alcohol in small amount. But for some strange reason one half of the band has changed color and it looks UGLY.
 Love this Fitbit!!!! Bought as an upgrade to original fitbit. Love this one so much more with all the features!
 Have had it a week now and absolutely love it. Does everything I need/want it to.
 After several calls to the customer service line found out the tracker foes NOT work with Win 7 as the old tracker did.
 This was my first fitness tracker, and I was very impressed with its capabilities, but had to return it.<br/><br/>Pros: It really motivated me to get moving every hour, shoot for 10,000 steps a day, map out my walks and hikes. It was really fun to use, at first.<br/><br/>Cons: After a few days, it started losing bluetooth connectivity with my Android phone. I would reset it, re-pair it, and it would work again for a day or two, and then just lose connectivity for no apparent reason. Yesterday I got it working again and went for a walk. It used GPS tracking to record my walk until it just stopped recording a few blocks from home. I can actually see on the app my map of the walk and exactly where it just decided to stop. I spent about an hour with Fitbit tech support to try and get it reconnected, without success. Then they told me that my Moto G3 (2015) Android phone has compatibility issues and the Charge 2 may not work reliably with it. Really??? It works perfect for several days, and then just stops connecting for no reason?<br/><br/>Sadly, I will be returning both my and my wife's Charge 2 trackers. It was fun while it lasted. Very disappointed in Fitbit.
 I received my shiny new fitbit. I bought it specifically for and only for the heartrate function. I am deployed and am doing a lot of training. After a few times in the gym, it appeared to malfunction. The heartrate would begin to DECREASE as I worked out! I took it off and it continued to register heartrate hours after removal. My GF has one and loves hers. Maybe this one was defective. I returned mine and got something else.
 Band was really uncomfortable and left irritation marks on my wrist after wearing for less than 1 day. I did enjoy the "relax" breathing exercises, but not worth my discomfort. The color was nice.
 No matter what I do I cant get my Fitbit to get notifications from my phone. One of the main reasons I spent the extra for this one was so I could get notifications while at work. Disappointed, I should have just bought a generic one.
 I'm a bike rider. This does not work at all when riding. Useless.
 This is one of the best investments ive made. Not only helps with the basics (tells time) but love the heart rate monitor , steps, stairs, distance, reminders, and many more features this small gadget has.
 Love it.
 Perfect for an EMT! My daughter loved it, easy set up, can use on her job as emt volunteer checking pulses etc. , it automatically set up for sleep schedule too, unlike older models.
 stopped working after couple months. would not charge
 I ordered this for my husband for his birthday because he liked the one I had. He is very happy with it and is losing weight by tracking his steps each day.  Great product!
 I like the Fitbit but the wrist band is a real nuisance.  Difficult to secure so it’s not hanging lose.  A better band it would be a 5 star rating.
 I love it.  it does only last about 5 days on the battery but it doesn't need long to recharge.  I've lost 9 lbs since I've been making sure to hit my step goals!
 I bought this product more than a year ago and I used it to keep track of the exercises I practiced every day. However, the clock stopped working about a week ago. I do not know what problem it has, but at the time of loading it does not work. I thought it was the charger and I tried it with another similar charger and it did not work either
 Husband loves it! Sends text/call notifcations. Keeps count on how many steps daily and monitors your heart rate. Only reason I gave it a 4 star is because it says you can get calendar notifications and for some reason it’s not doing that. Either way he doesn’t care much about that so he said it’s fine. He loves it either way.
 I had trouble programming the fitbit from the start.  Then, after I had limited use for a month or so, I recharged the fitbit which showed it was fully recharged, then nothing but a black screen.  It would never turn back on and was impossible to reach it through my phone or computer.<br/>I want to return it but seem to get caught in some loop because it has been longer than 30 days.<br/><br/>Please advise
 This tracker has a nice home screen that is easy to read and allows the wearer to swipe to get to more detailed information. However, it counts steps without moving.  Odd.  after 2 weeks, it died and has just been replaced<br/> We'll see how long this one lasts and if it is more accurate than the first one
 This is been a great activity tracker. I have used the Jawbone Up (it failed within 3 months), the fitbit charge (better than the jawbone but started to come apart after 18months). The charge 2 has an excellent battery life, I also prefer the redesign of the charging method. The charging clamp attaches securely and the unit charges quickly. I also really like the larger screen.
 I love my Fitbit Charge 2!  It really keeps me moving. It is everything it is reported to be and very, very easy to use and care for.  Buy one.  You won't regret it.
 It is everything as advertized.  If This model’s face gets scratched enough to sell a separate protection—why doesn’t Fidbit improve on it themselves.  That way I don’t have to buy anything extra—the protection should come with it.  Just sayin’
 I like the Fitbit charge with a few exceptions. The charge doesn't last long enough. I have had difficulty getting it completely set up. But on a day to day basis I really like it.
 I have had this fitbit for 11 months. The screen has become barely readable. I have only used it for about 5 months of the 11. I am disappointed by how fast the screen deteriorated.  The band also the clip portion of the band broke recently and I had the buy a replacement. I love what this tracker does, but I'm disappointed by how little time it lasted.
 Wish they would have added a feature to see the battery life on the watch. Texts on the screen are more of a gimmick since they are so small. Otherwise a great upgrade from Charge HR!
 Some neat features, such as reminders to move. I like the display of texts &amp; of caller info. The band is quite large, even though my wrist measurement is Size Large. I was concerned that a Small would be too small. A drawback is that the chargers for Fitbits all seem different from each other. If there was at least some standardization, that would be helpful.
 This is my second fitbit and after a year and a half mine has effectively died(original fitbit died after about a year).  It's scrolling through functions and the side button is unresponsive.  I love the product but with these durability issues I feel I need to look at different options for future purchases.
 Now I get to see how poorly I sleep. It’s depressing yet exhilarating. Band broke within two weeks, however but the charge itself still works fine.
 Cool features, motivates me to move and be active more. Having the Fitbit indicate when I’ve walked 10,000 steps feels like fiesta and a pleasant small accomplishment. Very impressed with all this thing does.
 Works just like I expected, thank you.
 Love it, had the charge HR before upgrading to this one and loved it, love how I can see my text and see who's calling before I pick up my phone, recommending as the Fitbit you should buy
 I'm very disappointed in the Fitbit Charge 2. The wrist band is too small for my wrist - it has literally fallen off my wrist on several occasions despite the fact that the clasp was secured. Generally, the quality of the wristband is inferior to previous models - how about instead of trying to make 7 different models, just make a few models well? The sensor itself seems to work OK.
 I guess having it last approx. 26 months was pretty good. Started not keeping a charge and not recording sleep patterns
 Everything is awsome on this. I just wish the battery life was longer but the charger is super fast! So it makes up for it, it's not 💯 on the steps sometimes I can trick it if I want to meet my step goal by shaking my rist in a certain movement but it has helped me so much. It's not to comfortable to sleep with my the sleep monitor itself works really well when u do have it on but I am a side sleeper so that is mainly why overall I love it
 Bought this for my fiancé. He loves his Fitbit! Thinks it manages his life, lol. He definitely monitors the weight, food, steps and all the stuff on the app.
 This Fitbit has everything that I was looking for. I can sleep with it on and I don't feel a thing. I have an advantage of seeing what I need to do to keep myself happy. The Fitbit charge 2 is perfect for anyone who wants to make a new year resolution to stay healthy. I recommend this Fitbit over all of the others. It look so gorgeous on me. Thank you for those who created this Fitbit.
 Great device. I first tried the Fitbit one but kept loosing them (3).<br/>I bought the Alta but later I realized it did not track the floors climbed and walking on a treadmill.  The  screen is too small to see without reading my glasses<br/>I purchased Fitbit Charge 2.  Convenient size, tracks floors climbed, and the band is easy to remove.
 Love it! Highly recommend. Great fit.
 I like everything about my fitbit except for the fact it counts false steps when you are in a car or driving..so I never know my acually steps..for a expensive device I'd expect it to be more accurate.
 I wanted to use this product to keep a count of my steps throughout the day.  In addition to my steps, the device also counted my hand claps and hand waves as steps. I'm really disappointed by this product and after receiving the email to rate the product, I realize that it's too late to return it. Wish there was a little more time given to do this.
 Good item for the money.
 I don't like that it isn't waterproof but other than that it is an excellent product.  I recommend getting the little screen protector stickers for it.  I am rough on mine and do what I can to make it last longer and not get all scratched up.
 Loving the Charge 2 FitBit! Keeps me accountable as well as gives me a notification when I'm getting a call or text, tracks sleep patterns, heart rate, soft vibrate alarm, and more, plus all the other things Fitbit is known for.
 I love this thing.  It tracks my steps, my heart rate, exercise and sleep. The latter which I've been told the Apple Watch doesn't do.  Unfortunately, I have to take off a star for the plastic band. I had to take it off today because its a hot day and it felt slimy and itchy.  I need to bit the bullet and order a leather band for it.
 I gave this to my husband for our 35th anniversary.  It took him a few days to get it to work because he does not have a cellphone.  Apparently, it needed a Bluetooth connection.  It works just fine now and he's pleased with its performance.  I occasionally use it while I'm sleeping to see how many hours I actually sleep, along with the breakdown of deep REM sleep, etc.  A great gift and wonderful for an engineer such as my husband!
 Its nice but didn't work, I had to send it to fitbit to have it replaced
 Works great, this is my first FitBit.  I've had some issues with the HR being inaccurate during strenuous exercise, but this is a known issue.  I really like the insight it provides into my fitness and the online portal and app are really nice.
 Sometimes it works as it is suppose to....another time it will stick and not count steps at all.  I will have to take it off and repeatedly plug into the charger before it will start working right.  So for the price it should work better.
 Came on time, actually quicker than original deliver date.<br/>Package was not damaged, everything came as described.<br/>Day one &amp; two of owning the fitbit has so far been great. I got the small. Fits perfect.
 I love my fitbit! I would like a little more accuracy on steps and heart rate but the tech just isn't there yet. Still better than my son's off brand.
 Product never worked even after taking it to Best buy Geek Squad where they told me that the battery was defective and never hold held a charge and I was not able to program it
 This is my 5th fitbit. First time with the charge 2 but love it!
 Left the Apple watch in the drawer and replaced with the Charge 2. The only thing I miss with the Apple watch is the ability to take phone calls. Other than that the Charge 2 does everything I need.
 If you already have an account with Fitbit you will save a lot of time and aggravation by setting things up by connecting it to your computer instead of a phone or pad. So far I love the look and functionality. I will come back later after I use it for awhile.
 Bought a less expensive off brand first, ended up returning and buying this name brand. Well worth the ease of charging, app use and quality.
 Wonderful. Need to strap it to your shoe if you use on tread mill. It doesn't see to record on tread mill or when pushing a cart in supermarket. That being said, it is great.
 Really nice product. Does everything I needed. My workouts and sleeping habits have changed using this device along with the fitbit app by analyzing. I like the reminders on the fitbit to keep moving.
 Call and text notifications do not work. I tried all “ work arounds “ online and still not working. Very frustrating when you purchase a product that promises options but those options don’t work. Won’t purchase another Fitbit
 Watch is less than a month old and won't hold a charge for more than 1 day. Am going to file a return with Fitbit to see if they will honor this product.
 I have loved my Fitbit in the past,  but this one was defective because the bands wouldn't stay attached,  so the screen was scratched.  I finally bought cheap replacement bands, shouldn't have to do that.
 This was a Christmas gift for my wife. She loves it. It's like the card that she never goes anywhere without. She didn't have a difficult time figuring it out which is a definite plus. I did see the price for less at local stores, as a Christmas special, after I purchased this one.
 I absolutely love this fitbit! I've owned my fitbit for five months now and don't have a single complaint. The battery lasts for several days, but does drain faster the more I turn the screen on. I find the tracker to be very accurate when measuring distance/steps and sleep. However, the heart rate sensor is occasionally off due to my not wearing the band overly tight.
 I finally upgrade and so glad I did!  I can get so much more information and feedback from this model than my One.
 This is for my wife.  She returned a Garmin Vivosmart 3 and kept this one and likes it.  She walks every evening after work to reach her "steps" goal.
 To Sum up the watch, it is: Accurate, Durable, Good Quality and within budget in-comparison to other similar products/brands available in the market.
 Battery nearly dead after only 6 weeks. Request for replacement denied. Waste on money
 My favorite part is the sleep analysis. Breaks down how my sleep is and gives little suggestions on fixing it. I thought the small would be too small but it fits perfect. Thankfully the Fitbit website has a measuring tape you can print to see which size you are.
 Used another fitness tracker for two years and loved the technology but the hardware was lacking.  The Fitbit Tracker's band prevents the issues I had with my other Tracker.
 Love it! I recycled my Apple Watch and got the Fitbit and it’s so much more accurate.
 The first review I gave was blasting this product as terrible. I couldn't get it to sync and Fitbit tech support is a joke. I found out many, many other people were having the same issues with this tracker and I was a little irritated that I hadn't seen that first. So I returned it. After doing a lot more research on other trackers, I kept coming back to this one anyway. I decided to roll the dice and re-order one and see if I had better luck.<br/><br/>The second one has worked flawlessly. It needed a software update right off the bat, which also went well. I've been happy with the performance and fit, and it does everything I need it to do. I was concerned about leaving the bluetooth on all the time because it drains my phone battery so quickly, but I found out that it's not necessary. You can sync it later.<br/><br/>The only trouble I've had is getting it to sync with MyFitnessPal but, from what I've read, that's a problem on MFP's end and not the Fitbit.<br/><br/>As long as you're lucky enough to get one that's not defective and doesn't sync up on setup, you're good. This is a solid product that does exactly what it's advertised to do. It's unfortunate that it's not more water tolerant, because I use it as my watch as well and often forget to take it off when I'm doing something outdoors.<br/><br/>*UPDATE*<br/>After using this for a few weeks, I've noticed a few things:<br/>- it's pretty easy to get heat rash under the regular band. I'm assuming you could purchase a replacement of a different material, but if you're out in pretty severe heat, it seems unavoidable.<br/>- apparently off-roading on really rocky roads causes it to count steps. It makes sense if you think about how the Fitbit records motion, but a little frustrating nonetheless.<br/>- getting a screen protector is probably a necessity. I bought a pack along with this purchase and have scratched it up a little - I can only imagine what it would look like had I not decided to get a protector<br/>- the heart rate meter can be a little uncomfortable. In order for it to be accurate, the band must be on relatively tight, which might dig in to some people's wrists. It bothered me at first but I got used to it. I'm still not entirely sure I trust the accuracy of the meter itself, but it seems to be better than some other products I've tried.
 I gave this to someone as a gift.  the feedback is great!!
 Perfect, i love the fit, and great battery life
 I absolutely love this thing. It fits my tiny baby wrists perfectly and it is extremely simple to use despite its many functions. Great gadget! The shipling and setup instructions were great as well. This is an all over great product!
 this makes me want to move. like that it notifies me when I have calls and text messages
 Ive had the Surge, two Jawbones, and the Nike Fuel. The is my favorite. Easiest to use, comfortable to wear. I used to like the Jawbone app better but Fitbit has really caught up.
 Delivery was really fast.<br/>The product is really satisfied.<br/>Battery time is a little short.
 Band always comes off second one lost first
 It’s all that it was hyped up to be.  I got it for the reminder.  Every hour you get up and move
 I love my Fitbit. It is a great workout tool and gives me insight as to where I need to make changes.
 My grandmother is not the Queen of England but has a flagship smartphone and is also very health-conscious. She says she cannot live without the sleep tracking anymore. Now upgraded to fitbit versa.<br/>*Fitbit Charge 3 coming soon if you can wait.
 Can't wear it tp work,School Bus goes nuts and add crazy amount of stairs and steps..
 I got this specifically to help monitor my heart rate due to health issues. It is comfortable for 24 hour wear, sleek and attractive, easy to navigate and custom and just perfect for my current needs. Not to mention motivating for when I am well.
 My husband loves this Fitbit. It’s great to track his steps!
 It take sometime to get use to it, but I love it. It keeps me on track. I sit all day for work and the fact that it reminds me to go get up and move is fantastic. I set a daily goal and it’s a chalange to meet it. It’s a great buy for the price.
 The wife loves this
 wrist band broke a few months into my possession.  Fitbit replaced band for free.
 Love this new Fitbit. No it's not 100% accurate, however no device is. I am very happy with the quality so far. Fingers crossed this product holds up better than some of their other products.
 Mom loves it!
 👍🏻👍🏻😎
 not actually satisfied. I have to leave my smart phone on at all times. It show the info on my phone. And will use your data plan, thank goodness I do unlimited data.
 I love this watch. It is awesome and I don't think I would have met my fitness goals without it. Loved it some much I even saved up to get the ionic
 I thought it was great, until the band started getting loose after 12 months. Then the band just fell off after only 13 months of use! Not happy.
 Good quality
 Wife loves it and wears it every day. Bought her an Apple Watch but returned it. She really wanted the Fitbit.
 Girlfriend seems to really like her purple fitbit! The app has had us trying to outstep each other!
 I love being able to monitor my heart rate and steps without even thinking about it.  Plus I love that the heart rate monitor is on my wrist.  When I tried other monitors before they were around my ribs and once I started working out they would get sweaty and slide down to my waist.
 It easy to change bands. Ended up buying new fitbit
 i hadit less than 2 weeks,and i could not get it to charge.called fit bit,and they are sending me a new one with a apoligie.when it was working it was fantastic.tracked almost everything.
 I love this so much. I like that I’m able to switch out all the bands so I can look a little more girly. It’s a little bulky but the bands help. Not very heavy duty my screen is cracked
 I bought this for my GrandFather for Xmas. He uses it everyday and loves it. Since neither of my grandparent's have a smart phone, i connected it to their old IPAD and they don't have any problems.
 I loved it initially. However, the screen is extremely fragile. Mine screen was scratched after only a few weeks. Now, after having it for less than 4 months, the scratch has turned into a crack and has expanded toward all four corners, like a cracked windshield. I don't do any extreme or contact sports. Severe damage like this shouldn't happen to someone who jogs and does yoga only. I feel they are cheaply made on purpose and not meant to withstand any real activity.
 This fitness watch is awesome! The only con I could think of is the lavender wristband is easily stained where it shows black smudges. Cleaning the smudges off doesn't work either so I ordered a black band from another vendor to switch out the lavender band.
 Seems it's not comfortable enough for a non-watch wearer; it spends too much time on the nightstand.
 Bought for my wife as a replacement. Real happy with it. May purchase another band that is more flexible
 I bought it so I could use it in conjunction with Myfitnesspal which the description says it integrates seamlessly with. I had to go back to tracking foods with Myfitnesspal because the food library on Fitbit is horrible. Most food items do not show up. And the exercises done using the Fitbit don't show up on MyFitnessPal. So after going through customer service for both apps, the solution was to use MyFitnessPal to track exercise and food and only use the Fitbit to track steps. I didn't buy this expensive piece of equipment to just be used as a step tracker. Also, it tracks steps and by your arm swings. So if you are walking while holding something in your hand it won't track those steps. And if you have to go up a parking structure it will count those as going up floors when you're just driving up some floors. In order to get away from that you have to download another app that knows when you are driving. Kind of ridiculous to me. And the heartrate monitor stops mid exercises. Go to the Fitbit blog before buying so you can read about all the glitches. It's going back.
 It should be waterproof. Also, the heart rate reading is not accurate. Functionality is very limited and it is not scratch resistant.
 So far so good. after one day with it I like it! useful alerts but not distracting. I like the heart rate and the sleep monitoring.
 It charges 8 hours and dies in 5 hours
 I am really enjoying my Fitbit! I am getting motivated to move more, tracking my heart rate, and also really like seeing how my sleep patterns are. No complaints at all. The website and phone app are handy.
 I love my fitbit! Very useful.
 Usually works ok but the heart rate is ususlly way off, it tells me that my heart rate is way faster thsn it is quite often and at times it does miss steps.
 There is a tooth (not the metal one that comes on all watches) in the band that ensures the excess is secured, which makes it a pain to put on, otherwise I'd give it 5 stars.
 We enjoy our fitbits. But one problem my wife is having on this newest one is that her clasp wasn’t stay locked and the band keeps coming off. Going to see about getting it replaced.<br/><br/>If thing work out, I will update the rating later.
 It’s working well as expected just as expected. The heart rate does go off sometimes but it only happen rarely so no big deal just yet.
 Very helpful in maintaining a healthy lifestyle
 First of all I love having this product and amazon did a great job getting it to me. My issue is the count on the pedometer. I'll check the number and look down as I'm walking and it won't count anything. I like showing my kids the fireworks when I hit 10000 and I have to walk 50 extra steps to get it despite saying I'm 5 away. And no, it doesn't catch up the count later. I'm not sure how accurate this is so it gets 4 stars.
 The heart rate monitor hurts my wife's wrist when she makes it tight enough to get a reading. A week after we purchased this a slimmer version came out. Wish we knew that was coming before purchasing this one.
 I'm loving my new Fitbit charge 2 I love the heart rate monitor and the steps counter as well as the food tracker to watch my calories. I also like the fact that it looks like a watch with a watch bracelet on it here's hoping that this tracker will be a lot better than my previous jawbone and have better durability.
 MUCH improved! After trying two other trackers, I came back to Fitbit. If you want a tracker that just plain works, that's still fitbit.
 Love my fitbits, BUT the one I received is broken. From the first day I got this, it would not even record my sleep -- instead I woke up with 30,000 steps. If I move my hand even a little bit, it records it as a step. Had to go to an actual store and buy a new one. Sad this didn't work out.
 Works great and app is really good also. Reminds you to get up and move. Also get text and call notifications. Can read your texts from your Fitbit.
 Received my charge 2 yesterday and it was working great I really enjoyed it. However I woke up to it this morning ans it wouldn't turn on. Tried to reset it nothing worked. I ended up contacting their customer support and they are sending me a new one. I am pretty pissed that it broke after obly 12 hours of us. However, I really liked it when it was working so I will see how the replacement goes.
 Purchased my Charge 2 in Feb 2017. It is 8 months in and it completely stopped charging. Up until now I have loved it. Regular use, no water damage, never dropped, etc. And yes, I've attached it correctly to the charger. For a $150+ watch I was really hoping for a longer life. Super frustrated and hoping Fitbit or Amazon can do something about this. PLEASE.
 Very Bad Product! Not accurate at all for either heart rate or steps. First off, the band must be kept at almost circulation stopping tightness on the wrist to even begin to gather a constant HR. The Large has 12 holes in the band to adjust the fit. I can wear it comfortably at the 7th clasp hole with no pain or issue but the problem is I need to make it much tighter at hole 8 even 9 at times just to see my HR get into the 120's and stay at a constant level. I've read product guides and online info directly from Fit Bit's website and followed the directions they gave to keep the accuracy going. I have it 1-2 inches down my arm past the wrist and very tight. I would be walking at a brisk pace for an average of 30 minutes each day and I would watch the HR go from 90 one second to 125 the next then down to 105 then back up to 117, all within 2 minutes of checking the stats. The second issue is that it will miss about 40-50% of the steps you do take. Once I calibrated the device I tried it on and took a walk. Just by walking to the end of my driveway from my back porch is roughly 55-60 steps and the Charge HR2 only counted 32. I've now spend a full week wearing it and have been constantly let down with the info I'm getting back. I've gotten to the point where I'm literally counting the steps I take myself just to prove to my wife how off this device is. To anyone looking to buy this Fit Bit, I implore you to please make sure you do enough research. I thought I had but boy was I wrong. I may post one more time in regards to the device when the band finally succeeds in cutting off all circulation to my hand and it just falls off. Very Very Disappointed...
 I used mine to keep track of my steps. I really need to get back to wearing it!
 Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it. I bought a size larger which fits perfectly. It has several notches open to make it smaller in the event she loses weight. Absolutely recommend it for purchase. It was easy for her to set it up also.
 It won't connect on Windows 10 Bluetooth.  Manages to connect on Android tablet, but the application installs and does nothing.  It doesn't work and I'm tired of screwing around with it.
 This watch is life changing! You build a relationship with it over time and it motivates me to reach my fitness goals! You will love it I promise! :)
 I bought this solely to monitor my sleeping patterns and found it to be very inaccurate to the point of being useless. For example it always says my sleep cycle ends 3 hours before I stop dreaming. I don't know how it figures this out but needs lots more work.
 Good Fitness watch, not much you could complain about, except it is not waterproof, and you have to take it off to shower.
 All I have been looking for in a fitness tracker / smart watch: Step count, stop watch, run tracker,  heart rate - messaging and relax mode are additional benefits. Would be great for this to be waterproof and have its own GPS in a future release, though not key for my use cases. 100% satisfied having used this now for 3+ weeks
 This was a gift for my husband, he has a heart condition and wears it almost 24/7 except for recharging and downloading.  It does all that it is advertised to do.
 Top ask of my son for Christmas. Very comfortable on his wrist with plenty of options to keep him occupied. Great color band
 Works great and love that it synced to my phone, allowing me to leave my phone! I think the width is a little too big.
 I purchased this on June 16th and its already not working. The heart rate monitor will stop working and then when it works again it jumps up so high that there is no way Id even be alive, my steps will jump up by 500-1000 with no movement. For the money spent I expect more!
 More tracking info than I want.  Good product but I do not use a good share of what's available
 Love the Fitbit Charge 2.  I had a Fitbit Flex for a year, which was fine, but I really wanted the heartbeats per minute information.  The Charge 2 just has so much more helpful information.  I love the controlled breathing feature!  It is also great in that I can modify which exercise I am doing, bit it running, weights, elliptical.  I would definitely recommend this product!
 purchased for Christmas give for my mother, 77 years old and had scheduled a knee replacement in February, needed to make sure she got her steps in each day, New knee is in and she loves looking down at her fitbit to know what her step count is...she is tickled pink.
 These are a great motivator to get the kids up and moving. I bought my 8 and 11 year old the small versions. My two kids have daily competitions about who has the most steps.
 Its honestly pretty awesome the HR can be off at times during a workout but for the most part it keeps track of pretty much everything love it !
 This is really helping me stay on track, and I am addicted to the sleep tracker. A must buy!
 Purchased as a gift for my sister and she loves it so...now I will have to try it.
 My old fitbit stopped working, so I needed a new one.  This one is perfect and I love that I can change bands.
 Ok but doesn't accurately reflect sleep time, it adds the time when you actually move to get out of bed and that time should not be calculated into the sleep time
 Works as advertised
 Got this as a gift for my mom. Now we all have one. The bands are able to be changed and adjusted as well.
 I had come from a Samsung Gear watch, I really liked the style, functions, and size of my old watch so trying this new Fitbit was a step for me. I am really glad I did. I LOVE THIS TRACKER and the app. I work at a job where I am on my feet for 36 hours in 3 days so it is nice to validate my exhaustion at the end of my work weekend. The functions have, actually, been helpful with monitoring and seeing what was going on with my health. Like I said 36 hrs in 3 days, I hadn't thought about how many calories I was consuming to what I was intaking. Through the app I was able to determine that i needed to up my calories because of how much i was burning; I'd feel horrible and was starving the rest of the week while I was off. I have really been able to balance out so many issues that I was having on top of having fun while doing it. Great fitbit and lots of fun. Do buy a protective screen for it though.
 Works good.Seems to be accurate on step counts after change a few setting. Looks nice on very small wrist. Had to call support. They were great, very easy to talk to. Fixed the problem of not getting notifications.
 Has motivated me and keeps me "accountable."  Would be best if it auto-synced but the heart rate details help drive the intensity of the next work out
 This was my husband's Christmas present.  He absolutely loves it!
 It is what it is
 Great product but for me, it was too large, fits at the 2nd to last notch. Got great customer service to return.
 This watch does not work. I cannot get it to come on. It was on the Fitbit.com/settings screen for a while and would not update and now it will not light up at all (and yes I have charged it 3 times now) no light! I am very upset! I had the charge HR for 3 years and was so excited for this watch and am so let down!
 I really enjoy using my fitbit.  Was having some issues with it connecting with Bluetooth but that got better with the last update.  I walk around a lot at work and it is nice to keep track of my steps and miles while working.  I go out of my way now to get extra steps in.  The only con was not sure paying extra for gunmetal band was worth it.
 Simple device which tells you a whole lot about what goes on in your body, in addition to being a watch and communication device.<br/>- It will tell you how much you sleep every night, down to the minute.<br/>- It will track every heartbeat you take when worn, with high resolution<br/>- It will count every calorie you burn, enabling better decisions for weight management<br/>- It quantifies workouts and provides information about intensity<br/><br/>Charging this thing is a breeze (~10 minutes a day). If you leave a charger outside your shower you'll spend close to zero time worrying about charger. It also will vibrate for call/text/email/news/facetime notifications, which can be turned on or off in one button.<br/><br/>A lot of the value in this product comes with the smartphone app. FitBit does a good job making the data presentable and fast to read. For the price of $120 to $150 this adds a substantial quantity of value to health. This is a solid product.
 Easy and fun to use.
 Fitbit broke after 3 months of use. At first, it was fine and then it broke on 12/6/17. I tried to pop it back in place but it continues to pop back out..<br/>I would not buy again
 Great tracker! My husband and I both got a Fitbit charge 2 and we are very happy with them. This tracker connects easily to both my iPhone and his android phone. The app for both phones is great for tracking food, sleep and progress on a day to day basis.
 love it,  I went with fitbit after much deliberation as there are so many fitness trackers in market in same range.
 Bought this for a friend who is very happy with it. She's constantly jumping up and doing a lap around the house when she visits. It keeps her on track and motivated toward her goals.
 seems to work well except that the notification vibration is so weak that it is hardly noticable.
 Best I've had.
 I absolutely LOVE my Fitbit Charge 2!! It has really made me accountable for moving my body, walking, exercising and just being active. In addition, the Text and Phone Call alerts are incredible! As soon as I get a text, it vibrates and goes across the screen 1 time... and when someone calls it vibrates and shows the name so you know who is calling even when you phone is not nearby! I love it! I can honestly say that besides my iPhone, I couldn't live without my Fitbit!!!
 I like the Fitbit charge 2. Easily synced to my iPhone, easy to set goals and reports, and is comfortable on my wrist. The battery life is good and it charges relatively quickly.
 Nice gift for my mom. She enjoys keeping track of her steps.
 I love my Fitbit Charge 2. It keeps me moving all through the day.
 Needed larger size.  More comfortable but rubber sometimes pinches skin when putting it on and adjusting it.
 Works great, good battery life. Last 6 days on average.
 The watch, when I received it, seemed to be of good quality. I didn't get the time to play around with it too much, because I noticed it was giving me additional steps when I would rock in my rocking chair at home (this is my way to relax after working). In like five minutes of rocking, it registered 500 steps. I'm not saying this is not a good watch, just too sensitive for me. I sent it back and am going to go back to the old fashioned pedometer.
 Easy to set up. Also can be connected to cell phone thru Bluetooth to receive message. A great product...keeps track<br/>of all the steps and different type of activates. It also reminds you to start walking when sitting for awhile.
 The Charge2 was great at first but after a few weeks the device stopped syncing to my phone. I tried the suggestions on the troubleshooting page and they still did not work. The device seems to have lost the ability to connect to Bluetooth. This is the second FitBit that stopped working in less than a year time. Not sure I would purchase a device from them again since their quality is not up to par.
 I think the fitbit is great and I'm so happy amazon recommended it to me! It has pushed me to get more active and I feel motivated to complete my goals. It is perfect for someone who has a hard time getting moving. I also love that it's battery life lasts for so long. I did not charge the device for 4 days and it still had battery! Perfect new watch and I'm sure I'll recommend it to others.
 gift
 It’s nice. It gets the job done and the battery life is awesome. I like that I can change out the bands if I get bored of the current one. The one huge flaw is the face. It gets scratched so easily, which is a big nono for something that’s used in athletics.
 more than i need.......but it's there if i need it......very happy......
 Completely inaccurate for counting steps.  It records hundreds of steps in my sleep - and I've even watched it jump up over 100 steps when I was sitting completely still.<br/><br/>Sleep tracking worked a couple times then stopped working as well.  I am returning it.
 Features are very nice but it was just too bulky. I tried the Alta too and had the same issue. If it was thinner, it would be perfect.
 We purchased two. One would not hold a charge. They immediately sent a replacement. Both work great.
 So far i’m  happy with my new Fitbit Chaarge 2 watch.<br/>But, I am  disappointed in a few things,<br/>The fit of the band, is to big, sits above my wrist and uncomfortable to sleep with.<br/>It is very easy to set up.<br/>I ordered a new band, i’m hoping it will fit better.
 Purchased this for the wife, and she likes it so much I had to get one. Really cool device.
 Great improvement over the other Fitbit models. For a few dollars more they have removed all of the negatives (band, charging, display) With these changes I will continue to buy Fitbit products.
 Long battery life and it does everything I want it to do so I’d say it’s pretty good
 I didn't know about the online database for logging food intake and weight, so that was a nice plus. I feel like my training has definitely gotten better thanks to being able to monitor my heart rate. Unfortunately, the band is too big for my wrist (even on the smallest setting) and often slides up and down my forearm. I'll have to go with size S next time.
 I love my fitbit.  It arrived on time and was reasonably priced.
 The replacement unit that you shipped me works perfectly! I’m very pleased and satisfied with Amazon overall! It was odd that the last unit didn’t work at all but I was made whole! Did you receive the returned unit?
 I replaced by Charge 2 with a Charge 3. The Charge 3 is lousy. Dimmer screen, short screen timeout and no date on screen. Stay with the Charge 2
 Love it works great
 I've had my Charge 2 for about 4 months now and so far, I love it. I switched from a Garmin Vivofit and I'm so glad I did! The Charge 2 is easy to use, accurate, and durable. I don't have a screen protector and I bang my Fitbit into walls, corners, literally everything and it doesn't have a single scratch. I thought I'd be annoyed by having to charge it, but the battery lasts about 5 days and it charges quickly. I really don't have any complaints.
 Purchased this for Father's Day for my husband since he'd commented on mine several times. Liked the "manly" style vs the Alta, has more functionality for him who is more active than myself &amp; great price. Easy to use &amp; sync with your phone as well as other fitness apps. Would recommend to a friend.
 BAND KEPT COMING APART.  YESTERDAY IT CAME APART AND FELL OFF MY WRIST AND WAS LOST.  LOVED THE PRODUCT BUT THE BAND WAS POORLY DESIGNED AND AS A RESULT I NO LONGER HAVE A FITBIT AND WILL NOT ORDER ANOTHER.
 After paying close attention to the other reviews concerning the GPS issues, I trusted that the promised software update would remedy any problems. And apparently it did! I bought this Fitbit specifically for its features and price point. It has not disappointed! It keeps you motivated and challenged to reach your daily goals, I love the little celebrations with confetti and fireworks when they are met! It works seamlessly with the app, and I really like the details for each goal in the app. Sleep tracking has been an added bonus, It makes me just as motivated to get to bed as it does to get moving! Battery performs as promised, I charge it in the car so I don't miss a step.<br/>Having lost 17 lbs. just using MyFitnessPal/MapMyFitness, I wanted to step up the activity awareness for continued results. I'm still working out how best to use them together as it integrates with MFP. Overall, very pleased with this purchase! Highly recommended! Now if you'll excuse me, it's telling me I have to move... :)
 it worked well for a few months and since then the battery needs to be charged daily. SO inconvenient. cant travel with it. Tried everything. updated software, re booted, turned off all alerts but it is getting discharged faster and faster. from 100% the battery drops to 0 from morning to evening.
 Bought it for a friend.  She is pleased with it.
 Burned my arm pretty bad. I had to go to the doctor and contact the Fitbit company. I followed directions and wore it loosely.
 I use it all day every day and love it the charge lasts so much linger than my original
 I've only had this 6 weeks and it won't hold a charge for 24 hrs. I've tried all the suggestions Fitbit gives and nothing helped. Very dissatisfied. Doesn't deserve one star.
 Ok
 Reasonably easy to snap in place (after I watched the U tube video a couple times) I love the Sport Band with ventilation holes in it for use here in sweaty South Florida.  I love the coral color. Much better fit than the generic one I purchased while waiting for this one to arrive.
 I like all the things it tracks and shows you. The only thing I don't like is how high it sits off my arm however I wanted one that has all the functions this one has so that's the trade off from something thinner.
 Unfortunately, it would not pair with my phone or iPad,  That made it unusable for me.
 When on offer its the cheapest you can get around the world.<br/>Works well and no problem. Im happy I dont have to keep charging all the time and can wear it wherever I go, even to sleep. Just not showering since its not 100% water resistant.
 I got this for Christmas and I just love it. Motivation on your wrist. Lots of options with the app.<br/>Small, comfortable and easy to use. I am more active and happy about that.
 Vast improvement on battery life compared to my previous model.
 I have had my fit bit charge for 4 months and it stopped working
 Great heart rate data  big enough to read for visually challenged!
 Love it! With the app I'm never bored. This has lasted and monitors not only my steps and heart rate but my sleep as well. Very nice and glad I bought it.
 Have had problems with this fitbit.  Disappointed with purchase.  Does not sync properly.
 Wish the battery lasted longer.
 My fit bit is not working correctly. It displays me having like 500 steps and then next time you look at it might be three steps and then it might be 55 steps next time it's never consistent. Also there's a crack on the screen. And when I moved from the East Coast to the west The time and date never changed with the time out here.
 I love my Charge 2. It has the perfect size screen and seems to very accurate when counting steps. I also like how it records your sleep and has different exercise modes. The only downside is that the battery only lasts about 5-6 days but it re-charges in about an hour to hour and a half.
 Love, Love, Love this fit bit. Makes me move more.
 Love it. Really makes you aware of how much you're moving. Setup and app are easy to follow. My boyfriend likes the larger design of the Charge 2. I have the FitBit Alta and like the smaller, sleeker design of that one.
 I wear it every day and night.  In addition to counting your steps. it monitors sleep quality and diet.
 This has been a wonderful and perfect piece of exercise equipment.  Timely and so far, accurate.  My wife is actually jealous as this one does more than the Alta version.
 Love it, it makes me move,drink water. Shows my pulse rate oh,also tells me the time.
 Love it. Very addicting. Feedback and app are fantastic. Love the sleep insights too. If it were waterproof it would never leave my wrist.
 I absolutely love my Fitbit. I use it daily to track my activity, calorie intake, and sleep habits. It has been a great tool to help with my goal of getting my fitness back on track.
 Works well
 This product is amazingly designed well. It syncs all data to your smartphone wirelessly. It vibrates upon a notification (calling only) with the name of the person if it is saved in your contacts. Otherwise, it displays unknown on the screen. It measures footsteps, stairs, hours of activity, sleep time, the amount of water consumed (manually), and heartbeats (in realtime).
 It's hip and all but the heartbeat tracker is very inaccurate
 Not a good product
 Awesome. Nice improvement over the 1st generation. Love the updated notifications, also the breathing exercises are a nice addition.
 The Charge 2 is easy to setup and use. Hey it's a Fitbit so you know the rest.
 Great transaction. I use the Fitbit every day and love it.
 I do love it but it doesn't always register when I go up and down steps. But I would highly recommend it to anyone who cares about their health
 It has a lot of features.
 I am in love with this Fitbit!! I would like the app to be a little more dummy friendly, but the Fitbit is AMAZING!! It was super easy to sync to my iOS phone. No issues at all. I love the sleep monitoring it does. Love love love!!!
 Awesome watch, counts my steps, and tells me about my sleeping patterns
 so far works very well  if you have a watch to see all activities  and it is readable
 Gift for my friend, she loves it!
 I bought this as a gift for my daughter and she really likes it. She likes how she can get her text messages on her Fitbit. She also enjoys the updates on her steps and exercising.
 Bought it for my for my wife - if she likes it - I like it - Ha
 This was my first smart watch and i love everything about it. sometimes it seems off on the heart rate, but it has a general idea, better if you turn the sensor part to the inside of your wrist when you run gives you a better and more accurate reading.
 Great product.  Daughter loves it!
 I love it. Does everything the original charge HR did and it has text and call notifications. A great workout tracker. I was conflicted wether to get the Iwatch or this but i am glad I picked this one. It has a great build quality way better than the original. exactly what I want in a watch because I don't need something to replace my smart phone but This is a nice companion that adds functions without being ridiculous. Plus it is way cheaper than the iwatch. I would reccomend it again.
 Couldn’t have asked for more!!!!
 I’ve always loved the look of Rose Gold. When I was on the market for a new Fitbit and saw this I instantly ordered it. I love it and wearily it 24/7 minus showering time!
 Not impressed with this. Battery life is phenomenal, but notifications are extremely slow to come through after texts come in.  Tracks fitness decent though, seems accurate. I personally wouldnt buy again.
 My wife loves it.  I paired with her Samsung phone perfectly and moves data to her weight loss tracking software.  It was a little tricky to program but once past that it was gravy.
 I've only had the fitbit Charger 2 for 2 weeks, already making differences in my life, all positive. I'm more active, more aware of my health (very surprised on how bad I was sleeping). Overall great product for monitoring your health. The app is user friendly and nicely put together.
 Doesn’t work. It is stuck on the setup screen. Very disappointed with the product.
 Nice features
 I gave this to my Wife for Christmas and she loves it!!  That's all I need to say
 Bought for my husband and he really likes it just doesn’t tend to wear it
 Love my Fitbit
 My son wanted this for his birthday, and he loves it!
 Love this Fitbit! Stays charged for a long time and has easy to use functionality through the computer or phone. Best purchase of the year!
 Like it, it gets used daily and still going strong.
 This was a bday gift for our grandson. He loves it.
 Worked great for about two months. Now screen won't light up until I tap it four or five time. Getting worried that it will go out completely soon! Other wise it would be great.
 I love this!!!  I connected it with my diet plan via my phone and now I don't have to write anything down, perfect!!!!
 After two lesser models, this one was a huge leap forward! Love it and the charger is foolproof!!
 I upgraded after two and half years from my Fitbit flex to the Charge 2. All I can say is WOW!!  I have not regretted the upgrade. I switched out the band to a more breathable one and it is working great. I know I am not using all of the features but give me time. As always, when I have a question, I receive feedback very quickly.
 I had the original Fitbit charge and upgraded to the FB charge 2. I absolutely love the new features, including the on screen text messages and the inhanced sleep pattern. The new charger seems to be a great improvement as well!
 Does everything it said it would. Sizing is off since there's no medium. I got a large which is a little big but it works. Get a screen protector though the screen scratches easily.
 It’s a nice watch but Fitbit says it’s supoosed to stay charged up to 5 days, mine stays charged for about 2.
 The band broke after 2 days
 Wish I hadn't waited so long to get one of these.  The little hokey encouragments really help and tracking my exercise and water really keeps me motivated!
 I like the band but the sizing was wrong. I measured 8.1” so I got the X-large and it was huge.  I ordered the large and it fit perfectly.
 Works great. Unsure how accurate it is with measurements, but I feel its pretty close. Great way to keep track of activity and sleep.
 please do your research prior to buying the Fitbit charge 2. It gave me an itchy rash on the 3rd day I was wearing it. after the rash appeared, I did some research on this product and found out it is a common problem with others who have also purchased the Fitbit charge 2.  I would not by again!!
 Bought for myself and fiancée as a replacement for her outdated one, they work perfectly
 love it and still using it to now, shipping and packaging was great!
 PERIOD OF USE: 2+ weeks.<br/>REASON FOR PURCHASE: Purchased as a gift for wife who wanted to get fit and track her progress. Bought the black for less chance of "getting dirty".<br/>PROS: My wife loves it. With the wristband + app, she tracks her walking distance, calorie intake, and competes with others family/friends. Charged battery lasts 8 hours. She charges the watch for ~15 minutes while taking a shower and that'll last her approximately 8 hours.<br/>CONS: They still need to make this waterproof. Of every other feature, making this device waterproof something really great.<br/><br/>SUMMARY: I'm very particular when it comes to spending money. I'm 100 times more critical when it comes to buying gifts for other people.<br/><br/>NOTE TO FITBIT: Make this device waterproof or come up with a new line that's made for someone that would wear this all the time in all conditions. Possibly a "rugged" version but of course without adding to the size. If you go with a "rugged" version, I also suggest some type of streamlined band without the metal clasp. Something more akin to the rubber bracelets where the entire piece is (or nearly is) a single piece. Make it so I can wear it rock climbing, swimming, doing yard work, etc. Mark it up $50. There is definitely a market for a more rugged version for people interested in tracking their health/fitness who also don't like the idea of wearing removable jewelry.
 it works, battery lasts a while, and it does what it claims to do.
 I am amazed at what I am really doing on a daily basis! From sleep to fat burning heart rate, I will do the stairs once more to just increase the numbers. A motivator and an informer!
 This fitness tracker is great pretty accurate step count the heart rate monitor lags a bit but catches up it holds a charge for about 4 days for me and is comfortable to wear  the only thing I really am disappointed by is it not being water proof
 Haven't seen another sale price that is as accurate.<br/><br/>Only con is that I really need a second timer for work &amp; the screen only stays illuminated for about 3-5 seconds.
 Wish the battery lasted longer during activities that require GPS to be enabled, such as biking and that the wrist band didn't break after 3 months. It is a great activity tracker overall.
 Replaced the same model I had.
 I love the Fitbit Charge 2. It tracks how many steps I do every day and I can see what my current heart rate is. I love earning badges to see how well I am doing.
 Works great. Love it
 Beautiful!! I absolutely love it!!! The lavender of the band is much more muted in person, which I was a little disappointed about, but it's very sleek and pretty overall.
 I love the size of the band and everything. Had a blaze too big. This is just right
 The coolest thing about it for me is how it breaks down the sleep cycle. What I don't like is that while it recorded 44 minutes of activity today, it did not count that as a workout. I do boot camp/HIIT classes and it didn't count at all. I liked seeing my different heart rate zones broken down on my Charge HR and I'm a bit disappointed that the 2 can't do the same thing. I'll likely return it.
 Love my fitbit , such a great motivation
 I really like this fit bit! I love that I can buy different bands for it easily as well. It's the perfect size for my small wrist. Love it!
 give this to my girlfriend for Christmas and yes loved it and use it all day
 Heart rate monitor horribly inaccurate when working out, doesn't track heart rate above 120 bpm. Wearing a separate chest monitor that says I'm at 180 bpm and the fitbit reads "- -". No amount of adjusting fixes it. I don't even wear it when working out anymore because of how frustrating it is to look at it every minute and see that it's not providing a reading. Fitbit just needs to make a chest monitor.
 This is my first fitness tracker, so I wasn't sure what to expect. However, I've been pleasantly surprised. Thanks to all the positive reviews, it made the decision easier. It has some great features including the ability to track different types of activities eg workout or running etc. I'm not sure how accurate the stats are, but I see this device more as a fun tool rather than serious health aid. The Fitbit app is brilliant, so you get a fantastic experience overall.
 Love! Does everything it’s supposed to &amp; syncs well with iPhone
 Got this for my wife, she requested it. It's really helping her get back into fitness after some medical issues.
 Love it. Has jump started my weight loss regime. Along with the app Lose it in conjunction with the watch I am able to know how many calories I intake. It has inspired me to walk and lift weights and I'm loosing about a pound a week. My goal is to loose 30lbs in about 7months.
 Very happy with this item.
 Just got this product this afternoon. It charging quickly and easy to set up. I have been weaing this few hours and I feel comfortable.
 One Kool Fit Bit, my wife loves it . No one could beat Amazon’s price !
 Doc told me purchase was not required as Fitbit readings not accurate
 Use this Fitbit daily works well
 Wifey loves it.
 A HUGE upgrade over the FitBit HR I used to wear. I love thsi new version. A little pricey but totally worth it. And the possiobility of changing bracellets is amazing.
 Bought for my dad so he could keep track of his steps and activity and he loves it! Uses it everyday
 Absolutely love this Fitbit I have a small wrist so I didnt need something bulky looking on my wrist.  The size of this band is perfect for me.
 Bought this as a replacement to the original Charge HR and it was a great investment! Fitbit really did a great job revamping this product to include more helpful features. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because it is a little confusing to cycle between the menus. Other than that, great product!
 Gift
 Doesn’t show text messages and “counts steps” when I’m driving 😡
 Not accurate for distance at all
 Great little wrist-piece an my arm.  Extensively produced to interact with me at many points in the day (perhaps too many).
 It stopped working after three weeks
 Love my Charge 2! It does everything I need. Monitors my HR and sleep patterns. Gives me gentle reminders to move. The activity monitor is pretty accurate. The bands are easily changeable
 Keeps track of my steps
 I had one of the original fit bits loved that one too.  Having a Charge 2 fitbit, has again given me the motivation to get up and go.!!!  Love actually watching my statsunsteadof going to my iPad.  As i walk, swim or run it will encourage me to keep going just by a tap on my FitBit
 Great product
 Love my Fitbit. Helps to keep me aware of how active I am and my sleep schedule.
 Bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it , so I love it too!
 I LOVE THIS! It has helped so much with my weight loss and water intake. The app is user friendly and I use along with my weight watchers. WORTH THE BUY!!!!
 Not doing what's advertised. It worked at first but now don't get the notifications, etc.
 great product , band did break after 2 weeks
 I just got it yesterday. I like the idea but first thing i can't understand why I am not able to manually reset my steps or miles/km taken. I will play futsal in the evening and want to have it recorded. Looks like this is a problem. Also it will not work with my iphone 4 ( i know but i still have iphone 4) as i need latest iphone firmware to install fitbit app. Other than that im still working on it.
 Stopped working after 2 months
 Bought this for myself and my dad for fathers day ! Packaging was nice and the product worked great. Wish it came with more directions. We just looked up directions on how to set up online . google it.
 This is the greatest product I ever purchased. I have been wearing it sensed purchased it, I lost 26 pounds since June 10, 2018, just walking 10,000 steps a day. Luv it!
 Much improved (so far) over previous product. Quick delivery . Got the protection plan this time.
 Everything excellent!
 I like this because it keeps track of what I am going to help me keep track of intakes and the number of calories used.
 My husband was the proud recipient of this item but he is a lefty and found it to be super awkward since there is no way to adjust or change it to wear on your right arm.  Otherwise, it's great.
 I am using this Fitbit Charge 2 as a motivation and to keep track of my progress because I am running a half-marathon next year with a good friend of mine. So far it's getting the job done kicking my arse into gear and taking those extra steps! 10/10 would recommend.
 I like the readouts...sometimes the heart monitor does not work...but over all I am very pleased with it...I had a tracker for a few years but viewing the stats on it was not as easy as the watch..
 It worked well until 3/26! it would not charge and came up with a battery with an exclamation mark in it. Tried to reset it.  Finally got it to charge and went to bed with it charging. Woke up this am and it is DEAD!  It will not reset at all. ONE DAY late for the return.  Not Happy!  I hope this does not happen to anyone else.
 Ordered this Fitbit for my husband.  He wanted a fitness tracker but doesn't like to wear bulky watches.  He loves his Fitbit, wears it all the time, even to bed.  Great buy, great price, and definitely works will.
 so far so good.  I will update if I have any product suggestions. comfortable.  A bit bulky from wearing no watch or device in past but getting used to it quickly.
 I like it a lot.it gives me the incentive to do more and stick to my fitness schedule. Reason for not giving it a 5 stars is because the synching is not working once in a while. In this case I have t re-start my ipad a couple of times before it synches again. Hope that Fibit will update the app to make the synching process to work better.
 Loved my Fitbit until it stopped tracking correctly on after 6 month.  The date stopped on April 1 and it stopped tracking correctly as well as the time is off.  Very disappointing for the cost.
 Very happy with this product and it has been helping me to control my diet as well as helping me to exercise properly.
 I bought this as a present for my mom she said the setup gave some issues but once setup it worked great. She loves the product as she is big into walking.
 Works as advertised, motivates me to be more active, a solid and useful device at a good price.
 Quick simple original set up. Step by step details on how to personalize. Came already pre charged so I could put it on and wear it immediately. Looks and feels great. Love the second band I ordered. Tons of features. I would definitely recommend and purchase as gifts.
 I like the product. It solved a lot of myths I have about my sleep. It also help me and keep me on track on my diet. However, I would rather buy it at a retail next time. I feel like I was charged more than I expected.
 wife loves it
 Been very happy with my FitBit Charge 2.  Does everything that I need and expected.  Battery life is typically good for 5+ days.  Way Better Than Original Charge (HR) which I previously had.
 Love this product. I wish the battery lasted longer. I have to charge mine every 3 days. I also would like it to be waterproof as I swim often.
 The watch kept giving trouble from the time it has been bought. After charging the screen goes blank and I have to restart it by connecting it to laptop. Finally the device is complete blank and not restarting even after making several attempts.
 I tried the Charge, but wanted to see phone and text notifications as well as track exercise such as weights. Tried the Blaze but it had features that were nice but the face was so huge, I felt like I had a man's watch on. Then the release of the Charge 2, small for a woman with some of the additional features I liked on the Blaze. Thanks Fitbit!
 Wore it everyday for a full year, used it to exercise as well as day-to-day wear. Then one day the Bluetooth functionality stopped working. Everything else about the watch seems fine, it just won’t connect to my phone anymore. Great product, but not worth the cost if I have to replace it yearly.
 Great buy. No complaints
 If you like the Charge HR but want more features, give this a shot. I prefer this it can give buzz-reminders to move each hour and coaches you to get through a minimum number of steps, etc. Also, the display is a lot easier to read than the Charge HR. The only downside so far is that with the Charge HR you could simply hold the button in to start a workout then classify it later in the app as to what type of workout. For the Charge 2 you have to push the button to get to the workout screen then scroll through that to get to the right type of workout then hold the button in to start it. Not a big deal, but worth knowing if you use that function a lot. A definite plus is the ability to swap out the bands to other styles and colors. You can find many bands on Amazon from various sellers. They will all likely work with it but watch the quality level for if the pattern/color will wear off over time.
 I need help! I bought my second Fitbit Charge 2 last June. The band is breaking and I have it taped to the fitbit. I realize these have limited shelf life however I am in hopes in under warranty against defects such as this. I use it everyday and do my share of promoting this product. Can I return for a new one or swap it out?<br/>Thank you<br/>Doug
 So glad I got this! It pushes me to walk more daily. It helps me to see how my heart reacts to exercise, stress, and any type of heart racing thing. It helps to remind me to move more and I like the design it's comfortable
 I originally wore the Fitbit Alta but wanted a tracker that could do heart rate and wher I didn't have to use the app as often to add types of exercise or sleep. I really love the charge 2. It incorporates everything right onto the actual Fitbit so I don't have to use the app. It's not too bulky and I never have to worry about it falling off since the band is like a watch band. It is very secure and easy to read.
 Both my wife and I have it and love it. It is a great motivator, well built and provides a ton of useful information for anyone serious about  attending to their health.
 LOVE LOVE LOVE! Received as a gift for Mother's Day and I've been wearing it every day. I love how it reminds me to get up and move and I've been able to set fitness goals of moving around more. I never realized how little I moved while working in an office job.
 Good tracker. The charging dock needs to be redesigned though - very difficult to place correctly.
 Excellent fitness device. Took one star because you cannot use the stop watch function while tracking your exercise.
 Got this as a gift for my boyfriend - he loves it!
 This registered about half my steps when walking around the house, and almost none when pushing a shopping cart. I tried it on both hands and multiple positions. It may have been defective, or just doesn't work for some people. I've seen plenty of other reviews and forum posts with people saying they had the same issue.
 Like all the features.  Still too early to see how it holds up.  Have been doing a side-by-side comparison to my old JawBone Up 2, which is much better looking (more like jewelry) than the bulky Fitbit, but it doesn't have the features I wanted, e.g., time/date/heart rate, etc.
 This unit stopped charging after less than 6 months. I have had 3 different fitbits in my household and I am a fitbit supporter. I tried to exchange it through Amazon with no luck and then I tried to exchange it through Fitbit and received no response. I have REALLY disapointed that after using FITBIT for so long, now that I have a problem with a unit I have been left with no assistance.
 I think the most simple way to review this item would be to say, if it breaks today... I'll order a new one tonight.
 Gran dispositivo para seguir tus actividad física!!
 Got it for my husband for Christmas. One week in and he still likes it. The touch screen feature is a little frustrating. It takes sometimes 3 taps be for it goes to the next option but he seems to be ok with it.
 After a lackluster purchase of a Bellabeat Leaf, I decided to see what the fuss was about and ordered a Fitbit charge 2. To compare the two would be unfair because while the costs are similar that's about where the comparison ends.<br/><br/>The charge 2 has so many features I'm still discovering. I can keep my phone on vibrate and get notifications on calls or texts on the Fitbit. The screen display can show me my current heart rate and step count which was not possible with the leaf. The reminders and alarms are better understood with the display as well.<br/><br/>While it feels a little bulky (considering I haven't worn a watch since purchasing my first flip phone), it doesn't look so and it's significantly smaller than the leaf and easier to take on and off. The only issue I have with the band is that the buckle is nickel and when it brushes my skin I itch (severe nickel allergy). Although I've been told this can be remedied with purchasing a different band online.<br/><br/>While the charge 2 is amazing and I'm loving it, the Fitbit app itself is a whole lot better than the leaf. I no longer need a separate app to track my walks/runs and food/water intake. It's all there. Step counting is a lot more accurate, and the challenges and community make it feel a lot more doable.<br/><br/>I'm definitely looking forward to enjoying this for a while!
 I've had the fitbit charge 2 for almost 4 months. It's a great buy. The battery lasts me about 6 days. The app is awesome very precise. I have no problems with it and the price is good.
 Size, battery life, appearance.<br/>Work in health care, very useful.
 I like this Fitbit but I don’t like the band it is really hard to get off and on
 Absolutely love it!!! Returned the Garmin Vivoactive and ordered this one and so glad I did!!!
 Already in love. I upgraded from the Fitbit Alta after a year. I love the screen is better. I really wanted the heart rate feature for working out. I love the style. Love that it does stairs climbed as well. I already loved my other Fitbit so this was a good purchase for me. My dad also has one and loves it. I can’t say a bad thing about it
 I love this fitness watch. It will allow me to stop guessing at the amount of activity I do each day and know for sure if I am meeting what I had hoped for my activity level. It feels comfortable on my wrist (ordered the large) and is light weight.
 Band broke in 5 months! But I have it a 3 because the Fitbit itself is still working.  Work on that band Fitbit!!
 If I could give 0 start I defiantly would do that. I bought this Fitbit as birthday gift for my cousin.  However, he charged it the whole afternoon. It still not working. Nothing shows up on that screen. It’s completely not working at all !!!!! But I can’t return it or replace it, it’s already in another country!!!!!!! Don’t by it from here !!!!!!! Worest ever !!!!
 Love this FitBit! Fits well and feels comfortable, but the screen already cracked only after 5 months of wear.
 Love my new Fitbit  it tracks my steps and encourages me to get up and move periodically. Also tells me my heart rate. And gives notifications. It looks great also.
 Haven't used the other heart rate trackers but this one works great and keeps me on track.Great product!<br/>Unfortunately, it's price reduced by $20 6-7 weeks after I bought them, a disappointment :(
 I really wanted to like the Fitbit charge2, and thought that some of the poor reviews I read regarding accuracy might have been a one off situation, but my personal experience confirmed how incorrect the readings are for this item. I sent a message to Fitbit customer service, and was auto-sent the link to their help site, which I had already consulted before sending the message. The step counter is totally off, it manages to read tiny movements when you’re sitting down and being relatively stationary as steps, which also throws off the calorie counter. I primarily purchased this device for a step counter, calorie burn record, and sleep tracker. I am very disappointed at how non-user friendly and non-functional the Fitbit app is as well. I’m glad I was able to receive a full refund. Save your $150 and pick up a different brand/style.
 Bought this for my Mom. She loves it.
 Best purchase of the year! My husband and I got each other fitbits for our anniversary. This will help get us back in shape.
 Upon receiving my FitBit, I liked the easy open packaging. It was super easy to sync with my iPhone. I’ve previously had the FitBit Alta, and I liked the additional functions that this model offers. With my previous FitBit, I did have an issue and customer service was quick to replace the broken piece to get me back on my way.
 I'm learning to use it.  I'm trying to get it to sync to my Weight Watcher's ap, but it keeps kicking out.  I have to dedicate more time to learning how to use it.
 Much better version than the previous one. You can see much more on the screen. Also it is just beautiful on your hand.
 I love being able to track my health. This also pushes me when I'm sitting too long in the office, and tracks my heart rate. This was worth the purchase.
 Absolutely love!! Great all around fitness watch/tracker and highly recommend!
 This Fitbit Charge 2 is a worthy investment.It is easy to connect to your smart phone and it is comfortable to wear. Will definitely be enjoying this.
 We actually wore out a fitbit Charge, so it was time to renew. We like the update to this and are working on wearing this one out over the next year or two.
 Got just what was ordered.<br/>this is the only fitness tracker that makes reaching goal fun with fitbit app all the challenges and competition is great value added.
 This one if for the wife. She is super happy with it. Which means my life is great lol
 Best thing I ever bought. I'm using it in conjunction with weight watchers and I'm down 62lbs. Also had to buy a smaller band for it.
 Exactly as advertised!
 Tracks exercise well and great alerts from phone. I'm a casual exerciser and find this has enough information for me.
 very happy with item, fast shipping
 Great quality
 Definitely worth it to get this. Very user-friendly.  Easy to set up.  Easy to synchronize with my iPhone.  Very interactive.
 my second fitbit... i just dont like that when i rise my wrist it doesnt respond right away... but overall, i love how charge is much better than charge HR
 It's been 3 weeks since I purchased the fitbit. My overall experience is positive. It feels comfortable during the day and night. The sleep tracker is awesome. The only negative I can mention is the heart rate monitor. It does not like extreme workouts or sweat. I have thrown about every type of excercise at it...Insanity, weight lifting, running, HIIT and sprint training. The heart rate works fine while jogging or weight lifting, but during the high intensity workouts, it tends to lose it's mind. If im doing sprint intervals, where my heart rate elevates quickly and reaches the 160's, the monitor will lag behind and still show it in the 120's for a while, then catch up or stop monitoring all together. I honestly believe it is due to the sweat, so I may try some small sweat bands on either side of the monitor.<br/><br/>UPDATE-1 Well it's been about 2 months and the heart rate is absolutely horrible. Dropping this review to 2 stars just because I like the sleep monitor. If you plan on elevating your heart rate above 140 and sweating, you may as well take this thing off....it just wont keep up. Ihave tried wearing it tighter and higher on my arm and with sweat bands on either side of it to help keep it dry. No luck. Very disappointing!
 Love love love it!. so many thing that can be done with this. had the charge hr and loved it but it broke so got this to replace it. love that its not as stiff as the hr
 So disappointed. Just received his in the mail yesterday. Turned it on. Said I needed to go to Fitbit.com/setup. So I did and was waiting for the app to download and the fit bit died. Soon after I plugged it into the charger. won't even charge even after two hours. Then I took it off seeing it only has two charge on the charging when there are three of them on the fit bit. Maybe sent wrong charger? Maybe doesn't work if run dead? Might have to send it back for a refund.
 It's nice that you can change bands but it keeps coming apart at the face. It works well for what I need but would be better if the band didn't disconnect from the face.
 I like it BUT if you have small wrists...you probably will not like the fit on your wrists. My wrist size is a tid bit below 6in. and it had big gaps on the sides.
 Bought for my wife.  She loves it.  Motivates her to walk more &amp; motivates me to walk more than her.
 Good fitness tracker.  Am having problems now with receiving messages, worked at first.  Need to call support, but they are always very helpful !
 So far, so good. I like the large display with both time and steps.  Heart rate monitor is very helpful and seems accurate and consistent. I would recommend this product highly.
 Had it since November '16. Still love it! Good battery life, GPS works great and I wear it in the shower and everyday consistently with no problems. The app is even compatible with MyFitnesspal  (sp?). Just an added bonus.
 The screen went dark almost 12 months to the day of purchase. It still sends signals to my phone and data but screen totally black.
 Works great
 Overrated, wont keep a good charge.
 Great product! I’m still getting the hang of it but I love it!
 Does everything it is advertised to do.  Keeps me going.
 I would rate this higher but unfortunately this Fitbit is extremely uncomfortable to wear.  The rectangular hard shape pressed against my wrist bone when I'm sitting at my desk
 I like my Fitbit.  It is comfortable and durable.  Tech support is very helpful.  They sent me a dongle to connect to my computer for free.  My bluetooth was not strong enough to completely sync.  Now it works great.
 Absolutely LOVE this wrist band ! I brought it in rose gold and it's so classy I've even had both of my managers tell me they want one exactly like mine ! Can be a little difficult to remove the links but once you get the hang of it they come out easily. Definitely buy if you want something classy ! I'm gonna for sure be buying another one when this one starts to go.
 Previously posted that it would not charge.  Cleaned the connector areas, now it is charging.  I usually clean with an alcohol wipe, each time I shower, but must have missed a time.
 I love this thing. It does everything I could want. Heart rate monitoring is my fave. When I am working out or playing ping pong, I can see if I am in a fat burning or cardio zone with a twist of my wrist. The app download is easy. It easily keeps track of my calories, steps, exercise, weight, sleep, water intake. It keeps me motivated. I am in competition with myself. I have had it for a month and have lost several inches.
 Great for counting steps and other but the wrist band has broke twice and when I call Fitbit they know about it and just send you another piece of wrist band that breaks again. Cheap product.
 Had to have it replaced after only 3 months.  It cracked right down the middle!  Fitbit said that it wasn't covered by warranty but the did replace it.
 Very happy with my Fitbit Charge 2. I really enjoy the reminders to get up and move throughout the day. The silent alarm is also a nice addition. I did a lot of research and decided to try the Charge 2. This is my first fitness band so I can compare with other products but I am extremely happy with my purchase so far.
 just remarkable!!!! I am so motivated to add up steps in my challenge of steps!!!
 I am loving this Fitbit Charge2. I have had it for a couple of months now and wanted to wait to review until now. It does everything I need and I really like the app. It works with my Fitness Pal pretty flawlessly and syncs with Apple Health as well. I lift weights and walk as my fitness and it does a good job. The HR seems way more accurate than the Mio Alpha2 I had previously. That one was eventually so erratic at measuring my HR, like dropping to the 70's when it had been at least 30 seconds after a lift that had my heart pumping. I have high hopes that this one will stay accurate based on other reviews, which I read a ton of on Amazon. The Charge2 doesn't seem far behind where my body is, which is a nice plus when you're trying to wait for the right HR before beginning a lift. The band on this did pinch my skin when I would tighten slightly for workouts, which Fitbit recommends, so I bought an off brand replacement and it doesn't pinch at all. You can find them on Amazon for $10 or so. Mine has a diamond type texture in the rubber, which I don't mind because it's comfy and solved the only negative I have found to the Charge2. The sleep cycle is cool and seems accurate and I love that I now get vibrating alarms on my wrist and notifications of incoming call and texts. A bonus that I didn't know I needed, but now can't live without, as a person that takes on call calls and texts and sometimes missed them due to not hearing my phone. I have lost 45#'s of fat and gained nearly 10#'s of muscle, meeting my final goal for health and looking great, in 11 months and I really do think that products like this(and, yes, the Mio, too) made a huge difference in how well I kept on track. I am 44 and a mom of 3. If you haven't used a tracker and you are struggling, I really do suggest trying one that tracks your HR, steps and calories from your wrist, so you can wear it all the time(except in the shower or swimming!, but they do make them if you need that). These things may not be perfectly measured and it may not be important for some folks(I know it's my macros and not my calories burned that gets results), but the motivation provided is immeasurable to someone like me.
 Battery life is shorter than the product advertises, but otherwise, it works perfectly and is very helpful in trying to reach your fitness goals.
 Works great, so much better than our first Charge.  Bigger screen, easier to read, more features, easier to charge and a better price than the original.
 I like this item immensely. Needed help getting started. But am enjoying results.
 Love all the features esp notifications and exercise tracking. It doesn’t show time every time I flick my wrist. Very glad I got a screen protector-since it’s a bit bulky, it gets bumped a lot.
 My wife's a nurse and this is a great multi purpose watch for her on the job. I like that I can send her a text that she can read and keep it moving.
 This has to be, at this point (4 days of use), the best fitness tracker on the market!  Believe me, I'm a skeptical man who does his homework BEFORE making any decisions to purchase.<br/><br/>The Charge 2 HR fits MY need and I didn't have to purchase a more expensive Fitbit or go higher up to another model.  It does EXACTLY what I use it for...I don't necessarily need a color dial to show off in the gym or anywhere else for that matter.<br/><br/>Rest assured, you won't go wrong with the Fitbit Charge 2 HR!<br/><br/>UPDATE (11/22-2017):  I have put this tracker through the paces and it performs top-notch!  I did have one issue last week ... it wouldn't sync for 2 days ... called Fitbit and they resolved the sync problem within 5 minutes it was an LG G2 issue)!<br/><br/>It has worked flawlessly like clock work!  Looking at one for my wife's Christmas gift!<br/><br/>UPDATE (01/17/2018):  It works like it is reported to!  Accurately tracks everything and more via the website and Fitbit app!  It works so good, I bought my wife a Charge 2 HR like mine...she experienced an issue with the battery dying after 24-30 hours...called Fitbit, they ran a diagnostics on her tracker, found it to be a faulty device, sent me a replacement and walked me through setting up the new one and didn't cost a cent!
 Nowhere in the product description or specifications was it mentioned that this product requires Windows 10 to operate. This makes me livid, as I purchased it as a gift for my father, only to find out that it wouldn't work with his computer. He wasn't even able to get past the setup process.<br/><br/>Had it been made clear that Windows 10 was required, I wouldn't have ever purchased it.
 Didn’t work and I’m still waiting for a replacement.
 I love my Fitbit!  I’ve had an Alta since 2011 and needed to upgrade.  I love the wider band and the heart rate info on the Charge 2.  It’s proven to be a worthwhile investment.
 Keeps me motivated to keep moving and meet my daily step goals.
 It worked great for a month and then the display went dim and you cannot see it without stopping every to squint to see it.<br/>Tried the reset and it didn’t fix it.  Fitbit company determined it was working properly and all they can do is give me a discount for a new devise.  Won’t throw good money after bad.
 Nice functions and a huge improvement over the original. The band is not comfortable, I'm still searching for one that I don't mind wearing all day.
 I love my new fitbit-so much better than the regular Charge.  I like that you can change the band and the display is larger and has the time, steps and heart rate together so you don't have to scroll to see them separately.
 love the fit bit charge 2. Will purchase a different wrist band. Looking online for reviews.
 Like fitbit has trouble sinking with app on phone sitting right next to phone
 New in package item. Works great and I would purchase from this buyer again.<br/><br/>Great unit for keeping track of your fitness. Good battery life.
 Had to contact Fitbit customer support which is off shore and had a English understanding problem. That being said they were helpful.<br/>1. This does not come with the Wireless bluetooth dongle. So if you are going to use this on a PC or mac you need to contact Fitbit customer service.<br/>2. The documentation that comes with the unit implies you can use it with the USB charging cable on a PC again, you need a dongle.<br/><br/>3. Fitbit is out of stock on the dongle we are awaiting shipment.<br/><br/>4. Over all the documentation is lacking to get you up and running and after 2 hours I finally called Customer Service, whose number is not included in the doc. You all have to go to the web sight for everything. This product is more geared to smart phones, which we did not have.
 This is my first Fitbit and I love love love it. I usually get annoyed with bracelets and things on my wrist but I rarely even notice it. I love the hourly reminders to move and the celebration after I meet my daily goals. My only slight issue is that it may be over counting my steps, but the company is being extremely helpful in adjusting it.
 I bought this in December and so bummed because it is only March and the plastic part of the band that clips onto the Fitbit device broke on me while I was at work. No strenuous activity caused this and for the rest of the day I had no idea what time it was or how many steps I have taken.<br/>Other than the shotty quality or the band I am pleased with the Fitbit Charge 2
 Bought this Fitbit for my wife last year for Christmas. She loves the display and after a year there are no signs of strap breakdown or any other problems that we've had with previous wearables.  Ability to switch straps easily is terrific!
 Love it still going. Would buy it again
 Love the device itself. It’s awseome.
 Battery lasts 5-6 days, accurate reading of heart rate and steps. Good for exercising, there's a setting for weight lifting as well as running.
 So glad I paid a little extra for the lavender and rose gold band. Super stylish.
 Very informative on health. Keeps me in line with sleep.
 I wear it on my ankle to get a more accurate reading, bought the X large. People thnk I'm dangerous and am under house arrest LOL!!!!
 Easy to use.  Comfortable and durable.
 While this is a very stylish-minimalist tracker, the step counter needs some improvement. I easily generate 1000+ steps when not walking.
 My wife lost her first Fitbit Charge and when I got to get her one at such a good price, it made the perfect birthday gift. She really does love this!
 I got this for my wife as an upgrade for the Fitbit Charge.<br/>This has a better display and most importantly, it vibrates when a text message arrives.
 I also bought a metal band that works great and looks great .  The flexibility of using other bands is a real plus.The heart rate function and sleep function are not always correct. I  also wish there was a stationary bike mode. It is hard to read the display in the sun. but better than others that I have owned.  I would recommend it
 Good quality easy to setup.
 works as expected, helps to keep you on track and a great upgrade from my old one
 Love, love, LOVE IT!! I didn't need the more expensive model and this seemed to do the trick. It gives me the information that I need and very comfortable to wear.
 This is a replacement for the one that I broke.  I love the Charge 2.
 Love.. love the added features with this Fitbit, my favorite is the coaching to get up and move to get the 250 steps each hour. Such a small motivator can help
 I boug this as a hearthate and sleep tracker.  It works great for that.  The step counter is not great. It counts steps as i drive and on bumpy roads in the hills it counts flights of stairs.
 Worked good for 5 days, now it won't reconnect to my phone, junk.Plus these people want access to your e-mail, don't like that.
 Enjoying having a Fitbit again and the new features since my last one!
 Good
 Great purchase
 I have very small wrists and was worried about how it'd look. It did take a bit to get used to, but I've learned to love it. I like the HR feature.
 Nice Watch
 Love it! Love the silent alarm to help wake me in the morning, the sleep log, and the silent alarm to let me know if I have a phone call come in.
 It works very well. Fits my wrist better than the bigger blaze with all the function I need
 It not as great as an Apple Watch.
 I wanted to enjoy my Fitbit Charge 2 Heart Rate + Fitness Wristband but after now losing my second<br/>Fitbit, I am convinced that maybe this device is not for me.  I have now lost a second device due to the<br/>fat that the strap loosens after continued daily wear. I am terribly disappointed.
 Ok. 50% of the time it doesn’t display when I turn my wrist to read it.
 I love it!  My old FitBit Charge's battery would never charge (ironic, no?).  This one is great!  It lasts about 3-4 days.
 This was a gift for my husband and he is very happy.  He got 14,000 steps the first day and he was ecstatic.
 works great, I got it to replace my Fitbit HR that was falling apart, happy that I wont have to replace this one for the same reason because the band is replaceable! I also like the new features, overall Im very happy with it!
 wife loves it
 LOVE LOVE LOVE this. Worth getting times a million but make sure to get a screen protector
 Love it. If you're on the fence, take the leap!
 Great tool for anyone concerned about their well being in terms of weight control and overall health and exercise statistics that are easily tracked with the Charge 2. Highly recommended!
 Love but do wonder if it really captures every step. And sometimes my text messages link to it and sometimes they don't. Not sure why????
 I guess it is a good product but the version we ordered was too large and - after contacting the seller (Amazon / Fitbit) through the Amazon web form - we've not heard back. We ended up with a device that does not fit but don't know how to get it replaced with a smaller version.
 returned, allergic to the band and said I walked 300 steps in my sleep!!??
 Fitbit works great and love using for my workouts. It definitely helps to give you a rough idea of how your body is responding to your general workouts and can be a good motivation tool if used correctly. I would recommend this product.
 So far so good! Good quality. Looks great! No issues yet :) it's really comfortable too, I had an hr fitbit before and the band would stick to me a bit.
 Product stopped working correctly after about eight months. Was told there was a year warranty but when I called they said there was nothing they could do. This is my second Fitbit that has stopped working in less than a year.
 HRM could be better, but I do love the Charge 2.<br/>I had the One before for two years. I didn't think I'd like wearing the Charge on my wrist after years of the One being in my pocket, but I'm forgetting the Charge 2 is there.
 Fitbit freezes on me. Customer service is slow at responding to you. Then when they do get back to you, they want me to record it. I have to constantly charge it. I'm considering sending it back.
 Display is VERY scratched up after only one month of normal use. Very unhappy  about quality. Do not remember this problem with charge
 Bought this for a gift for my daughter and she just loves it and all the information it provides her.  Highly recommend it.
 The charge 2 is perfect size and tracks everything we need it to.
 Great gift for my Wife, she love it and uses it all the time.
 Love it
 Battery life is good; the only problem I have is getting myself up when I get the vibration to move.
 Such an upgrade from the flex I used before.  Love the notifications that appear from my cell phone.  Calendar reminders, texts, etc.
 Absolutely love it! Way better than the original Charge HR I used to own. The problems I had with the wristband constantly falling apart near the face of the watch has been completely fixed now that this one has removable clip-on and interchangeable wristbands. Plus the new features are great.
 I've had my fitbit for a good while now &amp; I love it! I don't wear my watch anymore since this little thing does the same job &amp; more. I like how it prompts me to move &amp; gives me readings on my exercise. I use it @ the gym while taking spin, weighlifting, HIIT classes. Definitely glad I bought it.
 Enjoyed the FITBIT until now.<br/>Now it will not sync to my FIRE HD 8 tablet.<br/>Hope Amazon fixes this problem soon.
 I love my Fitbit Charge 2! You become more aware of your steps, activity, sleep patterns and calorie intake. Makes losing weight fun!
 Doesn’t always give the best bpm during certain workshop but this thing is pretty addicting.
 Bought this as a gift, receiver really loved it. Only downside is if you have a smallish wrist, you may need to order a different wrist strap.
 I find this very motivating.  I had an older version that broke. Love the new features.
 Loving my new Fitbit Charge 2! I'm a first time wearable fitness techie so this is a great piece! I wanted to give a shout out to the company Shopper Jack.<br/><br/>I noticed a lower price stamped on my Fitbit box than what I paid. So I emailed the company asking if they could refund me the difference ($8 but $8 is $8!) and they did!<br/><br/>Great customer service and great product!
 Sent it back sent back the thing it belong too.
 Excellent
 We bought this for my husband as a tool to keep track of steps while in cardiac therapy. He wears it daily. He loves it.  Even tracks sleeping movement too.  Now I want one!
 As a recent transplant recipient, I wanted a device to track my physical activity during my recovery process. I like the ability to see instantly my heart rate and activity as I try to reach my daily goals. I also appreciate the weekly reports and the log of my activity sense I started using my Fitbit Change 2.
 Nice.  It has the features I like and feels comfortable.
 Pretty good so far after 2 months. I wish it can hold its charge for more than 3-4 days. I haven't tried the GPS feature that supposedly connect to your mobile phone.
 Great fit bit. Measures heart rate, steps, elevation. Has a stop watch, time and date.  Paired with fit but on-line. Log food, track sleep, exercise. Great to challenge others to workout.
 Received fitbit yesterday, opened amazon box and the box for the fitbit had already been opened, the watch was missing the usual protective covering, there was a book on how to connect Bluetooth headphones, it was missing the charger for the fitbit and had a different charger in it. I set the watch up for my fiances phone and he is currently using my charger.
 This tracks activity, hr and sleep well. The app works well too.
 I'm still learning &amp; moving. Love the color, BUT colors from other fabrics or surfaces transfers to band, it doesn't clean easy.
 Absolutely a piece of junk. Wouldn't start up or charge. Returning and won't be purchasing anything from fitbit again. Have had this problem multiple times. It shouldn't be a lottery to see if your item will even work.
 I really love my fitbit....I wish it had GPS though. When I read about it on the Amazon description it said you could track your mileage through CONNECTED GPS. That means you have to run with your phone on you. NOT that the watch has GPS. Other than that I have no problems with it 😀
 Works well and tracks my steps.
 It works great, the battery doesn't last as long as I thought but it still charge it only 2-3 days. The heart rate monitor works surprisingly well, I've had it for a month or so and there's only been a few times where I've looked at it and it didn't have a heart rate for me. I still find new features for it and it gives me tips on how to maximize the features that I does have.
 I lover this thing. I researched many different arm bands similar to this and am glad I landed on this one. Big pimpin'
 I bot this one on Nov 23 2017 in US. One side of the wrist strap kept coming out frequently and was very inconvenient. I had to repress the strap again and again. Now, that side of the strap is broken.Don't know why the quality of the strap is so poor. Do I get a free replacement strap? I am in Chennai, India now.
 My daughter does not get dressed with out the fitbit. great product
 Easy to use. Love the call and text notifications without having to spend the money on an iPhone. Love that the battery percentage is visible. Love this!
 Got it for my dad, he loves it
 I purchased the Fitbit Charge 2 a few weeks ago. I paired it with my Samsung Galaxy S7 edge and all seemed hunky dory for a week and a half. One day the device stopped syncing to my phone. I went to the Fitbit community forums for help and found the recommended troubleshooting steps to follow. I followed all steps. Not only would my device not sync with my phone, but I couldn't get it to sync with any other devices either. I was very happy with the fit, the feel and the overall look and performance of the tracker up to the point of it not syncing reliably.<br/><br/>I could get it to pair with my Bluetooth on all devices (separately, not at the same time) but the fitbit app on those devices wouldn't let me set up the device. The device is useless to me if I can't get the data out of it. I don't know if it was an issue with the device itself or with Fitbit's app, but either way the product was useless to me.<br/><br/>I returned the device.
 Works great! Tracks your heart rate and REM versus light or deep sleep.
 Love
 I love it, I love it, I love it. Heart rate feature is so handy. And the workout tracker is my favorite thing about it because I like to know just how many calories I'm burning. Wonderful product.
 This was a gift for someone to replace the original fitbit charge that was a few years old. Fits great. Very accurate. Comfortable to wear.
 I love my fitbit 2 heart rate, I am an older person, it tracks my sleep, my steps. heart rate etc. What I really like is it motivates me to get out of the recliner and move! It will tell you, lets do 250 steps, lets go for a walk. I am very happy with this product so far.
 Very very accurate, efficient, beautiful color, very handy, my wife's life changed and for good!! If you seriously want to life a healthy life, buy one of there. Note that it is NOT waterproof :(<br/>I also have one Fitbit and one Garmin.
 Pretty neat device. My wife loves it and wears it all the time. Her only complaint is that she doesn't think the pedometer works right all the time. Idk
 So far it's great! Does everything I wanted it to! I was looking for something I could track my activity a day heart rate in a smaller package.. I have big wrists and it's thick so it sticks out from my wrist a little but other than that the fit is good.. durability wise I work in a factory and hit the face on steal frame of a machine.. only came out with a little scratch..(if I had purchased screen protection probably would not have even scratched it)
 Nice
 It arrived on time and as described.  It was a gift and she loves it, I'm not sure how well it works but it paired with the cell phone app without a problem.
 I enjoy this workout. I purchased this for a charity's Silent Auction to benefit wounded soldiers.
 What an improvement over past fit hitsy
 Love, love, love!!!
 Love it. Purchased to replace my Zip. Love that you can change out the band. Had it about a week now and no complaints.
 Band is hard to get on/off due to heavy rubber.
 Easy to wear; gives me the data  I want for my healthy lifestyle.
 So far so good.  I like the unit itself and the Fitbit site synced with my cell phone,
 There really is no reason for you not to get this.  If you have gone so far to reading the reviews just get it, you won't be disappointed.
 Great until it stopped working after 2 months!
 A lot of people have issues connecting the Charge 2 to their Fitbit account. Fitbit will typically send you a dongle if other solutions do not work, but even then it's not guaranteed to connect. MAKE SURE THE FITBIT BOX HAS NOT HAD THE TAPE CUT. If it's cut, it's a Fitbit someone else sent back for not working. That's the issue I had. Waiting on a replacement.
 Overall it is good. Sometimes the notifications don't get to the fit Bit very quickly or at all.
 Love Fibit Charge 2. Have had it for a little over a month and couldn't be happier with it. I am 76 and have been working out for almost 40 years and this is the first time I can check my heart rate while exercising. I also am impressed with the sleep function. Very informative.  My favorite device beside my iPhone. I highly recommend the Fitbit Charge 2.
 Terrible Band Links.
 Works great and keeps track of my steps, sleep and heart rate.  Design is simple and easy to use.
 Only one of the BEST items I have ever purchased. I literally wear it everyday and everywhere (except the shower...)
 Works great and it's very easy to set up and use.
 In the last year I owned both a Charge and Charge HR; I managed to ruin the bands on both within that time. I purchased the Charge 2 Special Edition in Gunmetal (all black) so that I could pair it with a gold band (without having the gold clash with the silver on the side of the FitBit). I like it a lot so far, and I'm sure that the ability to switch bands will come in handy. The only change I'd like is for text message notifications to display the entire message instead of just the first 40 characters. If they upgrade that feature then I'll be very pleased.
 Love this.  I really like the large display with time and date.  Finally I have something I can use as a watch and for my health.  Fast shipping and great quality.  It has already helped me lose a few pounds and realize I sit too much.
 This is a great fitbit model for typically active people. It has all the functions you need to track activity in a standard lifestyle. It includes a watch, heart rate monitor, stair counter, step counter, calendar, and sleep tracker. When paired with a computer or tab is will give tips and rewards like medals for accomplishments. I don't use the text or breathing features, but I did test them and they work fine as well.<br/>I've been using mine daily since the first week of December (about 3 months0 and have had no issues with malfunctions, and the band still looks like new.<br/>Overall, no complaints at all.
 Doesn't seem to be real accurate. Pretty comfortable and I like the app, it just doesn't always pick up my heart rate which causes it to miss out on active minutes. Also doesn't pick up steps when pushing a shopping cart nor stroller
 I like the text messages and other alerts.  It fits the bill for something like a smart watch but less expensive.  It could be a bit smaller and the bulging back can be a bit uncomfortable at times.  Great app and the heart rate monitor seems to be quite accurate.
 Had the orginal Charge.  Got this one for Christmas and Love it!  I would say the reminder Ms to be more active are my favorite feature.  Still has amazing battery life like my orginal too.
 Don't need to spend more
 I love my new fitbit. The only weird thing it that by the time I get up in the morning I have about 200 steps already. I must be walking in my sleep, lol
 Works very well. Daughter loved it for Christmas. Keeps very good count on everything
 Love my Fitbit, especially how it measures my sleep patterns and how many miles I walk each day.
 Device died after a year of use. Fitbit replaced with a new unit.
 This lil gadget really helps you to push yourself and get some daily activity in.
 This was a gift to my daughter she loves it only had for 3 wks already lost 7 lbs great motivator
 Considering this is a fitbit with one of the biggest screens, you'd think it would be more like a touchscreen instead of a shake-and-tap sort of thing. Because of how expensive this was I'm a bit disappointed. And I do not like the pixel-ly looking graphics and the utter blandness of the black background with boring white font titles. There's about 12 templates that you see shuffling through. Over all, just very meh
 Great product.  Fast charge. Accurate pulse reader. Really helpful for workouts and everyday activities.
 I can sure keep up with what I have been up to.  Very glad I bought it.  Does everything and more that I read it could do.
 Love my fit bit! Very comfortable and stylish to wear! Very accurate with counting steps and activity. More than impressive.
 As advertised and fast shipping.
 I bought this for my husband for Christmas. Surprisingly he is enjoying it and actually using it!
 I found the wrist band almost impossible to change. I didn't like the things on the screen. I wanted time , date, heart rate,steps and millage. Not all the rest.
 Great
 This product does not sync to iPhone 6s.  A real disappointment.
 So far fitbit is great.  Some functions could be easier to use.
 I love this Fitbit — color is gorgeous!
 Great product.  I would purchase again for a friend or recommend.  The functions for exercise and the different workouts are cool and it looks stylish.
 My husband LOVES his early Christmas present. Having fun "setting" it up.
 daughter wears all the time loves it
 It looks the same as the original band on my fitbit but no where near as long or as good of quality.
 My second Fitbit. Terrific fitness tracker but neither lasted a year.
 Love this product. I also have Fitbit alta but comparing the two, i like Fitbit Charge a lot better. It has a heart beat monitor so it allows me to see what my heart rate is during my workout. Band is like a watch band so it stands on nicely so i dont have to worry about losing it while i run. has many different settings like how many steps you took, heart rate, Alarm, stop watch (which i love because it helps during my workout to time my rest), and 2 min breathing/relaxing setting. Comparing to FitBit alta, the screen is definitely bigger and i feel it is an appropriate size. Overall i love this Fitbit and i wear it all the time. i recommend this Fitbit over all the other Fitbit when i weigh in the cost, efficiency, and design.
 Works great and is very comfortable to wear. Only things I would like better is if it was swimproof and had an option to wake me up after it detects I've  gotten a certain amount of sleep (that way I don't sleep the whole day away on weekends lol). And the sleep thing could probably be done with a software update anyway, so that may yet become a feature.
 I use it to keep track of my fitness/exercise routines. It is very easy to program. So far it’s been just what  I expected.
 useful but not very reliable. After syncing the device, my phone and the web dashboard will display different results for activities. The kind of results you might find in a first generation product. Okay for showing trends but doesn't pass the test if you are looking for an accurate record of your activities.
 I don't recommend this product. The return window was too small and the product stopped working several<br/>Days ago. Would appreciate talking to the seller.
 I LOVE my Fitbit charge 2! It has worked amazingly and is very accurate. It's also very nice to have a calming tool (the breathing exercise) since I have anxiety and I also have slight asthma. Helps a lot! The only complaint I have is how easily the screen scratches/ scuffs. Mine got scratched on the first day by something only slightly rough.
 No worth the money. Battery drain really fast do not last how product describe up to give days. I call fit bit company, they replace for a new one even the new fitbit battery still drain. Waste of money.
 Nice size for a small arm
 Wife loves it...uses it every single day!....
 Beautiful and fun! Motivated me to get moving. Wear it constantly and it still looks brand new, even though it's a lighter color.
 Great Fitbit product!<br/>I had an original and liked it.  I love this.  It has everything you could want and connects to my phone for easy viewing of my progress.
 After more than a year, I still love it, wear it everyday to record my steps in walking and jogging. However, their app could be much better than what it is now.
 My wife loves it because it provides exactly the information she wants.  My only question is why does Fitbit's app not seem to recognize HR information that her Charge 2 HR collects?
 Only been 1 and half months since we bought it, then 3 days ago just died! Not charging, no light, no response.
 Excellent
 This is my 2nd Fitbit and I upgraded to the Charge 2 for the heart rate monitoring feature this time. I love it! The upgraded features are awesome. It's very comfortable and good looking.
 After wearing this Fitbit for several days, I started getting numbness and tingling in the fingers on the side I was wearing Fitbit.  When I wasn’t wearing it, numbness went away.  Gave it to my daughter-in-law to wear just to see if there were any problems when she wore it.....she started experiencing the same problems.  It has now been returned.
 Christmas gift for active lady. She loves it and is amazed by uses.
 I’ve been use it for a while and I would get my money back if I could. If you want to track your heart rate during your workout don’t buy this product, sometimes my heart rate is 180 and the Fitbit shows 120, it is a huge difference! I’m very unhappy and I don’t recommend it at all!!
 Would not sync with any device I had. Ended up having to pay to ship it to Fitbit myself for them to send me a replacement. Extremely dissapointing.
 The 1st Fitbit I received didn't work. I got online and chatted with their help/customer service and they walked me through all the steps to get it working. It didn't.  They immediately sent me a link to get a replacement. The replacement works great! I love my Fitbit. It's a little big, but it's just taking getting used to wearing something on my wrist again. The app is great. The alarm, surprisingly, wakes me up.
 Although this Product has some very good functions, you should be aware of a huge Red Herring.  Currently, you are unable to access the times for your sleep patterns (you are instead given graphs to try to figure out approximate times for example Sleep Restlessness.)  This highly important feature for many of us was available in previous versions.  *Check out commentary online.  In normal cases, that might simply be looked at as an oversight by developers.  However, currently Fitbit has decided to charge you around $50 a year for this feature.  Again we have an example of Corporate Greed and lack of values where you pay more and more and get less and less.  If you listen to Fitbit commentary by Corporate Spokeswoman, they seem to be very nonchalant about the whole deal.  Be aware, that Corporations or Companies that go down this path, will in the future probably offer less and less for what you paid for.<br/>My suggestion:  Fly United.
 I love my Fitbit Charge 2. It is easy to use. It helps me to keep track of my exercises.
 I really love my new Fit Bit!  It's fun every morning to check to see my sleep patterns for the night. Then it's really good to see  how many steps I can get in a day, and it really helps to be reminded  to get up and move around if I've  been sitting too long.
 Just ok, in my opinion.<br/><br/>The biggest annoyance for me is that when I raise my wrist to check the time, it often does not light up the display. Also, if you want to check your steps, etc. and have to click on the screen, you often have to push very hard in order to do so.<br/><br/>Overall, would not buy again if I had a choice.
 Wife loves it.  Earned some points with this purchase
 Not enough features
 Much better than Fitbit charge hr.  More data and easier to read.  Higher resolution for sleep analysis too.
 Colour changed/stained a bit over time.
 Got this as a gift from my husband and I love it. Nice and comfortable.
 Thank you
 Product came in good shape and on anticipated date but wildly incorrect in tracking steps and other metrics. Would be sitting on couch and magically accumulate another 250 steps in the process, even after reaching out to tech support and trouble shooting settings. Save your money and avoid the trouble.
 It served OK for ~1.5 years, with occasional glitches in synchronization and notifications. Now the screen gradually went bad (without obvious reasons) and I can only see ~30% of pixels, which makes the device useless.
 I am so impressed with this little electronic gadget! I am very health conscience and the Fitbit has helped me track my fitness. I give it a ten!
 Works great. Just what I wanted.
 I like tracking my food, exercise and calorie in and out take.<br/>  I don't like the Data it uses on my cellphone.
 great tool for staying fit
 Product is as advertised. Heart rate monitor and step counter work well. Although the strap is too small for me nephew’s wrist , an extender worked just fine.
 I had the surge and then the charge and now the charge 2 and love love love it! It's the perfect size and so nice to have the steps show up along with the time just by turning my wrist. I definitely recommend it but I should have got a screen protector
 I love Fitbit so much. I just got it yesterday and I can't stop playing with it. It's easy to set up, the features are great, and i can't wait to start working out with it. The only thing I haven't been able to figure out is to turn off text message notifications at night. I am a light sleeper and the buzz of an incoming text kept waking me up every time. Once I find the answer to that I will be a very happy camper!
 Performes as advertised.
 I have had 2 fit bits in both cases they lasted just past the warranty period and stopped charging. After on year would not hold a charge. I would recommend buying a different product Fitbit was not interested in honoring any warranty after 12 months.
 It’s an awesome investment for your fitness and the battery lasts a good 3 days so better than the last model also the notifications have improved with better range and the motivation suggestions are good too.
 If you think about healthy lifestyle fitbit is a must... thanks to dear mother in law for her great gift...
 i had this it was too big on my wrist i  should of kept it as the fitbit alta hr is nothing comparable to all the other fitbits
 Vendor was great but I believe Fitbit needs to have 3 size selections rather than just 2.  If you are in between you either are on the very last hole or the very first.
 This thing is awesome! I love how it keeps track of everything and the battery lasts forever. I started wearing it Sunday afternoon and when I charged it on Tuesday evening, the battery was still more than half charged. I was really looking for something to measure my BPM and calories burned and this thing does the job and more. I gave it 4 stars only because the screen is a little flimsy and can get scratched easily. Otherwise, great product!
 So far so good. Had mine for over a month and it works exactly as promised.
 love, love, love!! I use it everyday and highly recommend it for the price.
 Really nice. Arrived on time. Never thought I'd pay much attention to this but it's easy and I follow my progress several times a day
 Love the limited color combination
 I love it I love having the reminders all day to remind me to walk,  I would like it to be a little thinner as I have small wrists
 Works great,  not a cheap band lime the others that hurt my wrist over time. I like it
 Way better than previous Fitbits.
 The wifey loves it.
 Love it!
 Wonderful present, wife uses it every day.
 I've used it for about 1 year and it died.  I charge it and it's blank.  I'm so sad.  It helped me sleep better, get more exercise when I knew I needed to get moving and tracked me recently doing 68,000 steps in Washington DC!!!
 Keeps me on track. I'm a 75 yr old women and try to pace myself with at least 5,000 daily. I like when I go over and it lets me know. Having Fibro is a challenge and keeping moving helps and Fit-Bit keeps me on track.
 Happy wife, happy life. She likes it, that’s all that matters.
 No count down function, need to pair with something
 Love this, it works great. I've only had 1 issue so far and that is when it stopped tracking my sleep and resting heart rate, just had to restart it though.
 Works and fits well. Love the reminder to get up and walk. Charge lasts for quite a while if you don't sync every day.
 Love it. I haven't had any problems with it so far.
 Love my new Fitbit! It actually gets you motivated which I what I need. Easy use app on my iPhone. Is an eye opener as far as sleep, water and exercise.
 Enjoying the new Fitbit and it's functionality. I measured for a small but got the large as I learned with my previous one they tend to get warm and having a looser fit is more comfortable.
 What can you say about a fitbit?  Second one I have had in 2.5 years.  Love using it - keeps me moving.
 I purchased this May 21 and on October 18 it stopped working . It won't charge . For the price it should last longer than 5 months
 Ok
 Just what I needed to keep me motivated. I love the app, it's very easy to use and so fun to get in and check my stats for the day!!
 Great gift for my college son. He loves it.
 Love it! Such a pretty color and I love it with the rose gold. You do have to watch out for it with dark colored clothing like jeans, they do rub off on the light color watch.
 Love all the things this Fitbit does!
 I love my Fitbit! My only complaint is that the heart rate tracker doesn’t work right during an exercise.
 My son received this as a gift and he loves it.  He's very active, and enjoys seeing his progress in numbers.  There have been no issues at all, and he wears it daily for the past three months.
 Outstanding device.  This thing gives me a lot of information and is comfortable to wear, I use it in place of my watch.
 this fitbit is amazing.....
 Love this product. However, the pulse rate is not reliable.
 Got it to show Dr. office heart was always racing.  Works great simple to set up and use.  Would recommend it for anyone....even the non-tecky people
 I LOVE this bracelet!  It does everything I want it to, and more!  Definitely worth the bucks, compared to some others that I have tried.
 Been wanting one of these for a few years now I have it and love it.
 Not being able to even shower with it on is a big bummer...
 I love my Fitbit Charge 2.  It keeps me motivated and ready for my next steps in living a healthier life.
 Great, certainly change how I exercise In that I have goals- specific number of steps, flights of stairs to climb and target calorie burn. I just love it.
 A most valuable gift for my husband. He loves counting daily steps and is faithful walker.
 Absolutely love it!!! FitBit has changed my life.
 Love this item.  Highly recommend
 Bought as a gift and she really loved it.
 My wife really, really likes this. not only for the health monitoring, but after pairing with her iphone, she gets text's and emails on it as well.
 My husband didn't like the plastic band that came with his Charge2 because it wasn't flexible and he couldn't get a perfect fit with the spacing of the holes in it.  This band was the perfect solution, allowing him to adjust it to exactly fit and providing much more flexibility.
 Stopped counting steps after the first charge.
 While I'm happy with the Charge 2 (love all the features it offers); I have a love/hate relationship going on with the band. My band has broken twice in a little over 3 months since I've had it. The plastic where the band snaps onto the tracker cracks and breaks, and the band will not latch securely onto the tracker. I'm wondering if this is a manufacturing defect and if others have had a similar experience?
 I bought this watch in April and enjoyed using it, until in December the band attachment on one side gave out.  I couldn't wear it b/c the strap kept falling off.  Through Amazon I was referred to fitbit and called to explain my problem to which they quickly responded.  Within a week i received a replacement wrist band. I'm happy to be wearing it now.
 Great fitness band! Sleek and fit well. I liked how it would remind you to breathe and help you meditate for a bit. Very nice!<br/>Thanks!
 This replaced the Fitbit Charge HR (version 1) that I've had for less than a year, which I had replaced under warranty *twice* because the rubber wrist band would delaminate, becoming "bubbly and ugly".  This Fitbit Charge 2 HR has replaceable wrist bands (which I hope not to replace!)<br/><br/>I like this version much better than the original!
 Super cute, love the color. Love all the features and that it not only tracks my fitness, but my sleep.
 My wife wouldn't be without it!
 It tracks you as sleeping if you are sitting watching tv before bed. Also got a mark on my wrist where the back touched it, so had to change wrists to give the area a break. Really like checking my heart rate during the day, not just when exercising. It’s great for seeing if you’re restless at night.
 Great product
 I also bought the rose gold stainless steel magnet band and love the combo of the two!
 Have only had it for a short while but so far it has been very good. Many different facets to it compared to my first Fitbit. Very pleased
 I  originally received a broken FitBit, but a 40 minute phone call with the FitBit customer service worker and about 7 day wait, I received my new ready to work FitBit and I love it. Keeps track of steps well and shows my text messages!!!
 Bought as a gift for my wife. She loves it.
 Do Not buy this product.  It has an inferior Bluetooth function.  I can not get it to Sync with my IMAC.  This happened on 2 units.  My original one and a replacement  from the manufacturer.  Definitely not worth the money.  Fitbit is not ready for prime time.
 Very Great improvement over the previous Charge.
 Wife wears it everyday.....had to buy replacement band because it got dirty fast.
 Received the Fitbit Charge 2 very quickly, the problem that I have with it is that is does not accurately count steps, also the Heart Rate never worked, I had tried to do the restarts and re syncing, but nothing worked.
 Very frustrated - I received my fitbit this morning around 9:00, 5 hours later and 2 attempts with customer support apparently the device is defective.  I am going to follow this through to remedy because I am a loyal brand buyer, I will update this review if/when problem is resolved.
 Love it. Use it every day. Enjoy trying to beat my records and getting an idea of how many calories I'm burning throughout the day based on activity. Love all the different types of tracking.
 Love it just wish it had a blood pressure
 Really is good quality and very nice looking.<br/>Actually the plum color goes with most other colors.  It's dark and almost a reddish brown in some lights.  I am very happy with it.
 Falls apart.
 My Fitbit arrived before it was promised. It was easy to set up. I have used it for 2 days and am very happy with it. I especially like the heart rate functions I'm very pleased with the Fitbit charge 2.
 I started with the Alta and it was a good beginner Fitbit but I love my Charge 2.  It counts steps on exercise equipment that the Alta didn't unless connected to my shoe.  Also like the heart rate info.  Highly recommend.
 I really like this Fitbit!  I love the notifications setting, so I can tell when I'm getting a call or text right from my wrist.  Helps me keep track of my activity which keeps me more active through out the day.
 I am absolutely in love with my new Fitbit. I have a Charge and a Charge HR, but this one is just the best yet! Great performance and a great look!
 Love it... should have got it a way back... There is not a day I go anywhere without it... Truly helps me manage my days.... Thanks for a great product
 I moved from a Fitbit One, after I lost it, to the Charge 2 specifically for the heart rate monitor.  At first I was impressed with the device - the large strap fit nicely and it was fairly easy to set up since I already had the fitbit app on my phone.  At first it seemed to function well and appeared to accurately count steps.  I thought the sleep stats were interesting as well.  Then I headed to the Grand Canyon for a 24 mile, rim to rim hike.  Again, steps seemed to be in line with distance but my heart rate never climbed over 115.  I finally stopped and actually took my pulse with a stopwatch and it was actually closer to 150 (very close to my hiking companion who was wearing a heart monitor chest strap).  SO the very thing I purchased it for, failed during a time when I really wanted to rely on it.  Given the failure of the heart rate monitor, it also then didn't display the right calories burned.  I returned and have ordered another Fitbit One.  Convinced that if I really want a monitor - then a device connected to a chest strap is the way to go
 Bought this item for my husband who is very fitness conscious. He absolutely adores being able to track his daily progress. Works with the app perfectly so it syncs with all his Apple devices.
 its ok
 I wear this fitbit every day.  The pulse monitor seems to be quite accurate and it's a very nice feature to have.  Certainly beats chest strap monitors.
 Helps to encourage me to move more and stay focused to get in shape to achieve my fitness goals.
 Clearly the best one yet. I like the larger face, giving me the time, date, steps with goal marked, and heart rate. It also has a breathing app that has actually helped me breathe deeply during an anxiety attack . As a sedentary person, I can program a " get moving " vibration (every two hours for me) with a step goal (250) and so far I'm doing it. Many other ways to encourage or mark different exercises; bike, run etc.<br/>Of course, being a girly grandma, I'm looking forward to the exchangeable color bands, due in November.<br/>I could have worn the small size band, but I choose the large to be able to move it up and down my wrist.<br/>Oh, setting it up, you need a dongle, not included. I used the same one for my hubby's FitBit one. It worked.<br/>And this is slightly sleeker than my FitBit Charge HR ...
 Mother wears it daily and loves it! comfortable and functional
 This is an upgraded FitBit for me.  I especially like the sleep cycle monitoring.  Great product
 Would have given it a 5 but it's just a little bit big for comfortable sleeping. Should have gone more streamlined
 Great buy and good price!
 I am having so much fun with my Fitbit Charge 2! It is really helping me stay motivated to work out, and has helped me remember to drink a lot more water throughout the day, too.
 Much improved visuals over the previous generation Charge HR. My only wish is that the band lasts longer than the six months of my previous Charge HR.
 Best purchase I have ever made.  Just wish Fitbit offered more comfortable bands.  However, sticking to the actual Fitbit, it holds you accountable...I have walked more than I have in years.  Would highly recommend this to anyone.
 This is the second fitbit I have bought and this one is much better than the last one. The only issue which I have is a conflict between steps and distance traveled using the g p s feature and the dash board. The gps indicated a distance exactly half what was recorded on the dashboard. But, that could be user error so I will do follow-up checks
 Love it! It tracks everything and it was worth the purchase. I would have liked it more if it were in color with a graph you can see on the screen. I will eventually get a larger one but this fit bit is great for beginners.
 This is my husband's he loves the Fitbit it gives him his heart rate his steps he walked and a couple of the things that he enjoy
 Product is exactly what it says it is. Charge holds a long time. If you don’t sync it with your phone/tablet it’ll eventually lose the time.
 A good quality device. Shipped and arrived quickly and on time. Looks exactly like the picture and works well. It has a long battery life and is comfortable. The band does get graphite all over it when I write and draw, but I have yet to see if it stains or washes off. It tracks sleep and HR well. Exactly what I was hoping for.
 Not accurate enough to make me confident about the tracking. It shouldn't show steps while sleeping.
 If it could only do my exercises for me...
 This particular Fitbit did not record mileage accurately.  I noticed that it was significantly below the steps that I expected.  To check its accuracy, I walked counting my steps and noticed that while I counted 500 steps, this Fitbit was half of that amount.  Amazon was wonderful in replacing this device for one that would work correctly.
 Thank you.  I can't ask for more I'm very pleased ,  I hope it will last for long.
 I've only had the Charge 2 for a few days, but my first impressions are overall positive. I previously used the Charge HR which I liked very much except for a handful of issues (see below). I had just started having problems with my 3rd HR in just over a year and I decided it was time for a change, so after comparing all my options including other brands I decided to give the Charge 2 a try. Fortunately the Charge 2 keeps almost all of what made the Charge HR great while fixing its biggest problems (for me at least).<br/><br/>My first problem with the Charge HR was the charger. Inevitably after several months of usage, the charging connection would become very loose to the point that it would not charge unless I sat there and held the cable in position. The Charge 2 addresses this in two ways. First, they redesigned the charger to wrap around the band, holding it in position much more securely. Second, the cable is longer (about a foot and a half compared to just a few inches) which allows me to plug it in and set the tracker down on a solid surface rather than forcing it to hang from the cable, reducing the stress on not only the charger/tracker connection but my USB ports as well. So my computer and my USB wall outlet are both grateful.<br/><br/>My other problem was with the band. On all 3 Charge HRs that I owned, after 4-5 months the band would separate from the top of the screen. It never separated completely and didn't seem to impact the functionality of the tracker, but the small flap of rubber where it was coming apart would catch on things, causing it to stretch even more and it just looked terrible. The Charge 2 seems to have a much tougher build, and worst case scenario the band is replaceable without replacing the whole device.<br/><br/>The new workout modes as well as the relaxation mode seem interesting, though I haven't had the time to explore them in depth yet.<br/><br/>Basic functionality aside, the best feature that carries over from previous models is the Fitbit customer service. Every time I contacted them regarding the problems with my previous trackers they were quick and attentive with their support and ultimate replacement of the problem devices. While I don't anticipate the need for those services with the Charge 2 its nice to know they're there just in case.<br/><br/>The one negative that keeps this from being a 5 star review is the silent alarm. The vibration is significantly less powerful than the Charge HR or the Flex I owned before that. While I understand that a more subtle vibration may be desired for things like notifications, it just isn't adequate for an alarm, especially a wake up alarm unless you're a very light sleeper (and even then I'm not sure I'd trust it). I'm hoping the weaker vibration is software related and that the power can be turned up in a future update rather than a hardware limitation.<br/><br/>Overall whether you are looking for your first tracker or upgrading from something else, this is a great tracker at a great price point.
 Great Fitbit works well and I love the constant heart rate and the reminders. Choose it instead of the Blaze.
 Would have been good to know that a dongle was needed to be purchased in order to use the fitbit with a laptop.<br/>Clear notice on the dashboard indicating a dongle was needed would also have saved two sessions with the help desk.
 It is probably a great product, but unfortunately I am not tech savvy, so I returned it.
 this is the first fitbit that i have owned. it is very simple to use, an app is required but it is free and literally walks you through the entire set up and range of features. the width is fine - like a wrist watch and i wear the small size with lots of room still. the display is bright and easy to navigate. i follow the instructions pretty strictly with cleaning the band and allowing the wrist a bit without the band on and have had no trouble with the band hurting or rubbing my skin at all. the sync works fast and simple and the battery lasts about five days (as noted). basically no complaints here -seems to be a great way to stay aware and keep up with your activity and well being in a technology world. yes i'm all behind the times in technology but finally caught up. recommend for any level of technology expert - even level 1 (me).
 hubby has lost weight he is more active than before love it and its work the money love the heart rate and how it tracks everything
 I am facing problem with my Fitbit watch now. The belt is kind of tearing apart. The screen is often flickering doesn't respond much. I was very happy with my watch till now. But now what's happening.
 Much better than my Fitbit Charge HR.  I almost didn't purchase another fitbit after the Charge HR but I'm glad I gave it another try.
 love it, a little big, but absolutely love how it works and how it keeps me on track for my goals- and didnt realize i was sleeping so poorly 😳
 The device would not pair.  Their tech support was friendly, but of no use at all.  After the third attempt trying to connect and getting the same message, I decided to just return it.
 Not for myself, but my wife really likes it. Went to the Doctor and the pulse rate on the Fitbit was same as what the nurse counted.
 I love this thing.  it pokes and prods me at all the right times and has helped me figure out my sleep.  Navigating through the menus is not super friendly, but a cave man like me could figure it out so it must be idiot proof.  Lost the bluetooth conection for a couple of days and finally figured out to turn it off and on before it reconnected.
 I love this upgrade. I look forward to changing the band to different colors. I also appreciate the larger clock face that holds more info.
 Niece seeems to love it and wears it everywhere.
 Nice &amp; waiting for new model
 "Location must be turned on to enable Bluetooth"...seriously? I'm always paranoid when apps force you to use functions that don't make sense. Maybe I'm not as tech savvy as I've thought, but I fail to see how GPS location is required for Bluetooth connectivity when my phone is in my pocket. If you are concerned about the things this watch may be tracking without your approval, consider a different option. I'd return the watch, but I doubt we saved the box during the Christmas cleanup.
 Exactly what I wanted! Good heart rate monitor, seems really accurate with that and the step count, I love it.
 Good
 I really like the fitbit. The reason I took off one star is because I ordered the large size and it came as the small size. I didn't want to deal with the hassle of returning it this close to Christmas. It's not a huge deal as the bands are changeable.
 The wristband broke easily, for the money I spent I should have bought Apple Watch
 The monitor is perfect!  The wrist band is terrible:  hard plastic, irritating to wear and bulky.  Worn loose, it tatters my long sleeve shirt cuff.  Worn tight, it rubs through the inside of the shirt sleeve cuff.  The monitor, as I understand it, is not water proof but the wrist band is designed as if it was. Not recommended for executive daily life.  I have had to order another wrist band, which is flexible and thinner.  Maybe Fitbit just don't care.
 This fitbit has totally changed my workout.  I work at a desk all day, and the hourly reminders have me up and walking around the office to get my 250 steps.  My total daily steps have doubled since I started wearing it.  I LOVE IT.  I bought one for my son and he put on 30,000 steps on the first day out hiking in the beautiful mountains of Montana.
 Bought this as a gift. He seems to love it! Received it in 24 hours!!!!
 Fantastic!  Used the Fitbit as part of my first half marathon trading program and it is flawless!  Tracks different exercises and accurately records every step and move.
 Gifted to gf who has everything and she wears it everyday
 My screen cracked and it was replaced through their customer support, no hassle  I love my Fitbit
 The Fitbit was ordered for my wife,  she was having a problem with detect when her heart rate was racing causing her to have trouble breathing.<br/>It's functions help with that, however the buckle and the back of the Fitbit have been irritating her skin. However my daughters provides no problems.
 I really like my fit bit! I purchased 2 of them we are enjoying them!
 Tracks heartbeat when I am not even wearing it. Was home sick in bed ALL DAY and it tracked 250 steps. Waste of money.
 Easy to use straight out of the box. Only neg is having to tell it which arm it's on since I switch regularly. Otherwise excellant
 So far I like this Fitbit Charge 2. I tested the heart rate monitor while testing my blood pressure at the Dr. office as well as at home and it is very accurate (within 1 to 2 beats off). Only thing that would make this Great is making it waterproof.
 I use it all of the time and enjoy it, but I was very disappointed that it does not work when you are on a treadmill.
 Does not calculate my steps correctly. I had updated it. It counts when I'm not moving and triples my steps when I take just one.
 I"ve had the watch for a while now and I love it! Only downfall is that one of the straps won't stay on.
 Got a gift for my wife and she loves it.  She was never a person to wear a watch but love all the feature of Fitbit.
 Gave this away as a gift to my daughter and see loves it...
 Great price and great quality Fitbit as always!
 I have a new buddy. We go everwhere (accept the pool or shower) together. My new buddy is so smart. My buddy is an encouraged. Remembers so much info. Gently reminds me without nagging. My buddy knows i need good sleep, plenty of water. Always knows how my heart is. Fitbuddy is my new fitbit friend.
 This is a life changer. Who knew something so small &amp; simple could be so motivating. Get one! You won't regret it :)
 Works great. Attaches to my phone.  This one you can replace/change the bands out with ease. Unlike the original.
 So far so good.  Took me a little bit to get the notifications to work properly, but with the new app download it was easy.
 I got it for my dad, he likes it, he mainly uses it for the footstep, heartbeat and sleep recording. His only complain with it is that when he is in the car the Fitbit starts counting more footsteps due to the vibration. So it adds over inflates his steps. If they can fix that this is a 5 star device.
 As soon as i got this product. I got it synced to my phone and went to go charge it. Plugged it in and it showed the exhausted battery and hasnt turned back on since. Hopefully the replacement will work better.
 fast delivery and  item as described - was easy to put on and fit well
 I've owned older fit bit models in the past and I thought it was time for an upgrade to the new charge 2. Sadly, it did not meet my expectations at all. Gave inaccurate readings of my steps and of my distance and time of my run. Full of glitches. The idea of all the things it has to offer is great, but they need to fix these glitches before this product can truly shine.
 Love love love my Fitbit charge 2. It is worth every penny spent. It tracks everything. The battery last a long time I charge my Fitbit every other week.  The text message feature is awesome.<br/>I recommend you make the purchase you won't regret it.
 The fitbit works fine but the band, even by measurements, was too small for comfort. Had to buy replacement. Otherwise it's great.
 The swipe feature isn't working properly. Constantly have to press the button to see the details.
 I love this rechargeable watch...the plum color as well as the usefulness of wearing this to count steps.
 Great present for my wife. She loves it and wears and uses it every day!
 They designed these bands to break apart, I would give them 0 stars if I could. Both my device and my wife has had the bands break, and every single person I know who has one has had the same thing happen. My wife upgraded to the Apple Watch and the difference in quality is day and night, I feel like a fool having spent money here after having the same experience with the original charge, they promised it was fixed and I gave them a second chance, shame on me. Seriously, this thing is not worth the asking price, believe me, I'm not an apple fan but you simply get more functionality and orders of magnitude better quality, there must be others who are better than this piece of cow dung but I don't know them, just look elsewhere. If you buy after reading this you have no one to blame but yourself. Btw I did contact fitbit support and they refuse to recognize this is a widespread problem or a defect, I was invited to their online store to purchase a new overpriced band and take better care of it next time.
 I have had this about four days and I am addicted! Easy set up and great app. Already st goals and lost 2 pounds!  Only challenge is figuring out how to set exercise for yoga.
 Loved it from the go! The package was delivered on time and it was packed well. This has motivated me to stay fit and active. If you are person who needs a little motivation to start a healthy and fit life here is your friend.
 Gift for my wife.  She loves it and uses it daily
 Your band WILL peel even if it never gets a drop fo water on it and you treat it as if it were a priceless watch. Three in one year for me, two for my wife and two for my mom. Thanks but no thanks!
 I like what it has to offer.. but if you wear it daily, which i did to start as i was excited to test it out, it will rub the outer part of your wrist raw. Whether its snug or a bit loose. Took like a week to fully heal.
 great product. exactly what is described!
 worked great until i let the battery drain out. now it's 3 days 3 hours behind and i can't get it to sync.
 I've been using Fitbit for about two years.  I bought this one for my girlfriend.  She loves it.  Their customer service department is great too.  As a matter of fact, I just ordered the Charge 2 to replace my older Charge HR.  It appears this model is better build.
 gave this to my wife who loves watches and fitness and it's a huge hit!
 As of right now, I love it.  Changed out the band because I sweat and stink under plastic, thank goodness there are options.  Seems a bit large on my small wrist, (not the band but the unit itself), but it seems to function okay.  So far battery life is as said, about 5 days.
 Love the fit bit, band broke after wearing for two months, do you stand behind the band?  If so, I would love to have a turcoise one..I know the spelling is wrong but you know which one...
 Good quality. Holds a charge. Better features than smaller Fitbit. App compatability is sweet.
 Enjoy keeping track of my sleep patterns and calories. Also when I work out at the gym it counts for calories burned. A lot of my friends have them and we enjoy comparing our stats.
 I was sceptical about the Fitbit products before I had it, but once you start using it, you understand why pretty much every other person has it. They are really easy to use and really comfortable, I love it!
 Works great.
 The best Fitbit yet. Love the interchangeable wristbands. The display is exactly what you need seeing both the time and steps on the initial display!
 The fitness tracker is excellent while it works. Unfortunately it stopped holding battery charge for more than 6 hours after 9 months of use.<br/>Good features but poor reliability.
 This is a step-up from the original and I like it very much.
 Love it.  This is an upgrade from my first Charge.  it is pretty easy to use.  I am not crazy over the charging methd.  A little cumbersome, otherwise great.
 Wife seems to love it much better than her previous one. The watch style band really makes the difference. Accuracy was never an issue and still is not. Great product.
 It works excellant! I use it every day.
 Working great.
 Only complaint is the screen scratches easily.  Other than that its great.
 Great upgrade from Charge. Definitely worth every penny
 Wife wanted for Christmas, she was really excited to get it.  Haven't seen it since.
 Love it!  The slim band is nice for people with small wrists.  Love the charging cord...really just use the # of steps in a day.  Haven't use other features yet.
 just love it, I really enjoy it, does what I expected and more, will never go without one again!
 Purchased the Fitbit November 2017. Did not wear it consistently until April 2018. The band piece that holds the strap down broke away. I now have difficulty "clamping" the strap "shut" (can't close the strap on my arm easily). Otherwise a great buy (so far).
 The best tracker from the best company . Great customer support , frequent updates . It’s an excellent band . More than a year now and working like charm
 Serves every purpose I need it for. Syncs well with phone. Will order extra bands for fun.
 This thing is actually getting me a movin'. I already feel so much better and it hasn't even been a week yet.
 Got this for my wife--she uses it daily and even after an accidental wearing into the shower, it works great!
 Much better band than original Charge. Battery seems to last okay too, given that it has the heart rate monitor. I charge mine about every  3-4 days in the am while getting ready for work. I like the reminders to walk during the day, but it did take a little time getting used to the softer vibrate alarm in the am.
 Disappointed,  sent back.  I dont like that I had to download apps to get this to work.
 Yes it did almost everything the old Fitbit charge HR did except vibrate to remind you to start sleeping. I like that you can choose your physical activity straight from the Fitbit gadget itself and not to have to go to the app on the phone.
 This is a great way to track and monitor your overall health status. It is extremely accurate and if you have any issues the return policy is top notch.
 This is the second Fitbit I have purchased. The first one was a Flex, and after about six months it died. I decided to try another one and purchased the Charge 2 in December 2016. Now, it too has died. First the wrist band would not stay on the Fitbit itself and then it just stopped working. I am either not going to use a fitness tracker in the future or I will purchase another brand.
 Nice
 Very useful.  Helps motivate me to get up and move during the day.
 I am very pleased with my Fitbit Charge 2. The display is easy to read and it tracks everything I need it to track from sleep to exercise.
 I like the Fitbit, it helps to keep me motivated. My biggest complaint is the band broke after a little over a year. I have watches that have lasted for decades, but this is my second Fitbit where the band broke in under two years
 Better battery life, sleek new design and the ability to switch bands sold me on this. The plastic has to be cleaned and aired out or there is an odor!
 So far I really like my Fitbit charge 2.  I had a Fitbit flex for 3 years and was sad to have to replace it, but it quit syncing.  I tried everything to correct that without success. I'm impressed with features on the new one I didn't have before and I like the way it charges. I wasn't sure about the width/size of my new one, but it's been easy to get used to. I especially like that it connects with my iPhone and alerts me to texts or calls.
 I had the original charge HR and this is such an upgrade. It feels great not cheap like the original and it has much more options to help me with my fitness goals.
 we love are fitbits charge 2. it tracks everything you do.
 I am very happy with this Fitbit. It’s my first one and it was easy to use and intuitive to set up. It works for me and keeps me going to hit my walk and exercise goals.
 My wife loves it. Now I'm going to upgrade to this model since I have the older version.
 Upgraded from my Charge HR and couldn't be happier! Love the display, motivation reminders and text message review!
 love it
 This Fitbit was not accurate. At first you don't notice it but the steps continue to miscalculate the longer you have it, it becomes obvious its off by double when compated to an app on my iPhone.<br/>Now Amazon has a cut off of 60 days no returns.<br/>If your seriously wanting to buy device dont buy a Fitbit
 Husband loves it and is helping him keep in target. Brags on when he hits his goals !
 It's a great device and worth the money if you walk everyone or are trying to get more exercise. The sleep tracking superb and extremely accurate. The step tracker needs some work, it sometimes takes a while (a few seconds) to update a brief short amount of walking but it will still register it. I've had it withstand pouring rain and drops and it still works well.
 Does everything I wanted it to do. Very satisfied with the purchase.
 BATTERY LIFE is awful... i honestly do not understand who wants to have a watch that has to be charged daily... maybe it's me
 Great product it got up and off her ass
 I have been using since May 2017, it is great and I like the size too. It does exactly what is needed for. I did. It want a iWatch, that is too big and have many functions that I will never use. Fitbit is quite accurate and apps is very friendly to use. Highly recommended product
 This is amazing. I would recommend it to anyone who has had trouble losing weight. I wear it all the time and my sleep has improved, my heart rate has improved. Everything has improved. I love this thing. I know $150 is a little expensive, but it's worth it. If you're a data geek like me, you'll love this thing.
 I really like this product and it is a definite upgrade from the Charge. I do not regret buying this at all.
 Replaced my Fitbit Charge HR.  Love the bigger screen, the additional features, and the fact that you can switch out bands!
 Love it. Small is perfect size for petite wrist. Goes with most outfits and is comfortable. Will say that overall it is still a big watch if you are petite.
 Doesn't do alot, better off buying a real smartwatch
 Wife loves it!
 Very disappointed.  Fitbit shows up to 1000 steps taken while sleeping. I have tried to reset but was not able to. This happened again overnight and I wasn't even wearing it. I've gone to help suites but nothing has helped.
 Love this version!  It is more accurate than previous Fitbits that I have used.
 Haven't had long, so far...really good.
 I've had the Fitbit for 2 days and I love it. It is comfortable and stylish. It does everything that I want and need to keep up with my health and activity. I would recommend the Fitbit Charge 2
 I love it
 Works well.
 Bday gift for my wife. She loves it.
 Love it, it’s helping me get healthy!
 Use it everyday, and its helped me lose 12 pounds already because I'm more aware of walking and what I eat, and how I sleep..
 Love it... so glad I upgraded to the charge HR 2.....much better then the charge HR....still learning it but thus,far it's nice...
 Love my FitBit!
 It works and does its job.  Pricey, though.
 For the most part I love it. But the battery barely even last the half the 5 days it claims to, even when I don't use the heart rate monitor.<br/> I also wake up and get out of the car with some steps counted so you have take the step count with a grain of salt.
 Didn’t even lat an entire year. The sleep tracker no longer works :(
 Product received was product advertised. Bought this for my mom and she's been using without issue.
 My wife is very happy with it.
 So far so good.  No complaints, can do "challenges" with friends from Facebook of phone contacts. Nice looking and sleek.
 This was a gift for my daughter.. She loved it!
 Love inspiring my son to be more active.  He loves his
 Love my Fitbit Charge 2!  Exactly as described.
 My husband loves it and tracks his steps, sleep, caloric intake, etc.
 Works well, except I have to keep syncing it with my phone.
 all you need and more in a fitness tracker.  I like that it is a little bit wider than the Alta, but has the same features.  I love that I can change out the band to coordinate.  The rose gold color is also a nice touch.
 Works as advertised and looks like they fixed the weak charging port from the old model.
 Christmas present. Has changed my husband's life!
 Does what it's supposed to! Sometimes counts steps when you're not walking though.
 Completely inaccurate step-counting leading to inaccurate calorie burning. I was shocked at how badly this product functions considering its price. A free cell phone app counts steps much more accurately! I tried all of the work around and I was still getting close to 8000 steps before lunch...
 Love love love this product. Bought to help keep track if heart rate, but the step count helps keep me motivated to move.
 This got my wife more active
 This is a good product - decent quality too. It is as described and we would consider to buy it again.
 I am first time user. The first thing I observed first is that it's step count increase even if I am sitting and not moving at all.
 What I like least could be my fault, but I have trouble shooted without change.  It seem not to display when I tap on screen each time, so that bothers me.  My original FITBIT CHARGE was great, but it broke.  Cyber Monday was the decision for me and thanks!  I do still the wristband!
 Great item
 Bought this as a gift for my dad. I think it is a fine product. I especially like that it shows the time without tapping. However, the rubber band is not the most comfortable one out there.
 It seems to be tougher than the two original Charge HR's that broke on me.  And, it is a better tracker.
 Fitbit is a great device to monitor heart rate and steps and  encourage exercise
 Great functions, sometimes doesn’t pick up HR though.
 Does the job.  Bought during a Fitbit sale.  The new ones coming out soon are water resistant or maybe even waterproof.
 Lost 30 lbs in 2 months. Just walking and using the app to track my calorie intake! I love this thing!!!
 Has met all of my expectations.  All data readings have seemed to be consistently accurate.  Thumbs Up!
 I love it!  It does everything I need it to do.  I track all my exercises and sleeping.  This is way better then the Microsoft one I had.
 This barely lasted two months and already doesn't work. Waste of money. DO NOT BUY!!
 I love my Fitbit Charge 2!!  So happy that I got this and it really helps me track my goals.  Can't believe I had waited this long to get one.
 This has been a great motivator for me. I really love it.
 Granddaughter loved it.
 I wish it had the second hand on it so I could wear it to work. I really don’t want to pay $50 just for a second hand. I do love my Fitbit but the band just busted and the screen is cracked and I haven’t owned it very long at all.
 This is my first Fitbit and I am loving it!  The reminders to get up and get moving are really helpful on a busy work day.  I didn't realize how much I was just sitting every day.  I love the look of it, and it is lightweight - very comfortable.  I am definitely more active with the Fitbit and I just wish I hadn't waited so long to make this purchase!
 Purchased for my preteen and she wears it all the time that’s a plus ( dealing with a preteen moods and want) not easy lol  and we compete with counting our steps
 The Fitbit was a gift for my husband and he loves the many features such as monitoring his heart rate and cell phone notifications.
 I bought this for my husband and he loves it!
 It works great for my need. I gave it a four star because a month after I got it an update came and now I can't get notifications.
 My Fitbit does not hold a charge for more than 5-6 hrs. So I lose tracking time throughout the day. When I wear it at bedtime on a full charge; by morning it's empty. My husband got the black one and it stays charged for 3 days.
 Daughter loves it
 really beautiful and practical fitness watch. Battery lasts longer than i expected but this maybe because i pair it with my mobile device once at the end of the day to see my stats. The small watch is just perfect for Asians like me.
 At first it worked well. It seemed like the real thing. How ever after a few months its started to show blank HR data whenever I did demanding exercise. App is nice and easy to use. However nothing works well if the data is not the correct one. Will ask for my money back.
 Love this!!! Especially the rose gold! The competition with my family and friends he's me outside and walking way more and I feel more energized.
 It's alright. I liked my UP better, especially the app, but they stopped making them.
 Easy to use.  Great tracking!
 Got this for my gals birthday, she loves it! It works to keep track of her activity.
 The band is removable but it was doing it all on its own to the point I have to replace it after only a couple months.
 Everything expected, good value, and it is an addicting gadget..  But getting healthier.
 This watch will not hold a charge. Two out of three times the device will completely fail to charge. I have largely stored the watch on a shelf. Trying to get support for replacement has been a fruitless. I would not purchase this product again.
 I bought one to find out just how active I was playing in VR. Heart rate monitor can be wonky, but great otherwise.
 Scratches very easily and is not covered on warranty.  App is great and tracks fairly well.
 Love love love
 Watch is great. Price is great but the charging wires length sucks. I mean common be reasonable. 1 feet of length who does that.
 It works pretty seamlessly as a general fitness tracker. It measures my resting heart rate, steps, stairs and sleep pretty accurately. However it's not very useful for actual exercise. The heart rate sensor isn't too bad for steady state cardio. It lags behind my chest strap heart rate sensor by about 2 seconds and the average heart rate will be 5-10 bpm off but that's expected from a wrist based heart rate sensor. The biggest issue I have with it is that the current pace shown on the display is painfully inaccurate. It'll stay static at one pace even if I vary my pace by 3 minutes per mile. For example it'll show that my current pace is 9:00 minutes per mile even if I vary my pace from 6:00 - 12:00. The pace will only change when I make a dramatic change like come to a complete stop.
 This was a gift to my Son! He is a fireman and has had one before. We got this for him for Christmas and he loves it! :-D
 This was my second time purchasing this model.  I had issues with it not displaying on the wrist turn, and not going through the different options when tapped.  However, when I got this one it updated right away and everything has been working great so far.  I have zero complaints about it, and as far as I'm concerned, it works better than my Fitbit HR
 I like the fit of this Fitbit Charge. Thanks
 Works as advertised. Best combo of features vs price of in fitness band. Would give 6 stars if it came with umtele Milanese loop band
 LOVE my fitbit, get partial text to see who's bothering you b4 you pick up the phone.
 I bought this as a gift. They love it.
 Love everything about it. The app is excellent too.
 They great tell I leave it at the gym my bad so got S3
 I love the Fitbit charge 2, but am disappointed in the band. I bought 2 Fitbits and both bands are coming apart.<br/>I was told that the bands were defective and were being replaced with new improved bands.<br/>I would like to replace both bands free of charge. One purple/large. One black/large.<br/>Can you help me since I bought through Amazon?
 Great item to keep me up and moving. I like how it not only tracks my steps but also my sleep.
 Big print I can read it without my glasses
 Wish it were waterproof and a bit more low-profile.
 Best Fitbit ever!
 Just as described, fits perfect
 My sister loved it and very attractive watch
 This is my second purchase of this product.  I enjoy the features and durability.
 My daughter-in-law love the color
 This item was better than I expected！<br/><br/>I can be wearing this all day because It's really compact.<br/><br/>I can know the state of my sleep, so I can improve the quality of sleep.<br/><br/>Also, because notifications of e-mail etc. arrive, I can use various on-hand watches without having to wear smart watch.
 No complaints so far except I've joined a much larger community of athletes who continue to push me to work harder. Ha! It's great!
 Absolutely love this product. I was very eager to buy it, wear it and exercise with it. It did not disappoint. I think this is the most popular product they have and you can immediately see why. It isn't expensive, its fairly comfortable and very interactive. However, I wish it had music control.<br/>I'd recommend this to anyone who is looking to motivate their already or even just starting out their fitness journey.
 Great product, very durable as a maintenance guy who wears this everyday its holding up well!!
 Not very accurate for distance/pace. Bought it for running/waking and it doesn’t give an accurate distance, possibly due to stride length being off. Wish it was waterproof. I like the look of it better than the past models, little small. The sleep feature has improved.
 Love my Fitbit!
 nice
 Bought this for my non tech husband,  he LOVES this tracker.  We both have one and the fitbit app is amazing.
 I feel the the heart rate monitor is very off
 This was a gift for my sister: she loved it!
 I received my Fitbit and immediately set it up and charged it up. I love it! I had the first HR charge and loved it as well. Am enjoying the battery life and the notifications it has.
 Great item, delivered as scheduled...was a gift!
 Love the new style
 Nice! Wife loved it Mother’s Day gift!
 Great upgrade to my Fitbit Alta.
 works great, looks great, fitbit software easy to use and follow, my daughter loves it.
 After 2 weeks the reminder to walk steps stopped working. I contacted Fitbit several times did what they asked and nothing worked.
 I have owned several of these and there is a serious design flaw. The bands breaks at the join and makes the Fitbit not usable. They have redesigned it but the same issues persist. I am not sure if this is a way to get people to buy more product. I guess i have taken the bait and done it few times.
 👍👍👍👍 I got it on January 3rd, 2019. My FitBit Charge 2 is doing great job and accurate. It can hold the battery like 100 percent to 70 percent for 3 days! :) Thank you!!
 This Fitbit Charge 2 was a gift for my grandson.  He had a fitbit alta but wanted to upgrade.  He loves the Charge 2.
 This is my new workout friend.  I absolutely love it.
 Love it... I only wish it tracked my pulse while I'm sleeping.
 Wear it daily and try to meet my goals
 So far so good.  Still trying to learn all the things it is capable of doing.  I am part of the older generation where I need to have a lot of tech support for my devices.  When I first started using it I could get messages on it, but it has stopped doing that and I am not sure why.
 Love my charger 2, and the extra features that were not on the Fitbit charger. Band is sturdy.
 I am really enjoying using the Fit Bit Charge 2.  It keeps track of all my health stats and lets me know when I am getting a text on my phone. My only concern is that my step or calorie count may be a bit inflated. This issue will have to be investigated. Overall, it''s a good product and seems to work as advertised. It's a huge improvement from the Fit Bit One.
 Actually my wife's.  She likes it.  Tracks her steps accurately.
 Husband is enjoying vs. a pedometer.
 Love my fitbit.  Great tool for providing feed back and goals.  Msgs remind me I have not met my goal and makes me get up and walk.  I run on our trend mill early in the morning and walk with my husband each day  when I get home.  Highly recommend this product.
 Love this!!!! I can use as a fitness aid &amp; a watch &amp; a sleep monitor. I can read it easily &amp; love being able to see results on my app.
 Got my wife the fitbit.  Now we both have one and she is making me keep up...ugh.  i guess that is a good thing...between Atkins and ave 8000 steps per day, i have lost 15 lbs in 2 weeks.
 This one is very accurate, specially if you are monitoring a planned work out. I've heard many complains in the Charge HR forum about the Charge HR not been accurate when using on a treadmill. Lucky for me this one, the Charge HR 2, it's accurate to a dot. I'm talking about maybe 1.1% off compared to the treadmill distance reading vs the HR 2 reading. People are reporting in the fitbit forums that the original Charge HR is off by 20 to 30%. Thanks for the improvement!!!  On the con side this device will miscount steps while doing normal activities like eating, driving or making gestures with your hands while you talk.  In an hour meeting I added like 250 steps for making gestures with my hands while I talked.
 Can’t reset to zero for calorie burning it jus continues to count
 So far so good. I have been through 3 of these FitBit’s and it’s always because the strap broke so hopefully that issue has been finally fixed with this model.
 Love all the features! Seems to be highly accurate.
 This is quite clever. Unlike my previous Fitbit, this one "reminds" me - often - about my steps! It's reminding me of something as I write this review. 😂
 It's really nice. The display look very good. It isn't too bulky either. It does everything it says it does. The sleep tracker is also pretty accurate. It's just the right amount of fancy at a reasonable price
 I love all the features of the Fitbit Charge 2!
 After 25 years I finally have a new watch I like.  Works as advertised.
 Wife loves it! She wears it and uses features after some initial training online.  Quality product.
 It’s great and keeps me active!
 So far the fitbit has been great!  It's stylish, doesn't/hasn't irratated my wrist. I have on all day and sleep with it on at night.
 fast shipping - item just as described
 Love it!
 I love this thing! I use it all the time! I have been way more active since I got it because it makes me push myself further.
 I am very happy with the Fitbit charge 2. It gives me accurate information and helps me to stay on track.
 Great price for the Charge 2.  It's everything I needed.
 The FitBit is nice. Tracks everything I could imagine, But the rubber bands are starting to come apart which is a bummer. Also the screen scratches easily.
 Wife loves it.
 I love it. I like the larger display and it seems to hold a charge considerably longer than my old FB Charge.
 I was looking for fitnes tracker to track my running data. Overall I'm happy with this product except One issue and that is GPS tracking, in order to get real life tracking Ive to carry my mobile during the run, which negates the whole purpose of buying fitness teacker as I could do all the same with an app.
 Reallly good unit ...
 Absolutely love it! No complaints what so ever.
 Long battery life, lots of nice features.
 Doesnt track steps accurately and clock turns on too bright when sleeping so i cant track sleep.
 Very happy with the choice
 Good product
 My husband and I bought these as a Christmas gift for each other. Shipped fast, great item. Love the color..purple. it make us both aware of our fitness goal throughout the day.  Thank you!
 Great quality, works perfectly.  Mainly use it for sleep tracking, but all other features are great too
 Wonderful upgrade from my fitbit HR charge.
 Now To keep it, or to give it away, that is the question.
 Wife loves it
 This is definitely a handy way to keep track of everything.
 my hubby loves his watch
 Nice and easy to use
 Buy if you are health conscious, if not , please don’t buy it just to see the time. It has amazing features and battery life so don’t worry mich about charging it, since it doesn’t take much charge. Looks cool and fits almost all size of arms. Buyyy itt:)
 Perfect!
 Easy to set up and looks nice!
 My wife loves it.  When Momma's Happy, everyone's happy.
 Very nice and still getting use to it.
 I love it.  So much easier to track accomplishments than my old one.
 So far I'm loving this tracking device! It has every function I can think of and had helped me get on track with water intake, exercise, and keeping a food log. Love that I can change bands. Def will recommend.
 Tracks sleep very well!! Step and stairs. Beautiful blue
 I wish the profile was lower and the strap was more like a watch. Also, they really need to make this waterproof and the software on the phone can be temperamental.
 this is a 'gooder'!
 I love the notifications as they truly motivate me.  I have had trouble wiith syncing with the computer.  I have to manually sync it daily if I want to check cumulative steps online.  Sadly,  I lost my community groups after changing from the "One" to the "Charge".
 Product is defective if used on a motorcycle, generates and corrupts data requiring manual editing multiple times per day.
 Great
 I upgraded to this watch from a previous FitBit version.  I have it set to a weightloss program app and a scale.  No issues and easy set up
 Love it, love it, Love it!
 Hey all if you are thinking about purchasing this product, i highly recommend it. I made the decision to purchase this when i thought i had lost my original Fitbit Charge.<br/><br/>I get many compliments on it because the lilac and rose gold colors are gorgeous.<br/><br/>Product does everything that it needs to do.  Love it.
 Good product.
 Great product, fast shipping, exactly as described
 One of my favorite accessories. I've had a fitbit for the last year or so and I don't even want to walk if it's not counting my steps. Really good battery life on this one. I charge it once or twice a week. I wear it to the gym and sauna about 5 times a week.
 Very happy with product.
 This is a very good device to track fitness. the battery life is amazing, lasts up to 7 days on a single full charge.
 LOVE this product.  I had the basic fitbit but this is a lot better with the heart rate and also shows on the screen how far down your battery has gone.
 Great product
 This is definitely a great upgrade.  The battery last longer.  It has more functions and a better display.  I'm so glad I upgraded.
 Thumbs up!
 I love this watch! I didn’t want a giant ionic or blaze one so I chose this instead. It’s awesome. It has tons of features and does exactly what I was hoping for. The condition of the physical watch is solid. It’s not flimsy and it’s in synch with my app. Haven’t had any issues so far.
 Stop charging after a week.
 I had to return the first one that I bought because it did not work. However, the second one that I got works fine and I like it a lot! Tracks pretty much everything.
 fairly straight forward to install - comes with a USB adapter that allows a regular PC to upload its data and recharge it
 Bought for my girlfriend. She loves it. Worked great and shipping was fast. They are very easy to set up and use takes no time at all. Would recommend.
 This is the best Fitbit for the money. The color is awesome and fits any style. The App is easy to use and tracks pretty much everything. You have so many options for replacement bands, which is a plus.
 I bought this for my husband birthday and he loves it!  Works great!  No problems!
 Came in the wrong size so I returned it
 Fits well and does exactly what it says and more!
 What a great price and a great product. I have used it daily since i purchased and I have had no problems.
 Just what she wanted.  Works great.
 I love this Fitbit! It has been amazing seeing how many steps I take in a day and how much sleep I actually get. It has been motivating for me to walk during the day. Great fit and looks good.
 It only took a couple months for the charge 2 to have issues. The am band won't stay connected to the device anymore. It gets a little better when I make it tighter, but then my sleep doesn't get recorded. The whole thing is constantly falling off and I'm afraid I'm going to lose it one of these times.
 This watch is excellent!<br/>Big improvement over the first generation Fitbit Charge! Setup is easy and battery life is great.<br/> Lots of new functionality.
 I’m so glad I upgraded from the Fitbit Charge HR. I like being able to change out the band. The sleep data on the app now shows your sleep cycle which is great! I also like the larger screen and to be able to read text messages and change the clock face.
 Great product
 Bulkier than I thought it would be and definitely overpriced. But it's a handy device, especially if you do sport and exercise. It's really easy to use and it's interesting to see your trends and stats
 Love this fitness watch. Great ap. Really can keep u tracking your food-water-sleep and exercise level. Highly recommend
 I love my new Fitbit Charge 2, I have had to other Fitbit wristbands and this is my favorite!
 GREAT, NO PROBLEMS!
 I like the product and have had a Fitbit for 5 years but have had numerous issues with the bands.  This latest one I ‘ve had for 6 months and the band broke Again!  I’m trying to glue it myself.
 What a great product!  I wanted to replace my old and ancient  heart rate monitor with a new wearable technology.  I did my research reading many of the negative reviews on this site - and frankly, many of the complaints I read were actually user error!  But I want to provide people with a balanced review:<br/><br/>The good....<br/>* nice fit and comfortable to wear<br/>* does more than I wanted, still exploring the features<br/>* a lot of the functionality worked right out of the box<br/><br/>The bad....<br/>* the product documentation is very limited, which makes it difficult to learn the product<br/>* the apple app &amp; fitbit interfaces are close, but not so much<br/>* to configure the fitbit you need the mobile app - difficult to find because of documentation<br/>* I cannot tell what the battery is left on the fitbit w/o using the mobile app<br/><br/>The ugly....<br/>* sorry don't have anything for this rating
 Track fitness
 great
 After two weeks the screen got very scratched and if you accidentally hit your Fitbit slightly against anything it will chip your Fitbit. Wish they had a more durable Fitbit for active people and outdoor people.
 Works well, easy to get started but I still feel the lack of more detailed product info. Should come with  a user guide. I had trouble figuring out how to charge it.
 Great product
 great
 LOVE IT. I use this mostly as a watch for my day to day activities. I love the tool that helps monitor your breathing, and the hourly points goal really get me motivated to move.
 It does all that is claimed.
 Great deal, great product
 Love this thing have had it a while now .
 Works well and I love the fact that it is easy to change bands. I love the information that can be displayed on the screen.
 WOW. Wish I had read comments more fully before I bought this, based on advice in an article on sleep tracking. This is a horrible solution for sleep tracing. The display comes on whenever you move and it's way too bright for a dark room. Even the little green light that is constantly on between this and your arm is annoying.. Look elsewhere.
 The Charge 2 works perfectly and tracks steps, heart rate, calories burned, and a lot more. I have it set to remind me to walk every hour that I’m awake. I’ve walked a minimum of 10,000 steps every day and feel wonderful.
 Loving it very much!!
 I love my Fitbit, it works great. My only problem was that the band broke but I cheaply and easily got that replaced and it still lasted me a good seven or eight months.
 I really enjoy my fitbit.  The only thing that the charge 2 is lacking is it being waterproof.  Syncs very well with my Android.  I especially like the silent alarm feature.
 Love my Fitbit 2. It encourages me to walk more steps each day.
 Love this tracker.  Now that the charge 3 is out, see how long charge 2 will sync and work well.
 The fitbit works great, but the band or strap does not stay on. It just doesn't snap on like the other side. Comes off all the time.
 Got mine I love it it's very comfortable and very good looking Type of watch/ fitness tracker to rock I'm new customer to FitBit® I'm very satisfied with my purchase I'm definitely going to be looking around and buying more Products!!!
 Magnificent device. Does all it says and very well.  I especially like the way it charts my sleep patterns.  Extremely accurate.  Easy to link tophone or ipad.  Highly recommended
 So far I love my fitbit, just make sure you keep the band really clean or you may have a breakout on your wrist.
 Bought two of these Charge 2 watches.  My daughters love how they work and how they simply sync with their iPhones.
 Enjoy,  tells me if I'm being a couch potato
 I love the charge 2 the battery, heart rate, etc. The reason for 4 stars is that the screen sometimes doesn't turn on when I rotate my wrist up, and I would like to be able to change workout modes on the watch and not just through the app.  I would defiantly buy it again!!
 Strap popped after 7 months!! Was replaced august 2017. Well strap popped agsin 6 months later. Very disgusted and dissappointed. I spend a lot of money with amazon. Need to rethink our relationship.
 Really frustrated with this product.  Purchased in October 2016, after 3 months of daily wear the band began delaminating, one month after that the bluetooth gave out.  I am completely unable to sync with the app on my phone even after reinstalling the software and several factory resets.
 It does everything I wanted and needed it to. Counts steps, heart rate, sleep patterns, reminds me to move, etc. It has the function for you to see your text messages and phone calls very nice!
 Bought it as a present for my husband. He loves it. The fitbit has made him more aware of his daily activity.
 Love this Fitbit.  I liked it so much, I purchased two.
 as advertised and arrived on time.
 Significantly over-counts steps, even when you put it on your non-dominant hand and set it for the dominant hand (which reduces sensitivity).  I was sitting at my desk yesterday and suddenly it's telling me I met my step goal for the day.  I've been at the desk all morning - there's no way I met my step goal.  I'd rather it under-counted than over-counted.  The $99 Fitbit One works much better.
 Love my fitbit!  Love that it tells the time... And also that it tells you when you have a text or call... but can't respond!  I love that!
 Wife got it from me for Xmas.  Uses it everyday, all day (and night). I'd say she loves it.
 Doesn't properly track steps. This is a consistent problem if you look on the fitbit boards. I estimate it only counts about half.
 It just was not for me.
 Purchased as gift. Owner likes it
 This was a gift for best friend and she LOVES it she needs help with the settings from her tech son but she loves it
 A great item, arrived when promised. I have had this item now for 2 months and I love the way it tracks my exercise and sleep patterns
 The watch wristband detaches from the watch easily despite my careful attention. Finally I lost it somewhere when I was wearing it. I had it for only less than 2 months. Won't buy this brand ever.
 Does everything I need. Easy to set up and use.
 Like it that you can switch out the bands.
 Love this! Great product. Fast shipping.
 The band will come apart after a few months/weeks but at least it's replaceable.  The tracker itself is great though!
 Freaking love it.<br/>So much better than the first Fitbit Charge HR.<br/>Love the new breathing technique they added!
 Wonderful.  Excellent performance.
 Product as described, love everything about it
 The product only works for so long until it does not keep track of your steps. Very disappointed with the product.
 Love the fitbit.  Using an app, will track heart rate, steps, workouts, calorie intake, water intake, flights of stairs.
 Excellent. The app that goes with it has lots of great features. I've tried "off brand" watches but I ended up returning all of them. The real fitbit is worth every penny!
 So far it works great. The band is a little bulky is my only complaint.
 I love my FitBit! It has a sleek design with plenty of functionality. It is definitely an upgrade from my Garmin vivo fit! I enjoy competing with friends for steps, the analysis of my sleep, and the heart rate option!!<br/><br/>10/10!
 Worked perfect, wife loves it.
 Loved my old fit bit, but this one is a large step forward.  This is perfect for me.  Wear it always and love the stats.
 Bought for myself.  Really like it.
 good product
 This was a gift. The recipient said it is great!
 makes exercising fun!
 This is my third Fitbit - I keep trading up to get more features.  This version is better quality than those I've owned previously.  No signs of wear after over 6 months.  Lots of cool options.  And I love the purple color.
 My daughter loves it!
 love it. you need to get one
 I love my Fitbit, if you are serious about loosing weight it is your best friend. You will love it
 Husband loves wears to work
 Update.... Another user put detailed directions to settin up S8 +, so i am not getting notifications and raised my rating! I bought this mostly to use the andriod phone notications.  Also the fitness.  Fitness good.  I can't get the phone notifications from my Galaxy S8+. Why!!!!??????
 I haven't had my fitbit charge 2 for a yr yet and it just stopped working. First it wasn't keeping accurate time or reading anything and now it won't even come on. I don't think it is worth the money. I even tried to get help through their website and that was a nightmare!
 My wife loves this thing.  She changes the bands often, which is very easy to do.
 Love this version of fit bit
 I really love the weekly statistics.  Seeing those numbers motivates me to get up and get moving.
 Bought as gift for grandchild.  It is a hit!
 I would call it a glorified pedometer.  I had high hopes but it thinks I'm sleeping when I'm reading, thinking I'm walking when I'm riding the mower, etc.
 Hi, I just got my fit bit yesterday. I love all of the features but it is over counting my steps. It's 630am an I have been up for an hour sitting on my couch and I already have 452 steps which is impossible. Is there a way to recalibrate or fix this? Thank you.
 Bought it as a gift to my dad, and he loved it!! For someone who is not tech savvy like my dad, it is very intuitively designed and easy to use. I love the heart rate feature, and the guided breathing session. I would consider to purchase one for myself too!
 Love my watch, this is my second one and I'm hooked.
 Love, love, love! It even reminds me to move when I've been sitting too long. Easy to read.
 Great product. If you will follow the reminders it will keep you moving.
 So happy I made this purchase and would definitely recommend to anyone.
 Love this...and the notifications are great.
 I love it! It provides me a way to track my activity and food and water intake. It also helps to get me motivated to get moving and get all my steroids in as well as go to the gym. I also like the sleep tracking to let me know how well I am actually sleeping.
 More functions and better battery life than the original Charge. I really like this unit!
 Does the job, fits well, paired with the app it’s a great value.
 Great fitness motivator! Love the essential info it provides throughout the day from number of steps taken to heart rate and calories burned.  Find the sleep information very helpful.
 Wife wears it everyday and has held up without any issues so far
 great
 Awful product. I spent hours attempting to sync it with my phone that is on the compatibility list. Lots of hours with tech support, forums, don't waste your time like I did.
 Great way to keep track of my workouts, steps, heart rate, and sleep patterns. Infinitely better than the zip version I bought a few years ago. Well worth the purchase.
 Everything it said it would be.  I love it!
 So far this Fitbit has been great. I say this with some hesitantly since I've had two fit bits that only lasted half a year. In their defense my lifestyle is very active (dirty garden work etc.) and I wore them everywhere except while in water. The phone techs assured me that this new heart rate 2 model is more durable. We will see. I bought another because it is motivating and I love their app.
 Came super fast and my daughter LOVES it!!!
 This is my first fitbit.I like this fitbit. Heart rate tracking feature is most i like. Battery backup is also good. For me it gives 5 days backup.<br/>Only issue sometime I feel is with fitbit android app. But issues gets fix in next app relese mostly.
 It was exactly what I wanted and easy to sinc to my IPad and phone. Use it everyday all day to track my steps and sleep.
 Got this for my husband as a Christmas gift. He uses it everyday and really likes it
 Good quality, easy to use, attractive,  Accurate for daily activities but erroneous while working out.  On treadmill, with my chest strapped monitor, my HR rate registered low 90's, while Fitbit reads 117.  Tried sever times, same results.  Caution........
 Works great, but I swim and regret not buying the fully waterproof one at a bit higher price.
 Needs a second hand. I see this request of Fitbit constantly. Otherwise, it does what it says it should.
 The fitbit works fine, but the strap on one side keeps coming off.  It's the strangest thing and really inconvenient.  In the middle of exercising or even just walking the simple raising of my arm separates the fitbit strap from the fitbit.  Not happy about it!!  Wish I could just exchange the strap without having to return the entire fitbit.
 Step count off at times, stair count off a tad but it works well. Nothing is perfect
 My husband loves his Fitbit!!
 Product was very easy to set up and get using! Love it so far!!
 I like all the listed features. Only one problem-- at times i have observed that it doesn't count your steps when you are holding a shopping cart or a stroller while walking.
 Doesn't work anymore.  The interface already wore off and won't sync anymore or hold a charge
 Shipping was quick and Fitbit works perfect with almost 7 days battery life don't even have to think about charging like I have to with my apple watch
 Bought for my wife and she loved it.Much better than the fitbit she had before. Loves the heart rate and super easy to set up with phone.
 Love the features of the Fitbit Charge 2 HR, but after only two months of use, the covering on the band began to separate from the end piece connector. This is the same issue I had with Charge HR. Also one of the plastic connectors cracked to the point where it wound not attach any more. Good product but it needs to be made more durable.
 Love this product! Works great and looks great on too! Very happy with my purchase. It's very simple to set up too
 So far I love it. I know I can do more with it but still learning
 Alright, so this was an upgrade from my Charge HR (series 1). Charge HR 1 screen finally cracked, but I got a good 3-4 years out of it so that's fair at that price point.  So far I really love the extra features I can view on the display! The display is also a lot more sturdy and I love that I can change the bands. One of my gripes with my Charge HR 1 was the band. This feature makes it a bit more competitive in the overall market. The fit is also better for me and the screen is much easier to see compared to the small strip on the Charge HR 1.<br/><br/>There is one major fault, that I was hoping would be resolved but only got worse: the heart rate monitor. OK, I know any optical heart rate monitor is going to be really only useful for monitoring trends, but this one is *way off.* If I put the HR 1 on and my resting heart rate reads as 70, the HR2 will read it as 80. There is about a ten point difference. Now comparing this to a manually calculated heart rate (my husband is a doctor), both are still off. My actual heart rate was 68. Not sure why this feature is now more inaccurate? We calculated it several times and I think I'll just have to invest in a chest band if I want accuracy. Once I start actually working out it loses sensitivity and the measurements become erratic. One reason I can stipulate is that I have low blood pressure so my wrist pulse is faint-- but many healthy people have this same problem. Fitbit should consider problem solving for this demographic-- either using an additional monitor that connects or changing the technology in general.  Or maybe calibrating it with a manually calculated heart rate might help.<br/><br/>Overall, for 150$, it is a pretty neat little tool. It keeps me motivated. No, a Fitbit wont make you healthier, and you should use reason when taking the biometrics into account (like pulse and calories burned), but it's still a good motivational and accountability tool. I chose this over the Apple watch, and I would do it again.
 Works really well, trying to get my steps in!
 gave as a gift to my husband and he loves his
 like it better than older model HR
 The device is really good; the bands and attachment leave a little to be desired.  Bands break and not easily (or inexpensively) replaced.
 Very happy with the product
 This device does a wonderful job of tracking my activity and helps me stay conscious of my activity levels! I would love if it were IP67 dust and waterfront resistant as well!
 Great product... fitbit is the police... best accountability device
 The FitBit Charge 2 replaces a fitness band I've worn for about 7-8 years.  So far it offers much more than what I previously wore.  Additionally, it cost much less than the previous brand :)
 This was a wasted purchased. I replaced this early on when I notice that it wasn't counting actual steps. I live and work in NYC and literally this obsecene watch counts my train rides, bus rides and escalators movements as steps. Also when I shake my wrist it jumps the steps to 50-100 steps.<br/><br/>In fact, the only reason I keep the watch is to literally check the time. *Sigh* I hung on to this for soo long to just use it as a time watch nothing else. The only reason I'm writing this review was because my friend was dealt with same thing happen however she just got it refunded and went to Target to get it and hers is perfectly fine. So maybe Amazon has some defective batches cause even the replacement is horrid.<br/><br/>I wasted nearly $200 on a really crappy product that absolutely useless expect the time.<br/><br/> I actually did right informing Amazon this back in January when they issued me a replacement and told me that I could only receive one replacement after that it will be a refund.<br/><br/>My advice get the warranty whether you're purchasing from Amazon or not because if the same thing does happen to you at least you could receive a proper refund out of the 30 day window.
 LOVE THIS NEW FITBIT!!! Upgraded from the flex and I couldn't be happier with it!
 This makes jerkin the gerkin worthwhile. Jerked the gerkin for 2 miles yesterday. Heart rate got over 100 during it. Great for birthday parties.
 Works like it should, has to be a little tight around the wrist to maintain heart rate. Syncs up well with my phone, multiple display options and customizable naming feature.
 perfect fit
 the individual I gave it to really loves it.  It synched with the smart phone without any problem. they are thrilled with it and the amount of information it has.  the especially like the reminder to keep moving.
 My son has been in to weight lifting and staying healthy and he wears this everyday!
 works great  I bought this as a gift and my boyfriend wears it everyday.  He absolutely loves it!!  Great buy!
 Love it
 Love it, everyone should have one and eat better! America we are too fat. Eat to Live not Live to Eat!
 I have had several different Fitbits.  This is my favorite by far.  It seems to be more accurate and the display shows more.
 I bought my fitbit charge 2 HR and fitness early September.  After two months of use I can easily say this product does what they advertise.  I have been pleasantly surprised ( I am usually a skeptic ) and would recommend this product to someone else, in fact, my wife watched me with this and has now purchased one.<br/><br/>Old Hickory
 Enjoy using it and it definitely motivates me to stay on schedule. I like seeing what ‘m doing throughout the day. I didn’t think I would wear it all the time, but it’s so lightweight that you hardly know it’s on. I am very glad I chose to buy it and thank my friend for telling me about the Charge 2!
 Quite simply: Changed my life. I had pre-high blood pressure and the doctor said, "You can manage these with more exercise or medicine. Your choice." So I got a FitBit. It works well, although on rare occasions sometimes loses my heart rate. Stays powered several days before needing recharging. Walking steps is not an exact science -- sometimes the 40 flights of steps I walk daily comes in at 37, 38, 39 or even 41. But that's not a big deal. Love the charts and emails and supportive reminders.
 overall good, but whenever going for bath and leave it alone automatically heart rate goes higher eventually it show everything extra at the end.
 Great product .... I'm loving it !
 Great fitness tracker. App works well.
 I would rate this 4.5 stars.  Overall, good fit for my  wrist.  And pretty easy to use.<br/>But it is not an actual touch monitor.  I hope the future charge 3 could incorporate a real touch monitor. Look forward to it.
 LOVE IT!
 Its so amazing!! Helps me stay on a daily track of goals!!<br/>Great product fast delivery!!
 Great product!
 Great product
 Love my new FitBit. Holds a charge for close to a week!  Has lots of settings, I haven’t even figured it all out yet!
 tested heart rate and it is very accurate. I love the sleep tracking and the hourly steps reminders. This has proven to be a very useful tool for me.
 Just as advertise
 Nice watch bright screen and accurate step count
 It died suddenly two months after  the warranty expired. Fitbit CS offered a 25% off a new product. But we are not going to purchase any Fitbit since there are tones of new brands with much better price and features. --Once was a loyal customer.
 Bought it for my wife, she loves it.
 A very nice upgrade from my previous Fitbit Charge.  Excellent and fast shipping.
 I love my Fitbit. I feel my steps are not calculated to the accuracy I would like. I have adjusted my stride. However I wear it everyday and it really keeps my motivated.
 I have really enjoyed my Fitbit Charge. Super minimal and keeps track of the most important things :) the app is really useful as well!
 My wife hasn't taken hers off except to charge since Christmas. Keeps track of many many things so you can focus on your overall health.
 Product works great but strap broke within first week of use.  Had to get a replacement from Walmart for $10.00.
 I am really happy with the fitbit charge 2 product so far. It's very easy to use and the app. is up to date and also user friendly. Only criticism would be that the graphics on the screen seem very basic (similar to a tamagotchi I had in the 90s)  I feel like that could have improved by 2017. But overall, is a great basic fitness tracker that sinks with my healthcare plan.
 Great device, and even better than the Fitbit Alta, which this replaced.
 Fits the Fitbit Charge 2 perfectly....  easy to put on.
 Love my new Fitbit.  It really pushes you to do more especially if you are in a challenge.  Love it!!!!!
 i really like this. it motivates you!!
 My wife loved receiving this as a Christmas gift
 Love it. Sleek and stylish
 I've used a Fitbit Flex for about 3 years and loved it so much that I decided to upgrade my Fitbit to the Charge 2. I was so excited! I am a hearing impaired person and really could rely on my Flex. It was like an extension of my body. I was able to use the Flex as my alarm in the mornings since I can no longer hear alarms or phones or other things most people take for granted. So I happily ponied up the money for the Charge 2 and tapped my foot waiting for it to be delivered (all 2 days hahaha). I strapped that baby on and set an alarm and it was like a different kind of deafness. Hearing impaired people can really pick up on vibration, even very subtle vibration. For example, when I'm walking my dog, I can tell when she's growling at someone even if she doesn't look any different, because I can *feel* the growl traveling up the leash. Other people walking her haven't been able to notice it. Vibration (and changes is light) is almost like hearing for me, so my body is very tuned to it. That being said... it vibrates enough to notice while I am awake. That vibration isn't sh*t when I'm sleeping. Very bad design. Fitbit claims they did this on purpose due to complaints, but so many people are complaining about the weak vibration that you know it isn't true. It doesn't even vibrate in the same pattern as the Flex, so you don't even have a prayer of recognizing the weak vibration. If I could recognize it, I could probably train myself to pick up the weaker vibration, but noooooooo. So I think it has a different motor (maybe a cheaper one) coupled with having the heart rate monitor between your skin and the alarm. That's my guess. I LOVE all the other features of this Fitbit, which is why I say I'd give it a 5 if the vibration was equal to the Flex. But the vibration is a big deal and not just for me. Plus, it's hardware, so an update doesn't have a prayer of fixing it. I had to buy a bed shaker alarm because of this Fitbit failure, so really I paid the price difference between the Flex and the Charge 2, but also $30 more just to avoid sending this thing back. In other news the walk reminders are so great. I really do love almost everything about it other than the vibration. It's not too comfy, but I've trained myself to ignore it. These with the HR monitors on them really need to be curved for comfort, not just the band, but the face. This will be an excellent purchase for you if the vibration function is not important to you at all :)
 its a Fitbit....nuff said.
 Love it , I got this in order to replace my watch and my flew that I had I have no complaints love it. The o lay thing I wish was that there was a clock face option that have the day of the week on it  not just month and date .
 Love the fit bit but thought since it was water proof, I could wear it to water aerobics, but it can't be submerged in water.
 Great upgrade to the charge hr. This is my fourth Fitbit and I am happy about the upgrades. Battery seems to last a day or two longer as well. It would be nice to see the next Fitbit 100% waterproof to use while swimming.
 The product functions properly.  It tracks everything it is supposed to.  The problem I have with the Fitbit Charge 2 is that the leads where the unit connects to charger is burning my arm.  In order to wear it comfortably, I have to cover the leads with tape.
 Great! I love it. Totally as expected. I've purchased 1 for myself, and 3 as gifts, and we all love them!
 I bought this almost six months ago. At the time, I rated it three stars. I've reduced it to two. In addition to the problems listed in the original post, it also doesn't count floors accurately, regardless of the type of hill or stairs.  Multiple flights will be counted as one or two.<br/><br/> I'm sorry I didn't return it immediately.  If you have a problem with yours, don't bother with the supposed fixes (tighter or looser band and so forth).  Just return it and hope you get one that works. My husband has my old HR and it still works great.<br/><br/>I bought this to replace my Fitbit HR that worked great.  I wanted the larger screen and updated features that this one has, and was initially happy with it.  For example, I really like that it will buzz you to move every hour; that you can do real time tracking with your phone, and you can select workouts.  For the most part it's been accurate.  If you buy one, be sure to measure because some people won't need the large size band anymore--you might do well with a small.<br/><br/>Cons:  The community forums are filled with complaints about heart rate inaccuracies.  I wasn't having that problem until this week.  First, the heart rate didn't show up when I synched the device to my phone.  Now, it's not sensing heart rate at times and at other times, it's SO inaccurate that the data is worthless.  I'm not an olympic athlete, so I'm not being fussy here.  I'm talking about gross inaccuracies.  For example, while biking, I wore a chest strap heart rate monitor for part of the ride.  When I intensified the workout to 85% of max, that number was reflected in the heart rate and my breathing.  Not so on my watch--it said 109bpm.  That's a difference of more than 40 bpm.  Same workout, I used just the hand grip sensors on the bike.  They matched the chest strap results.  Again, the watch was way off.  When I as done, the activity level was so low on the watch that it didn't generate activity minutes though I was biking for 30 minutes.<br/><br/>The Fitbit community makes all types of suggestions--turn bluetooth on and off; synch and resynch the app; reload the app; make sure the sensors are clean; tighten the watch up higher on your arm (maybe they mean my throat..lol).  None of these things worked to fix this.  I've contacted them through the forums and their email help.  Waiting on resolution.  My hope is to return for one that works.  I will write again to update on the results of this.<br/><br/>Next step is to try and return it for a new one.
 Like it.  Happy with my choice.  So far, so good.
 great battery life, cool to have the additional function of smartphone notifications.  it withstands the gross amount of sweat during a vigorous workout.  overall great tracker!
 Got this for my wife for her birthday and she absolutely loved it.  I got her the plum colored one although there are many different color options.  Good for fitness and it looks good just to wear around as well.  Would highly recommend.
 Bought this for my boyfriend back in April. So far he has loved it! It's all he wears. He tells me battery life is great, lasts almost 2 wks at a time. He also has mentioned that even though Fitbit doesn't say it's water proof, he has showered with it (by mistake) and is still works perfectly.
 I use it for tracking sleep only.<br/>It worked pretty well for several months but now it’s always off by hours.<br/>Too bad I bought 3<br/>For Xmas gifts<br/>:-)
 Love the step and sleep tracking. My Charge is synced with my phone so I get notifications when I have messages. On pace with my lifestyle.
 Had it less than a year and the band and broke off.  Screen really doesn't stand up to wear and tear.
 Great black Friday deal!
 This was a nice fit, color was nice and functions well.
 Didn't come with the wireless dongle needed...
 This is an excellent Fitbit.  I would recommend it to anyone
 Love this Fitbit. Keeps me on track.  Easy to use.
 So much better than the original-- Great job Fitbit
 Does its job and i love it
 Setting it up wasn't easy but I like it so far.
 Live it not a problem, better that the old version
 Works well but the band broke after about 6 months
 I like everything about it but ... it was working fine for the first week and then after a week it stoped counting my stairs climbing I tried to reset it but still same  problem
 i love it it tells me everything but when i got it i was disapointed because it said water ressistance and i thought it was waterproof and i cant even take it in the shower
 No integration, no APIs, and no hint that any sort of progress is on the horizon.
 Super fast delivery and I just LOVE it!
 So far everything is great.
 I purchased special edition gold rose as a gift for my wife and band's color started to fad in the first week of use. I am very disappointed!
 Lovvveeeee it!! So much fun!! Totally love all the new features and also the easy way you can change out bands.
 Muy bueno, el manual debe ser más claro.<br/>Llegó a tiempo.
 Bought for myself and I would not do it again. Doesn't count the steps correctly. If I swing my arm it counts it as a step.  Then when the battery lost the first full charge and I charged it the time was way off by hour's.
 Really like the detailed information it provides!
 love my fitbit.
 A great gift to recieve.
 Feels better than the older Charge model which I had bad luck with. Reasonably accurate and hoping it lasts longer
 I haven't had any problems with this device.  I like that it gives you notifications to get up and moving .  Very motivating!
 I ordered two Fitbit Charge 2's. The one that worked properly is GREAT! The one that didn't work, not so much.<br/><br/>I called Fitbit and they were way, way less than helpful. Thankfully, Amazon sent me a replacement and the new one is also working great so far.<br/><br/>I would recommend this product to a friend, provided they didn't have to deal with customer support at Fitbit!<br/><br/>Thanks Amazon!
 The product came out as advertised. Great features and concept. I've become more conscious now about my health especially my sleeping pattern after seeing the statistics. The only minor downside I could think is that the software needs to have more features, like perhaps personalization of the clock faces. But other than that, this product is great.
 Pin broke off after I had this for a week. I replaced the band. Within 3 months, the screen broke. I have no idea when or how it broke. I liked the tech of the product but manufacturing is complete crap. Don't waste your money on such a poorly manufactured device.
 This is my 4th fitbit.  I really like the upgrades on this model.  I have been pleased with my past trackers, but I like this one the best so far.  It fits nice on my rest and haven't notice any discomfort while sleeping.  I only wish it was waterproof.  I would encourage anyone in the market for a fitness tracker to have a go at this one.  It is durable and cost effective.
 I am a little disappointed.  I cannot get the reminder to move to work.  That was one of the main features I was looking forward to on this product.  I work a desk job and sometimes time gets away from me, so a remider to get up and move would be great.  Apparently, I am not the only one with this problem.  Anyway, I am under impressed with the Charge 2 and almost wish I had not wasted my money on it.
 Disappointed. It claims to follow sleep patterns. Some days are not even registered. So how can I trust the other data. Disappointed
 The sleep tracking is not accurate at all. It thinks I'm asleep if I am relaxing on the couch.
 Amazing quality! I am getting one of every color.
 Loving it!  The only complaint I have is that I sometimes get skin caught in the strap to hold the armband.
 I purchased the Charge 2 Fitbit January 12, 2018. The display stopped working yesterday February 27 and I just found out I only had 30 days to return it. Thankfully Fitbit has great customer service and I was able to get satisfactory support directly from them.
 great so far
 Gift for my wife and she now understands the way it motivates you  to do a little bit more. She comes in talking about how she has met her goals!!
 Purchased as gift, unit works well.
 I bought it for my husband for fathers day and he loved everything about the watch and applications but the steps feature is not very accurate. as you move your hand it count it as a step, so is not good to wear it everyday all day. for the most part is great.
 Love it
 She loves hers!
 Love it! Works just as they said it would. Love the blue band, and larger screen than the fitbitHR Inised to have.
 good
 Product is good, works as Fitbit designed it. Seller is not even close to beingas advertised. Ordered it with 2 day shipping and it arrived 2 weeks after order. Maybe they can't figure out what 2 days vs 2 weeks mean, hard concept I know.
 So far so good. If it dies or anything happens to it like others have said, I'll edit my review.
 There is an issue in Fitbit application for sync with wrist band. Still the problem is not resolved by the Fitbit company. So i did not recommend this product to anybody..
 I got really excited when receiving my Fitbit a year ago to help me keep track of my steps and heartbeat. It’s been a year and my Fitbit has already stopped working. I didn’t even use it on a daily basis and only used it twice a week when I went to the gym. 😢
 Love the Fitbit Charge 2. It keeps me motivated and has me walking everyday! It has many great apps you can get to compliment it as well. Great tool!
 Incredibly disappointed that this product would not set up. Fitbit customer service was unhelpful and didn't seem to care about my business. Will be moving to another brand.
 I absolutely love my fitbit. I now can't go anywhere without it! The only thing that I wish it did, is auto sync to the app. Sometimes my days don't actually get synced Or I have to re-sync before a run. But otherwise, a great product!
 I set up my Bluetooth and my notification settings on my FitBit  but still no luck 😔
 I am feeling very nice. I already feel that Iam getting healthier
 Arrived within 2 days. Husband is enjoying very much. Does all it says it will do. Keeps pretty accurate step counts and calories burned.
 Product as described.
 Got this as a gift for my boyfriend. He’s obsessed. Uses it everyday and it works like a charm. Also I love all the features it has
 Started getting black screen in my 13th months often with no reason and gradually the term of symptom shorter.  In my 15th months, screen is totally blacked out. I had kept it very nice as using only in the office though. Not worth it.
 I am very pleased with my fitbit.  I changed the band to one that is a silver mesh and more dressy.  I wear it all the time and it encourages me to walk more. The features such as heart rate, steps climbed, etc. are very useful.
 This is a must have watch.  It is very accurate on heart monitoring.
 I wear it everyday.  I get funny messages like feed me. It works wonderfully.
 Got as a gift and they like it
 Meets all of my expectations and it seems to be farley accurate!
 Have it as a gift to my dad. He loves it, it syns up to his phone perfectly (as long as bluetooth is on
 I really love how it even tracks your sleeping patterns.  Great gift idea for anyone.
 Good price. Nothing ever comes w directions.  However if u look at app it explains.  Sort of
 Very nice watch to record your daily patterns. Battery lasts an unbelievably long time.
 Nice
 Wife lost her Charge 1 HR. So, we got and new one and upgraded to the Charge 2. Very nice. Much improved.
 A bit bulkier than expected but got used to it fairly quickly. Love all the features and would definitely recommend it. Next time I may go with one of the flatter screen styles for a more comfortable fit, but do not have any regrets with this one.
 Nice
 Perfect!
 I love it. I had a Fitbit charge that wouldn't hold charge and this one last 3-4 days on one charge
 It is what the wife wanted
 My Girlfriend loves this! She is able to see text messages, caller ID, etc from her iPhone 6 too.
 Received a defective tracker -- tracked no information and wouldn't synch.  Had to work with Fitbit customer service to get a replacement.  Very disappointed in product quality.
 This fitness tracker is awesome! Beware if you are allergic to latex, save yourself some grief and order a different band.
 My wife love it.
 I have had this watch for about a week. I love it. It has already motivated me to work out more. I sleep better. I eat better. It works great on everything it advertises here. The only thing I wish I did was gotten a smaller size. It’s a little big on me but no bid deal.
 Works great. A little difficult to set up since I had a different Fitbit before
 So far so good!  I've had two break - so I hope this one lasts longer!
 purchased as a gift and the person loves it.  Does what it is suppose to do without any hiccups thus far;  great motivator.
 I really like the product however the engineering to attach the bands is very poor. I have been thru three bands now. The plastic attaching the fitbit to the band broke.
 My wife loves it and uses it all the time. It even shows iPhone messages
 The competitions are a super fun way to get and stay active. Consistency that you can achieve by tracking your steps can help you get more fit and lose those extra pounds.
 The date and time is wrong and unable to sync up by following the customer service's advice and from its website.
 Great motivator to get moving.  I've had an older fitbit for the last three years and this is a big leap forward.  I've found the pulse feature is accurate when I compare it with my treadmill pulse sensors and phone app.  Also, the app features are well designed.  I really like my fitbit charge 2.
 The belt comes off so often. It should have come with a spare belt. It costed me $200+ and within 6 months the belt is falling apart.
 Love it!! Makes me challenge myself! Long lasting battery
 Love it!  Wear it all the time!
 It's very nice,I bought it for my mother,she loves it,and all the features.
 Love it, love it! I've lost 20 pounds since I started wearing this thing.
 Bought this watch for my wife , she loves it. No problems so far.
 Overall, I like this tracker. I had a charge HR until it finally gave out on my and I originally purchased a Blaze.  The Blaze was nice, but it did things I didn't need.  This is slimmer on the wrist.  I also really needed a clock face with the seconds, and this charge 2 does.  I miss the ability to just hold in on the side button to start active minutes like my old HR had.  Overall, good quality tracker.
 Very exact and provides a lot of information.
 Love the fitbit but this one was wider than I prefer. Returning and buying the narrower version.
 Best Fitbit product that I have tried. Love the fact that it keeps your heart rate also.
 I love my fitbit.. Wear it all the time.
 This product is not what it is advertised to be.  IT DOES NOT MEASURE STEPS YOU TAKE.  It measures are movement.  Try keeping your are immobile and walk a mile (I did it) and it will say you walked ZERO steps.  But stand still or sit and wave your arm about and it will say you walked hundreds of steps.  Same applies to the AM.  Before you get out of bed it will say you have already walked hundreds of steps due to your movements during the night.  Also, why pay for an expensive trendy hoohaw to track your meals, foods, work outs, calories, etc. when there are dozens of FREE APPS that will do the exact same thing.  Finally, if you are in touch with your own body even a little bit you know if you had a good nights sleep by how you feel and function during the day.  Fitbit and others like it are just taking advantage of the latest fitness craze to take money our of your pockets.
 I  got in on Saturday and so far I love it. I bought several from other companies and they were a piece of junk.  Should of purchased a Fitbit months ago
 As described. However I don't use it because I found one l like better
 had an old fitbit charge and after a couple of years it came apart.  Bought this one and I like the hour wake up alerts to get you moving.<br/>and you heart rate.
 Received the fitbit2 just over a month ago and it failed a few days ago (stopped counting steps).  The 30 day return period has expired for Amazon return so now I'll find out whether fitbit will replace it.
 Buy the screen protectors. I didn't and sorely regret it. Now I have an annoying crack in my screen and fitbit or Amazon won't return it even though I've only had it for 20 days. Be careful, they are not very sturdy. As for tracking, it's ok. I had a flex and the only thing that's better is the HR monitor. I don't think it was worth the money.
 Works great. Was able to use it to get my HRA score up to get me into a better premium
 Literally just got this and I'm a little disappointed.  Heart rate and steps are wayyyyyyy off!
 I love this tracker.  It gives me all the information I want with a tap on the screen.
 I am loving this Fitbit.  It really does motivate me to exercise and reach my personal goal.
 Fast and accurate
 Love this upgraded version of the charge HR. I like that it will display your text messages now.
 Bought for my son. He loves it!
 Everyday use love my fitbit
 The prompts are great if you are being a lazy lima bean sitting on the couch
 I find this incredibly uncomfortable. It's cool, but if u can stand to wear it. You have to wear it tight to get a decent reading. It leaves indents on my wrist. Pass.
 I love my fitbit!
 much better then earlier versions
 The band came u glued within a few months.
 I absolutely love my Fitbit. Works fantastic and really keeps track of everything. I especially love the sleep portion as well as the caloric tracker on the app.
 works great
 I like the charge 2.  I bought it after losing my Fitbit One.  It is easy to wear and also functions as a watch.
 great
 It's great! Supports all my needs for a smart watch.
 Love fitbit products.
 Great item. Husband wears all the time. Definitely keeps him active. Shipped quickly
 Good
 Does a great job showing steps, heart rate and all the things that it should. The only thing that I wish it had was a better way to log weight lifting sessions as the heart rate does not really do the trick, as it isn't cardio.
 Love, Love, Love my Fitbit!  It has helped me improve my exercises and health.
 LOVE LOVE LOVE my new Fitbit. I had the first charge and loved it but I love this one more. Great battery life, I haven’t switched out the band and probably won’t because this is cute enough to wear with anything.
 Screen cracked after 4 months.<br/>Did not drop, strike, or otherwise abuse the device.<br/>This is apparently not covered by warranty.<br/><br/>If it were to stay intact, actually tracks nicely.<br/>Just not going to buy these twice per year.
 Good quality!!! Thank you!!!
 The band keeps coming disconnected and that's a pain because it is too big for me even though is it a small.  I don't know whether to order a new band or keep this one (with the very real prospect of it falling off sometime.
 Love it. Does so much more than I expected.
 Purchase was tor my husband, he likes all the features it has to offer.
 Use it every day
 LOVE the rose gold and the fact that the bands are interchangeable! So excited to use it!
 I bought the extension plan for this asurion and the will not respond to my complaints the tin is going away the heart rate will not work I have tried to reboot it several times it is I st getting worse
 love it, does what I need it to do and more.
 It worked great for the first 3 days, I would get notifications for text and calls but after 3 days it stopped working. Other than that it worked great.
 Update - after having this for a while, I've found that the vibration is so weak that I cannot feel it most of the time. It is useless to me, and I had been relying on these silent alarms. The hour "reminder to move" is useless, as well, because of the weak vibration. I am seriously considering going back to the Charge HR. I have missed meetings, I have to go back to an audible alarm in the morning (I get up an hour before my wife). I'm not happy with this, especially at $150.<br/><br/>My Charge HR has lasted nearly two years and the band was starting to separate. I disliked the non-replaceable (?) wrist band, but otherwise, it did its job as described. The Charge 2 came out and I debated upgrading, then I learned of the hourly "reminder to move" feature and that I could replace the less than desirable wrist band, and so I upgraded.<br/><br/>With the new wrist band installed (UMTELE Milanese Loop), it is wonderful. Setup with my existing FitBit app was very easy and its data is merged seamlessly with my existing data. The battery life is much better than the Charge HR, probably has a bigger battery.<br/><br/>I do have one complaint - the vibration is not as strong as on the Charge HR. I was able to use the Charge HR to wake me in the morning, now I'm sleeping through the Charge 2's silent alarm. Likewise, I often miss the reminder to move. I was counting on the reminder to move while on long drives, ten minutes is plenty of warning to pull over and walk 250 steps, which is actually not very much as I have discovered. I would happily sacrifice some of the battery life for a stronger vibration.
 By far one of my favorite purchases ever! Not bulky at all!
 This is not my first Fitbit. My first was the One and I loved it. I was not interested in updating to any of the wrist Fitbits until this model came along. Some people were complaining of the band wearing out with the earlier models. Well with this one you can change out the bands easily. I ordered the plum but already am planning on ordering a black band and also a blue band and maybe even a leather band. I like that it will automatically record my sleep. My One recorded sleep but I had to remember to set it to record sleep every night by pushing the button. I like it that it reminds me that I need to get up and get more steps in to get in 250 steps for the hour. As a matter of fact while I was sitting here at my computer doing the review it buzzed me to let me know that I had not gotten in all my steps and that I had to do 88 more. It will buzz me when goals are met.  It's fun to look at it and see how my heart rate changes with each activity that I do. I love the stopwatch functions. I like every function of this Fitbit. It does every thing my One did and much more!<br/><br/>Now for the cons: It is not as accurate as my One. It does not record every step. It just doesn't. I will sometimes swing my arms upward to make sure it counts. Another advantage of the One is the battery life. My One will last up to 10 days. The Charge 2 HR will only last a maximum of 5 days or less.<br/><br/>I don't think you will regret getting this device. I prefer this one wrist one to the other two which are above it which are the Surge and the Blaze. Those models are just too bulky for my wrist. This  Fitbit is just right.
 This is wonderful, more than I expected.  I love it and the watchband is fabulous
 The fit bit does not charge fully and needs recharged within 8 hours. Very disappointed with purchase.
 Does what it supposed to do. I enjoy using it to track steps and measure heart rates.
 I think I have become dependent on the heart rate monitor. Great step tracker to keep me on my feet, most days I fall short of my goal. Doesn't seem to track my stair climbing well, though. Sometimes I climb at least 20 times in a house with 2 sets of about 15 steps and it will only count 4 or so.
 This item was sold as new but is not. The package was missing the charger and the screen is scratched. Probably a return.
 Love it.
 I need to clarify my rating. I gave it a 3 because if the sizing of the band. In the website it says to measure the wrist, and go to the next size up if in between sizes. I did but the band was way too large. Had to return the X-lg and order the lg. The Fitbit itself gets a 5 rating!
 Mom bought it! Dad loves it!! :) We recommend it!
 Everything about this unit is faulty.  It doesn't record accurate steps, calorie entries, heart rate, sleep hours or exercise.  I have worn it 3 months in an effort to work around/with it's faults.  The final straw for me was when it started recording elliptical workouts in my sleep.  I googled to see if others were having the same problem and it was easy to find a lot of people commenting on the same problem.  An absolute waste of my money and no way to return it.  Before you purchase look up how many people report flaws and read a ton of reviews.  You'll find it is not worth your money and you should look at other units before purchasing this one.
 I REALLY LIKED THE WATCH AND IT'S PROFORMANCE. THE ONLY THING THAT I DID NOT LIKE IS THAT I CAN NOT FIND  WATCH BAND ON YOUR SITE THAT FITS MY ARM. IF YOU COULD DIRECT ME TO WERE I CAN GET A LARGER WATCH BAND (BEFORE I LOSE MY WATCH) I WOULD MUCH APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU.
 I loved my charge hr and didn't think I needed to upgradesnof the charge 2 but only a few days in and I love it!!!! The display is huge in a good way and I love that I can see my steps on the display without scanning through. I really like that you can select the activity you are doing such as running or weightlifting and the time you are doing it for. So so happy I got the charge 2!!
 Love it! Upgraded from the Flex. Battery lasts a week, I am very happy with it.
 I use this everyday  great and is as good as my 1st one
 Tried running with it.  HR reading was hit/miss.  I could not see display in daylight.  Returning.
 I had the very first FITBIT and needed to upgrade to a fitness tracker. Looked at Garmins and Apple watch. The price and functionally with the FITBIT along with size and style eventually helped me make the decision. Fitbit integrates with Garmin and MyFitness Pal to track exercise and food intake. It has text alerts, movement alerts and tracks sleep. Very nice product.
 Love that we can get phone notifications now and change the bands out. Only familiar with Fitbit Charge HR. Highly recommend.
 My best Fitbit! Waterproof and the battery lasts way longer!
 Was really excited to get this. Loved my Fitbit 1 and was looking forward to the new features. Sits up high on wrist. Gets sweaty fast. Isn't the most comfortable fit either. Love the features not the fit.
 Like it so far, a little big and uncomfortable though. Wish i would have gone down or up to the blaze
 This has been amazing!!! I got it last week and I've already lost 5 lbs just by being able to visibly see progress and set goals!
 I have only had this fit bit for a day but I like being able to track my steps and my sleep. I plan on using all the options fully but haven't had time yet. Love the color but I'm also excited to be able to switch the band.
 I like this because of the user replaceable band!
 This is my second one and I love it.
 Hood
 The band does not stay attached to the watch, reaching out to manufacture to see what they will do
 Enjoying watching my progress.  Nice size screen... no need to squint.
 I'd like it if the battery stayed charged for more than 24 hours.  It spends more time in the charger than on my wrist.  It'll spend the night in the charger, be fully charged, and then die in the afternoon because the battery is dead.  Absolutely useless.
 Don't settle for something less.  This fitness tracker is the best and the app is great!
 Excellent product.  The interchangeable wrist bands are great.  Good selection available online.
 Love this
 I previously had a purple fit bit hr and loved it. My husband ordered me the lavender rose one recently and it is lovely. I would have rated it a 5 but I am extremely disappointed that my band is already turning color. Very upsetting for such a high priced item. I'm hoping the seller can make it right.
 good product, still learning what this fitbit does..
 What can I say...? Love it! Upgraded from charge and i really like the new features.
 Bought this for my mom, she likes it a lot!
 This device doesn't accurately track steps or distance/mileage traveled. I have used it since 2/1/17 on a daily basis to track walks, biking miles and sleep. I have simultaneously used it linked to my cell phone with GPS on for the walks and biking miles. I have simultaneously compared it to MapMyRide which I have turned on at the same time as the Fitbit Charge 2. I have walked and biked specific known mileages and actually counted the individual steps per known specified tenth of a mile lengths on walks. I have used the default stride length for my height (71 inches male), have actually measured out stride length for set distances and then have adjusted the stride length accordingly to the specific length. I have compared the steps noted for specific lengths of walks on MapMyRide and simultaneously for Fitbit Charge 2. The number of steps for Fitbit differs from MapMyRide by about 700 steps for a 4.5 mile walk even though I had GPS enabled simultaneously for both my cell phone and the Fitbit Charge 2 during the walk The Fitbit Charge 2 underreports the steps. No matter what adjustment I make on the device, nothing works to accurately report steps and distance. I'm going to ask Fitbit for my money back and will never buy anything by them again.
 Nice gadget for health maintenence.
 I had a fitbit alta and mind you, I loved it. I decided to upgrade to the charge 2. I love it even more. I LOVE IT. Its great for exercising because you can calculate your calorie loss and fat burn. I love all the features to be honest. And for me, its even better than the alta.
 Love it! I use to have the orignal flex &amp; this is o much better! The only one thing I'm not thrilled about is the battery life, I find I have to charge it twice a week. I don't know if it is because it is setup to sync all day or not.. that is the recommended setting though.
 Yes am enjoying my new Fit bit...like the large readings, the date and time, steps and heart rate.  Want to buy another one for my husband.
 Great Product! Wonderful functionality!
 I love this Fitbit but unfortunately the band was falling apart. By following the link via support I was able to get a replacement without any difficulties! Great service!
 It's great; But, I have some disappointments. Firstly, it gathers a lot of raw data from me, including heart beats per minute and et cetera. But, failed to generate useful information from them. There are sufficient rooms to improve in the field of wearable gadgets in my opinion. Anyway, This is the first time I use a wearable gadget and I'm almost satisfied with this product.
 Delivered on time and in good condition. Tracker works as designed. The app is great to use as well for tracking all of your activity as well as sleep! Fitbit sends you emails to help guide you to use the functions of the watch to maximize use.
 awesome!!!!! good quality!!!!
 He loves it
 My second one. Other one fell off my wrist with the older kind of attachment. This band is secure
 Very happy HR close to readings at Doctor Office.
 love this Fitbit! Keeps track on everything and the batteries last for at least 5-6 days.
 Bought as a gift.
 I have had my charge 2 for well over a year now. I love it!!!!!!!
 he loves it
 awesome its a fitbit charge2 nough said!
 not very accurate.. registers hand movement as steps
 Works good but kind of a big drain on cell battery
 Love tracing my steps.  Easy to recharge.
 As expected.
 It is my first Fitbit, pretty good, love the feature to read text, but sometimes it is a bit glitchy on the count for steps, not so bad that I'm complaining though, it is based off heart rate versus motion like any other, so I expect any type will have some small glitches here and there. It isn't horribly bulky which is the main reason I got this.
 Worst watch ever, it just count steps (feature that is already available in the smartphones).<br/>It doesn’t track spinning, cardio, weights lifting, lower abs workouts.<br/><br/>I’m totally upset with the money I paid for it.
 I love this Fitbit. Excellent way to track exercise, sleep and calories.
 Just what my husband wanted.  Great quality. He had no problem syncing it with his computer.
 I previously had the Alta but this seems more accurate to me and I love the fact that it monitors my heart rate.
 I'm going to keep this short and to the point.  I like the Charge 2 form factor.  It's comfortable. But it lacks a couple,of things that makes it less desireable for me.<br/><br/>First - the notifications are woefully thin.  All you get are three types - calls, messages and texts.  Just about all of its mainstream competitors goes beyond and gives you full notifications.  I have lots of push notifications that I depend on.  So this is a deal breaker for me.<br/><br/>Second - the screen availability is woefully unreliable.  Far less reputable devices don't have the trouble the Charge 2 has in displaying the time just by lifting your wrist.  In most cases you have to push to button to light up the screen.<br/><br/>Beyond that, HR tends to be mostly reliable compared,to other devices, although calorie burn is not as reliable.<br/><br/>There are better choices.
 great
 My Charge 2 is less than 5 months old and it has just stopped working.  I followed directions on the web site and I cannot get it to charge. It is beyond the 45 day warranty, what do I do?
 Wife loved it and it has a lot of features. Looks great and so far ahs been working as expected.
 Love it!! I can't imagine life without it now. :)
 Less than three months the band broke . I didn’t get it wet, rarely wore to bed. I’m going to try to get s replacement band the first fit bit I had the starter part broke and it was no longer useable. I won’t purchase another one-next time I’ll get an Apple Watch
 Easy to use, easy to understand and long battery. I start to do more exercises and movements than before, good
 Amazing product.
 Small Screen
 It's great, hubby uses it all the time
 Works really well and is fairly accurate. Helps me keep up with taking care of myself while taking care of my newborn.
 I Really Like My Fitbit and glad I chose this one over some others that I considered.
 I love this!  It's like having a fitness coach on your wrist.  Don't really understand the people who leave less than positive reviews.  I got the limited edition and it's gorgeous! Works like my old Fitbit, but this one, when I flip my wrist, shows the time, steps AND heart rate. I like that I don't have to push the side to scroll through the options to see them.
 Wonderful way to stay on target!
 My 10 year old loves it
 Doesn’t keep a charge for a couple of days
 Such a cool product. Gave it as a gift to my dad and he loves it.
 Love this thing, it's  like  having  positive  peer pressure  on your wrist. I desperately  needed  the sleep  tracker and the challenge  feature  keeps  me  moving.
 I love this new fitbit. The screen is easy to read, especially compared to the original, and the slim watch face looks nicer. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a fitness tracker.
 If you're not using the workout functions super often, you can go almost a week on a charge.
 This device does not accurately count steps.  If i wave my hand, it is counted as a step, if I sit at my desk entering data, steps are racking up.  I'd like to think I'm walking 14,000 steps a day, but I'm not.  disappointed.  It tells time very well
 I bought this to see if it would motivate me to get moving. It does what I wanted. Just knowing I have it on makes me get and move.  It even tells me when I have been siting too long to get up and move.
 I have a fit bit that I used - I'd gone through 2 of them in the last 5 years , so I thought I'd purchase this one to help monitor my sleep - since I had purchased a Zinus Memory Foam Mattress.  It works.
 Works as advertised and overall a well polished product. The FitBit app is also well executed.<br/>Small drawbacks: personally the band can be more comfortable on the hand and the release mechanism can be better.<br/>Also, FitBit should add a night mode that prevents the screen from turning on by accident at night.
 Love these!! I'm ready for the versa now!! Great quality and wonderful product! Can't wait to buy the versa!!
 Love my Fitbit Charge - inspires me to move and exercise .
 band broke in less than 3 months, trying to get a replacement is ridiculous from them!!!!!<br/>don't recommend
 It was defected and it counts wrong data on the watch, for example it counts steps while it is sitting on the desk.<br/>I contacted Fitbit and they stayed it is defected and they will contact me soon to know how to return it, as I’m currently not in the US I’m in Jordan
 Very happy with this! I am a cook and I use the stopwatch and clock functions at work while tracking my steps. I have dropped it in a sink, and it still works great! The wrist flick motion is super convienent when I need to see the time/stopwatch but have gloves on.
 So far I am loving this Fitbit.  I like all the information it gives me, including letting me know I have a phone call or text.  The heart rate monitor seems to be pretty accurate for me and I love the look of it with the changeable bands.
 Love it. Durability seems good. Slim design is not overwhelming on wrist.
 Ive had the fitbit charge 2 for little over a month now. Im not an athlete but a 60 year old man who spends a little time trying to stay in shape. The app/display are very good. The features of the fitbit are very good.<br/>Some of my observations: General fitness in tracking is good. Bicycle tracking,heart rate,distance,avg speed,etc(bringing phone) is very good. Resting heart rate and sleep log,very good. Calorie tracking,steps,number of miles walked in a day seems very off... Especially,calorIes in vs calories out as I havent lost a pound yet,even though if accurate,I would of lost several pounds. The Eliptical machine I use at the gym, The fitbit is often erratic- meaning my heart rate is pegged at 187, even though typically with the exrcise program and machine I use- typical heart rate is about 118-125(consitantly 3 times a week). Im not a runner so I cannot comment on that.<br/>Overall it is still somewhat a useful device but maybe future software updates may level out some of these discrepencies.
 Been wearing this Fitbit since last December so far so good it still works great.
 good
 I upgraded from a fitbit Charge.  I loved my original fitbit but wanted to upgrade. This has many features that I have yet to explore but love the fact that it tells me when I have texts and calls as well as who is contacting me.  I like the notifications when i have been idle for too long as well.
 It’s junk.
 My granddaughter so loves this Fitbit. Her favorite color is purple and I looked everywhere, but Amazon was the only place I could find it during the holiday season.
 Great for school aged kids
 Bought as a gift for my husband, &amp; he really seems to like it. I have an older version of the Fitbit Charge &amp; love it!<br/>I used Amazon locker for the first time. It was perfect! I was able to pick it up at my convenience, while not having to worry about the package getting stolen off my porch.  It also came earlier than expected.
 I wear it daily and even sleep with it on so I can track my sleep. I love that its a watch and it keeps my heartbeat and everything else. It's great!
 The wife loves this
 A gift for a 20 yr old. Loves the sleep pattern and step counting. App with friends.
 Worked well for a few months, one day it wouldn't stop vibrating and it turned off completely. I charged it, even tried resetting it...nothing worked.
 I love this new Fitbit. The features are amazing and easy to read. I can see texts and incoming calls with keeping my phone on my desk at work or in my purse or back pocket. Would I buy again - yes. Good price on Amazon during the holiday sales.
 Bought this for my boyfriend. He loves it. It's perfect
 Love my fitbit charge 2.  It does everything I wanted it to and is very comfortable to wear, even to bed.
 disappointed ..I can not synchronize it .. I'm using Huawei devices. I have more than 2 days train it took days .. trying .. and I do not get it....  It may not be compatible with my phone ???
 Awesome delivery fast mom loves it. Easy to use and motivates her to move more. Bonus she loves the color
 I love this!!!
 She loved it, months later...still does.
 Of all of the features, I like the step tracking and sleep tracking best.
 Luv it!!.  A new part of my fitness program.
 Gift for wife.  Loves it!
 Product is good works well the strap has broken within 4 months of purchasing so that is a disappointment for 125 $ product.<br/>I have seen many of my friends who bought it in the stores also have the same problem
 Gift receiver liked it
 Does exactly what I need it to do.  Thanks!
 Exactly what I expected. Enjoy this product very much, especially the breathing exercises and the sleep tracking
 Fitbit helps encourage me to take a walk or to get moving. I like being part of the Fitbit community to see how my steps rank against friends and co-workers.<br/>Tracking sleep, number of hours and resting heart rate has also been great!
 Love it.
 Love my fitbit Charge 2...
 Easy to use and customize.
 Love it wear it all the time
 I absolutely love my fit bit charge. It keeps me moving with reminders all day.
 Nice and received on time..
 We love our Fitbits - they help to keep us committed to a healthier and more active lifestyle and give us insight to our sleeping patterns. There's always room for improvement and the Fitbit makes that improvement possible and measurable. Well done guys!
 Battery life is not a week long
 Love my Fitbit Charge 2.  Love the sleep analysis.  Plus it gets me up and moving - especially competing against my siblings.  I hate to see them win.
 This is a replacement for the original Charge HR. I loved that one. I like this one. Small things but it is still a great tool to have.
 Quick delivery and working great
 February 24, 2017 - I've been wearing this device for over a month. It started out great. I really enjoyed tracking my steps, monitoring my hear rate and the extra benefits my company offers for tracking my activity through a Fitbit. About a little over two weeks ago ago I started noticing a rash on my wrist. I initially ignored it. I figured it was that the band was wet or maybe dirty, so I made sure to dry it and wipe it down, to no avail. The rash persisted. I stopped wearing the band for a week now and applying cortisone which usually does the trick in a day or so, and I still have the rash. Feeling the need to count my steps again, I foolishly wore it yesterday on my other wrist and made sure not to wear it at night in the hopes of being able to use the device again. I woke up this morning to a rash on the other wrist too. Now I'm finding all these articles with people complaining about the same thing blaming it on the "cheap elastomer band". I just contacted Fitbit Customer Support and am waiting to hear back what the propose as a solution. Very disappointed that a company that espouses healthy living would put out a product that has a known health risk.<br/>_____________________________________<br/>January 24, 2017 - I've had a prior version of a Fitbit that you could clip to your belt. I really like this one much better because it monitors your pulse, which reveals a lot more about whehther you are relaxed or stressed. It is also not as easy to lose (my prior one got accidentally washed and dryed before I realized it; it never recovered). I had been using my cellphone to track my steps, but I find this to be much more accurate. It also has a "Relax" mode that guides you through some surprisingly relaxing breathing exercises. I use it when I go running, and it can automatically detect that I had been running, although I prefer to manually start the app before I hit the road. Additionally, my company has a program that offers financial incentives and rewards based on Fitbit activity. I am enjoying it.
 Arrived on time. Works great. Thanks!
 This is Fitbit #3 for me and so far I love it.
 This is a good Fitbit device.  Its sturdy and you can exercise with it on your wrist. Sweat proof.
 Excellent!  I use it every day to keep track of my exercise and heart.
 What a beauty!! The rose gold and lavender Charge 2 is gorgeous! I love the updates as well. The breathing sessions are great when I'm at work. I also love that you can choose an exercise and track it right from your tracker! I also like the  cardiovascular fitness update.  I switched to Apple Watch after having the charge HR. But I just couldn't get into the Apple Watch. I always found myself trying to justify having it as it  didn't motivate me.  I missed the challenges with my fit bit friends.I went back to the Fitbit with this rose gold Charge 2 and I also got Fitbit Blaze in the gold series with the pink band.  I've always loved Fitbit. I'm a Fitbit girl all the way! ❤️
 Like this much better than the black but still masculine
 nice
 Great fitness tracking device. It's been very accurate for me and I've noticed you can almost get addicted at doing more steps lol. If I see I only need 500 more steps before bed I'll get it to have another 1000 under my belt lol. I'd like there to be a crossfit Option for workout but apart from that it's great 👏🏽👏🏽
 LOVE IT, WORKS GREAT
 great product
 Very pleased with product. Have recommended to several.
 The fit bit is very nice, except I haven't had it to long and the wrist bad has broken. You will have to get an extra one.
 Love mine, lol it is telling me to get up and move right now so see yall later!!!!! lolol
 Had a previous charge and the new design is much easier to use, also very flattering. Would buy again for sure.
 I had a fitbit that was the cheap one, fell a part this one I live a lot better.
 love it
 Love!!! So easy and addictive to use!
 It's a great product. Does exactly what I bought it to do. Track heart rate, sleep, activity levels. And the motivators one gets from Fitbit, encouging more activity, etc. is a great feature. I also appreciate being able to compare my steps walked with friends and to occasionally give them "nudges".
 dumbest thing ever!!!<br/><br/>Logs driving as steps taken. Logs elevation changes while driving as floors climbed.<br/>The only solution they seem to have is to manually delete logged steps and floors through their app which is cumbersome. They should be embarrassed with this poor interface and their response on how to "work-around" the issue.<br/><br/>The whole idea of one of these wearables is for it to be automatic!!! to be accurate!!!<br/><br/>Fitbit, please spend an hour of programming time and update the device and app to negate driving as exercise!!!<br/>Seems like an easy algorithm. If me and my fitbit are traveling at 60mph and my pulse rate is 60, it's safe to say I'm either superman or i'm driving!!!
 sophisticated
 It's pretty good.  It doesn't always properly monitor my heart rate while I am at the gym.
 Absolutely amazing and love that you can set your alarm to go off on the fit bit. It is always giving reminders to keep moving as well and everything can be customized on the app. Would recommend very simple and straight forward.
 Bought this for my son for Christmas and he loves it!
 Wife and I both wear one.  Love the competition it inspires between us.
 my husband love his fitbit.  he has teeny tiny wrists, the small fit perfect.
 My wife loves it. She has used a Fitbit for a long time, but this has been better.
 Love the band and love how fast I received it!
 The strap is light, fits well and looks smart. Very easy to attach.
 Upgraded from the Charge HR. Really like the updates/features in this model with the exception of the silent alarm. The alarm has much less power (maybe 50%) less than the earlier model.  Cannot depend on this as a true alarm.
 The Fitbit Charge 2 is a great product and it is a great improvement over the original Charge HR.  Th only issue where the Charge HR surpassed the Charge 2 is the intensity of the vibrating alarm/notification for the wrist unit.
 Bit bulky with the heart monitor but overall I love it.  Great to be able to interchange bands.  Does everything I wanted and more.
 Love it
 I like my fit bit charge 2.  Keeps me motivated to keep moving.  It even gives me little hoorays as I hit goals.  Just wish there had been a instruction book included when I received it.  It does give some instructions as you proceed through the weeks.
 nice product
 Love this fitbit. Not only is it limited edition. I also love tracking my sleep and accurate step counter
 I purchase this Fitbit on July 2nd  and it stop working on January 2nd
 This works just right, had everything but the GPS, but the phone GPS does the rest
 Worth the money. Replaced my 3 year old charge that just fried after a update. This is by far a nicer product.
 I'm loving this! Keeps me aware of my moving!
 Love it. Its doing a great job of tracking the info I desired.
 This one is not for me.  It works but must remove to take a shower, must activate to see functions, and stopwatch goes black after 10 or so seconds making it impossible to view exercises with 15/20 second intervals.  I'm going back to submersible polar watch at half the $150 cost.
 This is my third version of Fitbit.. each one is better than the last.. this one id by far the best I have had!!!
 The replacement works great. Had to return original as it was the wrong size.
 I love this Fitbit. Keeps excellent track of my progress.
 Love it !
 What can I say? Fit Bits are awesome.
 This was a replacement for my first Fitbit that wouldn't update. This one is great. I love it!
 I bought this fitbit as a gift and I purchased one for myself a while back. Both of them are less than 4 months old and both have stopped working correctly although cleaning and care instructions were followed.
 will buy later
 My wife loves it.  You'll need to set some things up with your cell phone or computer (diet, food, etc.), but once you have the data in it is a great little device.
 I would recommend a protective cover but works great.
 Loved by my wife for her birthday!
 I bought this product to help me with my fitness goals. I love everything g about it
 Just what I expected!
 I like this better than my Alta.
 Bought this for my wife. She loves it.
 Heart rate monitor stopped working after a couple months of light use with no damage &amp; had to have fitbit replace
 I purchased as a gift for my husband.  He loves it and is really walking more and fascinated by the sleep app. I also got the screen protectors and they were so easy to install.
 Works great
 Bought it for my wife she wear it all the time
 great
 Love this.  I bought it specifically to be reminded to move hourly at work.  The vibration is not as strong as my previous Fitbit and I hope that they will improve this in future versions.  However, most of the time I feel the triggers and I am very happy with my purchase.
 This was a gift for our son Mark and so far he is pleased with it.
 Easy to use.
 Great product!! This Fitbit is all you need in a fitness tracker. Unlike other, more expensive fitness trackers, the Charge 2 allows you track your steps, sleep, and workouts, without having to have a huge screen. The ability to receive notifications is a huge bonus too!!
 Was as Advertised
 lost 30 lbs
 Band broke yesterday, didn't even last 6 months.  Junk.
 Got my Fitbit Charge 2 today.  Love it!  Amazing price on launch day from Amazon!<br/><br/>Great device from Fitbit, ready for more bands!
 It works well. i just wish i had gotten it sooner.
 LOVE IT! I swore I would not get into this FitBit craze. But ultimately (and begrudgingly) bought one for my employer's health plan. I have been pleasantly surprised and sure glad I got one. It is a great tool that keeps me accountable. Very easy to use with the app. Definitely worth the purchase!!!
 great item
 Love it! Had the 1st one and this one is somehow even better!
 I loved the original charge hr. It only had a problem of the band falling apart. This one had another problem more annoying than the first. I used the charge HR as silent alarm. It had a powerful vibration. The charge 2 had such a weak vibration,I barely felt it in the morning. The HR would automatically go into snooze if I don't get up right away. The new one somehow doesn't do that correctly and would stop snoozing after first snooze or if I moved my arm. It is more stylish than the last though.
 Sleep monitoring only works some nights and gps is less accurate than some phone apps
 Easy to use.  Great functionality
 This little devise has changed my life!!  I have to meet my daily goal!!  It has got me going again!!
 My wife loves her watch. It has many cool features and gave her some insight about her sleeping patterns enough to be tested for sleep apnea. Only issue is she had an allergic reaction to the band but we replaced it with a metal one and no problem so far.
 Tracking my exercise and my sleep pattern has been very helpful.
 Love it!!! HELPING ME MOVE MORE FOR SURE.
 Me encantó mi Fitbit Charge 2 😍
 The straps started to peel off after using this for about 6 months.
 Specifically bought this Fitbit to get my phone calls and messages. It doesn’t work. Bought in October and the tech support is still working on the problem. Keeps track of my steps well enough but still disappointed. Could have gotten a free app on my phone for that.
 Love this band, just wish I could swim with it..
 Everything was nice and dandy until it suddenly stopped working after 3 months of use. Now it can simpli be used as a small door stop.
 I'm walking twice as much as I usually do.  Fitbit makes me do it!  Fun and motivating.  Mission accomplished<br/>Plus the sleep data is fascinating.  I need more sleep!
 Returned this item due to it being inaccurate with steps taken and my heart rate. Not worth 130$ to be wrong. Returned without issues within a week of receiving.
 Perfect size for my teen daughter
 I love my Fitbit. This was the first Fitbit I bought and I couldn't be happier. It keeps track of my movements and any activity I do. I highly recommend this product.<br/><br/>I have bought 2 more Charge 2 after my initial purchase as gifts for my wife and brother.
 I really wanted to love this.  Unfortunately, I did not.  After comparing steps on this fitbit and others (charge and blaze) my steps were always several hundred steps off with the charge 2.  I followed all the manufacturer resolutions for inadequate step reporting without success.  For something that costs this much it really should be more accurate.  It does not count steps unless I am vigorously swinging my arms which is not a natural way for me to walk.<br/>I do love the new look of the Charge 2.  I like the relaxation breathing option and the heart rate seems accurate.
 good price &amp; easy to use
 I've had the FitBit for about 3 weeks and the accuracy is now ridiculously poor.  It's tracking steps while I'm sitting still.  Extremely disappointed.
 I had the Fitbit Alta for awhile, but this one with heart rate gives you a true number of calories used with walking!
 Love how it reminds you to move . Keeps track of sleep.. interesting to know since we have a 17month old baby
 strong band. I liked it. A little stiff but durable.
 Caused dermatitis.
 Item didn't last 2 months until total software failure, so disgusted with this product did not even work for 2 months for someone not a heavy exercise person. Just a casual exerciser.
 works as expected
 It made a great gift, my son absolutely loved it.  Worth the money.
 Great product especially for the price and features I was looking for, happy consumer.
 Had the charge, love the charge 2.  Arrived on time.
 I love knowing how much i have not done each day.<br/>Heart Rate is a good feature.<br/>I like the display when i hit my goals. Makes me happy
 It's what we expected
 Love this Fitbit.  It motivates me to walk 10,000 steps per day.  I love the feature that monitors your sleep and the hours of recording are accurate!  Just found out from a friend you can get notification of your phone calls on your cell phone through this device.  I am loving it!
 Everything works great.  It definitely met all of my expectations.
 I love my Fitbit Charge 2!  It gives me little reminders to get up and moving each hour.  I also love that I can challenge friends' and we can both get healthier. I highly recommend getting a Fitbit that fits your lifestyle!
 What a great product, wife couldn't be more pleased.
 I love my Charge 2 just what I needed, and like that you can change out band!
 Meets my needs
 Great gadget!<br/>Motivated me to a weight loss of 17 lbs from 3/16/17 thru 4/25/17
 Improved my fitness life !!. Simple product easy to use and stylish to wear.
 Band has broken three times connection to fit bit very poor
 It really has been a great tool for making incremental improvements in sleep, nutrition and excercise. Took away a star because if you run you do need an alternate tool/app to keep track of mileage/pace as the on in fitbit is fairly inaccurate even if you turn on the app and take the phone during your run.
 so far, so good.... really like the bright display and the fit itself. Good options
 I love love love my Fitbit Charge 2. &amp; the rose gold is so pretty!!
 Works excellent, battery life is good. Sometimes counts too many steps or is a little too sensitive to arm movements.
 like
 I love the watch but this is my second one that has issues with the band I’d like to know how to get this issue resolved without my continuously having to buy  new watch.
 Great product great price. I searched everywhere to save more.  Love it
 Love my fitbit Charge 2.
 I love this tracker.  I'm able to see my steps, heart rate, water consumption. Home &amp; sleep stats.
 I love my fitbit. I'm still finding out everything it can show.
 It doesn't get the pulse right all the time and the band is too long for small wrists.
 not accurate ,rubber band damaged like previus generation
 love this fitbit.
 Works well and does what is stated it would do. I wish the application for android was better and tracking naps same as sleep and merging multiple sleep periods into on report. Fit needs to improve the applications on android.
 Much better than the older Fitbit it replaced. More accurate and better looking.
 Some syncing issues
 I am trying to lose some weight and this gadget really motivates me to exercise and be active. It connects with the app on my iphone allowing me to log in the food. It is also cute.
 The watch did not work and it was obvious that it was worn previously. it had gunk and debris underneath the watch, and looked disgusting. A refund has been requested...
 Great fit for my wife, she enjoyed wearing it
 Much more stylish and great functionality. I've lost 15 lb since I started using Fitbit.
 excellent
 Verry satisfied
 Nice watch
 My fitbit has helped me keep up with water intake and exercise and kept me moving. I've been able to track my sleep patterns and improve my rest.  I wish I had purchased itwhen it first came out.
 I only had this Fit Bit for 5 months and it just quit working. Won't even turn on after I charged it overnight. Wouldn't purchase another one.
 Great gift , my wife uses it daily. A fitness must have.
 Great gift.  He loves all the features.
 The charge two is the best bang for the buck! Hands down the best
 So happy with this purchase I love my fit bit I wear it all day and night I take it off and put it in the charger when I shower the battery lasts for days
 Loving my fitbit so far. :)
 Great item
 Arrived on time, and I love it!!
 The product was great until the buckle on the band popped of now the Fitbit can't be worn and nobody is telling what to do. I am very unhappy right now why should I have to purchase a new lavender band since my Fitbit is only 6 months ago
 Bought this as a gift and they love it.
 Like all the features; but, I should have ordered the slim band version.  A little to wide for my wrist.  Other than that, I like it.
 Love it! Was a gift. Met all my expectations
 I use it everyday!
 I'm sure there are 100+ detailed reviews, but here's one, quick and to the point. I had a Blaze but gave it to my daughter and "upgraded" to this. Its smaller profile is more feminine and concealable. The features are comparable BUT the touchscreen is pretty unresponsive. When I start a workout, I have to tap the screen over and over to get it to switch to the next option. A pain in the @ss but not a deal breaker. What is a HUGE deal breaker is how difficult it is to change bands. I'm fashion-conscious and have many bands. It takes 2 people and a prying devise (we use scissors) to make the change. This sucks compare to the Blaze.
 Love the fit bit. But doesn't always record my sleep pattern. I think it is my pulse is low at night while sleeping. So my sleep pattern is never correct.
 Love this!
 Great tool
 Doesn’t always give good heart rate feed back
 The Charge 2 does the functions that I wanted, steps,heart rate, encourages activity. It's my constant coach.
 can't live without it.
 I had the original charge and was really excited about getting a sleeker new look with the HR monitor. Works perfectly and doesn’t look bulky on my small wrist. The color is perfect.
 Absolutely love my new Fitbit. It's easy to use and very comfortable
 I got the Charge 2 and it's defective. The vibrate function doesn't work. It doesn't vibrate for notifications. Even when charging, it's supposed to vibrate when it is connected to the charger.
 Like, like, like.
 I love this product.  Especially the ability to link up messages and phone calls so they buzz the fitbit when one comes through.  I also really like knowing which level of heart rate I am hitting at any given point.
 I bought this on November 2017 and  now the battery is not lasting more than 3 days ( I used to charge it only once a week).
 After several months of a careful use the wristband started to fall apart.<br/>My previous model Charge HR had the same issue with band.<br/>Don’t buy!
 I love it! I have found it very motivational. Since I sit at a desk all day, it has been great getting those little prompts to get up and move around a bit. I have gradually moved up to hitting my 10,000 daily steps goal almost everyday!!
 I like it better than my old charge. I love the notifications and the band is a lot better
 This is not my first Fitbit. I generally love them! This one, however, stopped charging within the first 2 months of owning. While plugged in it 'acknowledges' that it is charging, left on for an hour and taken off with no charge.
 Bought for grandmother. Works great, and she loves everything about it.
 Very happy with this product. Sleep tracking feature is my favorite part!
 Just what the granddaughter wanted for Christmas she loves it.
 I love it!  I have been using it daily and have increased my steps considerably since using it because I am more aware of how many steps I actually take in a day.
 Was very pleased with the Fitbit Charge 2 until the digital face burned out after 18 months.
 Too many features I don't want.
 I love my Fitbit i wear it everyday and i use to track my steps my calories my workouts and my eating plans.  The battery does last up to five days and I had no problem syncing it to my phone.
 This is my forth one.  I'm very happy with the rose gold
 Well, worked exactly 4 month and stopped charging. Tried my wifes charger but the problem is the watch. My wife still works after 10 month but mine gave up. Would not buy it again!
 Love it!! Tracks everything I want it to and it's a very nice fittness tracker!
 use it every day. every  thing is perfect. the information  is on the money.
 love it
 I love it! I am a huge data freak and this is perfect! The ONLY thing I wish you could do is download your heart rate data into a csv file or excel compatible file. I barely notice that I'm wearing it unless I get hot (I tend to swell when I get hot). Well done Fitbit!!!
 This was an upgrade for me, since I had been using a Flex. I love that it notifies me of texts and calls coming from my phone. I love the hourly reminders to get up and move. Great motivation.
 I really like the product, they totally upgraded the original HR. Occasionally, the device can't track the heart rate when you do an aerobic workout and also there is an issue with the band. The band keeps falling apart it due to this I have to order a new one.
 Worth every penny!! I love my fitbit so much, totally worth it.
 I have been using this for a month. I am very happy with it and how it keeps track of my heart rate and steps and sleep, etc.  It can go a week before recharging and I simply recharge it while I am in the shower and it charges fast too.
 Works great, however I cant ssinc with my phone, but it might be my phone.  Love it
 I love this product.  Keeping track of my activity and sleeping is really helping me to make improvements.
 User friendly! Had mine paired with my iPhone and ready to go in 5 minutes.  Easy to use and fun to see daily results!
 Excellent tracker, the only "but" is the notifications that it doesn't take it very well. Heart Rate average is very accurate.
 I am so pleased with this fitbit. It works perfect and was charged when I received it. Shipping was great and I got it the day they said I would.
 Very uncomfortable to sleep with.  Did not seem accurate regarding amounts of steps and distance.
 This watch is great I liked my Charge HR but I LOVE the Charge 2 so much more. It keep me motivated with its little reminders. I have recommended this to several people so far.
 I love it and if ever forget to wear it I feel lost with out it
 This is junk, Doesn't include dongle. It won't syn the with tablet or phone. Check the internet. everyone is having issues. Wasted too much time with the piece of junk.
 I haven't used any fitness trackers in the past, but my husband and I decided to give this one a go, since it has so many seemingly interesting options. We got them yesterday and they couldn't be easier to set up. All of the functions are working flawlessly so far for me: the vibration alarm easily woke me up, I get text and phone alerts, it measures steps and hb, I turn my wrist and it shows time/steps, it updated when I initialized the app, and I can tap on it to wake it up, too.<br/><br/>The only drawback for me is that the look of the strap is just not my style at all; I am interested in one of the leather bands (which are still showing as preorders), although I'm not sure if any of those colors really work with my typical wardrobe, either. Because it's so new, it doesn't look like there are any options on Etsy, either. So, time will tell if I get over this minor issue and keep up with the tracker.
 It does everything I need it to and isn't too large for my wrists like most watches!
 I am still adjusting to its use but I love when it tells me to take it for a walk.
 It needs to be restarted several times if the sleep tracking doesn't track sleep stages. Treadmill distance seems to be inaccurate.  Hope this could be fixed in the next software update.<br/>Other than these two issues, everything is great!
 This device works great. I needed a devuce that is compatible with mt phone.
 Charge 2's need to be made waterproof! Otherwise an exceptional fitness tool!
 Notification sometimes works and GPS doesn't always work. But other than that It works like they said.
 I'm in love with it! No complaints so far.
 Simple to use and works great.
 Great features but too big and bulky.  Sent it back and purchased an Alta instead.
 Poor wrist band, won’t buy again
 Works great but will be buying a new band that has a little bit more style and comfort.
 My Wife loves it.
 Worked great for about 3-4 months.  Then it started to burn my wrist.  I contacted the company and after a long process hope to get my money back
 So far, so good. I like the features and the look.
 I wanted an upgrade to the Flex I had and this was the perfect one for me!
 Awesome love the look feel and all the tracking info it tracks this is my second one I bought the first one I bought was a Gift for Mother's Day
 need label to send back to amazon
 Except for counting footsteps, it's difficult to count stairs or anything else.  I expected more versatility
 Just as described.
 This has totally changed the way I approach life. My eating, workouts, water intake, etc. has majorly increased thanks to the Fitbit Charge 2! I love the goals, reminders, and praise when I achieve something! Best purchase I've made in a while.
 Very durable! Accidentally got in pool with it, with scuba equipment for about 10 minutes at 15 feet. It never went out.
 Bought this one to replace a older version. Works a Great!
 I can go for a week without charging my charge 2. I'm impressed. If only they can make it "water proof"....then I will never take it off.
 I bought the Fitbit charge 2 in lavender/rose gold and it was definitely worth the extra money. The color is gorgeous, and it is very accurate to what the picture online shows. I have a 6.0 inch wrist and bought the small. I am only on the fourth hole, so if you are deciding between the large and small, I would go for the small. It synced very easily to my iPhone, and have had no problems yet. The touch screen is different than a normal one, but after a while it is very easy to control. I have had a little difficulty viewing it outside, but it is much better than other trackers. Overall, I love and recommend this tracker.
 This makes me really competitive.  Lots of information to be taken from wearing it. I miss it if I forget to wear it!
 I just love this new fit bit I had the old charge and this one is much better
 The box was opened &amp; damaged. I thought this was supposed to be new. I didn’t pay almost 200 for the box to come ripped open
 Excelente producto, ideal para los que inician con el ejercicio
 Love it! Thanks
 Nowhere in product information was it stated that Bluetooth was required to operate this device.  Set-up instructions on Fitbit's website were very incomplete, misleading and incorrect.  Had to purchase a "dongle" in order for the device to work.  Once I went through all the hassle, it worked great.
 Love it!
 This was a Christmas gift for my husband and he is very pleased with it
 Very easy to function. Helps to keep you accountable for ones health.
 To monitor my movements
 As advertised.  Love it!
 love it
 Love this product! Quality as described~
 I like it but the heart rate is totally inaccurate
 This is a great product. Hands down would recommend to everyone, you just need to make sure to download the app that goes with it. Very useful.
 I have to admit it changed my approach to exercise and sleep in a positive way-- check out the sleep function.  it is totally cool
 Watch band broke.  Fitbit quoted a 4 to 6 weeks delivery for a band replacement.  Crystal scratches easily.  Not rugged enough for everyday wear.
 Bought it for my husband as a birthday present.  As he refuses to wear a watch I knew I was takig a chance.  He loves it.  Wears all day and sleeps in it!
 "Water resistant" and not "water proof". Good otherwise
 Like this style better then the original one, and I love the rose gold better then the stainless steal looking one.
 Absolutely love it.  Never a minute without it
 Love my FitBit Charge. I take it off when I cook or do laundry cause it counts it as steps when I move my hand a lot. Don't regret getting it though wish I got it earlier. Lost 24 pounds already definitely keeps me motivated and the community on the app is awesome very supportive!
 Love it.
 My wife was reluctant at first but now loves it.
 Comfortable. Does heart rate. I never wore a watch so I was worried I could not stick with it but this was comfortable enough to tolerate. I wear it daily, it always works and has prompted me to be more active.
 I have a Surge also and I like the display better on the Surge. The Surge just too "utilitarian" looking and too big for my small wrist to wear except when I am exercising. I appreciate that these two fit-bits work together.
 awesome, I have only had for 3 days and I have already received several badges of accomplishment from Fitbit. I love it.
 Son loves the features and uses daily for workouts for college football
 Easy to use
 loving it so far
 I love it! Easy set up and feels great!
 I bought a second one as a backup just in case. I can't be without it... I'm in a fitness challenge.
 awesome device, it keeps you focus in your walking goals!
 loved my charge hr so bought the charge 2 and so far am loving it aswell
 Great item at a great price
 Fit Bit went dead one day afterwards refused to sync to my phone again. Just go to the store and get one.
 Just as expected
 Very weak watch band. Broke within first week. Chatted twice and emailed Fitbit to replace. Poor support.
 The only thing lacking is water resistance. Other than that, the item is a true winner in the field.
 I like that it holds a charge for many days! I was thinking it was a little thinner, more lady like! Looks better on a man! And my old one was water proof, really miss that!
 Samsung fit is better in same price
 Great present!
 Still running, always fun doing the work week hustle
 Tremendous aid for working out and weight loss.
 Excellent Product! Now I wish I would have bought two at the time. The watch works really well and the tracking is awesome. I was actually able to see how many hours that I slept at a time during the night.
 Good quality
 Love this! Easy to use and durable.
 This Fitbit Charge does everything as advertised.
 Let's just hope my insanely abnormal heart rate does not break it
 My wife saw the fit bit that I have and she wanted the same one. She likes it.
 Great product, exactly what my wife needed
 I love my fitbit! It's such a big help with ny exercise routine! I enjoy using it everyday! ❤
 great product
 My friend (birthday present) loves it.
 Bought this for my wife, she loves it. Wears it 24/7
 great price.
 Great product.
 love everything about the fitbit but I'm very disappointed that mine does not vibrate at all. I would like to return it for a new one since I paid the money for it to work properly but I'm not sure how to go about that. I hope to hear back for someone with guidance.
 This might seem like a good product if you've never used a piece of technology before.  Otherwise, you will recognize the hallmarks of poor engineering and poor user interface design.  In order to avoid any expensive electronic components, the designers tried to control everything by a rapidly blinking LED system designed for one purpose (to monitor heart rate via bloodflow).  They thought with this sensors alone they could do lots of other things, and it comes off like a hack.  "Tapping" the screen works intermittently, about 50%.  Turning your wrist to look at the display?  That works about 20% of the time.  The thing has no intelligence that can figure out when it's not on your wrist--it will contain to blink frantically, the dumbest "smart" product imaginable.
 Overpriced Junk!<br/>Bought FitBit since all my friends using it. Thought it can be a good gym companion. First time I put it on my wrist, I didn't like the material at all. It is cheap silicon and very vulnerable glass(Scratched in couple hours). Well, screen is not a touch-screen, it is a push-screen. You need to punch your fingers on to screen really hard to make it work. Stock Strap is not comfortable at all, had to buy a better watch strap.<br/>I don't understand why ppl like this watch. It is counting 1000+ steps while I am sleeping, never catches cycling or any sort of running,etc. Steps increase while driving or cycling (smart!watch thinks I am walking 50 miles/h) Looked up Fitbit forums, seems like a common problem. The fix offered is, reboot 3 times. What a joke.Battery is not going more than 4days. Notifications not showing up completely (When they do). You have to wait mins to see entire Text Message.<br/>Buggy, Limited, Cheap. No Idea how they become so popular.(It is my first and last Fitbit). Returning it and going back to Garmin.
 Bought for my wife. She uses it daily. Great product!
 It is GREAT.  So much better than the Charge.  It keeps me motivated.
 Loooooovvvveeee it!
 love it
 I love the features. It tracks everything I want, even calories burned. It buzzes me when I need to be active. It's very motivating. The battery lasts about 3 days. Wish they were solar like citizen watches so they would charge themselves. Love this watch.
 Very happy with this fit bit. It does more than I expected.
 Have been a fitbit fan from the beginning. Love all the new features
 I love it, however it is having trouble syncing to my phone. Setting it up the first day took hours and now about 2 weeks later it won't sync again so I unpaired it hoping that would help. It's not connecting again, is there anything I can do? It's very annoying.
 Love my fit bit.
 Was great at first.  Suddenly stopped syncing with my fitness pal app.  Annoying
 Bought for a friend she loves it says its working very good.
 Does everything I was hoping for.
 Perfect! I wear if every dingke day! Very comfortable!
 Couldn't get this to setup on either the Fitbit website or app. The Charge 2 HR+ was never found after several tries. It was returned and a Garmin was ordered.
 Love this. Walking more and counting my steps daily. Does everything it says it does. So glad I finally bought one.
 Awesome item. I love the way it tracks my heartbeat.
 Wife did noty like the Alta, which I am using and do like. She got the Change 2 for Christmas, and it is exactly what she waned. The band on the Alta was difficult for her to close. The more conventional band on the Change 2 is great
 Great purchase, was a gift and they loveveverything it does
 I haven't yet taken a run with my new watch and I'm already sitting down to write this 2-star review:<br/>Here's this shiny new Charge 2 that you got as a present and you want to start using. Not so fast: first you need to install the application that you don't want because FitBit demands some personal information from you. What gives? It's not like they're giving you a free email or messaging service - this gadget cost good money. But what choice do you have? So you give them your junk email address that you never use, connect by Bluetooth (this never works before the third try but whatever) and then there's a software update of the watch (the one that just got shipped from the factory). You hit "update" and you get a message back that the update was unsuccessful, please try again. You try again - same thing. You reset the PC. You go online to find out how to reset the watch (thanks, Google, you can have my real email address). No change. You go on a FitBit users' forum, where you find this helpful advice from FitBit technical support: please try to update 8-10 times until it works. Ha? You try 8-10 times; you reset, you try 8-10 times; you go out to the yard to calm down and do some honest work; you come back for another round; you call your teenage son to witness this wonder of technology and it works. Now, I know I'm supposed to enjoy my watch now for a long time (assuming quality assurance does a better job than software engineering) and forget about it, but I won't. I'm in hi-tech and I know software can be a bitch but c'mon, FitBit, you're a two billion dollar company and spend $300 million on R&amp;D every year. It's just a question of caring less about extorting personal information and more about user satisfaction.<br/>Okay, got this out of my system.
 loving it so far...only had it a day
 I am glad I have a product that works to my expectations. It's reliable and gives me the information I want in my desire to better shape life and health.
 Replacing the Fitbit HR with this one. So many more options and features. I love it!
 Got this as a anniversary gift for my partner. He is very happy with it because he got the Charge before and did not offer heart rate. He is very happy with the screen size and everything that it is capable of doing with the app.
 I love my Fitbit Charge HR 2!  It's light weight and looks so classy on my wrist. Only down fall I noticed was when text messages comes in it sometimes takes awhile for the message to show up and you have to keep turning your wrist for it to appear. Wish it wasn't so hard to view your messages on there. Other than that I love it. Shipping was extremely fast too!
 Got it for my husband works well and very accurate
 Came fast  everything was  great  with the order nothing to complain about
 I love my Fit Bit. Easy to work with and understand. I was amazed at all of the information it provides to keep me on track with exercise, eating,  heart rate and my sleep pattern. I would recommend everyone to get a Fit Bit
 Works great! Absolutely love it.
 purchased for my wife, se loves it.,
 Started with a Fitbit years ago, tried two different bands over time.  Back to Fitbit, most user friendly and easy to use.
 Will not read sleep, stairs correctly. Will not buy a Fitbit again. I sent a complaint over a month ago with no replay.
 Love this.  Works great and easy to set up.
 Love the bells and whistles. Just hate that it counts every single move. It even counts moves such as scratching your hair for instance. I read a review where it was counting movements while driving so you definitely will need to take it off when you drive.
 Worked ok for the first year. Then I was unable to receive text messages or notifications. And now it won't sync with my phone at all. Sadly it's now totally useless because the time is off.
 Can't live without it
 I really love my new Fitbit Charge 2.  It is easy to set up, and I use it every day.  It holds a charge for multiple days without needing more than 15 minutes of charging per day.  The HR and Sleep Tracking features are quite useful and provide very good data.  I purchased the small size which fits fine, but I have a relatively small wrist.
 Easy to set-up and pair to the phone, have only had for a couple of days but so far I really like it.
 Really great for people with hypoallergenic skin towards metal
 Awesome
 Does not keep accurate heart rate and calorie count.
 Just what my daughter-in-law wanted
 Highly recommend.
 Love this Fitbit. Able to track my activity while dieting
 Fit bit is fine. Band is awful. After a few month it won’t stay connected. I will have to buy a new band. Poor product quality
 This has everything thing I need to stay on track! I love the reminders to get up and move, heart rate and the way it shows the screen when I tilt it.  The sleep  tracking is awesome. It makes me very aware of how sleep affects your health. I liked it so much I got one for my daughter!
 I love my fitbit the only probably is it don't hold a charge long. I will purchase another one if I had to
 Love the new Charge 2. Bluetooth allows you to sync your cell and read about the first sentence of each incoming text message.
 fast delivery and great product
 I had a Fitbit Charge HR before buying this new one. This one is much better, It has a bigger screen &amp; the bands are interchangeable.
 I use it daily! Love it
 Good quality and long lasting battery life!
 So far enjoying the Charge 2 with all of it's prompting to get moving.
 Bought this for my daughter for Christmas, she loves it.
 Didn't pair with my phone for messaging.
 Got this for my husband for Christmas and it already has issues after 5 weeks of use. Of course it just started acting buggy this week, a few days past the return window. Emailed CS here and posted on the FitBit forum asking for opinions but it's not holding a charge for more than a few hours and I assume it's defective. Really hoping for a replacement. :/
 I got it for my wife, we have had it since February and the band will not attached on one side. She doesn't wear it much so it was not like it got heavy use.  I'm going to reach out the Fitbit and see if they can fix it
 Band wouldn't stay hooked. Sent a replacement very quickly!!
 Fits great and works just as advertised.  I have had it several months and I love it so far.
 Best purchase I've made this year! Cute and easy to use!!
 I like the way it keeps track of daily steps and sleep pattern.
 I still am learning all the Fitbit Charge 2 can do.  I really like being able to see how many steps I take and checking the sleep feature.  The size of band for my wrist was on the line as to whether to buy a small or a large and I decided on the large band just to be safe.  But if you are on the borderline of wrist size you might want the small because I felt the large band was too long.  The type of material in the band irritated my wrist and so I ended up buying a silver magnetic wrist band which I really love--unless my jewelry gets too close!  The battery seems to last about a week until it has to be recharged but it doesn't take long to charge.  I haven't tried doing any of the challenges they suggest but will soon.
 I liked the product.Howe c er the magnetism holding Fitbit to the strap failed.Resulting in questionable quality.I would expect for the price it would hold together love get than 6mo.
 My wife loves it
 loving my fitbit charge 2 so far. With so much smoke in the area I have not had a chance to get out and try running like I would like to. Maybe in a few weeks. Other than that it has helped keeping me on goal for exercise and walking distance.
 So far so good. Love all the features on the app. Calorie burn count. Meal tracking. Step reminders etc....only thing it's a little bulky wish it was thinner
 Love the Fitbit Charge 2, however the shipping was delayed quite a bit so that is why there are 4 starts versus 5. Especially being a Am Prime member.
 Gift
 To sum it up, this band improves on the Charge HR 1 in every single way.  I absolutely love this band having worn the HR1 for a year.
 nice
 I have had this for only a couple of weeks and two of the functions are no longer working,  Its supposed to turn on when I quickly turn my wrist and it did for a week but no longer does it.  Its also supposed to warn me when I have not walked 250 steps each hour which also worked for the first week no longer works.
 My wife loves it. A lot of function all in one device
 The notification setting doesn't work, and Fitbit won't send me a new device. I have tried to receive notifications on the Fitbit using 3 different devices, and it still will not work.
 Love it. Came as ordered and on time. Seems to match what is on my phone and other fitbit product. I got it for the sleep tracking and I am pleased with the data. I got it on a sale day so like it even more.  Enjoy!
 Good price - I am giving this as a Christmas present to my mother - she requested this model.
 good....
 Love it and I love that it reminds me to get up and move every hour.
 Had a problem with the changing cord but it was replaced for free and everything works great now.
 Works great. Keeps me moving
 Bought it as a gift for a friend. They loved it.
 Love this. I wear it everyday and it’s perfect!
 To monitor heart rate of family member diagnosed with atrial fib. Cardiologist concurred it was a great idea!
 I purchased my Fitbit Charge 2 approximately 2 months ago. It has been a challenge in every aspect. The start up required a dongle, if you don't have WIFI, which was not relayed in the product information and description. I had to order a dongle, at additional cost in order to sync the fitbit. I finally got the dongle and got it going. It seemed to keep track of my steps until I noticed that when I walked a few steps, it didn't add them on, and it took a while for them to show. It doesn't show going up and down steps, It never has, and I live in a two story house. This morning when I woke up, it had not deleted my steps. So, another issue created...I checked on line to see about deleting steps. There were other customers that have had the same issue and no real good answer to solve the problems. Paying this much for a Fitbit, it should work much better and be more user friendly for the consumer. I would definitely not recommend purchasing this product. Would like to see about returning it for a refund.
 Great
 I have been using it for about a month.  I unintentionally put the water resistance to the test by accidentally wearing it in a hotel hot tub for about 5-10min submerged about 1-2 feet.  I immediately took it off and dried the exterior and left it sitting on a towel.  I was quite worried because you cant turn it off.  Although I would not repeat it, I have no fear about wearing it out in the rain for a run or if it gets under the faucet briefly while washing my hands!  It has been in constant function with no flaws.  I charge it ever 2-3 days while im in the shower or bath usually from half charge. I charged it Friday afternoon about 3pm, it is now Monday at 11am and it still says medium charge for the battery. I would recommend this to anyone tracking HR, exercise, sleep! Only thing I was disappointed about was that if you just select workout it will not pick up on GPS, also I took a 5mile bike ride the other day and it did not account that into my distance for the days since it obviously can't count steps while you are cycling.
 Really enjoying my Fitbit. One of my best purchases ever. It helps me live a healthier lifestyle.
 cheap quality....lasted a week
 Very cool!
 Good product!
 Love everything about this watch
 I have purchased 7 or 8 Fitbit products over the last couple of years, and the wrist bands have separated from the display panel on 4 or 5 of the Fitbits after only a few months. Very poor design detail.
 I have really enjoyed mine. It is easy to use... sometimes not easy to sync but that's just because I'm in a remote location :) It's an excellent purchase for the price. I also enjoy seeing how much sleep I get... didn't know I don't usually get but 6 hours and a few minutes sleep! :O
 It doesn't send me text notifications. I contacted Fitbit and they simply told me it's nothing much they can do.
 Overall a wonderful product. Upgraded from a flex 2. Does exactly want I needed.
 Works great and am very happy with it. Customer service is good as well.
 The Fitbit Charge 2 has challenge me to move more.  Actually I purchased 3 one for my hubby, son and myself and we now do all a that we can do to get moving to get in the steps. My husband needed to get to moving for his heart and now we are on a plan for a healthier Family.
 Works great!  Still going strong 11 months later
 My wife loves it, she says it's an excellent motivator.
 Doesn't vibrate when it needs to. Inconsistent. Won't complain as it keeps track of my steps.
 A very nice gadget for tracking activities and sleep, notification (Mobile calls and SMS).<br/><br/>Though the disadvantage i faced  is that it is not compatible with limited list of mobile applications.<br/><br/>please fix that issue
 Very nice and accurate.
 Love that it tracks my sleep and steps per-day. It also reminds me to get up and move ... it's like a little accountability coach.
 Works great for what we need.
 Love this Fitbit.  Wears well with dress r casual attire.
 I do think this is generous with its steps. I was on a plane and still getting steps,otherwise love it.
 I bought this back in November 2017 and now it doesn’t work. It’s only March 2018!<br/>I’ve tried the reset button and it seems like it won’t charge. I loved it but feel like I wasted my money😥
 I am a first time fitbit owner and was curious about the product. I do not avidly work out 5 days a week and you'll never see me running. This is very important to state because my fitbit helps me to get off my bum.<br/><br/>There are 2 primary reasons I purchased this device. The first is the sleep tracker. I have struggled with sleep my entire life and my fitbit allows me to set a goal for myself and how long I sleep. I can generally look at my restlessness and get a handle on what I'm doing that is altering my sleep. This, to me, is the first step in my lifestyle change<br/><br/>The 2nd reason I bought this is for the watch. I wear a watch all the time except for when I'm working. I work in a very fast-paced restaurant environment and don't want to ruin my expensive fossil watch. This watch is as water resistant as I need it to be, with the added bonus of telling me how active my job is.<br/><br/>Yesterday my fitbit tracked over 15000 steps. I love the little party on my wrist every time I meet a goal. I also love being able to see my notifications without my phone.<br/><br/>The most important thing, I think, is that it motivates me to get moving every day. I really want to start a new fit lifestyle and by golly this thing helped from day one.<br/><br/>I'm removing one star because I don't feel the steps and sleep are completely accurate, but close enough for my needs.
 Loved everything about it!!!
 Seems like a great design and a very useful product.
 Fantastic, especially for the price. Love the heart rate and sleep features. Bands are extremely easy to switch out.
 Great buy
 the battery life life sucks!! I charge this thing more than I wear it and that's a shame, my battery last maybe a day.
 Love my fit bit but the clasp on the wrist band broke after wearing it only 2 months
 Loved the product but after less than 6 months,  band snaps periodically from the actual fit bit. Band snapped last week at spin class, fit bit shattered screen when landed on floor.
 It was a gift for my daughter. She loves it.
 Makes a charge H R resemble a circa 2010 pedometer.  Build quality is very good.  Screen can present much more information than all other fitbits at a quick glance.  Highly recommend.
 More comfortable than my first Fitbit (the Charge HR) and the battery life is finally over 3 days. (I generally need to recharge after 6 days.)<br/><br/>The sleep monitoring is great.<br/><br/>The only thing missing in this item is water proofing.
 Screen scratched easily, I would recommend getting some sort of screen cover. The app is nice.
 Got it for my wife for Christmas and she loves it.
 features are fine but output hard to read - need to make font bigger for e.g. heart rate
 I am used to the Jawbone "UP" ap that I really liked and am not used to the Fitbit Ap .I do like the device much better as it is much sturdier (jawbones fall apart) ...
 lots of information to help keep me on track for exercise and calories.
 I had to return it because it caused a sore on both wrists when I wore it. I really enjoyed it, just could not wear it.
 Yes! Love this! Totally helps me become and stay more active!!
 Fitbit charge 2 is easy to set and use.  I love that it lets me know when to get up and move if i have been setting to long.  Also how easy it is to see if i have burned more calories than i have consumed.
 Stopped holding any charge, 100 bucks totally down the drain after just over a month of wearing.
 As advertised. A great tool in monitoring all your physical activities, including heartbeat and sleep patterns
 Slim, well fitting and capable, this is it.
 Strap broke easily, found heart rate, and steps counted on elliptical to be inaccurate
 Bought this for my niece for Christmas. She was thrilled!
 Love this fit bit! No problems with delivery
 Perfect I love it
 Bought it June 7th and already not working<br/>Lights faded:( so upset it was Father's Day present for my husband
 Wife loves it.
 Great gift for my mom in law. Not too easy for her to set up (she's not too tech savvy) My husband was able to set it up for her and she seems happy with her Christmas gift.
 Great for exercise, auto tracks most workouts. Battery lasts at least 4 days. Only thing lacking is the smart watch aspect but if your getting this watch your probably not to concerned with that.
 I bought this a year ago now and it just made it past the year warranty and is now no longer working. Second fit bit I have had that has done this. No longer purchasing fit bits.
 LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  It is fantastic- I get my texts, phone calls,l love the relax mode!!!
 Very comfortable and looks great.  Very useful and easy to use.  Would reccomend to a friend as a gift. I've had a couple fitness bands before and this one takes the cake.
 Like this product much more than previous Fitbit as it is smaller and looks much better on small woman's wrist.
 Quick. I love this, especially the heart rate monitor.
 My husband uses his watch all the time. Great purchase.
 Awesome, was gift for Daughter in Law... she lives it!
 works great,love to check my steps and miles
 A really nice activity tracker, and very functional.
 I had the original FitBit prior to this one and loved it...this one takes it to another level. I love the step counter of course, but I also love the fact that it automatically detects workouts so I don't have to remember to activate anything before I start. I use the timer more than anything (not related to the expected benefits)...I set it at the beginning of my breaks so I no longer have to remind myself what time I left. I didn't expect that out of this but it's nice! I do not recommend buying other brand replacement bands. They fit but they'll irritate your skin. Stick with the Fit it brand bands.
 I absolutely love FitBit!
 Love it! Really keeps me on track and pushes me to reach goals. I get so excited when I get fireworks for completing my step goal for the day. Very encouraging.
 this thing is awesome.
 Great product.
 Got a rash from the underside of it
 No bike tracking.
 Christmas gift for my wife loves it
 Bought for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it!! I will be ordering one for myself and my husband for Valentine's Day!!
 I used a Nike Fuel band and loved it but this provides so much more info
 Great, new features work well
 Great purchase !!!
 I already owned this Fitbit Charge 2 and was so pleased ; I ordered this one for my sister's Birthday .
 Easy to use, sometimes it doesn't track 100%, like stairs or active minutes. Overall I'm really enjoying it!
 I bought this for my dad for Christmas. He is in love with it and uses it every day along with the app you can download. He's had no issues with it and I'm so glad he loves it
 Awsome
 It's helping me to keep on track with my goals
 Love Love Love my fitbit!
 Improved version of FitBit.  Would purchase again.
 It was a gift for my son and he is very happy with it.
 So glad my old Charge HR broke.  Love the Charge 2!
 Exactly what I was looking for!  Great heart rate monitor.  Color is perfect!  Price was the determining factor.
 Daughter loves being able to track fittness
 Love it
 Bought it for my daughter and she loves it.
 The band already broke...I literally work at a desk and am very gentle.  Very poor construction and not warrantied.
 Awesome Fitbit!
 Love my Fitbit Charge 2!!! I love being able to change out the band. Works great &amp; holds a charge.
 It was everything I expected. I've been using it every day.
 Arrived early and my wife loves it.
 I like it. I have had the Apple Watch before, and was annoyed with its bulkiness and battery life.<br/><br/>The Fitbit does better on both fronts, though it is a little bulkier than I expected. I love seeing my heartrate through the day.<br/><br/>You can sleep with it and it vibrates to wake you up, and it also lets you know about texts, calls, and calendar events.<br/><br/>Edit 12/14/16: just 2 weeks after regular usage, the screen has scratched already :/<br/><br/>Edit 12/31/16: Contacted Fitbit about the scratch, they were very helpful with helping me replace it :)
 Bought it for my wife at Christmas. She loves it. Highly recommended purchase!
 Both fit bits I had ordered had been used. I tried to get a replacement and that one was broken open and damaged as well.
 this was a gift, love it
 My husband and I love our Fitbit Charge 2s. We had the first generation of Fitbit Charge and had to replace it 3 times. This one is amazing!
 Great product, exceeded my expectations in getting me back on track with awareness of just how much I move (or don't move) and getting back into shape.  Had no issues, easy to use and also good measurement of heart rate to ensure you are exercising to your potential.
 Works great
 Love the Fitbit Charge 2 Heart Rate &amp; Fitness watch.  Love the larger display in tracking steps, miles, calories
 barely a month with this and it will not connect to any device. Big let down because I cant actually compile any of the data it records. Will try to see if I can return for one that works.
 Awesome can't say enough about this fit bit
 Absolutely  love it. For me, it's about the motivation. If I look at it &amp; see I only have a few more things to do to meet my goals, I make sure I meet them. My only issue is the band...makes me sweat &amp; leaves marks on my wrist. I will be changing it out for a different one.
 I like that it accurately measures daily mileage.  The hard plastic band irritates my wrist a bit, but overall it is a very good product.  I still need to use more of its many features.
 I love this thing. It's super comfortable and very fashionable. I wish it was waterproof.
 It do very well it do it job
 The Charge 2 is a good product for adults.  It is not intended for kids under the age of 13.  If you are looking to purchase this for kids under 13 you cannot set it up with their correct age.  Also, one other factor is you cannot have two of the same model fitbit devices on the same account.
 Love love love!
 much better than my HR i would love this thing
 My 3rd Fitbit.  I love it and wear it E-V-E-R-Y day.
 Oh my God,  for  the third time people asked me to buy it for them and  their friend,  🙌
 Love it
 Been wanting one of these. I'm very excited. It looks great and it works great. Shipping only took 2 days.
 Were looking for a cheap fitness watch.  The Charge 2 was the perfect solution.
 I'm disappointed in this product. I received it Dec. 15, 2017, so I've had it about four months now. I'm irritated because the band broke a few days ago. I also bought a Fitbit Aria, which stopped syncing to my device. I think I'm going to kiss Fitbit goodbye and invest in another fitness tracker.
 What else to say about fitbit products. Nice. I wanted one with heart rate, stair counts and sleep tracker and got this one black friday sale.
 love it, does what it should, comfortable, good app
 Fun and informative. This is one of the best little gadgets I've bought in a long time.
 What I like most is the fact it reminds you to get up and get moving when you've been sitting too long. I often need the nudge.
 After 2 months, alerts quit working. Now I have a $150 heart monitor. Awesome. Fixes do not work. I've read this a lot from other users. Do not buy this product.
 Great Devise, but personally still prefer my fitbit alta for its light weight and convenience.
 I loved both my fitbit rose gold special edition fitbit and extra band for the first 3 weeks...now both are rubbed off fading from every day use.
 The Charge2 is GREAT! Nice screen, and easy to use. We originally received a one with a dead screen, but had a new one within a week. Response time was quick. Thank you!
 Works great
 Great product. Lots of features. Helps to motivate healthy behaviour. Highly recommend!
 Love this fit bit!
 I like the watch and features overall, but the heart rate tracking is useless.<br/>If you want accurate HR, look elsewhere.
 My wife uses her fit bit every day
 I Just Need to repair my screen that is cracked, the monitor works perfectly...<br/>They respond that i need to buy a new watch!!<br/>Just for the screen!!!
 Excellent buy!
 It's a great piece of technology the menu navigation is disappointing.
 I absolutely love my charge 2 HR.  The display is easier to read.  The ability to measure my steps, calories burned and workouts an definite plus. I luv it
 Beautiful color and great style. Perfect width for young adult or smaller wrists. My teen daughter loves it.
 Love all the features on the new Charge Hr
 I don't know why I waited so long to get one of these.  It has been an excellent addition to my life.
 Yes, I gave it to my wife as a Christmas gift,  she loves it. The communication it has is awesome! I want to save up so I can get one for myself.
 Most functions are really nice ,battery life is great ,charger is somewhat awkward
 When they are built to track the movement of intense activities, it is expected that the product is made to handle such wear. Totally disappointed.
 Great product.
 motivates!
 Not even 2-months old and the band is already broken
 This Fitbit truely transfromed my lifeStyle. I work out every day and the device motivates me by setting up targets and updates.i love this prodcut
 Love my Fit Bit, works great.
 This was supposed to be gunmetal special edition color, cost more because of that and it just looks regular black. Should have bought the cheaper black one since it looks the same anyway. Disappointed.
 My wife loves this Fitbit. She doesn't leave home without it.
 Easy to set up and get stepping, looks nice and sleek as well. Not too bulky
 Band is not all that comfortable, but it is fun.  I upgraded from a fitbit one.  I wish there was a way to get an audible alarm!!  I do love fits!!
 I love how it is able to track so many things. Love it!
 gave as a gift and the receiver has has nothing but good things to say about it. She hasnt removed it since we bought it for her
 I had several Fitbit flexes and I love this one the best!  Love the heart rate monitor and the text/call notifications.
 Product was awesome until it started to not be.  After 5 months of working great it started now syncing with my phone and then just stopped working.  Just tried returning it, to no avail.
 Have had this since September and it has helped me stay motivated to be more active. No issues so far.
 I love this product it it is verry accurate and. Verry comfortable
 The fit bit came right on time and was packaged very well. My 26 year old son said it is beyond what he was hoping for in what it does. It was very easy to begin using and it meets all his expectations.
 Liked
 Works for me...new best friend
 Better then I expected. Definitely recommend
 I like my fitbit charge 2 a lot but it seems to be tracking steps that I didn't take. Any tips on how to improve its accuracy?
 Present for my daughter's birthday. She wore out her first Charge and likes this one even more.
 I am very pleased with this
 With the exception of not being waterproof its working great for me.
 It was great until the screen cracked from top to bottom.  Read the FitBit forums.  It's a common problem that they're "working on."  ...But for now, you're screwed.
 Love it! Just hate that i cant wear it at work due to policy
 Lots of new features on the Charge 2.
 Lots of new features on the Charge 2.
 I bought this items works well however after wearing it on and off for about 4 month my wrist broke out in a horrible rash. After finding out through complaints with its maker rash issues with the fitbit products I contacted Apple and was told I would receive a box to return the item in order to receive a refund. The box never arrived even after multiple attempts no one returned my phone calls nor responded to my emails. To make matters worst I brought a second fitbit charge 2 at the same time as a gift. Within 2 months of my issues the person I bought the other fitbit for began to experience the same problem. Needless to say I am highly disappointed with this product and its makers.
 This is an incredible watch/fitness tracker!
 Overall, best, cost effective Fitbit made to date with many features including step and floor count, heart rate, stop watch, alarms and sleep monitoring. Love the different bands that can be purchased -- this Fitbit can go from sporty to dressy in seconds!
 Doesn't keep track off my steps.  It went from giving me over 5,000 steps while I slept to undercounting my steps.  The heart rate and time seem to be the only thing it keeps track of.
 Only thing is make sure you get the screen protector it is crazy how scratched it gets in a short period of time.
 I ordered two fitbits, a versa for my husband and a Charge 2 for me. Mine came opened and used! This is unacceptable!
 Love this fitbit it works great tracking steps heartrate and sleep. Pair it with fitbit app and log your food. I wish it was waterproof.
 It makes it fun to exercise and see the results
 I didn't find the data it provided, valuable.
 Just Perfect
 Lov I was a gift
 Love it
 great seller, great product..... Thanks
 Love this product for my husband and he loves this as well! Great for accountability
 It seems to be more accurate then the charge 1 I previously had..
 Replaced my fit bit one which still oked but wanted an upgrade.
 Love it just as much as my first generation charge HR.
 Works as advertised and expected. Very satisfied!
 Had the fitbit charge for one year. This model kicks it to the curb~
 Love this fitbit!
 Love love love this Fitbit. Fits great. Looks great.  Still learning to use all features. The only complaint is when using the touch to swipe I have to touch the face of the watch pretty hard to swipe but figured that's also a part of it not being too sensitive specially with all the activity that's being completed.
 Wear daily....helps with steps and calorie burn....glad I got it
 love it!
 Loved it. Works great.
 Love it so far very accurate. I was using a vivofit and I loved that but I am glad I decided to upgrade!
 She loves this thing great size
 Keeps you motivated
 Love this fitbit.  Wear it every day.  I was on the fence with the color originally, but glad I chose this blue, love it in person!
 Only issue is it's not waterprooof so I can't use it when I swim.
 Love it
 Gave granddaughter a rash
 Love my Fitbit. Does everything its supposed to do. Easy to communicate with phone.
 Very informative.  Wish it was fully water proof.
 My strap broke the same week my Fitbit stopped charging 9 mts after I bought it. I liked it and am not happy that it only lasted 9 months!
 love this!!!love being apple to track everything
 Good
 I previously had a Fitbit Charge HR and when it died, I purchased this one.  It keeps me accountable for getting up and moving!
 Wife loves it
 I would not recommend buying this unless it's from the actual Fitbit store as the battery on mine needs to be charged every night...
 This was a gift and I love it!  Rated it 4 because sometimes the charger is difficult to attach and the clock face doesn't always light up when lifting my arm so I have to tap it. Small inconvenience for such a wonderful fitness watch.
 I lost my Charge 2 over two weeks ago. Today I went to check the spa, yep, there it was, at the bottom. Two weeks, under water in 100 degree temps and it works like a charm. Nicely done FitBit!!!!!
 Really great tool for tracking calories but the step and stair app is so off logging stairs when none are taken and logging miles that aren't walked.
 This is more expensive than the Samsung gear fit 2 and the display looks archaic. The gear 2 looks so much better and does everything this can do.
 It does a lot, but it doesn't track heart rate accurately during hard exercise. Sending it back.
 Love the Fitbit Charge 2. Not only does it track steps, but I use it for health monitoring, to track my heart rate (A-fib concerns) and sleep patterns. I also find the vibrating reminders to get up and walk helpful at work, where I sit at a computer most of the day. Another thing I really like is that the charge lasts several days.
 I'm not an avid exerciser so can't comment on the workout modes but it has been a good investment for everyday use. Battery lasts about a week with daily use and checking time atleast once an hour..
 Shipment arrived on time and my daughter loves it😀
 as described
 I have to reset it every day to get it to sync to my smart phone or laptop.
 I love my Fitbit Charge 2!  I feel that this is just what I needed to help me get back on track with my exercise/healthy lifestyle goals.
 This was better than the 2 previous health fitness trackers I've owned, This one don't have all the other features as my last two but much better quality
 I bought this for my daughter for Christmas.  It was an upgrade from her previous Fitbit and she just told me she loves it.
 these are great. My mom and I are working out together, even 1000 miles apart.
 I wanted to get this productive because it is not as expensive of the others out there and it is also small and portable.
 Lots of fun features.
 Love this!
 My wife and I love this product!
 meets my needs
 An amazing piece of technology.
 this is helping me get in shape
 Skip it. For the price by something different. Band broke before a year in. Coworker had same problem. Seems to be a trend.
 Love it ! It does everything I want it to do such ad monitor my heart rate and record daily activities. I really like the app too. Like others have said I just wished it was waterproof.
 Won't sync with my Samsung Galaxy 4 phone. Now all I have is an expensive piece of plastic I can't use for anything.
 This is second time I purchased the charge2. The first time the device wouldn't sync so I returned it. This time I have had no problems. I love my charge 2. It's 10 times better than the original charge which was a piece of junk.
 Both my husband and I bought these in January. Both screens cracked within 2 months and both of our stopped working this week (only 4 months in) .... I do not recommend
 Love this Fitbit.
 got this for my daughter and she loves it.  No problems.
 love it!
 the device is great, however, the ad we received today from Kohl's -- this is very disconcerting  --  a $50 price difference?????  not good
 great gift
 i like it
 The color is gorgeous and the band fits great.
 Must buy. Best tracker ived ever used. I highly recommend buying it.
 So far, it’s working really well! I use it every day.  It charges great and it really helps me stay on top of my exercise.
 Just what I wanted for the price!
 I am so happy I chose the Fitbit Charge 2.  I especially love that it tells you how long you are in each stage of sleep.  Ohave had it for 2 weeks and it has b!en perfect!
 Works really well. Very durable. Also very easy to set up.
 Was exactly what I expected
 had to send back didn't have dongle.
 Loving this item
 Best purchase I have made this year. I've already lost 5 pounds :)
 Works great, does what it’s suppose to do. Like that it notifies me that I’ve been sitting to long lol
 Does it all.  Very satisfied.
 Christmas gift for my wife, she loves it!
 I'm obsessed with this product and use it daily to keep track of not only my excel use but also how much water I drink and what foods I eat. The app is super self-explanatory and I would recommend this product to a friend
 Love it had it for a few yrs now
 It's great. I'm finally losing weight.
 Excellent tracking device for sleep, exercise, steps, stairs, and general daily activity. This allow you to build trends to analyze your a diet and activities.
 This is so fun and it's addicting to use!
 Pros:<br/>1. The band feels good on wrist, even with some sweat.<br/>2. Cool way of charging.<br/>Cons:<br/>1. Very frustrating interaction "tapping". Doesn't always work for one. Also tapping should be the interaction method like 10 years ago, not on a device selling $130 in 2016.<br/>2. Heart rate read will fail even with very small amount of sweat. I've tried adjusting the band looser or tighter. It did not fix the problem. What's the point of being a sport device if it can't stand some sweat?<br/>3. Very inaccurate readings. I'm not expecting it to be 100% accurate, 20-30% up or down is perfectly acceptable to me. But it counted me walking 22 steps when I in fact only walked 8 steps LOL. It's like the device is designed to make us feel better about ourselves instead of giving an objective monitoring. But if that's indeed what you want, get something cheaper.<br/>4. The price. I have to say for this price tag, I'm completely disappointed. $130 is a third of a good android phone. Yet we are getting something from the 1900s.
 Absolutely love this FitBit.
 Great! I love it. This new fit bit product is the best, works perfectly.  HR monitor is so good, accurate. Perfect......tracks exercises, movements, calories out, steps and sleep.
 good product but this color of band gets dirty very easily. I would think FITBIT would use a material that doesnt get dirty so easily since this wearable is used as a sport companion. Will FITBIT send me a new band?
 wife loved it. Easy to set up.
 Overall the Fitbit charge 2 does well tracking calories and distance when compared to my garmin GPS tracker. It is comfortable to wear and has several options.<br/>The only negative comment I have about the Fitbit charge 2 is that the screen cracked fairly easily, and I have only used the charge 2 for 10 days. As I don't remember hitting the charge against any surface, I assume it must have been a fairly mild contact. Of course it could be that my unit is defective, or that I just didn't noticed when I cracked the unit, however I am inclined to think the quality of the screen is subpart and very fragile. For this reason I have given the charge 2 only 2 stars.
 I like how it reminds me to get moving. Heart rate is good to know.<br/>It registers my steps but I guestion the accuracy.
 My wife loved it
 Best tracker out there. So far no issues.
 It just didn’t work.
 Bought if for a gift. They loved it. Now I'm going to buy one for myself
 Love this more than the previous models I used
 I've had both a Fitbit Flex and a Fkex2 -- Fitbit Charge2 is the best!  It has so many more features and is very comfortable to wear. I've only had it 2 days so I know I will love it even more after I experience all it can do.
 It's a little bulky but it's great!
 I absolutely enjoy this product because it keeps me on target and conscious in walking my 10,000 steps every day!
 I like most everything about it but it doesn't keep very good track of climbing stairs
 It's exactly what I wanted! Fitness tracker and the water tracker on the app especially! Fits great with small and large bands. Battery life is not as good as I hoped, but still does nicely!
 This was a great thing for 8 months. I gave it to my girlfriend and she wore it daily. Now, after 8 months, it doesn't work at all. Just crapped out. No abuse to it, just normal wear. Now I can't contact anyone to see if there is any recourse.
 I love it!  The only flaw I can find is that I wish it had a "Find My Phone" feature.
 My husband loooove it
 love my fit bit....keeps me posted....can keep track of treadmill steps also...
 It lasted a cple of months then stopped.  Disappointed again.
 Is as advertised.
 Everything went smoothly and the item is great!
 She loves it
 I love the watch and it does the job. There are some inaccuracies that could be improved.
 Great purchase. Worth it.
 I love the sleeker design and the ability to change bands.
 Generally ok with the purchase. However, I did not receive a dongle with the watch and this makes it almost meaningless so I have to share mine (this purchase was a gift)
 For something you're supposed to wear almost 24/7, it was pretty uncomfortable.
 Bought this for my mom's birthday and she loved it! It keeps her motivated to work towards goals and she didn't have any issues figuring out how to set it up and use it ( she's bad with technology). Highly recommended!
 Can't wait to see my summer body.  So motivating to see my progress. Loving it!!
 MY HUSBAND LOVES THIS!<br/>EASY SET UP, FAST DELIVERY! IM HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE.
 I originally loved my Fitbit!! But after 7 months of use, it just stopped working. Died. Dead. It was charged. Very disappointing. Not happy after spending that much money on it.
 Love it !!!
 I didn’t need all the bells and whistles just something to encourage me to workout more.
 Worked right out of the box, no problems yet.
 Great
 Great product. Works as advertised
 It’s great tracking not only your steps but your resting heart rate and sleep. Plus water consumption, workouts and more with the app
 Bought this for husband and he loves it!<br/>Very motivating.
 Did what it said it would do
 After months of good use, it's started giving trouble. Losing time and date.
 I will revise my review, maybe.  I went to sync it with my phone and GUESS what this Fitbit doesn't sync with my HTC10 and there is no help for it on either the fitbit site or HTC.  However, this is Fitbit's issue. So if you have a new model phone, you might not want to get a fitbit. My old phone and my old fitbit were a dream together, until the clasp broke and I didn't notice it was gone.
 Gift for wife. loves the features
 Wife loved it and has been using it daily.
 I liked all the futures, but the battery died after 6 months of use :-(
 Much better for me than my old Charge HR
 I do like it a lot. We do not have blue tooth so set up was not much fun. Contacted customer service 2 times and they were very helpful though.
 I don't wear a watch so feels bulky.  At band where Fitbit fits in especially is blocky.  Think Alta is better choice for me.
 Heart Rate Monitoring is very inaccurate.  Does most everything well (tracking sleep,  breathing relaxation, stopwatch).  If accurate heart rate monitoring is what you're looking for, it's better to go with a chest strap... the optical heart rate technology is just not "there" yet.
 Perfect. Easy to set up. Great for all things "getting in shape".
 After 1-2 months of using the fitbit, I love it. I am able to track my sleeping patterns, estimated calories burn, and much more! This is one of a kind for fitness or just keeping track of your steps! 5 stars!
 IT WAS A GIFT - THEY ARE VERY HAPPY
 Exactly what I needed to keep going.  Really like the notifications it gives.
 I love it!
 Confusing set up instructions.  Would not buy again.
 Love it
 Ordered for the wife . She loves it using all time on steps and sleeping recording.
 I'm not sure WHY but the band looks like it's coming apart. Pics below. I've only had this for a couple of months.....
 Wife loved it! great product!
 Husband loves this Fitbit and looks good too!
 Works fine and do what they say it can do. Battery last about 5 to 6 days what is OK, and recharge if very fast.
 Loving it! Cannot live without it anymore. Very comfortable, easy to set up and wear. Impressed with the accurate heart rate and sleep stages data. Water proof  capability as a plus
 So far so good. Relax mode is a life savior
 love it
 the watch serves the purposes I wanted very well.  However, the band gives me some trouble.  It's difficult to insert the metal clip into the slot i wanted,(it keeps wiggling), once I did, I have difficulty inserting the end of the band into the band's closing slip.
 Wear it all the time
 ok
 It's no where as good or sensitive as the original fitbit.  It's trying to be more than it is, and the navigation is much more complicated.  Sorry I got this one, and will likely go back to the original.
 Great product. My wife loves it.
 Really like the wrist band and display.  Could really use a larger font for us old people.  I wish it would run on batteries like the last one because it is a pain to charge it otherwise I would have given the product 5 stars.
 A bit hard to know what some of the icons represent, and not totally accurate in readings.
 Great watch. Sometimes the heart rate monitor is a little iffy as I'll look at the watch and it shows a couple dashes for my heart rate instead of the beats per minute. However, the battery life is amazing and the OLED display is easy to see, even with glare from the sun. Would recommend.
 Great product, liked very much
 Just have to take your time and follow directions and their will no problems.
 I have worn this watch for a day and the lavender belt already looks dirty. It seems to pick up the dye from clothes. It is not acceptable. I had an Apple watch for 2 years and did not have this problem. I can't believe that an accessory can have such a short life-span.
 No one could get it set going to return it
 👍👍
 This Fitbit works well with running. The calorie tracker is not accurate, but it does everything else it’s supposed to do
 Love my new fitbit! Quick delivery..great product!
 Christmas gift for granddaughter who loves it.  Good price.
 Great deal
 did not work right after two weeks.
 Sleep tracking doesn’t work well. Not sure if I got a faulty one but the sleep stages only worked about 10% of the time. Not comfortable on my wrist, especially at night. The band was hard to fasten and unfasten. Not a fan of the design.
 Great fitness tracker. The connected gps feature is fantastic for runs.
 works great arrived on time
 I bought 2. One was for my daughter's 30th birthday. That was the only thing she wanted. She loves it. I really think it has helped to encourage her to exercise. The other one, I kept for myself.
 It needs to be waterproof, but the huge problem is that it records way too many steps. How do you get 600+ steps while you SLEEP
 Love this! I suggest getting the screen protector.
 love it and all the extra bands
 Works great and keeps me moving.
 The Fitbit Charge 2 has increased my steps each day and number of stairs I am doing.<br/>I plan to increase my days of exercising . I have used the deep breathing also.It is a great item to<br/>keep me motivated
 Love it! Bought one for me and my grandmother. I did have a slight allergic reaction to it so those of you with sensitive skin, switch arms.
 Tells me the time, keeps me motivated to move, and had alarms built in. Love it!
 Grossly overstates the number of steps taken by at least 50%. Does not track sleep paterns well.  I don't trust the product.
 Love it.
 product will not charge only lasted about 1.5 months, just over amazon time to return, horrible
 I love my Fitbit charge 2. I'm still learning something new about it every day.  I love the sleep monitor, I knew I wasn't sleeping good but didn't realize how many times I was restless.  But I'm working on it.  I love the challenges with my friends also, great motivation.
 I've had this for a a little over a month.  It was great for the first couple of weeks and now it won't charge or stay charged, and of course it's 4 days past the date to be able to return.
 Use my fitbit everyday! Absolutely love it!
 Love, Love my Fitbit Charge 2 !  I have recently started my journey to better health and fitness. The charge 2 has helped me keep track of my steps which motivates me to exercise more. I absolutely love this device!
 love it!
 Loved the product and serves the purpose.<br/>It’s an awesome invention
 Christmas gift for my son. He loves it.
 I just love this fitbit. This was a Christmas gift for myself! Its amazing.
 I reluctantly took a decision to buy this a year ago . It changed my life and lifestyle forever  . I never remove it and I am so dependent on it . Thank human kind for fitbit !
 MY 15 YEAR OLD LOVES EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS
 Better than the previous model
 I wear this constantly. Love the way it tracks my sleep/wakefulness. I have used most of the features and they're all useful and helpful. The breathing feature is especially great!
 Prompt delivery -- great product!
 When it works it’s great, but that’s when it works😡!!<br/>I’m always having to reset it. It’s so frustrating!!<br/>I would not buy this again.<br/>I would go for a Apple Watch instead...
 I've wanted one of these for a long time . . . the price was great, and shipping was fast.
 Only downfall is the wristband has an odor.  I need to buy another strap.<br/>Very happy with this upgrade from my other Fitbit.
 Works well, is attractive and decently priced
 Can I rate this as 10 stars? I am moving over from the Microsoft Band 2 that was a great device, but the constant band tearing and replacements under warranty were a bit much to deal with. Enter the Fitbit Charge 2! This Fitbit has all of the features I would like, the app on my Apple iPhone 6 has been great, syncs well, and is chalk full of great data each day. The app is very customizable for whatever you want to see on a dashboard. The battery is as stated with a charge needed every five days and that is with constant workouts five days a week! The battery life is far better than the daily charges by the Band 2 or other devices on the market. It is very comfortable on my wrist and looks great. I couldn't be more happy and expect this Fitbit to last a long, long time!<br/>I was so happy with the Fitbit Charge 2 that my wife and I now have (each have one) that we purchased the Fitbit scale. It also syncs flawlessly to our Fitbit accounts, shows up right away in the app, tracks weight/BMI, etc.<br/>I can't say enough about both the Fitbit Charge 2, Fitbit scale, Fitbit app, etc. Just one heck of a complete package for tracking fitness related metrics! This has been after constantly wearing the Charge 2 and using the scale for a month now.
 My first Fitbit. I'm hooked. Would recommend to anyone.
 Excellent item for fitness and everyday activities tracking.
 Absolutely love my fitbit Charge 2! Helps me watch my calorie intake vs what I am burning and it keep me moving!
 I like everything about the Fitbit charger 2, I’m very happy with information it conveys while wearing it.
 great product. works as expected
 Love my Fitbit.  I use most information it offers to improve my health.
 I took my sweet time to review this FItbit Charge 2 HR.<br/>I was previously using another brand which I loved but for which the band was wearing down way too often.<br/>In the end, I love my FItbit but here are more detail:<br/>- Nice app.<br/>- Reliable<br/>- Easy to use.<br/>- Give step, Heart Rate, instantaneous or average.<br/>- Reasonable battery life.<br/>- Nice charger.<br/><br/>What I am missing:<br/>- Does not separate light sleep from deep sleep<br/>- Not waterproof<br/><br/>In conclusion:<br/>Fitbit did not advertise waterproof so I cannot consider it as a con (per say). In fact, there is no false advertisement with this item. I am fully satisfied for the moment.
 great features, really enjoy it, also looks very stylish
 Waste of money. Does not accurately count steps. If you wave your arm around it counts that as steps taken.
 I love my Fitbit. It helps me keep track of my sleep and my workouts. It’s a very useful tool.
 LOVE IT
 Convenient to check the exercise stats. actually achieved targets earlier hence tend to reduce extra walking
 Bought this as a gift for my wife. She loves it. Battery lasts 3-4 days.
 Bought as a gift. They like it.
 Love it!  Best Fitbit!  Meets all my needs and works great.
 LOVE MY FIT BIT! keeps track very well and is very durable.
 Love my fitbit... but I have one major complaint about connected GPS: it's very inconsistent. All other things consistent, some days connected GPS works, some days it doesn't. I've done my best to eliminate all other variables and yet this inconsistency prevails.
 Love all the features of my Fitbit Charge 2! I love the reminders to move (on the hour) and the breathing exercises. I like knowing my heart rate too.
 Way better then the older fit bits
 Long battery life more than 4days
 I like it because I can monitor how much time I sleep.
 I love my Fitbit.  It's great and easy to use.
 I bought the charge 2 for the comfort of the band and the clock, because I have a hard time seeing and the bright display was easy but it was lacking date and time, although I fell in love with the fit side of the product.
 Excellent product
 It's a cool idea but I got this thing for the Heart Rate monitor and it's extremely innacurate. For example, I spent 20 minutes on the stair climber, consistently, and my heart rate was showing around 70-73 bpm however i could barely breathe and the stair climber was showing me about 160bpm. I stopped and took my own pulse and I was at about 160bpm, not 70. This happens during exercise a lot so the heart rate monitor seems to really only be good for when you're sitting down and not performing any activity. Bummer since this is what I got it for. Steps are fairly accurate but overcalculated, meaning I sometimes wake up after a full night's sleep and it says I've taken 200-300 steps during a time where it also says I was asleep.
 Gift. Daughter loves it.
 It is easy to use, confortable, and the apps is very friendly, May be it could be a good idea to be able to take a shower wear it.
 Love it!
 It was a birthday gift for my dad and he liked it because it measured his heart rate accurately.  The only problem was the wrong charger was in the box and he had to buy one at the store.  Beside that, everything was good.
 Pros: Great design, easy to use, customizable interface. Love the reminders to move and the ability to use different bands. The rose gold color of this addition is really nice. Customer service is wonderful (particularly via Twitter).<br/><br/>Cons: absolutely zero durability (and that's a consistent theme of Fitbit products). Battery started draining in less than 24 hours after about 10 months. Customer service worked with me over a period of several weeks to try and figure out why/how to fix, but eventually they just offered me a replacement tracker because it was still under warranty. I had a Charge before a Charge 2, and it did very similar things - it would malfunction after a few months, and Fitbit replaced it under the warranty. However, after a year passes and the warranty is up, it's basically a disposable wearable - it will break and you'll have to buy a new one.<br/><br/>Ultimately, while the product is great, its durability is the deciding factor - I would not recommend this product. To shell out $150+ for this product for it to last a single year is ridiculous.
 I really enjoy the Fitbit.
 the watch is okay, it works well, but there are a few issues i found with it. The fitbit charge 2 does not track steps accurately, it actually just tracks the up and down movement of the arm. Also, for this price, I would like it to track the cycles of my sleep, for example if it is light sleep or deep sleep. I also noticed that after waking up, you remain in bed to read, it counts that as sleep too. In conclusion, it is overpriced for its abilities, I feel as if I paid more for the brand that the ability of the watch!
 It didn't work so I sent it back
 I am in love with this Fitbit Charge 2, this was an upgrade to an old Fitbit and this one just blows the other out of the water!
 My wife loves it.
 I purchased it as a gift for my husband. I was concerned before buying it because he doesn't like anything too "technical". My concern was unfounded. After showing him the basics of using it he has used it every day and has discovered more features that I wasn't even aware of.
 Great product until the dog ate it off the night stand.  Left me very sad.
 My husband surprised me with the charge2 as a Christmas gift and I'm in love! The charge2 is awesome and I'm excited to have he option of changing out the bands whenever I want. It's a jump start to the new year of getting healthier to keep up with my four young kids.
 I would give this a zero if I could.  I would like a refund,  After 4 days the Fitbit did not sync and as of day 5 the Fit bit did not reset each day.  I want a refund.  Hoping the seller contacts me.
 Where it all the time. Sure thought I walked more steps than I actually do. Now have goals to move more and the alarm feature works great.
 love it and I love the new face of the fitbit charge 2
 this was a gift for my daughter
 Fitbit stopped working within a week
 Great!
 great
 Really like this tracker , love the face display especially the time option in seconds on display ( excellent for my job) . This particular one however would not charge at all despite a full day connected to a power source
 my bands purchese on March 29,2017,my band break,is been only 2 months.I order  new bands but dosent fit on Charge 2 HR,please help me.<br/>  Mirta Lamas
 My wife loves it.
 Love this product
 Tells heart rate, how many hours you slept, can be connected to phone, can read text messages on it and you can put in how much water you drink.
 Got it brand new out of the box today and looks like it’s been used but I’m buying it new?? it’s been charging for five hours and won’t work at all.  Turns out the device was broken when I got it. Really disappointed.
 Stopped working after a month
 The only issue with the color is that the dirt gets ground into the band and unable to get it out, no matter what you use to clean or scrub it with. The band on this is much better and does not provoke a rash like the original fitbit charge did.
 Overall a great product, however, the screen does not do a great job turning on when I turn it toward me, so if I feel a vibrate and turn, I can't see why it vibrated without pressing the button... a major lack in the functionality department, if you ask me.
 Exactly what I wanted.
 Works great!
 I love the Fitbit, but the band just fell apart after only a few months, can A new band be sent or fitbit replaced, haven't even had it a year
 Love it! Just what I wanted.
 I have only had it for about a week as a replacement to my Chart HR, but thus far I've found it to be a reasonably solid upgrade. My major complaint is with the polarization of the screen. As I'm sure is the case with many others, I wear polarized sunglasses when hiking/running, etc and the screen appears to have inconsistent polarization causing me to struggle to get a quick read while on the trail. It is inconvenient and also a bit dangerous as I find myself fidgeting with my glasses and/or Fitbit and not paying attention to my footfalls.
 Works well.
 Lost 5 lbs in the first week
 I like it a lot. My girls have the watches which I would like to have one day.
 Great product just sucks that it's not water proof so have to take it off for shower and swimming
 I love my new fitbit.
 Bought it for my husband as a Christmas gift. He wears it every day to keep track of his steps.
 I love my Fitbit Charge 2. The display is crisp and easy to read. The interchangeable bands are such a plus. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to take charge of their health habits.
 Use it because it works.
 Daughter really liked it
 I have had this product for a little under 7 months. It has been ok. About 2 weeks ago I noticed a small crack on the charge 2 face after a round of golf. It has since grown all the way down the face. I wear it through out my day, but my main activities are golfing and walking. When contacting Fitbit I received a response somewhere along the lines of it was your fault. I haven't slammed it into anything and have not abused the product. This product isn't worth the money if it can't hold up to my perceived intended use of an fitness tracker which includes golf, walking, sleeping, and the rigors of accounting
 Works as expected and I am really sold on the sleep tracking features. My only complain is that the displace scratches over time. However, the scratches do not effect the functionality of the tracker, only its aesthetics.
 I needed a new Fitbit and I decided to try the Fitbit Charge 2 and I like it.
 Display stopped working after 5 months. I have tried resetting the watch as recommended without success.
 I agree with many of these wonderful reviews. I just want to point out several things that are not given by others:<br/><br/>1. The band is much longer than the charge hr. I own the small version of both devices. I used to use the 2nd hole in HR, but I found I am using the last but one hole in Charge 2, both are counting from the tail of the band.<br/><br/>2. It supports Chinese in text messages. I think it would support other UTF codings.
 Purchased as a gift.  As I understand it, she is enjoying this. Per the person it was gifted to:  The only issue is in using this while working out, sweat tends to make the unit quit working until such time as it can be dried off.
 Easy to change out bands
 Great fit
 The strap broke off. I've had it less than 3 months
 Love the product but impossible to find a lavender replacement band with the matte finish clasp. And, the band looks slightly dirty almost immediately- tried cleaning as recommended- didn’t help. So sad.
 I love the Charge 2 - It is amazing! It keeps me moving in the office and after work.  I have join the weekly challenge and I am hitting my goals everyday!  This is just what I needed.  So happy with my Charge 2.
 Works great easy to use
 Pretty good, nice size, not bulky at all
 Better built than the charge like the metal housing should last a while had 4 months no issues.
 I like fit it products. Their phone app is great as well.
 Love this tracker...it has everything I need to measure including text and phone notifications...
 Purchased as a gift...no complaints here!
 Had this for not even 4 months and the band broke.  Should last lot longer than that for this price.
 my wife likes it
 Works great as  motivator. Like the weekly reports. The watch and wristband are bit wide for my wrist. Since I wear it most of the time I do remove it periodically. Also be careful if you wear wrap on wrist weights during workouts.
 By far the best fitness tracker I've ever owned! I love it! It is kind of large and hard to sleep with on. I'm getting used to it though. The large band was way too big but that can easily be fixed because of the interchangeable bands.
 Easy to use and set up.  I like that it automatically starts my workouts.  Glad I bought the screen protector or my screen would have been scratched the second week of having it.
 I love it! Easy to set up, many intractive programs to assist in my goal to be more active.
 As far as Amazon goes it's great with costumer care now as for the BitFit I don't know. As you already know we had to return one due to its bad quality but I guess in a perfect world that would not have been a problem. Thank you for resolving my issue. David Trujillo
 I bought this product back in August 2017 and I'm still using it in December 2018!
 I love it...it talks to me when I'm being lazy and that makes me laugh.  I like the way it charts my exercise on a graph that I get through my email.  I also love that you can get text messages on it if your I-phone is nearby .
 Not one for electronics or the latest gadgets but this is great! It offers more than expected. Enjoying it very much. Highly recommend
 works like a champ
 Only problem - Regular Fit Bit did not even last a year.  Now, Fitbit Charge, I'm on 3rd one, they don't last. I like product itself though would like them to fix this problem.
 Love my fitbit.  This is my second and it keeps me on track.
 not accurate has to be set perfectly in a certain spot on your wrist. Needs work and priced way to high
 Purchased, didn't charge. Returned for another, also didn't charge. Read online about rampant firmware issues.
 Excelent
 Husband loves it!
 I cannot live without it now... it is always with me...
 Great
 Love, love my Fitbit.  I would recommend to others.
 The best.
 not sure if it the watch or the replacement bands. on the one side of the watch I can not release the mechanism to change the bands. there seems to be some marks on the watch which tells me something is not working together
 Very disappointed to spend so much money only to have the watch fall apart.
 I love this product.<br/>Fitbit in general is a great product.
 Love it! Upgraded from Flex 2 and love all the extras. Good value. Recommend.
 I love my new fitbit.  holds a charge longer than my last one and I like the new additional features.
 Good product! Just as advertised
 There was no dongle in the box. Good thing I had a spare.
 This broke within a few months.  It just completely stopped working.  I am trying to figure out how to return this.
 works great and easy to sync
 LOVE IT
 Wear it every day! Love the feature of getting text messages on it as well.
 Love it!!
 Love it. Does everything and more. The app is very complete as well. Good price and functionality
 Worked fine for the first 90 days then it quit connecting to the iPhone and recording data<br/>Not worth the money.
 watch never worked.
 I would like to return the item...i don't have much time use it and meeting dste line. Please send me a return address. It would not workout for me please. Sincerely, Nicholas Tindong 04/25/2018
 Mine kept falling apart to the point of where it came off my arm and it was lost.... extremely disappointed!!!
 Tracking steps
 great product love it
 Difficult to pair with fitness pal
 works as expected
 This is a wonderful product. It reminds me to get up and get moving to reach my goals.
 Great equipment! The app is very good and presents usefull report of the collect data.
 my husband is in love and addicted to it! great present
 This is not accurate at all. I understand that it will not work as well as a monitor connected with tens and pads but this is way off. My heart rate was in the 170's and this was all over the place even in the high 80's when I am going all out for 12 minutes straight and it wasn't my first exercise.  How do I know, because I have three stents in my heart and I was being monitored at a medical facility at the moment.  Also when I'm doing any cardio the fitbit wouldn't pick up a heartrate or even that I was exercising.  The GPS horrible, my route that it tracked showed that I can ride thru water or on it, take your pick.  I bought this just for the purpose of my heartrate, my doctor wanted me to keep it under  a certain rate. I thought it was good because it matched my Garmin 800 cycling computer with monitor and the more I learned to use the different features the more it failed to do what it was supposed to do.  Mind you that I wasn't even sweating when it started failing to work properly. Excellent seller though, no complaints about them
 This was also a gift. The recipient seemed to be very happy with it.
 Awesome !!
 Set up was impossibly hard.Returning product has been problematic.If you buy it do it in store where you can get help.It could be a great product but we never found out.
 Very comfortable, good stats.
 Love my Fitbit.  This Fitbit keeps up with my steps so I’m encouraged to get more steps.
 It broke off my arm Like my last fit bit did
 easy to use great app available for it.  Screens really bright
 Hmm, not sure if I like having a device that reminds me that I need more exercise.<br/><br/>No, really, because of the Fitbit, I do walk more and don't complain when I have to park far from my destination.<br/><br/>It also has shown me that I'm not getting nearly as much sleep as I thought I was getting.<br/><br/>The charging cable is fairly short, so make sure your charger port is on the desk, not behind the bed! I charge it about 15 minutes per day and can go for several days without charging it without a problem. I do try to fully charge it about once a week. I think it will go for 4-5 days without a charge if you turn off the continuous synch option.<br/><br/>I do wish it were more water resistant, but a few splashes when washing the dishes doesn't seem to bother it.<br/><br/>Overall, this has been very helpful in improving my awareness of my exercise level and I look forward to keep using it for years to come!
 Love it! I am new to fitbit products but it does exactly what I wanted it for and it fits and looks nice.
 Recommend highly! !
 I'm sure the product is great. It's annoying that it didn't come charged!!! It wouldn't even finish hooking up to the app before it died!
 Easy to switch bands love the product
 Gave to my husband on his birthday. My husband wears it all the time.
 Absolutely LOVE
 I absolutely love my Fitbit charger 2. I updated from the previous model and the features are so much better.
 Works great and looks good.
 My wife absolutely loves it.
 I bought the Fitbit to monitor my heart rate while exercising.  It turns out it is not very good at monitoring exercise heart rate.  While weightlifting at the gym I would check it between sets against taking my pulse using the sweep second hand on a wall clock and it was from 8 to 20 beats low.  While checking it on a rowing machine it read 77 several times and I am certain it was well over 100.  Reviewing the Fitbit literature it is a resting heart rate monitor.  It seems to track your steps very well.  I played 18 holes of golf and later in the day checked my results and I had climbed 9 flights of stairs.  The golf course in Florida was flat, no stairs at all that day.  When you lift it to look at it the display shows date time and steps.  To get heart rate you nee to push the button on the side which is not always convenient when exercising.  The resting heart rate graph for the day usually has some strange periods spiking over 80 or 90 when I am resting with a normal resting heart rate of 54.  I have actually caught it doing the high resting heart rate and confirmed my pulse was no where near what the display showed.  Since it tends to be wrong on the exercising heart rate and has spikes in the resting heart rate I suspect the calorie burn is also not very accurate.  If you want to measure only your steps and resting heart rate it would be good for you.  I would not recommend it for monitoring active exercise heart rate.
 Fits perfect for my Fitbit!
 Bought it as a Mother's Day gift and it already broke. Quick customer service fixed the problem.
 Frustrated that the battery does not hold charge. On my 2nd replacement in 4 months, this last replacement hasnt held a charge more than 48 hours per charge from the time I received it.
 I love my Fitbit! It is fantastic and has helped me achieve my fitness goals. I can set little alarms to remind myself to drink water and to move more! Definitely recommend it!
 nice product
 Overall decent product. The strap broke at exactly 4 months, need to replace. Originally very fast charge time, now slower. Sleep indicator is pretty good.
 Amazing the amount of data this thing spits out from sitting on your wrist.  I enjoy this product and recommend it.
 I love it so far!  I love that it prompts me to be more active.
 I really do like the features and battery life but the quality is atrocious. My entire family of 5 each own one.  All are broken.. less than one year of use.  DO NOT BUY.  JUNK
 Bought it as a gift for her. She loves it.
 Completely addicted to my fitbit!!!
 as expected
 MY SON IS THOROUGHLY ENJOYING HIS FITBIT WATCH.  THANKYOU
 I love my Fitbit!! Keeps me in on track with activity and exercise.
 More than fitness. Lifestyle tracking.
 This was gift for my wife and she loved it
 Wife loves it
 All good.
 I love it!
 Love it.
 This replaced a previous model. I like the features I have tried so far. The screen is so much better than the Charge 2 that I replaced. It's much larger and so much easier to read.
 I purchased this as more of gadget but found out  it is a good tool. I was previously logging on paper things like my weight and calories eaten but this gives me a good idea of what I am burning. My weight is about where I want at 160 lbs  so I know log the food and it figures out what I burn which is nice. I work out about 5 days a week and being able to track my workouts is also nice but is good  even if you just walk around the block and only need to track your weight. You do need to take the time to log in what you have eaten to get some benefit out of the calorie count feature. The sleep mode that tracks my sleep is interesting but not sure of its value but I do check it every day.  It  does have a small learning but there is plenty of information on fitbits site and the internet in general to help answer any questions. I would recommend this its a good tool to keep you in, or help get you in shape
 Works great but did not come with charger
 I love my Fitbit!!  I had some questions regarding how to enter in specific exercises so that it would register on my daily exercise tab.  Fitbit was very responsive and gave me step by step instructions.  I would highly recommend this product.
 may not be worth the money
 Left a burn-like mark on my wrist, not sure whether it's a chemical reaction or what:(  I hope it goes away after a couple of days.
 very disappointed with this item just found out a major crack on the screen less then a month after purchase
 Works well and I love beating my family in the challenges.
 Fails to charge 1 week after return window closed! Contacting manufacturer for return or replacement. Will update once resolved . . .
 Keeps me motivated . Least favorite thing clock is only visible when  press button
 My Daughte loves her fitness watch
 Gift for my husband since I enjoy mine so much. I was going to get the Apple Watch after having the Fitbit HR for almost 2 years. After doing my research this fitness tracker was more of what I wanted.
 I LOVE my fitbit.. but I can see that I'll have to change the band in the near future...
 A very useful tool for guiding you towards better health. Provides lots of useful tracking info such as heart rate, sleep pattern, weight, etc. Like a personal trainer 24/7!<br/>I'd love to see blood pressure sensor integrated in next version.
 Very happy with the new Charge 2.  Had a Flex which was a horrible experience.  Completely fell apart within months.  Charge 2 is without doubt a better purchase.  Worth the extra cost.
 LOVE IT!
 love Fitbit, even give you reminders once it is time to exercise.
 For my wife, looks great works great.
 Works well. Does a great job of keeping track of you activity which does motivate me to do more. I did not like that the band broke off the watch after 3 days. I had to purchase a replacement band.
 Our son loved it.<br/>Now our whole family can have competitions.<br/>Easy to set up
 Great !! I love it
 Bought for my wife. Is working as expected. I have the Fitbit surge and this does almost all the things it does except it is smaller
 love it
 gave as gift
 Great purchase!
 Wear it everyday &amp; love it :)
 Bought it for my wife. She likes it.
 Love it!
 My only criticism is that riding my exercycle does not trigger the odometer. I have to strap it to my ankle which is not a great solution. Other than that I am happy.
 No issues with this product.
 Love the fitbit. I had a previous version and the wristband broke soon after I received it. This one is so much better than the earlier version! So much more details and I love the interchangeable wristbands.
 Such an upgrade! I love it!
 this Fitbit is not syncing to my iPhone,  I cannot change the time, when we went in daylight saving time.  wasted  $149.00!
 Product lit up when first attached to charger, light went out and does not work at all.  Nothing happens when pushing butten.
 iIt works well, but  one should be told if your computer does not have a blue tooth you need to order one in a seperate order.
 beautiful colors
 it works great!
 Bought the fitbit charge 2 and really wanted to like it.  This the replacement that doesn't work correctly for the original that also did not work correctly.  Unit consistently under counts steps, usually by 10-30%.  I know this because I walk on a treadmill and it is easy to count actual steps taken in 1 min, 5 min, or more.  At 4 miles per hour on the treadmill I get 132 steps per min times 30 min equals 3960 steps.  Fitbit Charge 2 consistently gives me about 3400 steps and sometimes a lot less. I can only assume that it is also under counting on my other daily activities, so on a day where fitbit says I walked 20,000 steps I can assume that I actually walked at least 23,000 steps. I have tried resetting, changing height, both up and down, and replacing unit all to no avail.  It also way over counts calories, probably by at least 50%.  As a toy the Fitbit charge 2 is fun to play with but as a serious health and fitness tool it is totally worthless.
 My son loves this Fitbit worth the money I spent for this very happy with my purchase
 Love my new Fitbit 2❤️️ If I'm sitting down to much it tells me to get up and get moving. Plus the text messages I can see.
 Exactly what I wanted for my daughter for Christmas. Came quickly!
 Girl friend loves it!
 Has many great features and keeps me on track!  Love the morning vibrating alarm!
 I bought this fitbit on May 5.  Less than four months later the strap is already broken! cannot be reconnected!
 was as described
 Very good product. Not recommended for nurses, as it is requires the other hand to display the seconds.
 Very satisfied with the performance.
 At times, unreliable.
 I am new to the concept of Fitbit, but  it appeals to me because it provides valuable information about me of which I was previously unaware (the daily step count, heart rate monitor, and the sleep analysis information.)  I know I am not even close to utilizing all that the Fitbit can do, but I sure am having fun exploring it.  If you are at all curious about learning these things about yourself, then get one.  At first it feels a little "Big Brother-ish", but I for one am glad to know, for instance, how really poorly I sleep and am taking steps to fix the problem.<br/><br/>The Fitbit is smart and very intuitive.  It was a breeze to set up and the Fitbit App is informative and very user-friendly.  All in all, I am excited that I have a Fitbit and can highly recommend it.
 Not worth the money if you want more than steps. To get activity minutes, you have to be active for at least 10 minutes. Will get another brand.
 I love my fitbit, but after a few weeks it has trouble synking to my computer even when hooked up with cable.
 Exactly as I expected!  Love the product and it came packaged very well.
 Beautiful perfect and love it
 easy to use
 Great product. Much improved over original charge HR. Don’t buy cheap imitations!
 love it! serve my purposes.
 Love it.
 I never thought I'd really like one, but it is the best thing for me.  I wanted to track my sleep and activity and this does that and so much more.
 works great, very happy with it
 I like it but wish I could take blood pressure also
 I LOVE this!!
 This is a great product!
 I love my new Fitbit Charge 2. I like that i dont have to carry my phone around with me because it lets me know when i get a text or phone call. It keeps me motivated throughout the day and allows me to join challenges w my friends &amp; family to see who gets the most steps.
 Purchased this for a wellness challenge at work, and it is actually way more motivating than I realized! Also this one you can change the bands on, which I think is great.
 Love it , use all the time ! Very helpful ! Great !
 InLOVE this Fitbit charge 2. It's user-friendly, smile to set up and easy to understand. The health snapshot is particularly helpful. Fuss-free. I highly recommend this device!
 I like the added features on the newer model - easy to read display
 love it
 It's good. It's not giving me enough steps. But that would be cheating. I should step more
 Great
 Love these watches.
 Hello "Rational Consumers" =) my name is Zane and I have been using this product everyday since it arrived in the mail a month and a half ago. I would like first to say that I do not have a CELL PHONE to PAIR this WITH. so when I opened the box I was rather upset to realize my misfortune as they did not bother to include the wireless connection dongle, so i could pair it with my recently upgraded *although I didn't want or need to*, windows platform, at least now I can be upset about President Donald Trump trying to hurt my friends politically from the un wanted updates of news regularly sent to my windows 10. anyway so I came back to amazon and accidentally bought the OLD bluetooth dongle. YAY! needless to say I have been using a cell phone belonging to somebody else to track my results. I would like now to share that experience....<br/><br/>Everyday I will show up to work an hour early and use the building I work in as a running track, I have been recording every single run every single day on my fitbit charge 2 and I was interested to discover that the faster I ran the less distance I had to cover, LOL it really makes the space time wrinkle theory make sense when you look at it from that prospective... anyway so Everywhere the Fitbit is constantly saying "try the GPS get MORE ACCURATE results" and not having GPS I was rather Excluded<br/><br/>So finally I borrowed a GPS to get a measurement that I could re apply all my times to so I could understand better my speed and distance... I followed the google HOW TO set up GPS. and it gave me every instruction except for the last one that actually activated it "BLUETOOTH SHARE LOCATION"  so I ran a 1.71 recorded distance thinking that It was GPS only to find out it did nothing So I turned it on, FINALLY! hopped on my enduro and DROVE THE DISTANCE trying only to get a measurement by satellite. to find that my 1.60-1.89 range was "MORE ACCURATELY" Recorded at .18 Miles... silly me thinking I was running almost 2 miles It really set me back in my excitement. I must have wrinkled space time....<br/><br/>Any way moral of the story if you want to have a cardio fitness score higher than "GOOD-AVERAGE" I would recommend going to a place with the equipment to accurately measure something like that because this devices "GREATER ACCURACY" and its Regular step pace ratio Are in fact one and the same and the GPS just Scribbles a line on a map and doesn't measure anything....<br/><br/> Thank you for taking the time to read this review I hope It helps your decision... I would have put 5 stars if the GPS actually had a Function.. But I put three because they try really hard to sell me on something that does nothing.... It is however really nice to know that work will burn approx. 5000 calories out of me on a good day, and it really helps me know when I got good sleep although the feeling I get naturally of "WELL RESTED" does just as well... anyway thank you
 My husband upgraded his flex and loves his new Charge!
 Love it
 Nothing like a fitbit! I've tried some of the other brands and they just aren't as good.
 Great health tool.
 Works great
 I've had this device for two months and the screen is all scratched up and have a crack in it. The device is great, but the screen is a mess. The device is still new. It should not be this damaged.
 Fits great and easy to use.
 Love it, I love the sleep feature.
 Great product
 I purchased the product for my wife, she loves it. Would buy again.
 If I could give this 0 stars, I would. It was great in the beginning, but I have noticed on multiple occasions that it tells me I workout 0 days a week, even when I records 30+ minutes of activity daily. I also do approximately 40 minutes of cardio with my workouts and average up to 2-3 miles during that, and the Charge 2 doesn't record them at all. I have used another fitness app just to see what the difference is and the Fitbit has been 1,000-2,000 steps off. Extremely disappointed. And as for the floor counter, I wouldn't even bother looking at it. I lived on the 3rd floor of a house when I bought it, but apparently I didn't do any floors most days 😑.
 Use it every day. Tracks my xercise routine. Keep me focused.  Lost 40 pounds in 2 months by maintaining my goals.
 Love it
 love it!
 My wife loves it. :o)
 Great product. It keeps me constantly aware of my health status.
 LOVE 💜 my Fitbit Charge 2!  I had purchased one for my son &amp; one for my hubby. They both loved theirs, so I decided it was time for me to get one. I enjoy all the features on this Fitbit. My Fitbit has been just the motivation I needed to get up and moving. Great product!
 The buzzing notification does not work. I’ve googled and tried everything.
 Works and looks great!
 Love it! Charges fast, battery lasts for days!
 I love my Fitbit. I helps me keep track of my sleep. The accuracy is amazing. Excellent tool for helping you get in shape.
 One of the main reasons I purchased the charge 2 was to track my sleep; unfortunately, it always significantly understates the number of hours slept and is useless for that purpose.
 This is my life. An alarm alerts me, notifications when I get a text and phone rings.. not to mention the ability to see what time it is.. the only issue I have is when I'm super sweaty, it won't read heart rate. But I love the way it keeps me motivated
 Great product - accurate and precise.  However the quality of the band and clasp is cheap to say the best.  I had to order a new band within 2 weeks as the clasp broke.
 Love it
 Charge HR2 is a great improvement to my Charge HR. I like that it tracks my sleep and it prompts me of when am I supposed to move.
 I love it. It's perfect for what I need it for.
 Different but works great!
 :)
 This review is for those who are looking for something simple and may not be as tech-savvy as you might like.  I bought the Fitbit and tried to set it up using my Windows 10 laptop because I don't have a smartphone.  It turns out that my laptop does not have Bluetooth, so I would need to have purchased a separate "dongle" to make this work.  Being anxious to get set up, I next tried to do so using my Amazon Fire table (which does have Bluetooth).  It turns out that this is not a supported device and therefore does not work.  Neither of these important points are mentioned in the product description, so I thought I'd share this to save other unsuspecting users the hassle.  I looked at the app and it also appears that I would only use about 5% of the functionality.  All I really need is a reliable heart-rate monitor that doesn't require a chest strap.  So, this is probably a great device if you're an avid workout fan and have the technical know-how to set it up.  For those of us who need something simple, not so great.
 Bummed that they changed the charger again. I bought this as a replacement for the charge 1 that deteriorated through EVERYDAY wear and tear. Works great just bummed about charger.
 this has worked great so far. it has done everything I thought it would do...
 I love my Charge 2, Favorite fitbit yet!
 Love it.
 does every thing i need Don't buy the leather band it is a rip off
 Perfect for me and what I need it for easy to use
 Love it! Thank you
 Awesome
 Love this!!
 My wife uses it all the time.  Works great
 I gave it as a gift, and she tells me she Loves it.
 I returned it because it has a factory defect. It has a line on the LCD.
 Easy to set up and works accurately.
 Arrived on time and all good
 Sleep tracker inaccurate too expensive for what it does wont show who its calling you only when messages it will show the name and the message and if your looking to connect with with s health it will not
 My mom loves it does what it says it will do According to her .
 love it
 Good
 Love this thing!
 Perfect FIT BIT!
 Just got it for birthday in feb. loved it, then now it wont charge or work at all.... wished i had it back to working... spent over 130 for it for what????
 I really like this device, though the band is not too flexible...not very easy to take it off
 Encouraged me to get up and take steps
 Great
 Works great
 Wife loves it
 Fantastic
 straps broke within a month. fitbit now says im walking over 9 miles a night while im sleeping
 It tells you to get up move! Also makes you challenge yourself to hit a goal everyday. It tells you your heart rate when walking, just sitting, etc,
 Exactly what I wanted!!
 Grt
 battery level doesn't seem to last very long but overall i like it
 The size is right and it does everything I want
 Pretty much what I read and expected. You gotta play around with it for a few days to figure it out fully.
 Met my expectations. Would recommend this product
 Great for my teenager
 Life the Charge 2 so much better than the Charge!. . . just shows more. . .love the sleep evaluations and heart rate.
 Bought this model as a replacement for a Charge HR. Like the large display and replaceable bands.
 I am enjoying the daily feedback.
 Bought it in January and have only recently started to going to the gym. It dies, however, run out of battery faster now.
 Have had it for a few months and love it so far. Has a long battery life and does what it's expected to do.
 Readings are innacurate. Its useless.
 Bought as a gift. Holds charge very long. Accurate readings.
 Bought this to replace my Apple Watch and found it to be very inaccurate, to the extent is wasn't even worth wearing other than to track steps. Both heart rate and distance walked/hiked were incredibly inaccurate.
 awesome tech
 It's exactly what I wanted, I love it! It stays charged for at least a week and only takes about 25 minutes to charge completely. It's perfect for me!
 was christmas gift
 Great product!
 The Fitbit is amazing and I am still trying to learn the basics.<br/>It is a bit overwhelming and offers way more information than<br/>I need.  But I do enjoy the basic functions, especially my<br/>sleep patterns.
 Love it. Buy it; it will hold you accountable for taking your daily steps.
 love this fitbit I am doing very well in my walking :-)
 Great watch  easy to read but wish it was waterproof waterproofing isn't new technology so it should be waterproof for a fitness watch and the charger hookup is touch to the point where it's kind of a pain
 Wife loves it
 Stopped working after 6 months of use. Never got wet except for sweating lightly during walks and runs. Garbage. I wish I wouldn’t have spent so much money on it!
 I am loving my Fitbit charge 2, it's perfect for what I was looking for.
 Love my Charge 2 Fitbit so I got one for my husband.  We started out with the HR and when the Charge 2 came out we decided to<br/>Upgrade.  We like the features of the Charge 2 and it is easier to charge the battery than the HR.
 k
 Only accurate when walking.  Inaccurate heart rate on rower, elliptical.  Good for reminder to move during day, phone can do that. Not wearing it anymore.  Save your money.
 I like this one more than my previous charge.<br/><br/>Cons: No option for clock face with seconds shown in numerical fashion, no military time.<br/>When driving you can have a HUGE discrepancy with flights climbed and steps. Their solution is to go to their website and log 'driving' as an activity and it will negate everything from that time frame. If it's that big of an issue, they should make it one of the workout options for the app interface so ou don't need to go to a computer to fix your step count.
 works great thanks
 ok
 good product
 I wear it around the hospital for work. Fits comfortably and the battery life is what sold me. It lasts about 5 days and charges within two hours, maybe less. A great buy if you're looking for a start on a Fitbit lifestyle.
 It is amazing so far!!!!
 Wife loves it, great Christmas present. She is very competitive and its a great way to track her progress
 Awesome,  just what i expected
 When I got it there was a scratch / crack in the screen... I requested for a replacement.. hope everything is fine with the new one.
 would have given 5 stars but the band rubbed my wrist.<br/>Bought another band and I love it.
 Exactly what I was expecting! Very happy with my purchase.
 as promised
 I really wanted to love this product. I'm very much into fitness and health and I thought this would be a great to to help track my progress. The Fitbit is beautiful design rise but unfortunately it's not accurate at all.<br/><br/>I found that it wouldn't count my steps when I was actually walking but it would count them while I was asleep, driving my car, and work sitting at my desk. To test my theory that it must track when you move your arm, I started taking the Fitbit off while driving. Sadly, I got the same result, it counted steps while sitting in my cup holder. I consider still keeping it for the heart rate part but I found that was also inaccurate. It was reporting my heart rate also while sitting in my car cup holder. Sadly I'm disappointed in this product. For the amount of money you pay I would think it would be more accurate. I will be returning this 😔.
 The Fitbit Charge 2 is an excellent tool to use to monitor your daily progress while trying to achieve a healthy balance in your life concerning sleep, diet and exercise.
 Best fitness tracker I ever used👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
 Definitely not medical grade accurate, but does a good job keeping me informed.  Especially like the sleep monitor.
 We bought this nine months ago.  The battery is dead and can’t be changed.  It should be under warranty, trying to see how to return it.
 This item as been a favorite but the wrist band comes apart very easily and falls off.  It is less than 6 months old.
 Love it!!!!!
 Great buy
 Really like this tracker. It fits well and works just like it said it would. Keeps battery power for about 4 days for me and the app is awesome.
 The best fitness band I have owned!!  Love it!!
 Stated falling apart after 6 months of use. Contacted Fitbit to see if they would replace product and was denied. Time to switch brands. Waste of money.
 I got this so I could start keeping track of my fitness. So far, it is marvelous. There are so many features I didnt even know about when I bought it. It works great, it feels great, and it looks great. My fitness is steadily increasing and I'm able to track my progress and see which exercises are actually helpful and such.<br/><br/>The food tracker is also really helpful in planning my diet. The alarms work really well. They're not the annoying, loud, blaring ones, but are silent vibrations that will surely wake you.<br/><br/>My only issue is that it's not water-proof so I can't swim with it, but that's something I knew before I got it, so no complaints.<br/><br/>It syncs so easily with my surfacebook and the reminders during the day to be active have really helped me so far. Overall, I would highly recommend this to someone looking to track their fitness.
 Girlfriend uses it every day.
 worked great out of the box. Easy to set up. Time will tell about battery life and dependability
 Like it but battery doesn’t keep charge long . Sometimes doesn’t bring up your steps and other things . Sporadic
 Love the look!
 It works for me great.
 works well
 I love this Fitbit! I have not had a problem with it yet, and it's been a few months. It helps me track EVERYTHING. Charges quickly, has many features. It's amazing.
 Great fitness watch!
 Good
 Great product bought as a present. Made a wonderful gift
 My daughter loves it.
 Everything Fitbit promised! I'm in love with my new Fitbit!
 Works great.  Heart rate function and sleep tracker have helped me learn about how diet and exercise affect both.
 I like to see the steps I take they can add up fast at times I go for walks . I also like the way how many calories in burned.  Very good watch to tell me how many hours I slept. Great watch.
 Only giving it an4 because it arrived not working. Screen did not display. However, Amazon was very quick to get me a replacement that worked great. Fitbit support was also great to communicate with.
 AS EXPECTED
 LOVE my new Fitbit.
 Great fitbit.
 initially tried linking with the laptop but had all kinds of problems..... went to the phone app and everything went very smoothly.<br/>my wife has this linked to her phone and her ipad.
 I love the Fitbit but it gives me WAY more steps (tracks steps for me tapping my head) and does not recognize my NON-cardio workout
 Perfect for me.
 Love everything about this Fitbit!
 I love this product!
 Love the product but it was missing a part that caused frustration with the set up. Once he received the missing part my husband was able to get it to work and loves it.
 Order went as stated !
 AWESOME tool
 It works very well does everything I expected. The battery maintains a charger longer than I expected. Don't really like the band that came with it but it does the job. Just ordered a replacement band.
 Great product, very beautiful
 Heart beat rating was inconsistent and with in week the battery charging dropped to half day. I am disappointed after 2 months of use.
 Would be five stars but package was delayed. I really liked the sleep tracking feature and the hourly 250 step reminders. I also really like the features on the app.
 Too sensitive. It records any arm movement as a step.
 I have been pleased with the performance and available information relating to my level of exercise. I did notice that sometimes the Fitbit did no reset to a new day. It continued adding information to the previous day. Have not figured out on how to correct this problem.
 Ordered this for my wife's birthday on 8-1-17 and we received it by 8-8-17.She absolutely loves it! No bad reviews here!
 it was not a very useful product for me for the money what is paid....
 Bought this for my wife and it is perfect.  It's very lightweight and tracks everything she needs.
 great fitness watch
 First one was fine until it simply went dead. Second one is doing fine. Was well within warranty period, so replacement was no cost.
 This is an awesome product! I love all the features it has. The battery life is also one of the best I've seen on any mobile device. Worth it. :)
 After finally getting it set up, I have enjoyed it. But they do not include the wireless dongle any longer. If you don't happen to have Bluetooth, it will never set up without the dongle. So I had to order that also. It was very frustrating at first.
 love it<br/><br/>Sleep app great
 When it got to hot outside. Texas heat killed it quit working. Had to replace this twice.
 Love my new Fitbit 2!  Wish it came with instructions so I could do more.
 I love my fit bit. Tracks heart rate and sleep patterns.
 Great!
 I love this Fitbit. This is my second one. I upgraded from the charge to the charge 2.
 Excellent product..
 This has been a real disappointment. The heart rate tracking has never been accurate and given that's one of the main things this is all about there's no excuse for that. I take my elderly dog for a leisurely walk daily and it consistently has me getting into my peak heart rate zone during this activity. Then when I do my HIIT training on my bike it consistently fails to detect my heart rate or has it down at 60-70 beats per minute. I do appreciate the notifications of texts and calls on my phone and the customer service has been accommodating, replacing it twice but all three devices have had the same issues so it's clear it's just a lemon product.
 Really enjoy that it also monitors my sleep. Can compare how I feel when I get up in morning with how it says how I slept.
 been using this one since start of the year. very happy with the purchase.
 Love this!  Had the charge hr and just upgraded to the charge 2! So many amazing features!
 Open the box, goto website.<br/><br/>First step -- plug in dongle --- SORRY NOT DONGLE in your BOX!!!!!!<br/><br/>First step FAIL.
 Love it
 Best thing ever!!! I love my fit bit.
 I got this for my wife and it arrived just yesterday. I was pretty excited about this, but after fiddling with it for a little bit, it was clear pretty quickly that this product is extremely underwhelming. First, the screen is not a touch screen, just glass. There is only 1 button that allows you to navigate the different screens in one direction (if you miss your screen, you can't go back, gotta keep looping around). It does not display calories on the watch itself, you must go to the app to see anything. It also won't show calories burned per walk/run, it just shows you your overall (whole day) calories burned.<br/>I understand that this is a fitness watch, and it's not supposed to have all the fancy features of a Samsung Gear or an Apple Watch, but the price is not cheap enough to justify its lack of any "nice' features.<br/><br/>A Gear s1 is cheaper, Gear s2 is cheaper (at the right place) and an Apple watch series 1 is less than a 100 bucks more. They will do everything this watch does (minus the floor count) and a whole-lot more.
 Good
 It would help if the gift didn't have the clearance price tag that came from Walmart.
 Nice !!  Is the best.
 Great.
 My husband loves his Fitbit.
 Great product.  Delivered on time.
 Tracks everything i need it to plus a few things. Looks good to.
 I especially like the capability to see my heart rate and any stairs I've climbed. Just wish it had the same bands that snap on as my Alta. Not crazy about this buckle.
 He is having fun with it.
 I love it thank you
 Works perfect, my son loves it. Great price. Thanks
 nice
 It constantly monitors my heart rate and converts it somehow into calories used.  I am always busy during work never knowing how many calories I am using. It is hard to gain a little weight.  Now after wearing the Fitbit I see that I am burning a lot of calories in my work!!
 Great product
 The Fitbit charge 2 is pretty much the same as the Fitbit Charge. I was hoping to get a more accurate heart rate but as with the Fitbit Charge anything other than resting pulse is wildly inaccurate.
 Loved my Fitbit charge but love my charge 2 even more. Screen easier to read and all changes are excellent
 Love it
 Works as advertised
 The only negative is that it isn't water proof!
 The style and functionality of this product is exactly what I needed.
 love it.
 Loved it!
 Love the tracker. Just wish Fitbit stated that the dongle was not included.
 Love, love, love this Fitbit! It does everything and more and I’m so glad I made this purchase!!!
 Second one! And it will not work again! My son had the same problem.
 Works very well.
 Garbage. The band is completely insecure. Comes off randomly.  It has not been subjected to any abuse. Only wore it a month, it was a Christmas gift to myself and it is garbage.
 Bought this as a Christmas gift.  Was able to wear it for less than 2 months and the band clip is no longer working to hold the fitbit on my wrist.
 Love it
 I would like to return fit bit and exchange for Apple watch
 Love my Charge 2 !!
 One of my best purchase from last year.<br/><br/>Would gave 5 stars but the band didn't last. Had to buy an other one. But still an excellent (and motivating) product
 Love it already. Just a couple work outs in
 Does a good job tracking sleep patterns and heart activity.  Keeps you on the move which is a good thing
 This product lived up to my expectations
 This Fitbit Charge 2 is nice looking and fit me perfectly, but the vague instructions for set up did not work.  I followed the instructions on the app step by step several times, plus I looked online to find advice from Fitbit help, and Fitbit community, but nothing I tried would make my texts and calls show up on this Fitbit.  I saw that there were many many unsatisfied customers having the same problem with this particular model so I am returning it. I would have loved it, if I could have figured it out. The purple color is very pretty.<br/><br/>Update: I purchased the Fitbit Alta HR and had no problem setting it up by following the instructions so I think the Charge I had may have been a lemon.
 Complete disappointment! I had problems receiving notifications on the device. After that I also had problems with the device connecting to my phone.
 This does what it says it will do. It is really up to you on what to do with the data. Excellent monitoring device.
 I decided on the Charge 2 because of how highly rated the heart rate monitoring is. I'm newly pregnant and really need to stay active and also monitor my heart rate during runs and various activities. So far it is working wonderfully.
 Great!
 Shipping was fast and Fitbit does everything I need it to do. Easy to use and navigate. I'm 57 and if I can operate it anyone can.
 Received my fitbit from my husband for Holiday, and I love it!
 Love it
 Nice case. Good fit, works well
 Don't know if I like.  Can't figure out how to symc it ow what to do.Written instructions were minimal.<br/>Need more detailed instructions.
 Faulty out of box, will not connect to mobile/PC stuck at the setup screen, went online and found out I'm not the only one, may have to return it.
 I bought this but had to return it.  My step count was never accurate and super disappointing.  The features such on the Charge 2 is why I gave it 2 stars.  Buy at your own risk.
 Love the color.
 I purchased this item and it has already been opened and used the seals were broken.
 Works well
 Really like this product. It does what it advertises very well. The battery life is very good. It is light and durable. Doesn't pick up a stationary bike other than the heart rate. Elliptical and treadmill is fairly accurate (close enough for me).
 Awesome
 Great gift to get someone moving!
 The new Charge 2 is everything I could hope for and more!
 A great sleep monitor and motivator to keep even the most unenthusiastic fitness person (me) motivated
 I really love this fitbit! It keeps me going on my steps and other things. I recommend it!
 Great replacement for my old Charge HR. Provides more information
 I'm obsessed with it and love that it keeps me on track as well as all of the data it provides, especially my sleep patterns. Great way to jump start your year!
 Like this alot!
 Great Tool for fitness!
 Had to send it back because it wouldn't turn on. Hopefully the next one I order works.
 FitBit Charge 2 gives erratic and incorrct heart rate during exercise. Device returned.<br/><br/>I returned my Fitbit Charge 2 since it would not consistently give an accurate heart rate. It works fine at rest or with mild consistent walking, but failed to show the increase in heart rate as I had a fairly rapid increase in heart rate as I did some hill climbs. It would not show the proper heart rate until about 20-30 seconds at rest at the top of the climb when my rate would be in the 135-150 range.<br/><br/>I did follow the suggestions from the help fitbit site.  I.E. move fitbit up the arm, keep the fitbit flat and near the skin, etc.<br/><br/>Here are the results if my usage<br/>-- Basically it did OK until I started my hill climb at about a heart rate (HR) of about 95-100. Once as I started the climb the HR dropped some and stayed level until I got to the top. At the top it still registered no higher than about 100. I checked my pulse with my watch and my rate was about 135-140. Finally when I finished taking my pulse the fitbit did register at about 135. I had about the same results on additional climbs. BTW I have a total of 9 climbs of 100-150 yards distance and elevation change of 50-80 feet.<br/>-- Along the way, I have a stop at an exercise station and I do some pushups, pull ups &amp; chin ups. At the end my HR measured by the fitbit was in the mid 60's. As I continued walking the fitbit did not display a HR, just "- -" (pair of dashes). At this point I did my last climb of my walk and again the fitbit would not show the increase in HR as I did my climb and did not show the increased rate at the top until I took my pulse rate using my watch. My rate was right at 150. Which is the max for my 72 years of age. After taking my pulse the fitbit did display a HR of mid 140's.<br/><br/>Bottom line, the heart rate monitor, at best is erratic and does not show a consistent, real time heart rate.
 Excellent.
 Amazing product
 I love this Fitbit. I really like that synced with my phone it will tell me who's calling and also displays text messages. I appreciate the nudge every hour to get moving as well.
 Works great!
 Love this device...it has replaced my wristwatch.
 I worried I wouldn’t get much use of my Fitbit, now that I have it I use it constantly!
 the heart reat dosent work very well
 This was a gift for my lady. She is definitely enjoying it!
 Shipped immediately. I love my fitbit watch so much as I use it daily :)
 I have had this over a year and have grown to really dislike it.<br/>Reason # 1<br/>It isn’t a good watch.  I have to stab it multiple times for the clock face to come up. And then it can’t be read outdoors.  You are supposed to be able to flick your wrist to see the time.<br/><br/>Reason#2<br/>It tracks walking ok but doesn’t detect any other exercise. Ie. bike yoga etc.<br/><br/>Reason #3<br/>Battery sucks. I have to charge every day and a half.<br/><br/>The software app is fine.<br/><br/>I’m looking for a replacement.
 It does all the things it say it was going to.
 If i could give this watch 10 stars i would.It is a great product over the years of buying cheaper fitness watches and loosing them as a result of playing football (so called soccer) this is worth every penny.Great product all around
 I like it very much, but the adjust of the band its far to be perfect.
 It is very good
 Love it. Tracks my sleep and entire day activity.
 Not as accurate as I hoped and a little too thick, makes it difficult to sleep with it on
 Doesn't count stairs accurately but other than that great buy.
 It's perfect. More than I expected
 works well
 Excellent item
 I like my watch
 i love it
 It's only been 3 months and won't hold a charge<br/> It's also very uncomfortable to wear.
 Works well.
 This little beauty has kept me on track to get up every hour and take a walk, to hit my 10,000 steps a day and provides me with fireworks when I hit those 10,000 steps.  I love that I can sync to my phone to see my daily and weekly progress.
 My son liked the watch.  This is a good watch but I purchased one before and the band wore out at the point where it clips into the face of the Fit bit.
 Really happy
 My wife loves her Fitbit, this is the second one she owns, unfortunately we could have purchased it for $20 less at our local Target or Wallmart stores. Too late for us, but she loves it anyway.
 No Comment
 Works get and keeps me motivated!
 Fit bit works great! Battery lasts forever!!
 Bought for my Granddaughter and she liked it very much.
 I wear it everyday and it is a huge motivator to keep me moving.
 Great band, fits perfectly!
 I love it! It already has me being way more active!
 My fitbit never works when I am exercising hard. Despite repeated adjustments and a reset. Really disappointing product. Wish I could get my money back
 Love it!!
 Awesome device that's already kickstarted my weight loss journey. Definitely recommend.
 Wife loves this and wears everyday!
 I want to like this but it sucks because it doesn't sync properly, so I lose all of my data and I can't track my progress (the whole reason I bought the stupid this). I wish I could get my money back.
 I love my Fitbit Charge 2. It works great and helps keep me on track on my fitness goals and motivated.
 The stats are still flaky. Some regular handshakes and movements register steps regularly, and my heart rate is very different from what a medical heart rate monitor would give you. But I suppose that is expected from a $150 device including everything nice as far as tracking goes.<br/><br/>That said, ignoring the flaky metrics for now, it worked fine for the most part for the first few months. And then the sensor to show time when I flick my wrist stopped responding. It started getting flaky last week (after 2-3 months of usage), and completely stopped working this week. Again, considering the device is $150, I did not expect amazing amount of accuracy, but did expect the basic features to continue working reliably for at least a year. This is really poorly built shiny piece of instrument that might be more of a style statement than a utility.
 As a therapist assistant I couldn’t live without it!
 I love my fitbit charge 2. It does more than I expected, like text message reminder (and read out!) I'm moving more and more aware of the amount of movement in my day.  The plum color looks great on my skin tone too.Amazon was quick to deliver at the best price.  Lovin my Prime
 fantastic i love all of the extras.
 I think it is a big improvement over the Charge HR.  I really like the improved sleep tracking and able to track location of my runs and biking
 Using a windows phone.Phone notifications not supported. Have doubts about the sleep tracking too. Else a superb product.
 I got this as a gift for muy wife.  She loves it.  It starts charged,  tracks elliptical,  running,  and biking.  She loves the meditation feature!
 wife loves it
 Very happy with this fitbit
 I've had it less then a month and its refusing to sync to anything and now I can't sync it
 Product didn't work at all. I've spent over 6 hours trying to get it to pair with my iPhone. Returning this item right away.
 Works without much fuss!!
 Great step tracker and watch. Love it!
 Short battery life, but great otherwise
 love it
 love it help you move more
 Love my new fitbit.
 really good choice
 This is my favorite Fitbit to date. It tracks almost everything, including weight workouts, elliptical machines, etc. It also gives you a silent notice if you have not walked 250 steps in the last hour.
 Got this for the wife. She loves it. Only thing she does not like is the charger is a bit short on length.
 This was a great investment! For sure encouragement to get moving everyday and it actually makes it feel more rewarding to see how your doing.
 So far I like it much better than the flex I owned
 I had the original Fitbit charge and decided to upgrade to this one and I'm very happy that I did!!
 love it
 Like it overall. Have had issues where It doesn’t read my heart rate here and there, usually problem gets fixed after charging it a bit.
 great product but band made me break out so had to buy a leather one.
 As advertised
 It's a nice watch and okay if you just wear it walking, but if it's on your arm while driving it adds steps and miles
 Works Great!!
 wonderful color, my wife really likes having a watch as part of her fitness tracker.  No longer wearing 2 items on her wrist is nice.
 It has motivated me to walk extra steps. Loved it.
 The delivery came early as expected and the packaging was really carefully put. As for the product its really good. Has all the basic features and really love it.
 I love it!
 So far, so good. I've had my Charge 2 for about a month and I've had no problems. Much more solid build than the Charge HR.
 Its small enough! Im not a fan of the larger fitbits and this one has connected GPS and good battery life so it does the work. Wish it was completely waterproof though.
 I love my Fitbit. I needed to get a new one cause my old one died. 2 weeks after my new one came the new Fitbit slender came out ☹️😪  Would have loved to get the new model. Can't afford to order another one. 😩
 Easier buying on Amazon then through Fit Bit
 It arrived on time. I am completely happy with my purchase. The battery life is pretty good. The tracking seems accurate.
 The wrist band broke after only 10 months. Charge 2 fails to record steps many times while on the treadmill.
 This device has been working well in the time I have spent with it connects easily and had no problems pairing but the metal clasp broke on it in the first week of owning it and that's poor quality and annoying.
 Love it.  Really helps me meet my activity and fitness goals by providing up to the minute details on my progress. I highly recommend.
 Everything is amazing it really motovares me to work out more and eat more. The step tracker is a bit off but what can you do?
 Love the text and call alerts.
 I liked the concept but it threw my system totally off. I have always been very active and dont need reminders. It just didn't do it for me.
 I have had this for almost a year. Love all the features!
 Love it. Keeps you active. Battery has lasted 6 days. NO COMPLAINTS ON THIS PURCHASE.
 In short: impeccable hardware but really underdeveloped software. The reason why I love the hardware is the incredible precision of step and heart rate measurement. I would give this product five stars if it wasn't for so many problems on the software. First of all, the degree of personalization of your hourly activity is almost nil. The device vibrates whenever you don't make (250!) steps every hour. No possibility of changing the amount of steps or the frequency of the notification! I don't know where the software programmers work but it is completely impractical for me to get up every hour to make 250 steps. This means that I don't use at all this functionality that would be very useful for me if I could adjust it to lower standards. Second, there is a huge problem of overestimation of calories consumed that has been signaled by hundreds of users and that has been by now totally ignored. The problem is a little technical but go check the many issues related to it signaled in their blogs if you wanna use the device for losing weight. Third, there is also very low flexibility of the app to organize your fitness activity. I was interested in having a device that would vibrate any 1/2/3 minutes to help me in my fitness/calisthenics activity but this is possible only if you set up an "interval run", meaning that the device totally miscalculates what you are doing. And it isn't even possible to edit a wrong inputted activity!
 Love it! Came in box. Had charger and instructions. Screen works. Works great with the app!
 love it all the time.
 Arrived quickly and works great!
 Nice enhancements from HR, hope it lasts longer.
 Strap broke no product support wasted $150.  Do not buy through Amazon
 Really love the way the Charge 2 tracks and fits. Wish the battery life could be longer but it does last for a good 5 days before charging.
 The Fitbit Charge 2 has the features I expected and like. However, the battery only last a day to 1.5 days at most before needing to be recharged. Is that normal, or do I have a bad unit?
 Very happy with performance, as accurate (loosley defined) as any other band, but well made and durable.
 Love the color<br/>Cant get my phone to sync
 This does everything you need it to do.  Just buy it.
 AMAZING!! I'm admittedly a Fitbit fan, I've had the original flex, Charge HR, tried the Alta HR and I'm very glad to go back to the new Charge 2. The delivery was fast and the new style is beautiful!
 Have been using for about 1.5 weeks now but I feel it is a great product. Love the fact that it has a digital watch as well as tracks your heart rate. I am tracking heart rate, water consumption, sleep patterns, steps, workouts, weight, everything I could possibly want to do.The phone app allows for all this. I have not used the calorie count for food but I have used the silent alarm for work so I don't wake the family and that that works great too. The Charge 2 has the option to change wristband colors as well for the stylish type. Overall a great product and I would recommend to anyone trying be a little healthier and be active and be able to see/track you results.
 Best Fitbit ever has a nice screen it's very accurate I love it so much
 Awesome
 It works great. Its easy to navigate, comfortable to wear, and makes it very simple to track your steps and exercise. The battery lasts about 3 days before I have to charge it. I love It!
 Product is easy to set up and offers more options than the original Fitbit Charge.  So, far I am very pleased.  Packaging was great and it arrived on time.
 Love my Fitbit Charge 2 !
 second one that does not work.....
 I am still wearing my zip as well as my new charger 2. When I am hiking a trail the charger records 3000 steps less than the zip. Is there a reason for this?
 Best Fitbit yet. I does all you need if you a walker looking to keep calories in check. You will enjoy it.
 I like it.
 Love it. Keeps me on track. I try to beat my numbers each day.
 its awsome
 Not a fan at all! You move your arms or getting up from laying down and it thinks you are taking steps. Not accurate.
 Didn't work out of the box. Won't connect using iPhone app or desktop.
 love it
 I love it!
 Wife enjoys counting steps.
 Great
 great
 Poor design for small wrist doesn’t sit right.  Hard to see display outdoors. Clunky tapping to get through screens. I am done with Fitbit there are better options.
 Was a gift for my husband fit very nice
 The band is stiff and not soft and flexible. You have to pay $69 more for a leather straps. This might be not a problem for man but women may have trouble putting strap thru loop.
 Bought Charge 2 as an upgrade to original Charge.  Love the bigger screen and text/message notification.  The new on-device Relax feature helps to relax body and mind with breathing/heart rate display.  The Fitbit app has a number of fun games where you can challenge other Fitbit users on daily, weekly or weekend exercises.  The app shows reports of steps, sleep, heart rate so you can see your fitness trend.  The online Fitbit forum is a vibrant and active community where you can participate for free and discuss topics such as Get Moving, Eat Well, Manage Weight, Sleep Better, Be Inspired etc.  There are different color bands that you can choose to match with your style.  FIVE STARS for well design plus great app and active online community support.
 Use it everyday. Very good deal. Easy to change bands.
 Excellent for the price. Watch out on battery!
 I really like it. It's comfortable to wear and easy to use. Strap can be a little touch but no biggie. It makes me get up and walk more! Thanks
 I bought the large and it fits great.  Responds really well to movements and steps and all that.  I use it to keep myself moving and motivated, but also to track my sleep!  Everything  perfectly!
 I really like it BUT it would be so much better if they made it water proof. When using gym equipment or gps on my phone when out walking, the reading are always vastly different as far as mileage and calories burned. The reading are not even close to the same. Do not know which item is right.<br/> I am a gadget person and as gadgets go, this is pretty good. Just do not rely too much on calorie counter and distance meter. I wear it while sleeping to check my sleep patterns and it shows I took like 250 steps during my sleep and walked 1/4 mile or something outrageous like that. No, I do not sleep walk. Ha Ha.Pretty nice when I wake up in the morning, I have already burned like 600 calories during my sleep.<br/>When and if they ever fine tune the fitbit and it is more accurate, it will be a fantastic product.
 Nice product. Packaged well.
 Was a gift! She loved it! Exactly what she wanted
 Purchased as a gift and my friend seems to be enjoying it without any problems! I love my FITBIT SURGE!
 Easy to set up. One day love it. Already reporting better than my old FB Charge.
 good
 Bought it for my wife. She loves it!
 While I LOVE the Charge 2, this band broke already, not even 3 months in...
 Excellent product. More so, I love the application for your mobile.<br/><br/>The results are in an exceptional view able interface that anyone can utilise
 Initially, this would have been 4 or 5 star review, as I have enjoyed the product and the interface is fine. However, after only 3 months of regular use, this device developed a hairline crack in the display face. This wasn't due to anything catastrophic (slamming in a car door or stepping on it, etc.) as far as I can tell it just developed due to regular wear and tear. Customer service at fitbit offered me 25% discount on my next purchase but would not replace the tracker as screen defects are not covered under warranty. The Fitbit person on chat was nice enough, but uninterested in making the defect in the product right with me, and therefore I'm lead to conclude that the company doesn't seem willing to stand behind their products in order to build long-term relationships with their customers. My prior tracker was a jawbone Up2, and I always had excellent customer service experiences with them.  Looking for more functionality, I purchased this Fitbit and am really disappointed with this company and the durability of their fairly pricey product.<br/><br/>So if you're looking for a one-off purchase that may or may not break down on you after 3 months, this is tracker for you.
 The step count is off.
 Very disappointing.  It was not reliable to count when I went up a flight of stairs.  It would sometimes count steps when I was sleeping.  The sleep tracker did not work well.  The BPM did not always work even though it was properly placed and comfortably snug.  It would start to count steps when I moved my arms but not my feet!  Now that I'm using another tracker, I really do not think the steps it logged were accurate.  The band was OK.  I bought 2 other bands, one was leather and the other one was magnetic mesh.  They were both great but unfortunately are now useless.  I'm returning the Fitbit.
 Best fitbit ever!
 Love it.  Very very happy customer
 The clasp of this broke after a month. Not happy at all! How does something you pay this kind of money for break after a month!
 I am addicted to my fitbit. It is probably not that accurate with the steps (especially the stairs) but it keeps me motivated and I also love the sleep monitor!
 My husband's best buddy!!
 Just what I needed
 Got it for my wife!
 Unfortunately , this is not the Fitbit for me.  I'm going back to my old Flex.
 I really wanted to love this Fitbit, so I will start with positivity: it looks nice and the bands really are increadibly easy to replace. I really like the reminder to move and the relax feature is pretty awesome.<br/>For my own personal negative expierience with the watch: it's inaccurate, now when setting up your watch with the app you have to let it know which wrist you are putting it on and you need to let it know if you are right or left handed. One would think that if you are putting the device on your right hand when you are right handed, it wouldn't be so sensitive to add 250 steps when you are brushing your teeth. I bought this wanting to keep track of my steps and I cannot say it's working for that. I've never owned a Fitbit but I would think that this is a bug they would have fixed by now?
 Worst piece of junk ever. 3rd FitBit that didn't even last 1 year. Don't waste your money on this brand, but a Garmen
 It's really pretty but it scratches really easily. Disappointed the warrenty doesn't cover it, esp after only having it for one day.
 My only complaint is that it doesn't always "open" when I flick my wrist.
 Good for everything!
 Nice fit, looks good, hope it will keep me on track
 So I really like the fitbit after a couple weeks but on issue may have me return it.  It works great for the most part tracking steps, setting goals and telling how you're doing.  The dashboard ap is really nice - I love it.  Having this on all the time has made me really pay attention to how active I am.  It's worth it if it motivates you to exercise more.  The one issue is the HR monitor seems to lose connection at high HR's or during intense workouts.  I checked the forum and this seems to be a common problem.  This can be an issue if you're trying to stay in your cardio zone, ect  It does a fantastic job of tracking runs, average HR, ect.  I really want something I think now with it's own GPS so I don't have to have my phone on me for all the data, this will still do the trick for most people.
 Great improvement over the previous edition of the Charge HR.  Out performs my Apply Watch for fitness and sleep tracking!
 Love it... so many great features plus a bigger more useful screen.
 Great deal. This is my 'healthy' Christmas treat for myself. I believe I just gave myself a very useful and practical item that is totally worth it.
 Did't work for me. Returned it.
 It has everything I needed it to do plus more.....My husband and I bought them at the same time. Oh what fun we are having competing with those 10,000 steps per day...Great buy!
 Much more durable than the original Charge. Has more features that are actually useful like automatic exercise logging.
 This is a great product - it has the three most important features a smartwatch should have - fitness tracking, notification and wait for it .. It tells time! The one feature it has that most smartwatches do not have is that the battery lasts a few days.
 great motivator
 Love it!!
 Since purchasing my fit bit it makes me move around more. Love it love it
 This is perfect!
 I love my Fitbit! The only draw back is that it needs to get charged every 2-3 days.
 The wife loved it. It is accurate and we compete in challenges. Keeps accurate information about your sleep, eating habits if you really want to take the time to track it.
 Easy to use
 The color is gorgeous, and it works well. I bought this as a gift and the recipient couldn't be happier. She loves that she can change out the bands, and it is much easier to charge than the previous generation. Considering one for myself!
 Works great and has helped keep me moving by competing with myself. Was worth it .
 Love it works perfectly for me. If you are thinking about getting a fitbit this is the one to get!
 I love my Fitbit and the bands array of colors means I can wear it with anything !
 Lots to love on this watch (smaller, interchangeable bands) but the fact that the display shuts off after only a few seconds is a disappointment and the font size is hard for us over 50's to see without specs!
 Got this for my husband and he loves it.  He downloads it every night and get a kick out of seeing his progress.
 Needs a better band
 My girlfriend gave me the Blaze. I thought the Charge 2 was more feminine, especially with the rose gold color available and matching metallic wristband. She loved it, her girlfriends are envious given the feminine style and rich color.
 I love my Fitbit! its so cool! but for yall out there its not water proof... just splash, sweat and rain proof, but I still love it!
 I love this and I love the color
 Bands are the same quality as the one that came with the Fitbit.  Very easy to change out and the color variety is great!
 My wrist band has broke 3 times since I bought this product!!
 Great investment in tracking activity.
 I love it.  It gives incentive to work out and keep up with the app.
 Awesome fitbit. Features that I like. Stepped up from the Alta. Would buy again.
 Didn't work at all. Wouldn't connect to app. Spent hour on phone with support with outcome being return it because this sometimes happens. Just happened to be a faulty one.
 This is an awesome product worth every penny and I got the warranty too. I love it, it's fun, and super easy to use.
 The product is great. BUT am wanting some nice bands and while there are plenty available  none seem to ship to New Zealand. So left with the stock standard band supplied with the product.
 My Fitbit is working fine and is womderful!! Today I went skiing with my family and it easily survived the cold of outside and heat of my jacket (even though my phone didn't) it works exactly as said and definitely deserves five stars!
 I love my fit bit!
 use everyday
 I love the new FitBit Charge 2.  I recently gave my Alta to my daughter - I missed the push button feature.  I like all the info on the first screen.  Only negative - it's pretty bright at night and lights up too easily.
 I really love it. The GPS tracking is so good. Now I can know exactly where I walked. Of course the distance travelled is much more accurate
 I used it less than a month before the armband broke and I had to use duct tape to hold it together. It should last longer than a month!!!
 Beautiful product... but so far my Zip seems to keep much better track of my steps (in pocket vs on wrist), which is frustrating.  works well outside but if you run in place on carpet, nada.  seems to be Very Accurate for outside walking
 I love it much more than the previous version. Great look and a wide choice of optional wristbands
 Faulty when it  came new from the box. Retured it immediately
 I just love Fitbit
 Works great
 I love my fitbit!! It motivates me to keep on movin!<br/>I like that it tracks all my vitals and so does my dr!<br/>The app shows all your data!<br/>Why did I wait so long to buy one!!
 Sometimes I question the steps it records.Wish I could tell when the battery is going to need charging.
 Purchased this as a Christmas gift for my husband, who absolutely loves it. Tracks activity, heart rate, sleep, etc., and has really motivated him to be more active. Stylish and functional.
 I consistently walk up and down stairs each day. I only get "credit" every 2 or 3 days. Uncomfortable to sleep in,  even when loosened some.
 Exactly as advertised. Purple color in the picture is pretty exact.
 love this!
 Bought as a replacement for one that was broken.  Love it
 Works great tracks steps and heart rate very accurately
 The color meets my expectation.<br/><br/>It functions well and it is very easy to configure.  It is very convenient to know my heart beat and steps anywhere any time.
 Loved it, got it for my girlfriend and she uses it daily! Always discover new things with the watch
 love it already after two days.
 Functionality can be improved by giving an AOD.
 Fits perfectly; great material. Love it
 Gifted - new owner is quite happy with it.
 Great product.
 Awesome sauce!!
 We love them.
 I needed to replace my Fitbit Alta, which I loved, because it had gotten lost.  I loved the slim design and the fact that it didn't make me look like I was wearing two watches.<br/><br/>Right around the time I lost the tracker, I saw the promo for the Fitbit Charge 2 with the HR monitor feature.  My Alta didn't have that feature so I thought I would upgrade.  Well, It's going back.  The face is too large for my liking and with the monitor underneath the face, it makes wearing the tracker a bit uncomfortable on the wrist.  Had I done better due diligence, I would have learned that my slim Alta now has the HR monitor feature and I could have saved this interim purchase.<br/><br/> My two stars is because the product didn't work for me; not that because it's not a good product.
 Love it. Readings so much better.
 Love wearing it and checking my progress daily
 daughter very happy with this she loves it
 Got as a gift for my mother she loves it uses it every day!
 I like the features and functionality of this tracker!
 I love the Fitbit Charge 2. It provides all the information I need to track my exercise and monitor my heart rate, not to mention recording calories used.
 Great product. Holds together well and does everything it days. Also has great battery life.
 So far it is doing everything it claims. Took a bit to get used to wearing it at night but sleep feature is great.
 The fitbit is everything i hoped it would be. I have used it everyday for the past 3 weeks and i am definitely satisfied with my purchase
 Easy to use, so much info available. Makes getting in shape fun!
 Cannot get iOS notifications to work, even after following multiple FAQs.  Works great in other areas, and I'd be very happy with it if the actual "smart watch" functionality worked...but it doesn't.
 for my wife for xmas
 I didn't manage to sync the Fitbit neither to my iPhone nor to my PC (Fitbit forum and support didn't help), so I returned it. Returning Fitbit was without any problem.
 I wore the Fitbit for about 2 hours and it burned 2 little holes in my skin where the heart rate monitor was. I reported this to Fitbit. It was not worn tightly.
 Wonderful
 great product, my wife loves it, she wears it every day!
 Love my Fitbit Charge2.
 The charger 2 is like my consciousness. It keeps me moving ! The only thing that I'm not happy about is the strap is irritating my skin with redness and itching. I keep it clean .
 Arrived when expected, no problems, works great.
 Had a problem with the first one, sent it back and received a second one which worked well.
 Bought as a gift and the recipient said she loves it!
 Exactly what my wife wanted!
 Keeps me on my toes.
 Love it! Upgraded from the charge and I can't get enough of how great it i!
 Purchased as a gift
 Satisfy with my purchase. I'd consider purchasing an Apple Watch previously, but realized Fitbit works for my  active lifestyle...
 had this for 6 months now, I love it but now the battery wont last no more than 2-3 days, is there any chance of exchanging the item? Would love to hear back
 I transitioned from the fitbit charge to the charge 2 and couldn't be happier. The band is more flexible, the multiple fitness settings are better, and the larger screen makes for easier viewing. Very satisfied.
 Excellent product! I enjoy using it and watching how I do along the day.
 I had the Fitbit flex and this is such a major upgrade!!!  I love how all the information I'm looking for is now right on my wrist.
 Works very well for me.
 I love the fact that it is a watch, and a fitbit.  The sleek design is both attractive and comfortable while playing sports or just walking around. The lavender band is easy to detach to switch up the look.
 I LOVE my fitbit!  It really inspires me to move around more.
 It tracks sleep, steps, stairs, etc.  Reminds you to drink enough water. Very interesting product.
 Received timely and as described.  Awesome wellness tool.
 Got this as a Christmas gift for my daughter. She loved the item and I liked the price..
 Got the Fitbit charge 2 for my 65 year old dad. He's heard me talk about how many steps I get daily with my Fitbit so I thought he'd enjoy having one of his own. He's not all that tech savvy but has learned how to use it with the Fitbit app. He doesn't have a smartphone but uses it with his android tablet. It's a great motivator because everyday we'll compare our step count for a little friendly competition. He used to think it was funny when I would tell him that I danced around the house right before bedtime trying to meet my 10,000 step goal. Now he does it too! My dad is hard to buy for but this just might be his favorite gift ever!
 After less than three months of use the thing just froze. No change in time or vitals. No reset.
 I love it much better than mine won the charge to continuously tracks heart rate and knows when I'm sleeping &amp; awake
 Worked as advertised.  Battery life is very good.  About 4 to 5 days before needing charged.
 This was a Christmas gift for my mom who was skeptical about fitness bands and trackers... and now she loves it! She is hooked! She loves doing the challenges with me through the fitbit app &amp; how it encourages her to get up and move every hour.
 With a 100 percent charge the battery won't stay charged for more than a few hours.  Have turned everything off to save battery and it still runs down a few hours.
 Met all my expectations. This little devil is a slave driver, but it does so in quite a nice way!
 I have owned this for about 5 days and really like it. Step accuracy seems a bit off. Sitting or lying down somehow counts as steps? I think arm movements have something to do with that? Walking, step accuracy seems ok, not perfect just ok. My iPhone 6 health app is totally accurate but does not do all the other cool things this unit is capable of. The Fitbit app is excellent. Sleep tracking seems right on. I like the ease of changing bands. Have not cross checked heart rate monitor yet, hope it is accurate? I would have paid more for the ability to swim with it! Fitbit please note.
 My new Fitbit Charge 2 is awesome.  I am surprised how many miles i walk a day.  I am a Realtor and this helps me keep track of a lot of things, such as heart rate, weight, steps and more.
 I am in love with my Fitbit charge 2! I wear it everyday and at night to track my sleep. I like the reminders that it gives me to walk each hour and I look forward to meeting my daily step goal.
 Completely Satisfied .  Thanks for  a Great Product..
 This is a great fitbit
 Device works well.  Band sucks.  Cheap clasp.  Uncomfortable.  I would expect a $150 device to have a better band.  Ordered different band.
 Lasted just over a year then one day, nothing. Says fully charged then dies after being unplugged for seconds.
 Love my fitbit!!!!!
 Wife and I bought one for each other, not planned.  We love them.  So many facets of data. Helps analyze our daily activities, workouts, and sleep. Display could be brighter when out in the daylight, but overall it's excellent.
 Love this new fitbit.  Love the fact that I can change the bands.
 Came in real fast and works great
 It keeps me moving and at my age of 72 it is important that I keep fit.
 On day three with the Fitbit Charge 2, and overall I think it's a pretty decent product. I've listed the pros and cons belows.<br/><br/>Cons<br/>- Battery was almost completely dead right out of the box. I've read other reviews where people didn't have to charge the Fitbit for 2 or 3 days out of the box. I didn't even have enough power to sync the device to my phone. But after a 10-15 minute charge it was good to go.<br/><br/>- Step counter doesn't appear to be 100% accurate...it's probably 90-95%, which isn't too bad. There are times when I'll take something like 30 steps and the tracker will count it as 25. But then there are times when I take 30 steps and tracker counts it as 35-40. I guess it all evens itself out by the end of the day.<br/><br/>- After sleeping with it for two nights, I personally find it uncomfortable to sleep with the Fitbit on my wrist.  But this is a personal preference thing...you guys might sleep with it on and love it. The sleep tracker is really cool and surprising accurate though. Another complaint is that if you move your arm above your head the Fitbit might think you are trying to look at the display screen.  Then the LED lights up in a dark room while you are trying to sleep, which is sort of annoying.<br/><br/>- The food tracker only really tracks calories. I'm one of those folks that tracks everything; calories, sodium, fat, cholesterol, etc. You can look up the nutritional facts of everything you ate fairly easy, but it would be cool if it tracked it all for you.<br/><br/>Pros<br/>- Very easy to use. The companion app is awesome.<br/><br/>- Very motivating! You can set goals for yourself for steps, floors, calories, and minutes of exercise.  Everything is tracked and you can see your progress in the Fitbit app. You can even set reminders every hour to get up and move.
 Cannot connect with iPhone many times after the recent update on the iPhone app.
 I'm loving this charge 2. Very cool comfortable and seems pretty accurate with my heart rate. Will get more bands 👍🏻❤️
 Quick and efficient shipping from the seller. The product is a nice upgrade from my original charge HR. Both easy to use and stylish. Love it!
 This a solid wrist band that does help me keep track The notifications are only for text messages, also works with facebook messenger on latest version. Other than that it is very solid feels durable and good build quality
 Like the Fitbit very much. The wrist band is difficult and stiff. I had to order a meal ch more versatile band which adds to cost.
 My husband and I both have a fit bit. We love them. They're very easy to use and really do help track food and activity.
 I purchased this Fitbit for my husband. He loves it...
 I went from tracking my fitness with an app to the Fitbit Charge 2.  I love that it tracks my heart rate and sleep.  If only it helped me sleep longer.
 I have had two Charge HRs and both bands bubbled up within a year.  I like being able to change the band on this one.
 Good product and works perfectly.
 Excellent. Better than the HR Charge. Love the new screen.
 Works as expected...love the reminders and silent alarm.
 Got here quickly. Very happy with the for bit charge 2
 Uncomfortable watch, the metrics are inaccurate
 it keeps up with me very well
 The band falls apart within a few months.
 gives me what I was looking for and very confortable
 My favorite fitness tracker so far. Love the interchangeable bands.
 Loving it! A much better design than the Fitbit charge HR.
 Everything as said, so accurate. I love my new fitbit!!
 I love this thing! The 2 min relaxation mode is awesome when you need a break from everything but don’t have that much time.
 Great x-mas present.
 Loved it
 The only issue I have had is that the charger does not always charge my fit bit.
 as expected
 keeps me motivated has a weekly review of all your activities but I must get a better band this one irritates my wrist but I like this product
 Love it!
 Works perfect!
 I love the color! This is great to track calories during a workout and check your heart rate, the only negative thing about the charge 2 is the step counter is inaccurate. If you move your wrist it counts it as steps.
 I like it
 Love it! Quick shipping on all 3 of the fitbits i purchased! Also my family loved it as well! . Purchased for my sister, dad and I.
 Love my Charge 2.  Delivery was quick.  It does everything that I wanted it to.
 I AM SO IMPRESSED. I've owned the flex and the blaze. This is the perfect size for my wrist. I charged it fully when I got it and battery lasted 7 days. Best fitbit I've had. Love it
 Gift for my husband.  Loves it!
 I bought this for my daughter and she loves it  .Keeps track of everything and very easy to use
 Love it
 Love it but I’m pretty sure it doesn’t count about 20% of my steps. Others have said the same thing in the FitBit community app. But otherwise it’s great.
 upgrade from an older fitbit flex was a good move
 Product is great. Issue I ordered a gunmetal special edition one and they shipped me the standard black model. Big price difference...
 Works great, I love it.
 I like it it works just fine,
 Love it, but i have to charge it every other day.
 too chunky and the latch gets in the way
 Heart rate isn't as accurate. When jogging, I know the BPM is definitely NOT 54-60.
 I got this as a gift for my wife and she absolutely loves it.  She gets excited when she reaches her 10,000 step limit and the firework display shows up.  She wanted to get back into the gym and this device has helped her start her goals.
 The belt keeps falling apart nothing wrong with the fitbit.
 love it. still learning on how to use it
 Been using it for 6months ... very good product .. totally recommend
 Love it, except I ordered a small and it was still to big and clumsy on my wrist.  However, it is definitely my motivation to get up and move all day long.
 Just what I've been looking for, Great look and a great material. 5 Stars.
 Excellent product. MNy useful features.
 It is very practical and light, I imagine that I could take more juice to my fibit, but in general it is well, I have 8 months of having it and everything is fine, I just hope the battery is durable.
 I was replacing my old Fitbit charge 2 &amp; am very happy with this new one &amp; the updates that have been made...love it
 Just as expected.
 Exactly as advertised!
 It fails miserably as a pedometer. If you don't swing your arms it doesn't count the steps. In contrast sometimes any arm movement will count towards steps. Yes, I have it setup correctly.<br/><br/>The HR monitor does seem to increase/decrease in correlation to what I'm doing. For instance if I use my standing desk it will show around 80-90bpm. If I sit down it will dip down to 70 or lower.<br/><br/>It tracks my sleep pretty accurately.<br/><br/>It is just unfortunate it fails as a pedometer, as that is all I really wanted.<br/><br/>The band hurts my wrist. It's either too tight or too loose. I regret this purchase.<br/><br/>I really wish I could give this zero stars. I just for finished with a 10 mile walk.... It logged 9k steps. Worthless.
