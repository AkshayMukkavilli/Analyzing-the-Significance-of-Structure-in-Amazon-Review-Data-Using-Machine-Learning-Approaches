I liked her before I started reading this
What Happened? I Couldn't Finish It. Hillary Rodham Clinton
READ THIS BOOK!
Oh Hillary, you should have waited.....
After reading this I couldn‚Äôt believe she lost. She, according to her was the greatest candidate ever.
"The Buck Starts Here" would be a better title
"what Hillary wants you to think happened"
Tells more about HRC than about the election
Excuses Excuses.
Review Deleted--Again
great insight into a misunderstood person
The book didn't need to be written
A REVEALING AND CANDID ACCOUNT OF THE 2016 ELECTION, ITS AFTERMATH, AND MUCH MORE
This pretty much sums up the book
Amazon wiped out negative reviews
Authentic Voice of Hilary Clinton
Didn't really learn anything new
Four out of five
HRC - My Hero
Great book
I wanted the updated book...got the first edition
A different perspective
This book could be re-titled as, "America Dodges a Bullet."
BORING BOOK; DO NOT RECOMMEND
Elect read if you‚Äôre interested in TRUTH.
Engrossing and painful.
Good book on her
Hasty memoir
Too much Hillary
She makes herself out to be the sweet little personable grandmother

intelligent story. Painful that she is not our president
Emotionally candid and Secretary Clinton answered all the questions I would have liked to asked her over a cocktail: how did you feel during those debates, how are you so resilient and not angry at the American voters who let you down, how do you handle stress and personal attacks?  How did you feel on Nov.9th and how could you go to Trump‚Äôs inauguration without throwing up?  HRC answers it honestly and from the heart.  I enjoyed reading her account.  My heart is still broken, but we will fight on together.
