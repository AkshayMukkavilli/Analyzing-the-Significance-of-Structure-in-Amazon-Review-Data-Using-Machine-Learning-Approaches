 Okay, so I’ve been putting off writing this review while I try to process my feelings about it. Here are my thoughts, in no particular order:<br/>1. There was nothing particularly surprising in this book or in any of the other books that have been released about Trump, except this book describes the lengths to which his staff go in order to handle him—taking documents off his desk before he can sign them, conducting meetings prior to meetings to try to agree on an approach<br/>2. The book itself was disjointed and unfocused. Perhaps Woodward did this on purpose to try to portray a chaotic and unfocused administration, but I honestly am left wondering why he felt he had to write the book now and why he was in such a hurry to release it. I felt as though the book was not finished—it ends abruptly when McGahn resigns and I’m not sure if there was a point to it ending then or if it was just the last thing Woodward could cover before he could meet his publishing deadline.<br/>3. Bannon comes off surprisingly well in this book. I suspect he is a source for much of the info.<br/>4. Woodward comes across as lukewarm on the Mueller investigation. I doubt that is his intent, however he is being so careful to try to present things from the point of view of Trump and his team that he gives the impression that he is somewhat sympathetic to them.<br/>5. Repeatedly we see Trump refusing to look at evidence, especially if it contradicts his own long-held beliefs. For instance, one of his economic advisers says that his role is to identify the underlying statistics that confirm Trump’s instincts, and Trump’s instincts when it comes to the economy are always correct.<br/>6. This book reinforces that Trump views everything from a profit motive. He obsesses over the fact that countries benefit from the US military without helping to pay for it, not understanding the strategic importance of using our military around the world. He gets all excited when Afghanistan promises him the mineral rights in exchange for our military support, not realizing that the minerals in Afghanistan are totally inaccessible and are useless to anyone.<br/>7. And everything comes through a filter of how it impacts Trump. This is the only thing he cares about.<br/><br/>But he knew that. We knew it before the election, and nothing has changed except he’s become even more boorish and less conciliatory. My guess is that the Trump apologists will do what they always do and shrug this book off- fake news, poorly researched, lies, etc.  Those opposed to Trump who have been following his presidency at all will shrug and say, “Yeah, tell us something we don’t know.” (This is pretty much where I am.)<br/><br/>The key target audience is, of course, the in-betweeners, and despite all the teeth gnashing and hand wringing about this book, if they haven’t figured everything that is in this book out already, then they are willfully sticking their heads in the sand and aren't going to change now<br/><br/>So bottom line, for me, is that I truly don’t understand why Woodward wrote this book at this  point in time. My husband says he was trying to impact the elections, and that may be it. Somehow, I just don’t see it, though. I think voters have Trump fatigue. I think they are tired of the whole thing, and most of them have probably already decided for whom they will vote. At this point, Mueller could come out and tell everyone that he has discovered all of Hillary’s missing emails on Trump’s servers and found evidence that Trump and Clinton are colluding together on pizza gate, and it still wouldn’t have an impact on anything. These are, indeed, strange and scary times.
 Bob Woodward has not written a conventional biography of Donald Trump. His book, "Fear: Trump in the White House". is 42 chapters long, with each chapter being another tale of woe about Trump and his time in the White House. As with all Bob Woodward books, it is very plainly written. There's not much flowery writing in "Fear", just the facts. Woodward lets the reader put their own interpretation on what he's written; unfortunately, most readers - like me - will see facts that add up to a disaster of a presidency.<br/><br/>Should fans of Donald Trump buy and read "Fear"? Yes, but they probably won't because the truth, as accounted by Bob Woodward, is not an easy read. I'm a liberal Democrat - horrified by Donald Trump and his presidency since the time when Trump came down the escalator in Trump Tower in 2015 - and I'm finding it difficult to have my greatest fears verified.<br/><br/>I also find it interesting that Bob Woodward and his publisher chose to release the book on September 11th.
 No American leader has polarized the electorate more than has the current occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Is it possible Donald Trump has discovered the secret to getting away with everything is "Fear?"<br/><br/>Neither has any topped Donald Trump in his ability to polarize our nation. I, myself, find Mr. Trump repugnant. Yet, even as I curse him for his apparent lack of empathy for other human beings, I do occasionally find his approach to politics refreshing. Why?<br/><br/>In search of an answer for that last question, I have read most every book about the guy. Woodward’s “Fear” is probably the greatest insight we ever shall have into the psyche of America’s closest approximation to Adolph Hitler. Mind you, Hitler murdered millions, so the comparison is not literal. It is the mindset I’m speaking of, not the actual murderous intent. What I mean is, to understand how the Germans came to embrace Hitler, one must come to understand how so many Americans and political leadership have to to embrace Donald Trump.<br/><br/>Because of “Fear,” I understand better as to why Donald J. Trump is the greatest threat to our republic. It is not because the man is evil or due to his radical conservative politics. It is because the man runs his operation in a manner most similar to how Jeff Bezos seems to run Amazon, i said ‘seems’ to. The difference is, Amazon is run as a controlled dynamic response to the demands of the marketplace. At any given moment, decisions are made according to a logical algorithm, at Amazon. In Trumplandia, it is according to the instinct of Donald Trump — only.<br/><br/>BLUSH FACTOR: There are profanities of most every sort. Still, since this is nonfiction, I hope every American reads “Fear.”<br/><br/>And please remember to vote in November. Whether or not you support Trump, our country needs to fully deal with the emotions now being stirred.<br/><br/>The writing in “Fear” is thought-provoking and uneven. Because of Woodward’s dependence on Deep Background, I cannot rate it five stars. I WANT to know who said what, precisely.<br/><br/>Still, this is the one great insight into Donald J. Trump that history will most appreciate, provided the world does survive.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE<br/><br/>Four stars out of five.<br/><br/>I am striving to produce reviews that help you find books that you want, or avoid books that you wish to avoid. With your help, my improvement will help you and me improve book reviews on Amazon. Together, you and I can build a great customer review process that helps everybody. Will you join me? It is people such as you who have helped me improve over the years. I'm still learning, and I have a great deal yet to learn. With your help, I'll improve every day.<br/><br/>One request: Be respectful and courteous in your comments and emails to me. I will do likewise with you.<br/><br/>Thank you so much for indicating if this review helped you, or for your comment.
 Let me get this out of the way first - Bob Woodward is a very good writer and clearly an excellent investigative journalist. That being understood, there is nothing in Fear that warrants reading it. Perhaps this is a sign of the times. It's a reality of our lives - with this 24 hour news cycle and constant social media access to many of the main players in this  saga - that it's next to impossible to be shocked by anything. Sure, there are entertaining tidbits here and there, but please tell me one revelation in this book that we haven't heard time and again. On the one hand, having someone of Woodward's reputation writing these things does in some ways lend credence to many of the outlandish stories we've been hearing the past couple of years. Is that enough, though? That's up to the individual reader, but for me reading this book felt like reliving stories that I had already been told numerous times.<br/>I also became more and more uncomfortable with Woodward's use of quotations in some instances. For example, there's a moment mid-way through Fear in which President Trump calls Lindsey Graham in the middle of the night for a heart to heart. It's difficult to believe that either Graham or Trump relayed this story to Woodward, so the idea that he is surmising what was said is problematic for me in terms of the book's overall effect. I get that it's a narrative choice, and one that Woodward hardly invented, but because of the nature of this book and because of the subject matter and allegations of fake news, this method may blur the lines just a bit too much.<br/>Overall, this is a mostly shallow exercise that doesn't really offer anything new or groundbreaking nor does it change the narrative of where this country finds itself in the here and now.
 Some revelations about our president but nothing you did not know if you mildly followed the news. Woodward actually makes him look better than my impression of him. Much of the book impugns the people working for him much more than the president himself. It attempts to explain the complexity of the job and policy decisions as a means of justifying the president's missteps. President Trump seems almost logical in his policy outlook throughout the book. Yes, he comes off as self absorbed and self indulgent but we all knew that about him in the 1980's. Not that impressed with this book.
 This well written disturbing  book shows us all why we need to get out and vote before it's too late.
 Bob Woodward has done it again. "Fear" is a remarkable and important book, especially  because it is so current and revealing and is vouched for by this very credible reporter. Woodward's book confirms in much greater detail many earlier and less credible reports, plus many others --- establishing clearly that Donald Trump is not fit to be the US president  --- politically, intellectually, psychologically or morally. Moreover, his erratic behavior is a threat to US national security, as Woodward's book and recent TV interviews make very clear. Of course, most of the media attention on this book has been and will continue to be on Woodward's many shocking scoops. The most important question, however, that the book raises, for me at least, is "When and how will Trump's reckless rule be retired?"<br/><br/>Mike Pence, the "Shadow President" and Trump's hand picked successor, will from many indications become president in the months following the November 6 election. That seems to be a high probability, even without Special Counsel Robert Mueller's likely devastating report on the Russian conspiracy to influence illegally the 2016 presidential elections and the related cover up obstructing Mueller's investigation of this conspiracy . The only unknown now is when and how Trump goes--- by the impeachment process or by simple resignation like Nixon did. We can expect Pence will then give Trump a full pardon, after Trump fully pardons some family members and close associates. Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort need not hold their breath waiting for a pardon. Trump, some of his family members and close associates will, of course, still be at risk of state law prosecutions, expecially in NY.<br/><br/>Trump has long used fear to exercise power over others. Fear, as Machiavelli strongly recommended five centuries ago to a corrupt pope's nephew, is preferable to and more effective than kindness. Paradoxically, Trump's own deep personal fear of failure still drives him desperately--- any means are justified to reach Trump's top goals of personal profit and glory forever. Any means is OK, including even orphaning innocent infants at the Mexican border, while other immigrants are welcomed to work temporarily at Mar-a-Lago. Woodward's book just reinforces these observations many have already made.<br/><br/>It is amazing to me that many of the so-called "adults in the room" cannot see that Trump is misbehaving as he always did. He cannot be changed, certainly not now and not by the many handlers selected seemingly because Trump can dominate them. That said, Trump still has more than two years remaining on his term!<br/><br/>I have strong reactions to Woodward's many disturbing disclosures, as (1) a former Harvard Law  assistant to Archibald Cox (prior to his being the unforgettable Watergate Prosecutor and nailing Nixon), (2) a former high school chum of Rudy Guiliani (now an unimpressive key Trump advisor), (3) a former law firm colleague of Bob Khuzami (now the impressive head of NYC federal investigations of Trump criminal matters) and (4) a father and grandfather.<br/><br/>Initially, my strongest reaction to "Fear" was, in turn, real fear for the US and the world. How can the US survive two years more of Trump as president, especially given Woodward's very disturbing reports? On further reflection on the most likely outcomes, however, based on my experience,  I am now less worried for the reasons indicated below. The US survived a Revolutionary War, a Civil War, a "Know Nothing" political party, two World Wars, a Korean War, an Iraq War and a Cold War, major Depressions, Prohibition and Nixon, et al. The US will survive Trump and Mike Pence!<br/><br/>Woodward’s book is extremely specific and very detailed--- describing relevant facts, documents, dates and meetings. Importantly, he reports on how some of Trump's policies are so haphazardly made, not just on the many bizarre episodes of Trump and his staff. Woodward draws some really important and very plausible inferences from the collective information of the many involved in specific presidential matters Woodward investigated. And his extensive tapes of his hundreds of hours of interviews of almost 100 relevant persons are available to "prove" his inferences. Trump and his cronies' predictable complaints of Woodward bias, if anything, just invite a closer look at Woodward's findings.<br/><br/>At 75 years old, Woodward clearly had a purpose in this voluntary and prodigious effort to research and write this book--- to  flush out the true Donald Trump and show the danger he poses for US national security. Woodward, a Navy veteran like John McCain before him, is also a patriot. To paraphrase Trump, Woodward shows vividly that Trump's behavior is "very sad and really disgusting".<br/><br/>The media will have a field day with some of the troubling Trump episodes Woodward reports. Many persons cited in the book will challenge some of his reports. To be expected and perhaps understandable, given Trump's fiery temper about those he thinks are in any way disloyal to him. The facts will nevertheless prevail, as they have mostly for Woodward's earlier books about the many presidents who immediately preceded Trump.<br/><br/>More important, however, than specific episodes, is what the confluence of these troubling episodes clearly shows --- Trump is clearly unfit to be president! The longer he remains, the greater the risk in our nuclear age for the US, and the world as well. It is well to recall the near catastrophe last January when a Hawaiian technician pressed the wrong button indicating a non-existent "imminent" North Korean missile attack, following Trump's reckless rhetoric about the real North Korean threat. This must have sent a real chill down the spines of the leaders of all nuclear nations, and many others as well.<br/><br/>Will Trump then finish his first term? Very doubtful, it appears.<br/><br/>If the Democrats win a House majority in less than two months, prompt impeachment proceedings and numerous House investigations of Trump and his corrupt cronies appear to be inevitable. That dooms Trump.<br/><br/>Even if the Democrats remain the minority, impeachment is still likely to occur in my view as Mueller's efforts continue --- they cannot be stopped now. They will continue even if Mueller is fired as they continued after Nixon fired Archibald Cox. Moreover, there is a reasonable prospect that one or more of Trump's children and/or in-laws could soon be indicted.<br/><br/>Trump will after November be  an increasingly unnecessary liability for Republicans, the GOP. Only 32% of voters currently polled even think Trump is honest.  He has already done what the GOP and its billionaire backers like the Kochs  and Devoses most wanted --- a major tax cut for the wealthiest, reckless deregulation, insuring a right wing judiciary majority, reducing drastically Federal revenues needed to fund the social safety net, et al.<br/><br/>Moreover, it seems unlikely that Trump will be able to handle the steadily growing pressure he faces. He may even elect to resign as Nixon did. Pence can finish up to the cheers of the Kochs, Devoses, et al.<br/><br/>For a fuller picture of what to expect from Pence when Trump "retires", please see the new comprehensive, readable and detailed biography of Mike Pence, "The Shadow President ..." by  Pulitzer Prize winning investigative reporter, Michael D'Antonio, and by his co-author, Peter Eisner. This book's findings dovetail nicely with the findings in "Fear".<br/><br/>Unlike Woodward, D'Antonio even got, for his recent excellent Trump biography, hours of direct interviews of Trump before the 2016 elections, until Trump abruptly ended the interviews apparently concerned that D'Antonio was writing a truthful book based on facts, not on Trump's limitless lies and specious spin. We now know from this important book on Pence why it is very unlikely that Pence will ever be able to clean up Donald Trump's mess. We also can understand much better why Trump recently predicted that stock markets would crash if he were to be impeached. Not too great an endorsement of his successor, Pence, by a reckless and incompetent boss who has now witnessed up close for almost two years the non-stop cheerleading of the "Shadow President", Mike Pence.<br/><br/>Pence successfully strived during the last two years behind the scenes, with Trump's apparent blessings, to advance his repressive and regressive fundamentalist Christian remaking of American society, including through administration and judicial right-wing appointments and adoption of fundamentalist social policies, like curtailing legal abortions and even limiting contraception access. Significantly, these policies mostly benefit in the end the already "uberrich" top 0.01% of Americans at the expense of the 99.99 % less fortunate--- how Christian is that?<br/><br/>Trump's and Pence's unfair tax cuts and excessive deregulation can readily be fixed by Democrats when they regain power. But Trump and Pence have already changed the Federal judiciary with their many right wing judges appointed for life. That is not so easily fixed.<br/><br/>This is scary stuff for a religiously diverse nation with constitutional safeguards of religious freedom that were extremely important for good reason to our Founding Fathers. They rejected a theocracy as well as a monarchy !<br/><br/>By providing a brisk and insightful history of Pence's personal and political journey, we are able with this book to see behind Pence's perpetual smile and smooth style. It is not a very pretty picture.<br/><br/>All, even Trump supporters, should read this book to understand better the threat Pence poses even for Trump. After the midterm elections, the "uberrich" will know they can fulfill all their remaining political and economic dreams through Pence, without having to put up any longer with Trump's erratic and at times almost bizarre policies and behavior. By mid-November, Trump will need Pence more than Pence will need Trump.<br/><br/>It is not surprising the Omarosa recently observed on Chris Matthews' "Hardball" show that she thinks one of Pence's staff was the author of the unprecedented and anonymous New York times Op Ed column that further undercuts Trump and re-inforces some of Woodward's revelations. As to be expected, Pence offers to swear under oath that HE did not write the Op Ed column, which denial leaves room that one of his staffers wrote it, no?<br/><br/>"Fear" and "The Shadow Presidency" raise a very ironic possibility in my mind. If Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report, after the midterm elections in November, indicates that Trump and Pence were both implicated in Russian election conspiracy and/or in the subsequent cover-up, both of them could be removed from office or worse by a Congress forced by public outrage to act on Mueller's report. Even Nixon's base abandoned him once the true facts were widely known.<br/><br/>Pence often played a key role in the 2016 campaign, as well as during the two years since. Who knows what he said and did in secret? Who knows if Pence was recorded by Amarosa, an evangelical pastor, or Michael Cohen, a "tell all" third rate lawyer or someone else at the White House, including possibly Trump himself. I suspect that by now, Mueller knows!<br/><br/>If that happens, Nancy Pelosi could succeed after next January to the presidency as Speaker of the House, third in line after the President and Vice President. So much then for the great Trump/Pence strategy.<br/><br/>The Pence book makes very clear why Pence is to be feared, perhaps even more than Trump. The "god" of Trump is Trump --- in that sense, he is obvious and usually predictable. Pence's "god" is much darker and more dangerous, as well as unpredictable, as this book has confirmed for me. It may be that a needy and greedy Trump is a safer bet than a surreptitious and smiling religious zealot, Pence.<br/><br/>Pence legitimated Trump with the important and united fundamentalist voter base, who voted by over 80% to elect Trump! Trump also won 52% of Catholics' votes, while only 46% of the national vote. Who will legitimate Pence? This book suggests "good" fundamentalists should now vote against Pence if they ever find their Christian moorings again!<br/><br/>Pence appears determined to advance a repressive and regressive fundamentalist evangelical theocracy, even though most Americans, including most Christians, have no interest in a theocracy, Christian or otherwise. Our Founding Fathers were well aware of the brutal post-Reformation religious wars that some of their not too distant relatives had fled Europe to avoid.<br/><br/>Interestingly, Pence was a Catholic altar boy and Trump attended for two years a Jesuit college, Fordham. And the current four male Supreme Court conservative Catholic Justices and the newly nominated likely to be Justice, Brett Kavanagh, were also raised Catholic. Four of these five also went to Catholic schools --- Clarence Thomas to Jesuit Holy Cross College, Neil Gorsuch and Kavanagh to Jesuit Georgetown Prep and John Roberts to La Lumiere School. Samuel Alito was raised in a traditional Italian American Catholic family environment.<br/><br/>It seems clear to me, as a graduate of 16 years of Catholic schools, that each of these men in varying degrees may be unduly, even mistakenly, influenced by celibate Vatican officials' "infallible teachings" on reproductive matters.<br/><br/>In 1930, Pope Pius XI gratuitously (and "infallibly" {?}) condemned all birth control to help Mussolini and leaders of other Catholic Western European countries pump up their populations following the decline in births after World War I's slaughter of many potential Western European fathers. Pius XI, who had in 1920 seen up close in Poland the brutal atheistic Soviet threat in operation, was worried about expanding Soviet influence. Of course, Trump has now shown us that Putin and other former Soviets are the West's best friends!<br/><br/>The Vatican's position on women's reproductive rights, initially adopted in 1930 in Pope Pius XI's "infallible" condemnation of birth control,  is not based on the interests of women or families or on any Biblical foundation or even on rigorous philosophical and scientific foundations. On the contrary, it is based solely on the Vatican's mythical claim since 1870 that "the pope is infallible" so what a pope said in 1930 remains the "Gospel Truth" forever.<br/><br/>The origin of the papal infallibility myth has recently been subjected to close and thorough analysis by the leading Catholic historian, Georgetown's 91 year old John O'Malley. A Jesuit, O'Malley has recently published a superb and short new book, "Vatican I", which documents in detail the 1870 invention in desperate circumstances by Pope Pius IX of "papal infallibility".<br/><br/>While I share an Ivy League law school background and a Catholic upbringing with the Supreme Court's likely new all male majority, thanks to the scholarship of John O'Malley, Hans Kung and other brave Catholic scholars, I do not share in their uninformed adoration for papal "infallible teachings".<br/><br/>Hopefully, some the these men will also read the important Vatican I book. If these male Catholic Justices are, based on their purported take on Catholic moral teachings,  going to make legal rules for over 150 million American women about female reproductive matters, these Justices should at least understand the mythological origin of these teachings.  They should all read O'Malley's new book and my Amazon review of it.<br/><br/>Of course., "infallible" popes since 1870 have greatly increased their power even over Cardinals and other Bishops by exploiting their newly invented unique claim to being infallible. Popes, much like Trump, want to retain their power even if hundreds of millions of women worldwide are denied reproductive justice to protect popes' mythical claims to infallibility. Popes have shown in their shameful cover-ups of priests' and bishops' sexual abuse of defenseless children that popes sin like other humans. The papal fixation on preserving their unique "infallible claims" to protect the power they have built up over the last 150 years is more important than any women or children, it appears.<br/><br/>If popes reverse themselves now on women's reproductive rights, their claims to the symbolic power of papal infallibility will fail. Of course, as few Catholics seem to know, popes have earlier reversed themselves on moral issues like slavery and usury. So much for unchanging infallible truths!<br/><br/>That said, with Kavanagh on the Supreme Court, as appears likely, Roe v. Wade can be expected to be limited greatly, executive authority will likely be almost unlimited in immigration, foreign relations and other important areas, and corporate political donations will remain almost unlimited. These surely are trying times for the US.<br/><br/>The push-back of majority voters will need to begin in earnest in less than 60 days in House and Senate elections, and again in 2020's presidential elections. In the 1930's FDR tamed a right wing court with the support of a majority of voters. This can happen again.
 Bob Woodward is certifiably THE most respected investigative journalist of the last 50 years and has covered countless administrations. The man has certifiably no agenda against Trump or the current administration (as could be inferred from Comney's book) that would call into question the integrity of the stories contained.<br/><br/>That being said, however, this book isn't exactly full of breaking news. We know Trump was and remains unprepared to be the president. We know he won through the extremist right wing media coverage. We know the economy is doing well but that many of the decisions were made outside of his own direct understanding.<br/><br/>That being said, this book offers a very official feeling look into Trump's current predicament and inability and unfitness for the job. The most shocking parts of this book however, had not previously been covered. i.e. his own staff hiding documents and his Twitter causing international tensions, the level of which not previously understood.<br/><br/>While many on the right will scream that many of the sources in this book denied quotes or stories about them, I mean, who wouldn't? If you were caught by your boss for talking about them behind their back or undermining their authority, who wouldn't lie to save their own position?  Let's be real. "Yes sir/Mam'n I took documents off your desk to save our company and hid them." No one would do that. The evidence and amount of corroboration outweighs any half-denials. Both Rob Porter and Gary Cohn issued lengthy statements of denial regarding taking documents, but never actually denied taking the documents. Everything else can be corroborated as Bob is known for his due diligence.<br/><br/>I find a small sense of relief and a strong appreciation for having Bob Woodward to continue to investigate in the same manner that brought down the Nixon administration during Watergate during this complex and inconceivable time in American history.<br/><br/>I'll end this with one food for thought; Bob Woodward has some of the highest journalistic credentials and his work has been lauded for decades for it's integrity and truthfulness, covering every president from Nixon to Clinton, to Bush and Obama. Trump has been caught in lie after lie. I'll shape my opinions accordingly. I hope everyone else in this country turns off Fox News and other strongly biased news sources (on both sides) and does the same.
 Reading this book, I felt as though Mr. Woodward was sitting opposite me on a sofa with a coffee table between us. Each of us had a cup of coffee and were just having a personal conversation. On the table was spread out various documents that were backing up the incredible tale being discussed. This is my attempt to get persons that would normally not even try to read a dull or dry non-fiction book to pay attention to an extremely well written book that tells us information we, as Citizens of the United States of America need to learn.<br/><br/>I found myself reading the book as though I was sitting with a jury hearing a case and trying to determine if there was truly a 'reasonable doubt' to be found. Was the subject of the case truly doing his best to run this country in the country's best interest.<br/><br/>I have made my decision and now ask all readers to do likewise. Even though the book was written under 'deep cover', meaning names not used, there were many names used. The rhythms of the words for others gave away their identities even where actual names weren't offered. This is an important book. I ignored the various news clips and televised discussions and decided to read this book unbiased. I hope you will as well.<br/><br/>Thank you, Mr. Woodward for informing the public of information we truly need and deserve.
 Agent Orange is gonna see red now. I can't believe we as a country did this. Thank you Bob for some objective insight into that circus.
 Thoroughly researched and vetted, Bob Woodward’s detailing of life within the Trump White House is as engrossing as it is frightening – hence the title.<br/><br/>Donald Drumpf may be invoking unmitigated fear in the minds and hearts of his top advisors but it’s also what every concerned American paying attention over the past two years will be feeling every day until Stormy Daniels’ lover is removed from office.
 Common sense narrative.factual, moving. It is scary and helpful to learn the background, inside, activities that caused the terrifying roller coaster ride we are now all on. It is told calmly, with compassion.
 Not salacious at all. Couldn't put it down. We are well and truly screwed. Thanks for the confirmation, Bob. Highly recommend.
 This is the book that only Bob Woodward could have written. With his experience and regard as a journalist who's held numerous administrations up to scrutiny (both Republican and Democratic), this is the examination of the Trump administration that we very much need. It's a pity that so many of his supporters will tune out this warning because it's one that's badly needed.<br/><br/>Woodward doesn't mince facts as he shines a spotlight on the chaos within the White House. That even those who are unprepared and unqualified for the positions that they hold are scrambling behind the scenes to make coherent policy out of Trump's whims, reining in the worst excesses and even taking the unheard of step of actively working to keep Trump from entirely gutting American's foreign and domestic operations. We see his staff members trying to salvage our alliances, recognizing how vital they are for our country's security even if the man holding the office of president doesn't.<br/><br/>But while the book, based impeccably on fact and direct testimony of those trying to operate in the eye of the storm, reveals the total dysfunction of the Trump White House and how utterly detached Trump is from reality, it raises other more troubling questions. Where are the checks that our founding fathers built into our system of government that were meant to corral an out-of-control president? What happens when the Congress, currently in the control of Trump's supposed party refuses to take seriously its role as an equal part of the federal government and give Trump free rein. What will remain of the Republican party once Trump leaves the political stage (whether by impeachment, being voted out or at the end of a dreaded second term)? What happens to our need for rational political discourse now that we've entered a world where fear, personal insults and cruelty are seen as political assets?<br/><br/>I'd call this a must read even with the knowledge that too many people who need to read this book won't. Which is a real shame because like it or not, we're all in this together and one day we're all going to be survivors of what Trump has inflicted on our country.
 For those of us alive, this is the most important book of our lifetimes! Read it and get into action -- get out the vote. Yesterday,  when a supermarket cashier wished me a good day after my purchase, I responded with "get out the vote" -- but he misheard me, saying, "I don't have a boat." Most of us are not wealthy enough to own boats -- but we each have a vote, the most valuable thing we possess. Use your votes, people, to stave off fascism and bring back democracy (and sanity!).
 A terrifying portrait of the current sitting President.<br/>Remove the colon after the word fear folks!<br/>- This is a call to action like no other book he’s written before -
 I bought the book essentially based upon the author's reputation.<br/>It is not well written or well edited. Language is awkward and repetitious.<br/>The contents of the book which are based mostly on annonymous sources tell nothing that was not already said in "Fire and Fury"<br/>The allegation that unelected persons, appointed by Trump, are contolling the ship of state and evading Trump, is not  comforting to me.<br/>In fact, some of the alleged statements made by Trump that the cabal has overruled, sound pretty good to me.<br/> i.e. getting out of Afghanistan  and stopping the bloated military spending and use those funds to repair the failing infrastructure in the country  which for the most part was built when FDR was president.<br/> So, if Trump is incapable of the Presidency, the answer is not a coup, but a removal by available legal means.<br/>What is needed is integrity and backbone in those who have the power.
 This is journalism at its finest. It is full of first hand accounts of people who know exactly what was happening during Trumps campaign, and is currently happening in the Trump presidency. I'm amazed that the same guy that brought down Nixon wrote this book. I watched the movie about him well after it had come out. I was too young to understand Watergate as a child, and the movie "All the Presidents Men" illuminated the importance of Bob Woodward and the free press in this country. It's almost unbelievable that he has succeeded yet again where every other news outlet has failed. He has the truth with documentation and eye witness accounts.<br/><br/>This book, although riveting and shocking, is actually a welcome reprieve from the daily crazy in the news because this book explains things and makes sense of the chaos we've been getting via the news outlets for well over a couple years.<br/><br/>I am actually relieved that Trumps rise to president actually makes sense based on the synchronicity of the events. Of course the sexual misconduct allegations came out the exact same time as news that the campaign was colluding with Russia. Someone leaked it and orchestrated the distraction perfectly. Even part of the campaign was surprised at the timing.<br/><br/>I'm only on chapter 4, and I feel a sense of relief that Bannon hated Manafort, and that the RNC and its benefactors pulled all funding for Trump at the last minutes of the campaign because they knew he would lose and didn't want to support him.<br/><br/>With all of the nonsense and propaganda being shoved in our faces, it is refreshing to read actual witness accounts, word for word, about Trump and how he got elected, and what daily life is like in the White House. It is terrifying, but not quite as terrifying as my imagination. Somehow, it is comforting to know that Russia succeeded, but that every apparatus of the Trump crazy train is countering his unreliability as much as they can.<br/><br/>What a jumbled mix of emotions I have in reaction to this book, and I'm only on chapter 4. I have a lot of questions. Many more than I did previously, but this feels like progress. The real story is starting to be told.
 I was so excited for this book to come out I downloded it just after midnight. I'm an avid reader but have never read a Bob Woodward book before. I was expecting to be impressed on several levels but sadly its been difficult to read because I keep encountering so many editing mistakes...just now I tried to read it again (only at 22%) and I've spotted yet another one! Some of these are pretty basic and I expect and frankly (we all) deserve better from a professional.<br/><br/>The storytelling is not near as compelling as the Wolfe book either. So far the best story is the opening one as it was written in a captivating way and you can read that for free in the sample. Save your money &amp; read excerpts for a better experience.
 Our country so desperately needs to wake up to what is going on the WH right now.  I am praying this book... which is meticulously written and well done... will help do that.
 Extremely thorough, extremely captivating...and unfortunately, extremely true.
 Finished the first seven chapters of the book and I can't stop reading! First-hand accounts of those who created the Trump Presidency and "MAGA". Those who fed the monster and later regretted it.<br/><br/>Edit: 15 Chapters into the book, I can't help but notice that Trump's Administration is so out of wack, that Steve Bannon none other is portraited unintentionally by Woodward as "a voice of reason"! This is deeply disturbing.<br/><br/>Edit: Done reading the book. One thing that I find impressing about Trump (to be fair) is his insistence on keeping his promises to his base that got him into the WH. Needle to say that most of these promises are stupid and potentially very harmful to the American Life, American Economy and American national security.  I couldn't record this book enough. However, I wish there was more coverage of the WH's role in bringing  North Korean to the negotiations' table.
 Having been on the pre-order list, I waited with anticipation to receive this book by an outstanding author.  I've admired him for years, and watched several of his interviews on this blockbuster tome.  What a let-down!  It's full of oddly phrased conversations, with quote marks placed half-way through sentences at times.  There's no narrative of explanation or thoughtful analysis.  I was bored by the half-way mark!<br/><br/>He and his co-author (whom he admits was in charge of the entire pacing, placement and chronology) have merely typed up snippets of conversations without any cohesion or theme.  And every conversation is full of profanity.  He apparently felt no compulsion to clean up the language and, if they truly all speak like this, what a blue haze must emanate the halls of our White House.  'Talk about a poor workplace environment:  These are professionals who are running our country - so very, very sad.<br/><br/>And not only was there simply no literary depth to this book, Woodward failed to mention so many other things, like the fight with the GOP Congress over revising Obamacare.  Also, there was no discussion on Trump's background as to why he leads the way he does, no reference to so many more staff turnovers the first year than ever in the history of a President, nothing on Trump's crude texts related to various porn stars he'd admired, and other than one waiver mentioned, no mention of all the others he obtained for lobbyists that he liked, or for obtaining foreign workers at his Florida home, or how many in the White House had no security clearances.<br/><br/>Woodward talks of the amount of time Trump wastes watching TV, but failed to mentioned that he golfs more than the most recent presidents combined, and spends 3-4 days on the weekends at his golf courses, calling them "working weekends." Frankly, the only new thing that I learned was that Trump's son-in-law is in effect running our country.<br/><br/>This book would not pass our old high school English teachers.  Its topic is not placed in a historical context, and it lacks strong analysis and proofs of its theme - because there simply is none!  I'm now reading Greg Miller's "The Apprentice," which is exquisitely written with analysis and thought, with facts stated clearly, and placed in historical context and in chronological order.  It gives us a much, much better view of what transpired these past two years. But don't bother reading Woodward's book.  It was such a disappointment from a journalist and writer whom I once greatly admired.
 How did we ever, got to this point, should be the question to ALL of us.
 Bob Woodward, the highly distinguished and well-respected journalist, has investigated and reported on administrations of all US presidents beginning with Watergate-era Richard M. Nixon. Over the decades, he has a developed a well deserved reputation for integrity, accuracy and impartiality. While various public figures that have appeared in his pages have groused about how they've been portrayed, Woodward has never been shown to have breached his reportorial integrity. Now, as expected, having taken on the Philosopher King Himself, Donald J. Trump in “Fear”, the expected barrage of "fake news" and other counter-evidentiary claims are pouring forth from the administration and its supporters. Cross-referencing "Fear" with numerous, diverse and independently reported sources, it seems likely that Woodward's reputation will be burnished by this excellent piece of reportage.<br/><br/>As pre-release copies of "Fear" have already been carefully reviewed by (amongst very many others) The Washington Post, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and other esteemed (by most readers), there is little point in regurgitating illustrative vignettes and Trumpian solecisms now. Interested readers can find titillating examples reported across the political spectrum<br/><br/>Certainly, knowing his subject's history, Woodward has prepared for the furor generated by "Fear". Per The Times,  "Fear" is based on hundreds of hours of interviews and many months of meticulous research. There is no reason to doubt this: that’s always been the case with Woodwardian investigations, as the Litigator-in-Chief will doubtlessly be flagellating both his White House legal staff and the hapless Attorney General to send Bob to Gitmo tout de suite. As per habit though, Trump, his minions and his paladins are engaged in some mighty serious ad hominem attacks: what other avenue than to disparage Woodward's reputation as they can’t (so far) refute any specific claims. Personally directed attacks have asymptotically escalated over the past week and they've probably not yet plateaued. For instance, The Donald called Woodward a “liar” earlier a few days ago (and, for good measure, he's also slung a few at Carl Bernstein, Bob's partner in exposing Nixonian Watergate). So far, nothing that appears factual has been refuted. Various principles have issued “non-denial denials” and Trump is fulminating over disloyalty and leaks galore in the Oval Office and his Castle by the Sea.<br/><br/>Without regurgitating the many outrageous actions against both custom and law committed by and on behalf of Mr. Trump over the last few decades, suffice it to note that there are very few surprises in "Fear" at least to politically engaged readers of whatever persuasion. Yes, there are many heretofore unknown dysfunctional interactions and a catalogue of internal tensions between the president and various highly placed members of his staff.<br/><br/>Woodward's style lacks nuance and has a reportorial “Just the facts ma’am. Just the facts” flavor. As a result, “Fear” reads very rapidly. Were it not for the astonishing (albeit not unexpected) anecdotes - and every reader will surely have a favorite! -  Bob's writing is simultaneously straightforward and appropriate for the subject. Clearly, a neutral and non-sensational approach is clearly needed when dealing with a subject as contentious as this one.<br/><br/>What emerges from all this is that The Donald - the self-styled "stable genius", who is "very highly educated" and seems to see a Philosopher King reflected in the Magic Mirror on the Wall (the same one that indicated record setting inauguration crowds) - is fundamentally a dolt. To give credit where due, he is a cunning rabble rouser, one with astonishing and innate abilities as a populist agitator. Yet, adding to his woes, Trump is apparently a congenital liar and has a vengeful mercurial personality: the perfect complement to his vanity, venality and intellectual vacuousness. Worse, he possesses a consistent and laser-like penchant for revenge, so expect Woodward's book and Bob himself to be the center of a legal blitzkrieg for a long, long time.<br/><br/>How to sum up? This paragraph (from the introduction) works well: "The reality was that the United States in 2017 was tethered to the words and actions of an emotionally overwrought, mercurial and unpredictable leader. Members of his staff had joined to purposefully block some of what they beleived were the president's most dangerous impulses. It was a nervous breakdown of the executive  power of the most powerful country in the world."<br/><br/>While the timing of "Fear's" release may be coincidental, the more politically engaged (conspiratorial?) Brietbart reader might speculate that it was intended to make mischief for Republicans around mid-term election time. Recent polls suggest that hasn't happened with "the base" (so far), but some shift in electoral sentiment against Republicans seems to be emerging. Hopefully, this meticulously constructed chronicle of ineptitude, incompetence, willful ignorance, histrionics and lies will help usher Trump back into his gilded Tower, there to rage and foment additional conspiracies against his imagined New Camelot, which has somehow gone awry, partly thanks to "Fear".
 I went w/the Kindle version because I couldn’t wait. I can highlight, bookmark, search, &amp; re-read this as many times as it takes to absorb the things that I miss in my haste. Read on my iPhone or Kindle...I hope I can find a place to stop or I’m pulling an all-nighter for the first time in 25+ years. TY, Bob Woodward. You and Walter Cronkite were my heroes as a young journalist, &amp; I am grateful that you are again describing the unimaginable. - Prairie Girl
 Dowd as cited on page 337 was frustrated, into observing that Trump was a "liar", and this lead to Dowd resigning before Trump fired him. On page 230, prior to leaving, Mc Master futilly tried to explain to Trump that he, Trump, was bashing Ukrainian officials with a Russian propaganda talking point. To no avail. In all this, Trump self promotes, leading to world class talent unable to get through to Trump how dangerous his conduct is.  This travelogue of  massive dereliction of duty and mental incapacity shocked me. Trump was elected by voters asking for a 'change' candidate. The reality is that Trump is a self promation candidate and the interests of the USA be damned.<br/><br/>I liked it that Woodward gave very precise backing to readers wishing to present their case as to why Trump; is unsuited to the office of the presidency.<br/><br/>Non withstanding that, the book also indicates what may be the hidden attraction of Trump to a part of the electorate. If one is not exposed to the daily train wreck of abuse and incompentence, Trump appears if one does not look too closely to be a "truth teller".<br/><br/>Reading Woodward's book,  such a chariatable rendition of Trump's conduct cannot be seriously entertained by informed voters.<br/><br/>I hope that Congress, and the House and Senate , and the Trump White house bury their differences and show Trump the 25 amendment exit, which is fully justifiable by those who take the time to read this book.
 Horrible writing, reads like a bunch of note cards, somewhat in order with one or more cards miss sorted. I've read and enjoyed other Woodward books, disappointed.<br/>And, oh ya, there are miss labeled pictures, he confuses Bannon with Ivanka? I'm serious! Musta been in a big rush to press.
 Bob Woodward doesn't disappoint. What a great read from a very trusted source. Knew we were in "crazy town"...now I am learning just how deep and we stepped in to it from day one- that ride down the escalator. I still remember the horror I felt when that announcement speech was played live for our beautiful country to gasp at. With Mr. Woodward's book we get to read just how far down we have allowed this pathological liar and crude bully of a President to take us. But I still have hope. Hope that in the not too distant future this nightmare ends. Thank you, Mr. Woodward, for this inside look- my hope is it opens all the eyes needed to get us free of this unqualified bully; who frankly scares me.
 If you have been reading the New York Times, WSJ or Washington Post with regularity over the past two years, you will find nothing new here.  What was new in advance of publication has been covered in various media discussions in the run up to the release of the book.  What is problematic is the lack of depth.  It is all fine to explain that some action is far from the norm, but if the normal approach is not explained in detail, then the statement has little meaning or impact.  The absence of detail and depth creates the greatest problem.  Although the book provides one or two brief stories about Jared Kushner, for example, there is very little depth to the discussion.  The role of areas of the White House (press secretaries, K Conway) are all but ignored, and most Cabinet members never appear.<br/>Oddly, if anything this book actually works to  improve the picture of Trump (while moving from 1 to 3 on a scale of 1,000 is not a significant accomplishment, the book does help in that way).  If anything, Sec. Tillerson comes off worse than Trump, while Sec. Matthis also appears to have a very flexible backbone at times.
 Can’t put it down. Halfway through and it just keeps blowing my mind. I was not a Trump supporter but neither was I a Never-Trumper. I was hopeful that as a business man he could bring something new to Washington and create change that could unify the county. Bob Woodward’s book is one more nail in the coffin showcasing a president who has no moral compass, ability to access right from wrong, an inability to understand US and foreign politics, easily manipulated by those around him, and a a constant need to put himself first above all else. The scenarios outlined by Woodward will blow your mind.
 Objective statements based on concrete, clear details.  What a welcome change to so much of this... Thank you Mr. Woodward for the reminder of HOW we can (choose to) witness, discern, and experience the mess unfolding.
 Our country needs more JOURNALISTS!
 I just got it. So far, woa!
 Read both Fire and Fury and House of Putin house of trump when they came out. But had my reserves. This is a detailed account. It's facts, scene's stacked on top one another, to paint an alarming picture. Granted I'm only a hundred pages in and I can only think how the rest is going to be, but so far it's bleak.<br/>Reality tv does politics.
 Cannot put this down. Terrifying compelling and expertly researched, as expected from one of the finest journalists of our time.
 With all the news of a dysfunctional White House, did you ever wonder what it would be like to be a fly on the wall? Woodward gives us a glipse of that and it is terrifying. This book is not just hearsay but actual taped interviews. The author masterfully weaves the story allowing the reader to reach his/her own conclusion. It will be harder to sleep tonight.
 Meticulously researched and resourced, gone over a  gazillion times, and edited by an army of experts, how can the president call this book a work of fiction?<br/><br/>Oh wait. Consider where that's coming from. then start praying with the rest of the intellectual world that cooler heads will prevail.<br/><br/>The man can't get out of his own way. And when Bob Woodward speaks, truth really is truth.<br/><br/>Read. This. Book.
 I believe Bob over Trump ANY DAY.....
 I read Michael Wolff's book about Trump's White House and thought it was certainly credible, but in retrospect (and after reading Woodward's "Fear") I feel it has a slightly salacious bent. Reading Woodward's account of the inner workings of the Trump White House not only restates much of what we've heard before, but it lends credibility to accounts of the same nature from sources that could have once been considered "iffy." In other words, this book confirms the reports of what we were once inclined to think of as outrageous and inconceivable behavior on the part of grown adults in positions of very serious responsibility. The dereliction of duty, the utter bankruptcy of morals, and the terrorized, back-stabbing frenzy of self-preservation that is taking place at the top of our government is galling, shocking and downright disgusting. Our very lives are in the hands of people who routinely demonstrate incompetence, pettiness and greed, among other things, such as their utter disregard for the safety, solidarity and integrity of our nation. This is how we "Make America Great Again??????"<br/><br/>Mr. Woodward is doing with this book what he did during Watergate: he is opening the eyes of the American people, which will go a very long way toward bringing about the necessary changes. Yes, there will still be those who insist on squeezing their eyes tightly closed while they are blatantly lied to, ripped off and disenfranchised by the one they rely on the serve them. It's the old Stockholm Syndrome, I guess. Very sad.<br/><br/>Thank you, Bob Woodward, for your bravery and your commitment to the principles of Democracy. Your book, like you, is a winner!!!!
 A book, written by a man with a lifetime of impeccable character, about another man with a lifetime of impeachable offenses.  Who are you willing to believe?  It is time to wake up to smell the TRUTH and take action.
 I am only on Chapter 11, but so far it closely follows the breaking news as it has appeared, after the book!  The Data checked out against WAPO, NYT, LAT, ALTERNET, PROPUBLICA, THE ATLANTIC, MOTHER JONES, MSNBC, ETC. and several others.<br/>It also checks out against my psych. training, and knowledge over the years, of El Trumpo.<br/><br/>I trained in NYC, and even years ago he was regarded as a laughing stock--but now he is where he can do a huge amount of damage.<br/><br/>Woodward has written clearly and logically.  As the wall poster says "I will defend my country from enemies, both foreign and Republican."
 I don't like the fact that the book and the Audio version do not align. To top it off, the book begins on Chapter 22. At first, I thought it was kinda of a joke, but when I heard the whole chapter and then said, "Chapter 23" I was like....NOOOOO!!!! Ugh! I'm so annoyed.
 Woodward did his research well.  The exacting details in Fear put the reader right smack dab into the middle of this insane administration. Reading this book is as close to Trump as I ever want to get. Once I started reading it I couldn’t put it down. I hope Fear helps to bring about change in the November elections.
 While I appreciate Woodward's writing, as often with his books, I'm left with the feeling there's a lot more he learned that he withholds to secure his future access. I follow the news closely and but for a few bits of extra Trump hyperbole, concrete thinking and grandiosity, there wasn't much new to me. Dunno. There's something about Woodward that always stays measured in ways that make me mistrust his motives and authenticity.<br/><br/>The hardest part of the book for me was getting a real sense of how military men think, and their power in our world. So much money is spent and so many lives are lost so warriors do not lose face. With apologies to my civilized, thoughtful brethren, our world has been spoiled by fouled testosterone. I don't expect that to change any time soon.
 The book was outstanding. I applaud him for writing that. Stays up to date
 Compelling from the first page. Well written, and from an incredibly esteemed journalist. Timing of release is perfection.
 Bob Woodward’s book “Fear” is an engrossing read. His well researched prose provides an authentic sense of ‘being there’ in the first year plus of Donald Trump’s presidency.<br/><br/>Woodward conveys color, perspective and human character to Trump and the better known members of his early administration.<br/><br/>The connective tissue binding these individual and collective narratives is how 45’s team functioned, both working together and individually, for a singularly unlikely president.<br/><br/>Trump antagonists and supporters will find much here to support their existing impressions of Trump, while learning important insights about a man they may view as dangerously unprepared &amp; unsuited for office, or a provocative change agent. Woodward’s matter of fact style lends trustworthy perspective to an array of important observations, such as Trump being largely unaware of how our government functions (and disinclined to learn more), of a man supremely confident in his innate ability to ‘read’ people &amp; circumstances, his fixation on media coverage &amp; his transcendent focus on ‘winning’ irrespective of associated costs or impacts.<br/><br/>His personal charm is explored as is his ruthless approach to perceived enemies &amp; associates who have outlived their usefulness to him.<br/><br/>The early Mueller investigation is reported from an insider’s perspective, especially the interplay between Mueller &amp; Trump’s attorney John Dowd.<br/><br/>As an avid follower of and commentator about this president and his administration I found Woodward’s account informative, lucid &amp; insightful.<br/><br/>I would strongly recommend ‘Fear’ to anyone with a more then passing interest in the Trump administration.
 Chilling and harrowing re-telling of the rise of someone who became president despite being utterly unqualified for the role. This book will likely stand the test of time as a "never again" warning to future generations.
 I am just beginning the book, brilliantly written, an easy read, by a pulitzer prize winner who helped end Nixon.  A book all Americans need to read! I can't Believe the GOP Kleptocracy will do nothing to save us! It's shocking! Terrifying! Can not wait till November, particularly now with this book in hand. We need to wake up and save ourselves!
 I’ve read only the prologue. That’s enough scarey stuff for now - more later
 A serious look at policy making in the Trump White House. I had heard the many headline stories. But the book places them in context, and tells a straightforward if disconcerting story.  I could not put it down. This book is not to be missed.
 We all need to read this book and open the contains to see what’s really happening the author has done a magnificent job, one of the best books I’ve read.
 I'm about halfway through the book, and I've discovered two dirty little secrets. Dirty little secret #1: most TV reviewers only got through the first three chapters of the book and based their evaluations and anecdotes on that (I've since been told that for most advance reviewers, three chapters is all they get prior to publication). Dirty little secret #2: the first three chapters are all you really need. Woodward's portrait of the principal players in this tragicomedy is dead on. Here's a bonus: dirty little secret #3: You can read substantial parts of the book on Amazon. It's worth the time. Just try chapter one, where Steve Bossie and Steve Bannon are talking with Trump in 2010, trying to figure out what kind of Presidential candidate Trump would make. Trump had not declined mentally and physically to the point he has today, but he was still recognizable as the quintessential Queens con man, for whom truth was whatever helped him personally in the moment.  His answers to Bannon's and Bossie's questions were typical Trump, shockingly ignorant, and hilarious and horrifying in turn. Woodward has produced a tour de force which should be read by everyone with a serious interest in politics. Before you vote this November, be informed -- and be warned.
 There really wasn't anything new in this book that I hadn't already seen in the news.  Not sure why all the fuss.  The only difference all the facts are compiled in one place.  If you haven't been paying attention, this may inform you.<br/>I had been expecting some astounding revelations due to the hype, but was surprised by the lack of new material.
 “The only thing we have to fear is fear itself,” said Franklin Delano Roosevelt on the day he was sworn in as president of the United States. The year was 1933, and the new president was trying to quell the nation’s fears amid the throes of the Great Depression.<br/><br/>But if fear is meant to signify the new book about the Trump Administration by Bob Woodward, then there is nothing to fear in that respect either.<br/><br/>Woodward, the veteran journalist who along with Carl Bernstein is credited for uncovering the Watergate scandal that ultimately brought down Richard Nixon’s presidency, wrote a book with Bernstein in 1974 about Watergate, titled All the President’s Men. Since then, the prolific author has penned an additional eighteen tomes, including at least one on each president from George H.W. Bush to Barack Obama.<br/><br/>This year, poignantly on September 11, Woodward’s 19th book was released, about the Trump Administration, titled Fear: Trump in the White House. The book’s release, on the heels of the buzz circulating around the September 5 New York Times op-ed piece “I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration,” by Anonymous, to whom I refer as “Shallow Throat,” had folks on both sides of the Trump fence in a frenzy. To extreme Trump haters and extreme Trump supporters, I have this to say: you’re not going to like this book. To the rest of us, it is a valuable, thoughtful, addition to all of the serious books – as opposed to the trashy ones – about the Trump presidency to date.<br/><br/>As the author of several books myself, most recently Stop Calling Them "Immigrants", I appreciate evenhanded writing.<br/><br/>Many in the increasingly sensationalized, supermarket-tabloidy media, true to their flawed character, cherrypicked the most contentious, controversial tidbits contained in the book (such as then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson referring to President Trump as a “moron”), so as to imply that the book is chock full of Trump-bashing, as if it were a tell-all expose written by a disgruntled former employee or business associate who now suffers from TDS – Trump Derangement Syndrome. But Fear is no such book.<br/><br/>Woodward, true to form, pulls no punches, but presents no agenda. Unlike far inferior writers, he does not weave together a theme to demonstrate anything. Rather, the book reads as if he is keeping a journal of the daily goings on of the Trump White House, which has even prompted some readers to deem the book “boring,” because there weren’t enough juicy details in it about Trump.<br/><br/>The book certainly portrays Trump as high-strung, tempestuous, angry, unpredictable, and irreconcilable at times. It also shows him as incredibly sharp and perceptive, often impatient when some of his staff fell short of such standards.<br/><br/>Woodward describes compassionate sides of Trump rarely made public, such as his subsequent aversion to meeting with families of veterans killed in action, because his initial experience in doing so was far too painful for him to endure. There is further evidence of Trump’s sensitivity to human suffering insofar as his reaction – that one more publicized – to disfigured and killed children in Syria as a result of its president Bashar al-Assad’s use of chemical weapons in that nation’s civil war.<br/><br/>The first part of the book reveals a great deal of political miscalculations by many of Trump’s associates, and in sharp contrast portrays former Breitbart Head Steve Bannon and U.S. Senator (SC) Lindsey Graham as prognosticating geniuses.<br/><br/>In addition to Tillerson, Woodward reports about others in the White House having described Trump in unflattering ways, suggesting that he was out of his depth and/or started to lose his grip. The important takeaway from that, though, is that Woodward does not imply that he himself draws those conclusions, but rather that he is reporting about others who have. Just as Woodward points to those loyal to the president and seemingly happy in their jobs.<br/><br/>Curiously, one of Trump’s closest confidantes, Kellyanne Conway, who served as his third and final campaign manager and is now Counselor to the president, is not featured all that much. In fact, as the book progresses, well into the first year of the Trump Administration, Conway, who is one of the president’s steadfast allies amid a virtual revolving door of underlings, is hardly mentioned at all.<br/><br/>As the book moves forward, the number of negative anecdotes increase, perhaps giving the TDS crowd the red meat they crave, and providing those Trump supporters who refuse to criticize the president about anything a reason to discredit Woodward.<br/><br/>One theme intensifies – dishonesty. Woodward does not directly accuse Trump of lying, he places that conclusion, repeatedly and squarely in the mouth of John Dowd, one of Trump’s attorneys at the time. In fact, Woodward concludes that the one overriding problem Trump has, which Dowd knew but couldn’t say out loud, is that the president is “a f****n liar.”<br/><br/>Woodward emphasizes Trump’s focus, even respect for denying any wrongdoing – whether the denier is he or someone else – because to admit and/or to apologize is “weak.” Trump himself has admitted such on various occasions, and in his 1987 book The Art of the Deal disclosed that he often embellishes stories to make them more interesting to the beholder – not much different than a Herodotean approach to historical writing, as opposed to a Thucydidean one.<br/><br/>The most puzzling part about Woodward’s book is the title, Fear, which is attributed to a quote featured on the back cover, attributed to Trump on March 31, 2016, “Real power is – I don’t even want to use the word – fear.” But there is no pattern in the book of Trump using fear to rule as president. From the way Woodward describes life in the Trump Administration, a more appropriate title might be Chaos, Uncertainty, Unpredictability, or Frenzy. Not so much Fear.<br/><br/>I hope readers of this review who have yet to read Fear by Bob Woodward will do so soon. Because his supporters will complain that too much of Trump’s dirty laundry is aired, and the haters will complain too little. And that is exactly what makes it a worthwhile read.<br/><br/>Why, then, only four stars? Because I grade the great Woodward on a curve. A first-rate investigative reporter such as he should have done his homework more carefully; too many people flatly deny what was written about them in the book. They do not insinuate that Woodward is a liar, just that he was careless.
 Woodward has provided a chilling depiction of a President Trump who doesn't like facts. His motto could be "Don't bother me with facts. My mind is made up".  Filled with bizarre often insane notions, e.g., that the purpose of the US Federal Government is to make money above all else, Trump seems incapable of learning anything. He hates to read anything and ignores his daily take-home briefings,  is obsessed with watching TV (Fox News), and lies constantly. While these are hardly new revelations, Woodward's book adds great credence to the reality of how Most of the White House staff spend their time trying to "manage" an unhinged President who thinks he has never been wrong about anything in his 71 years of life, and has zero self-consciousness, empathy or understanding of those different from himself. He values others based on their loyalty to HIM, not the country.  While the book is written in simple terms (which surprised me at first but must greatly increase its readability for the average citizen), it is full of direct quotes from many of the most famous Republican names in our time. We have a President who thinks he knows everything but sadly knows next to nothing about how the international political and economic worlds operate.
 As I have commented in other reviews, my intense interest in current events in the political arena is the result of a deep anxiety concerning the state of our democracy - and indeed the world - subsequent to the events culminating in the election of our 45th president. Having become a devotee of various commentators on MSNBC, especially Rachel Maddow and Lawrence O'Donnell, I have therefore also been made aware of a number of important books, of which Bob Woodward's "Fear" is the most recently called to my attention. Having pre-ordered this book on Kindle, I've had it in my hands for approximately 24 hours, and although I'm by no means finished perusing it, I believe I've read enough to form a strong opinion, and I want to develop my own analysis prior to a glut of other people's opinions and commentaries.<br/><br/>In view of the fact that my interest is, as stated above, extremely recent, I freely assert that I have read none of Woodward's other documentaries on previous chief executives. Therefore I can't make any comparisons to his previous reporting; I will leave that endeavor to more experienced partisans. However, it is clearly obvious even to a political novice like me that this author is in a category all by himself with respect to detail and thoroughness of reporting. His writing style is extremely accessible - one could even say "folksy" - and he doesn't use footnotes. One thing I did find challenging, however, was the rapid change of topic and focus which seems to be his style as he discusses various activities, conversation, and issues relating to the huge number of concerns involved in the function of the administration. If I were studying this book seriously, I believe I'd have to set up a spreadsheet, flowchart and timeline to try to relate all the intricacies he discusses and the individuals and circumstances involved.<br/><br/>I am aware that the media are prone to pick out the most sensational "sound bites" from Woodward's book, and that those who are in opposition or feel threatened by the content will try to distort and misrepresent aspects of his analysis and challenge the facts and quotations cited. This is, of course, a dangerously shallow approach. For myself, I believe this massive endeavor of investigative journalism deserves the utmost consideration. I have given it four stars rather than the five which a more knowledgeable reader would reasonably render simply because I have found it more than a little daunting to keep up with the flow and nuance. It undoubtedly deserves a deeper analysis than that of which I am capable as a "lay reader" with negligible political or journalistic expertise
 Woodward's book is a slow grinding picture into presidency we know very little about.  The latest media coverage doesn't provide the depth to which this book dives in confirming a looming fear: Trump is very much unstable and has created a Whitehouse very much in his image.<br/><br/>One of the themes from Fire and Fury posits that the trump campaign was convinced they'd loose the election.  It didn't matter what they did, who they met with, there's no way we can win.  Then they did.<br/><br/>Woodward provides amazing examples of how this same group moved into positions of immense responsibility, with no idea what they are doing.<br/><br/>I'd recommend the book
 This is a good revealing book. I was especially interested in the discussions about tariffs. It tells why he didn't learn about free trade in college and what he is so adamant about using them. All in all, worth reading
 Inform yourself by reading this book. This is one of the most important events this lifetime.
 Woodward is a journalist in the finest sense of the word. When you open the book, there’s an explanation of how he gathers information, and how he attributes it, giving the reader an accurate way to gauge whether an event depicted was verified through multiple, independent sources - publicly if possible - or if he was unable to vet the information adequately, and the reader knows this.<br/><br/>One story that was cited in reviews of the book struck me as implausible and skeptical - but before the first chapter begins, that story is broken down detail-by-detail, sourced on the record by multiple people directly involved, and even a *photo* of the document in question. All of which served to make an incredulous story that seemed implausible into fact - an unpleasant fact, much like seeing an autopsy report, with measurements, detail, and clinical, unflattering photos.<br/><br/>It is an excellent book, and one that causes me significant unease to read, because it turns the “surely they’re exaggerating” sound bite into cold, hard, unassailable fact. This is not a pleasant read - it’s like getting a folder handed to you by a serious-looking doctor. The information isn’t pleasant, but - like a biopsy report, truth is truth, even when it’s not the news you wanted to hear.
 Important perspective on current dysfunction in the White House
 Great book and i could not put it down. It shows how crazy things are in the white house,led by a crazy person. It also tells other people tried hard to make things right and do the right thing for this country. I f this book is half the truth we are in deep trouble. Highly recommend this book!
 Excellent presentation by a more than qualified and accomplished journalist.  Great read.
 I read "Fear" but can't really say I enjoyed doing so. The picture it paints of the Trump Presidency is depressing and demoralizing. I've been thoroughly disgusted with the man and our elected representatives since the 2016 general election. Trump is vile, divisive, dishonest and, apparently quite disturbed; morally, mentally and psychologically unfit for office.<br/><br/>I think what disturbed me most was Woodward's repeated demonstrations of Trump's refusal to be persuaded by facts and statistics when they contradict his preconceived beliefs<br/> (or assumptions): despite numerous attempts by Gary Cohn to illustrate to Trump that foreign trade isn't bad for the country, or that tariffs and a trade war will serve only to harm the U.S. economy (especially Trump's working class base), and that trade agreements impact not only our economy but our national security, he refuses to see, heed, or even acknowledge the logic and facts proving such arguments; to Trump, Gary Cohn is "globalist" and a "Democrat."<br/><br/>The U.S. has been intimately involved in global affairs, trade, and security since the beginning, middle and end of WW II seventy-three years<br/>ago. Simply wishing and willing the roll-back of time won't make it so..<br/><br/>If Democrats don't win back control of the House and (possibly) the Senate this November, I am afraid the President will drag all of us down, kicking and screaming, into what will be a vastly injured, diminished, and damaged United States of America. As a nation, we have plenty of problems to face without Trump's misguided and dangerous lack of leadership adding to the list woes. We all need to vote this year as though our lives depend on it. They do.
 Bob Woodward does it again!  Excellent  writing, clear and concise.<br/>However, had I known that about a third of all the page count would be taken up by photos, portraits, footnotes and oodles of indexes, I would have thought a little harder at the price of the book.<br/>Since the book ends about 18 months into Trump's presidency, it leaves the reader awaiting the next chapter to come......and wondering how it will end.  I have the sense, that will be Bob's next book!
 Amazing look into the dysfunctional Trump administration.
 I pre-ordered this book here on Amazon and glad I did because the hard copies sold out almost immediately (my copy was on my doorstep by Tuesday afternoon - thanks Amazon Prime!)....I am half way through the book and have found it hard to put down...Woodward's style makes you feel like you are living what is happening...its not flowery, its just a blow by blow view of what happened...the account of how Trump got elected during the first part of the book is fascinating....and, I might add, probably will give Trump fans something to like about this book...Trump truly beat incredible odds to win no doubt.  But what happens after he wins is the part I am getting into now and it continues to be riveting...Despite what Trump and his people are saying, you can believe Bob Woodward....he is telling the truth and they all know it...all of Woodward's famous books (and he has told hard truth about presidents from BOTH political parties) have turned out to be true so he does not make stuff up and history will show him to be correct about all this...how it all turns out in the end, nobody knows and Woodward doesn't claim to know either....he just uses this book to report what is happening inside the White House and you can count on it being the truth...our great free speech and free press rights at work for the American people! I highly encourage you to read this book - if you can get your hands on one!  I'll update this review when I finish the book....
 Wow! This is such a page turner! Woodward writes with such ease it takes the reader on an unbelievable journey. I usually don’t read nonfiction, but boy am I glad I read this one!
 Woodward cites a colleague who put the spirit and effort of a coauthor into this book. Yet her name doesn't appear on the cover. I was a little annoyed at him. Then I read the book. I suspect she saw the train wreck and said, "Bob, you should get all the credit." Please!<br/><br/>His thesis is that staff have seized power from an unpredictable leader. One might have thought he would have shown how this happened chronologically. Was it all bad on day one? Or did the situation gradually worsen? What caused this problem?<br/><br/>The presentation used though avoids answers to all these questions. We are presented with a long series of unrelated vignettes. One reviewer spoke of a mishmash of cue cards. That describes the book very well. There is no evidence an outline was used in constructing the work or that an editor was employed in polishing it.<br/><br/>The book is based entirely on Woodward's reputation which, apparently, is good. He says everything is on "deep background"--not naming his sources. (He actually does name a source on page 60.) Woodward's old boss, Ben Bradlee, was worried when much of the early Watergate coverage was done on deep background. Bradlee later got burned when a different reporter, supposedly working on deep background, was just making stuff up. The Post had to return a Pulitzer that time. I am not questioning that Woodward did the interviews. But it is troubling he could get only a single person to go on record.<br/><br/>I expected from the media coverage that the book would be detrimental to the president. I read the book and think he has nothing to worry about. The disjointed presentation does not build a case.
 This book turned out to be somewhat different than I had expected.  Sure there are plenty of instances of Trump calling staff members and others horrid names and throwing fits; ample instances of White House staffers at each others' throats; precipitous possible military actions; and plenty of high jinks by folks with whom we have become familiar such as Steve Bannon, Peter Navarro and Steven Miller. But as I read through the book, what stuck me as being primarily important was that "Fear" is really nothing less than a professional management evaluation (something Bain Capital might produce) of why the White House has become dysfunctional and without cohesion. Generally speaking, the author is not often judgmental but he does, in good Woodward style, call them as he sees them--both good and bad. The book covers the period from the campaign through the early months of 2018. I expect we are likely to see a followup volume before the 2020 election.<br/><br/>Woodward has reproduced purported dialogues which he claims to have on tape. It is often not too hard to figure out who were the sources for his "multiple deep background interviews." Just preserving these discussions is a valuable contribution of the book. One of the best examples of this are the discussions between Trump lawyer John Doud and the Special Counsel. Mueller makes it explicit what he is after: "corrupt intent."  To my mind that means we are dealing with obstruction of justice, and if presidential powers are used with corrupt intent to violate the law, they would not shield the president. Some of Senator Graham's conversations with Trump also help illuminate the reader.  The many conversations involving the president and what to do with North Korea amply reflect the lack of focus, limited background  and explosive emotionalism with which these alternatives were evaluated.<br/><br/>Much like a MBA course, a number of in effect case studies appear: what to do about Afghanistan;  the tariff/free trade dispute; terminating NAFTA; passage of the tax reform legislation; and of course immigration policy. So the reader sees how key policies and decisions were made--as frightening as that sometime is. It must be said that other White Houses had intense infighting, such as LBJ, Nixon, and probably others that were kept private--so Trumpland is not alone in this regard. Though it does appear extreme. Some positive aspects emerge such as the key role played by Jared Kushner in developing warm ties with the new Saudi crown prince. And there are others--so while bleak, the picture is not entirely dark.<br/><br/>My main conclusion is that for effective management to occur, there must be a strong presidential chief of staff.  In my opinion, surely part of the blame for dysfunction that appears in the book falls at the feet of Reince Priebus who may have had good Hill contacts, but lack managerial skills and determination. Even a much stronger personality, General John F. Kelly, gets worn down even though he had vowed to be the person to straighten things out. But given the collection of characters around the President, as well as Trump himself, it is no wonder that not even Kelly can organize things and he certainly tried. To coin a phrase, "the good, the bad, and the ugly" about the current White House operation skillfully and fairly told.
 This is the most powerful and serious book on the disaster of the Trump presidency yet published.  It is not an angry book and in my opinion does not take cheap shots.  Rather, it goes through the major decisions of the Trump presidency and allows you to see its disturbing patterns over time.  One of the biggest problems is that Trump has fixed ideas on a number of important issues that are based on his own prejudices and he cannot be swayed by clear facts or even mountains of data.  According to Woodward, he strongly believes that "trade is bad" and tariffs are good.  He justifies these views with statements like, "I've believed this for 30 years," and that is supposed to end all argument.  Gary Cohn's statement that tariffs may cripple the American agricultural sector, which has $130 billion in exports, is treated as a joke that Trump characterizes as BS and says he does not want to hear about anymore.  Trump also tells General McMaster that he does not care about US allies and basically sees them as freeloaders and crooks.  Strategic and military issues exasperate Trump, and he sees foreign policy as about making money.  According to virtually all of Woodward's sources, Trump does not read anything except newspapers, and he does not listen to anyone who does not agree with him.  He refuses to look at data that contradicts his long-held beliefs.  Woodward does not however go as far as Michael Wolff, who cites reports that Trump is only "semi-literate."<br/><br/>Woodward, as usual, is kind in his treatment of those people who are his best sources, but reflecting the frustrations of key advisors is a lot more than an exercise in kindness.  Trump correctly identifies China as an intellectual property  cheat (costing the United States up to $600 billion in lost revenues over the years), but then decides that he will not implement a joint strategy with US allies because he does not like them.  Correspondingly, Trump confronts China alone with tariffs instead of leading a coalition of other nations aggrieved by the same Chinese policies. Trump is  deeply angry with his generals at times and tells them that they do not need a strategy for Afghanistan since all they have to do is kill people.<br/><br/> I do not see how anyone can read this book and believe even a portion of it and still come away believing that Trump is fit to be president.  This does not mean that Trump has been wrong on every issue, but he has been horribly wrong on some big ones.  Even this might be partially forgivable if he was actually willing to learn and consider new information, but that is not who he is or what he does.  Trump’s greatest fear is showing weakness and to admit that somebody else might be right and he needs to change his view  is correspondingly unthinkable.  And here lies the danger.
 This was pretty heavy going and depressing to boot.  Almost half of the book is footnotes.  While I had heard a lot of the stories covered in the book, I had not heard so many details.  It would be nice if people could read it and learn enough to change their opinion, but the people that need to read it won't.
 Bob Woodward has written an amazing insight into the chaos and turmoil of the Trump administration.  Not surprisingly, all of it created by Trump himself.  As the old saying goes, “When you elect a clown expect a circus.”<br/><br/>The most amazing thing about “Fear: Trump in the White House” is that it was written after less than 20 months into Trump’s term as president.  No doubt there will be a sequel (or more) since the circus is still playing.  Also amazing is that no other sitting POTUS has had so many negative books written about him.  I expect even more to be forthcoming after Trump’s term ends.<br/><br/>From reading “Fear: Trump in the White House”, it’s obvious that Bob Woodard had indepth interviews and access to diaries / journals provided by Reince Priebus, Rex Tillerson, Gary Cohn, and Rob Porter.  It’s more than likely that  John Kelly, H.R. McMaster, Steve Bannon, and John Dowd also cooperated with Bob Woodward for this book.
 You must read this book. I believe 1000% that this is how the first year of Donald Trump’s presidency went down.  It is well-written, extensively footnoted, and calm, believe it or not. The last line of the text says it all.
 Woodward writes an easily digestible account of one of the most disastrous events in modern American history. Better the devil you know...
 Bob Woodward who is known for his straight forward reporting, and some would say boring prose style decided to end Fear Trump in the White House with the president’s former top lawyer John Dowd calling Trump a liar. Woodward isn’t known for editorializing or really making any kind of evaluations or analysis in his books, but it seems he couldn’t avoid it in this one.<br/><br/>That’s because Fear outlines a White House in disarray. The president is given to fits, watches a huge amount of television and gets angry over every criticism, there is no bureaucratic system working so things happen haphazardly especially when Trump makes announcements via Twitter without telling his staff beforehand, all leading to dysfunction. The president’s staff is so worried about his shifting moods and off the cuff decisions that they actively work to block his worst tendencies sometimes with little success. The book also reveals Trump’s world view which is shaped by his business background which leads him to believe everything is about money. That might seem okay at face value, but when applied to things like foreign policy and the military doesn’t work. Trump also has a vision of an American economy based upon factories that ceased to exist several decades ago. That has led him to make several of his decisions on trade in an attempt to move the economy backwards. Most important, the book gives a real understanding for how and why Trump does what he does.<br/><br/>Any kind of behind the scenes book like this will bring up questions about sources. At the end there are extensive footnotes, but these are mostly for specific events like a Trump press conference, etc. The real heart of the book comes from several former members of the administration and Trump employees who talked to Woodward. It’s pretty obvious from the amount of conversations included to figure out who some of these are. They include Steve Bannon Trump’s former top policy adviser, Reince Priebus the first chief of staff, Senator Lindsey Graham a close Trump ally in Congress, Gary Cohn the former chief economic adviser, John Dowd Trump’s former lawyer hired to deal with the Muller investigation, and H.R. McMaster the former National Security Adviser. There are more, but those are some of the most apparent.<br/><br/>On to what the book says about the Trump administration.<br/><br/>The first issue is dysfunction. This problem starts at the top. Trump doesn’t like to read, rarely pays attention to briefings, and doesn’t even go through his daily schedule. Instead, Trump likes to improvise in many situations, and his mind often wonders from subject to subject. For instance, Trump said he didn’t want to pay for transgender members of the military to have surgeries. Few were actually asking to do this. Trump’s staff said they would have a meeting on the issue, but then Trump Tweeted that he would not allow anyone transgender to serve in the military. The White House then claimed this decision had been done after consultation with Secretary of Defense James Mattis, but that wasn’t true and just cover for Trump’s Tweet. The courts ended up overturning the ban, something that could have been avoided if Trump had followed what his staff wanted to do. Trump also would flip back and forth on issues, and had no apparent memory for things that he had said before. The Muller investigation also unhinged the president. When Muller was first appointed Trump got so mad that his economic adviser Cohn said the White House was incapacitated for weeks. All Trump could think about was Muller and he wouldn’t listen to anyone or do anything until his temper had subsided. Trump would also go off on rants and make rash decisions based upon what he saw on TV. For instance, his chief of staff Kelly suggested his deputy Kelly Nielsen succeed him as Homeland Security Secretary. Trump agreed, but when she was criticized on Fox News he changed his mind. Kelly was eventually able to get the president to back Nielsen, but it showed how Trump could suddenly change his opinion due to the media. The way Trump’s staff tried to deal with the president’s ever changing attitudes was to say they would look into a matter, but do nothing. At the extreme, they would take papers off his desk that they thought were bad policy so Trump wouldn’t sign them.<br/><br/>Next came the administration. Priebus and his successor as chief of staff John Kelly tried to impose rules and order on how things were done such as organizing meetings, policy papers being written and delivered to them, controlling who would see the president, etc. None of what they tried work. For example, the White House authorized an investigation into China stealing intellectual property rights. When this was finished, the U.S. could impose tariffs upon Beijing and would likely have many allies in Europe and other areas that would join the U.S. in pressuring China. Then trade advisor Peter Navarro and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross walked into Trump’s office and got him to sign an order authorizing steel and aluminum tariffs, that no one else in the White House knew about. This overturned the whole process that was planned with the investigation and building up allies against China. Trump’s daughter Ivanka and son in law Jarod Kushner would also walk in and out of meetings uninvited, and make suggestions to their father without consulting with anyone. That in a nut shell is how the Trump administration works. Various people can come into the Oval Office or call Trump and get him to do things without consultations with any others.<br/><br/>Trump’s abrasive style and lack of knowledge about the government also led some of his top staff to want to quit. Secretary of State Tillerson said Trump didn’t understand foreign policy or the military and was mad at how he constantly denigrated generals saying they didn’t know anything. Trump ended up firing Tillerson via a Tweet without telling anyone including the Secretary of State beforehand. National Security Adviser McMaster wanted to quit over many of the same issues, and eventually resigned. Trump would deride McMaster as well saying he wasn't a businessman, he didn’t know cost benefit analysis, and used his experience in Iraq against him. Chief economic adviser Cohn quit after Trump’s comments on the racist rally in Charlottesville where he said there were good people on both sides. Cohn confronted him over that and Trump went on a tirade attacking Cohn’s wife and then Cohn. Cohn agreed to stay on until the tax cut bill was finished, but then left.<br/><br/>Fear also does a good job explaining Trump’s world view. Having come from a business background Trump saw almost everything in terms of money. He thought the main priority of the U.S. government should be making a profit. That didn’t work on many issues however. For example, in general Trump did not believe in any of the longstanding U.S. alliances like NATO or allies such as South Korea. On the latter Trump would constantly focus upon two issues. First, the U.S. had a trade deficit, and second the U.S. had a large military presence there. Trump said both made America lose money and he was against both. He even asked why the U.S. had an alliance with South Korea to begin with, wanted to end a free trade agreement with the country and withdraw U.S. forces. His national security staff had to constantly remind him that South Korea was necessary to deal with North Korea that was expanding its nuclear program. At one meeting Defense Secretary Mattis even said that South Korea was necessary to stop World War III. Trump would constantly complain about the relationship anyways. Another example was that Trump said the goal of the U.S. military should be making money, and would constantly criticize generals for not thinking about that. He said the U.S. should take all the precious minerals from Afghanistan even though it wasn’t profitable and once refused to sign an order on Libyan policy saying that America should grab its oil. This idea also explains why Trump is against all trade agreements, is imposing tariffs, and is opposed to things like NATO because he believes they cost the U.S. money. This split much of his cabinet right down the middle as there were plenty who supported trade, and others who didn’t. His views would lead to constant turmoil with his staff, and represents a rather crass and amoral vision of how the United States should act.<br/><br/>The book also highlights that Trump has an anachronistic view of the American economy. One of Trump’s main beliefs is that tariffs can return jobs, mostly in factories to the United States. This is never going to happen. The U.S. economy is now based upon services and hi-tech. The advances in technology also mean that the factories that are in the United States only employ a fraction of the people they once did. Several of Trump’s advisers like Cohn tried to explain to him that the economy he is attempting to revive hasn’t existed in America for 30 years, but he dismissed them. Part of Trump’s base is white working class voters who have gone through huge dislocations, job and salaries losses with deindustrialization. He’s thinking about these people with some of his decisions on trade, but trying to move the economy backwards is not going to be a successful solution to what they have gone through.<br/><br/>Overall, this book is highly recommended. It might not be the most exciting read as Woodward has a rather bland style. He also skips from subject to subject within each chapter, so for example, you can’t find just one or two chapters on Trump’s trade policy or on Afghanistan, those topics are spread throughout the entire book. The main take away is that it helps a reader explain why Trump does things. If he goes on a rant on Twitter, it’s probably because he saw something on TV. If he has a presser and says all kinds of wild stuff it’s because he’s freelancing, which he likes to do, and he doesn’t know what he’s talking about because he hasn’t listened to any briefings, and that will leads to all kinds of contradictory statements.
 The prologue alone shows a President who believes that a trade agreement with South Korea (KORUS) which produces an $18B trade deficit and costs $3.5B a year for US troops is worth scrapping even though this action would jeopardize a capability to recognize an ICBM launch aimed at Los Angeles within 7 seconds for missiles that could strike the target in 38 minutes. The termination letter was repeatedly stolen or delayed by staff, including Trumps top economic adviser Gary Cohn, the former president of Goldman Sachs and Secretary of Defense, Marine general James Mattis, who recognized the insanity for what it was. But Trump promptly forgot about the letter drafts. Repeatedly.<br/><br/>Other notable Trumpisms: Deny, deny, deny.  Belief in Fear as the only cardinal rule in wielding power. He loves chaos.<br/><br/>Best Woodward book yet, plenty of detail, easy to read, chronological order of events helpful.
 While Mr. Woodward has had his critics over his long career, it's pretty clear the legendary reporter sticks to journalistic rules and produces accurate material. I've read quite a few of the author's works including All the President's Men, The Last Days, Bush at War, Obama's Wars, Shadow, The Brethren, and Maestro. In the sphere of politics 'Fear' is the most disturbing. Even though President George W. Bush was not exactly the most inquisitive critical-thinking person to hold the job, President Foghorn Trump Leghorn truly is a league of his own in the brainless self-delusion department. The blood drained from my face after reading the first few pages of Mr. Woodward's work.<br/><br/>'Fear' skims over events starting right after the Republican convention and ignores most of the weird actions taken by President Leghorn. The author's book focuses on the atmosphere of working in Trump's administration. It's clear the guy is neither intelligent, emotionally stable, nor capable of admitting when he is mistaken. 'Fear' repeatedly shows he has the attention span of a caffeinated spider monkey and does not even have a rudimentary understanding of how government or the world works. It also shows how the lump is an unabashed pathological liar. Certain individuals get more page time than others. Steve Bannon, Chief of Staffs John Kelly and Reince Priebus, National Security Adviser H. R. McMaster, Staff Secretary Rob Porter, Secretary of Defense James Mattis, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, and Trump’s attorney John Dowd are the ones that come to mind. I was surprised how much time was spent on South Carolina's Senator Lindsey Graham relationship with Trump. There are plenty of other cameos but the book focuses on important events such as his desire to disband NATO, pull out of South Korea and the Afghanistan War, scrap the Iran nuclear deal, Syria's civil war, Middle East relations, the firing of FBI James Comey, North Korea's nuclear program, the Charlotteville's White Nationalist rally, and of course, the Mueller investigation. Trump's trade wars were aggressively pushed by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and some economist outlier named Peter Navarro who Trump is one step from asking for his hand in marriage. Such things as Fox News's influence on Trump, how Jared and Ivanka work in the White House, and President Leghorn's notorious tweets are touched upon. The book avoids getting into too much wonkish detail about the specifics of an issue. It also includes 16 pages of colored photos.<br/><br/>'Fear' is easily Mr. Woodward's most disturbing book. It is a fair-minded work where the author even comes to the defense of Trump in a few instances. It also includes quite a bit of profanity. Heck, I'm not sure if Steve Bannon can utter a complete sentence without the f-bomb when he's not in front of a camera. I would strongly suggest also reading Pulitzer-Prize-Winning reporter David Cay Johnston’s ‘The Making of Donald Trump’ for a more detailed dissection of the guy’s mindset when Trump was a businessman and celebrity huckster. Woodward's book does its job of giving the reader a good idea of how Trump's White House works. It is not normal, it is not even remotely healthy, and it should make you worry. Someone hold me. I’m scared.
 I have probably read every book that Bob Woodward has ever written, and this one seems thrown together more quickly than others.  This is probably because Woodward felt the need to get it out before it became "stale", meaning that events that occur after the publication of the book may diminish its impact on today's political discourse.<br/><br/>I think that this book measures up with every other Woodward book, other than All the President's Men, but for one thing--  it ends very abruptly, with the President's personal counsel resigning because he cannot talk the President out of testifying to the Special Counsel's Office.  The problem is that in real life, the narrative keeps going on--  we don't know where this will end, and it seems like a very artificial end to the Trump as President narrative.<br/><br/>If the book kept going through Trump's term, however long it lasts, the book would probably make a more graceful or natural ending.  I think it's highly relevant and it paints a very unflattering picture of the President that is probably well earned, but the public would have been better served by a book that took another six months to write/publish.
 Politics aside, what emerges from this book is the clear fact that Trump is not qualified to be president. He fails at the most basic functions of the job. People who despise his policies should take some comfort in that Trump's inability to execute as president means that he has delivered very little that he promised before the election. However all Americans should be terrified that only through backdoor actions by his staff have we been saved from his ignorance and incompetence which could cause economic melt-down, war or even worse.<br/>I don't give the book five stars because it is uneven and the narrative is choppy. The basic reporting, however, is rock solid.
 I started reading this book with reasonably high expectations.  I believe that Bob Woodward may be one of the last true journalists there are and I trust his information.  I also decided to read this book as an Anti-Trump, to try to see if I could learn something about the individual, or come to some understanding that might help me be more open-minded in my assessment of him.  My opinion of Trump has not changed, but my frustration turned to melencholy over the kind of man we have in the White House.  I came to appreciate that Trump is a very smart person, but that intelligence is often "wasted" for lack of a better word.  His character flaws and his ego often keep him from reasonable decision making, and seeking guidance even in areas where he knows he might need it.  At first, I found myself starting to understand and empathize with some of the issues I had been critical about, but as the book continued it was truly hard to maintain that level of understanding.  By the end of the book, the reports on the activities, decision-making, etc., seemed quite repetitive as the pattern of behavior is the same regardless of the issue at hand.  All in all, this was an interesting book written by a talented journalist, but in the end, there was nothing new.
 This was definitely a page-turner.  I actually found myself appreciating and understanding some of the Trump administration key figures much better than I did prior to reading the book. It also shows Donald Trump as a much more empathetic person than I initially would've thought deserved.  I also like how it openly displays Lindsey Graham's hypocritical side. The South Korean comment he made was...Wow. And does he use all that colorful talk in church? My guess is not. As for Woodward's portrayal of Trump being unintelligent and lacking the ability to lead this country - that was spot on and we see that daily in his words and action. Quotes by him and actions initiated by him as relayed in the book should make everyone extremely concerned for our country.
 I just finished this book and pleased to award it five stars.  It is an in-depth, behind-the-scenes look at the President from the latter stages of the campaign look until his first year and a half as the 45th President of the United States.<br/>The author has tried to distill a series of interviews into a series of monographs depicting the president’s approach to leadership of the campaign and subsequently the country.<br/>It serves as an insightful look into the inner working of power.<br/>Whether one likes the president or not, one has to admit the decision to focus on key states to garner enough electoral college votes represented a great strategic move.<br/>Depending on one’s point of view, one can condemn or praise the president on his approach toward making decisions.<br/>The author has performed a masterful job of depicting key events and allowing the reader to arrive at his or her conclusions.<br/>I highly recommend it.<br/>Five stars.
 The book is fantastic I won't deny it.  It starts out very strong giving you a window into the incompetence, stupidity, and recklessness of Trump.  If he would only just listen to his more moderate advisers he would be a much more effective POTUS but that is just not Trump's style.  The man is a walking, talking cluster f$%k who has the attention span of a 3 year old and the comprehension level of someone that had half his brain wasted on crack for the last 30 years.  I suppose in some ways we should be grateful that the white house is so dysfunctional.  As it is they have managed to cause a humanitarian crisis at the border, brought us to the brink of nuclear war, and roil global supply chains and financial markets with misguided tariffs.  The latter may be what undoes him at the end.  Most though certainly not all Americans couldn't care less about the trauma of separating mother and child at the border, or the fact that children have died from neglect in federal custody, or that they have been traumatized, orphaned, or even abused and raped.  None of that matters to half of the American electorate because they don't see immigrants as people but rather as animals.  However, if you mess with their financial livelihood or their ability to sell products, make an income, or purchasing power then all bets are off!  In the end Trump's asinine, ancient, and misguided views on trade will be what breaks the back of his administration!<br/><br/>I can't really say there are any heros in this story but there are some who stand out more honorably than others.  Jim Mattis is the shining star of the bunch by a long shot.  The man is a ramrod straight military man unwilling to follow illegal and criminal orders from Trump or anyone else.  Surprisingly, his mild manner style at avoiding confrontation when dealing with Trump makes him the most effective of his advisers.  Gary Cohn would be the other person who I feel comes off quite well in the narrative.  A distant third would be Jim Kelly.  My view of Kelly has gotten worse since 2017 because I now can see the hostility he has for many of those illegal immigrants and the DACA recipients.  But I do not think Kelly is a racist certainly not in the same vein as Miller, Bannon, Sessions and many of the other immigration hawks in the white house.  Surprisingly Rob Porter comes across as a reasonable force in the white house.  By far the most destructive agents in the book are Stephen Miller, Steve Bannon, Jeff Sessions, Peter Navarro and Wilbur Ross.  These guys make up a toxic witches brew of racist, misogynist, and obsolete economics ideology.  If they are ever able to gain complete influence over Trump it will be a friggin disaster!<br/><br/>The reason I give the book four stars instead of five is because I think Bob Woodward ended it too hastily.  Near the end of the narrative he just seems to be rushing through the special counsel investigation, how it came about, what the interactions were between Dowd, Mueller and Quarles (his number two).  I admit the picture he paints of Dowd and Sekulow acting out in front of Mueller and Quarles the mock interview with the president using Sekulow as a stand in for Trump was hilarious.  It is clear Dowd and Sekulow think Trump is a bonafide moron and I would agree with them.  They say without any ambiguity that Trump is an F'ING LIAR!  Maybe the book ended this way because Woodward knew how sensitive Trump is about the Mueller probe and didn't want the full weight of the federal government coming after him.  Or maybe it's just because Bob Mueller runs a very airtight investigation and there just isn't any information available.  Either way you are definitely left feeling sort of empty in the end. Like there wasn't a thorough exposition of the whole sordid Trump/Russia affair!  I still like the book and have no problems recommending it for others!
 As politicians have said when interviewed when “Fear” came out, there's really nothing surprising about the individual facts and character traits we learn in this book. The power of this book is in the context it provides as we see how Trump – supposedly shocked in having been elected President – tries to rise to the occasion to do what is thought to be the most difficult job in the world.<br/><br/>Woodward’s genius is in the way he identifies and organizes the “scenes” of his book. The flow is generally chronological as we see Trump feeling optimistic that he can do this job but slowly realizing (and failing to admit) that it is beyond him. The details could have quickly overcome readers, but Woodward wisely limits the cast of characters to only the key players – Trump, Bannon, Cohn, Priebus, Kelly, Mathis, Tillerson, McMaster and Porter. We hear little from bit players like Sarah, Kellyanne, Sean or Anthony, and even Pence, Jared, Ivanka or Donald Jr. rarely appear. Having set up this conflict, we then follow how each character tries but fails to work with Trump. It really is the Apprentice come to life.<br/><br/>And this makes for great drama. We see Trump at first realizing he needs counsel and the experts whom he chooses to surround himself with, gradually convincing himself (and them) that he can rely on the instincts and beliefs he’s always used to run his business. As this happens, those experts gradually withdraw until we end up with the situation we hear about every night in the media. That is really the strength and purpose of this book. The things Trump says, does and tweets are increasingly shocking, but “Fear” tells us how we got to this point.<br/><br/>Perhaps only Woodward (and perhaps Bernstein) could have put this book together like this. Where Watergate and “All the President’s Men” was very much a detective story, “Fear” is a psychological thriller with the plot playing out and being documented nightly in the media in plain sight. It also seems strategic and compelling that Woodward would drop this book right at this time … 7 weeks before the mid-terms as everyone anxiously awaits Mueller’s findings. This is not just a book. It’s a frantic call to action.<br/><br/>I went into this read very much a Trump-hater and at first this book gave me more ammunition for hating him further. But, as you read through these chapters, you start to see how we got here. Trump probably really believed he could be successful in this job. But the question is … Could any expert politician or expert leader really be successful? The issues he addresses – the Middle East, North Korea, Afghanistan, Iran, terrorism – much less the issues he creates – tariffs, NAFTA, trade agreements, relationships with our Allies and with our adversaries – seem almost unsolvable. Could even Abraham Lincoln navigate through this quandary?<br/><br/>I had just read a book called “Factfulness,” which was inspirational. Its message was optimistic … that the world is experiencing unrelenting progress with problems being solved at an unbelievable pace. “Fear” left me more depressed and wondering whether our international and national problems can ever be solved. We can only hope, based on the adage that it’s always darkest before the dawn.
 I will not be able to get a good night sleep until....
 First,  “Fear” is an interesting behind the scenes description of how Trump’s White House works, in 42 chapters, 357 pages.  It is mostly chronological, essentially beginning just after the eelction and ending February, 2018.  It is a rather quick read with a fair amount of dialog.  For those who have kept up with the news since mid-2016, there will not be many new incidents, but what is likely to grab your attention is a good bit more detail on how all the players interact with each other, how decisions are made, and how they are implemented – and not implemented.<br/><br/>Secondly, When advanced copies of the book were released about a week before the pub date, it seemed that all the papers and news stations could focus on was “idiot”, “moron”, and a few other inflammatory asides, an unintentional (?) disservice to the book.  There is no fire here, nor fury. Rather, “Fear” is a fair, balanced look at U.S. leadership, 2017.  Some successes, too many failures.  None of which should come as a big surprise to anyone.<br/><br/>Thirdly, Sources. In twenty-eight pages of Source Notes, Woodward prefaces each chapter’s notes with: “The information in this chapter comes primarily from multiple deep background interviews with firsthand sources.”  There are many one-on-one conversations between staff and Trump that are quoted in the book, and we know that Trump was not interviewed for the book, so… Interesting to keep that in mind when reading “Fear”.  One last point re sources and “Fear” - not all of the focus all the time is on Trump.  There is a huge supporting cast here, including Kelly, Bannon, Priebus, Cohn, Porter, Conway, Graham, Tillerson, Hicks, Ivanka, Jared, Dowd, McMaster, Sessions, Pompeo, Mattis, Pence, Mnuchin and Navarro.  Some come off much better than others, and some don’t.  Yes, “Fear” changed my perception of several of these players, some for the better, some for the worse.  More on that below.<br/><br/>Now, for a bit more detail.  In the first 20% of the book, Bannon and to a lesser degree, Conway, play significant roles.  Manafort seems to have done little of significance during his brief term as campaign manager except worry about his personal finances.  With only weeks to go before the election the “grab her by the …..” tape explodes, and some suggest Trump quit the race.  Bannon elbows everyone aside and takes over the campaign, still seeing hope,  feeling strongly that Clinton is very beatable.  He describes her as “joyless”, coming across as too practiced and with a poorly focused campaign (no mention of the economy, stupid).  These and a few other comments are the best analyses of Clinton and her mismanaged campaign that I have read, including Clinton’s own “What Happened”.  Trump is elected and Bannon (literally) and Conway (figuratively) disappear. And replaced by a host of others.<br/><br/>One of the more entertaining passages appears soon after, the hiring of Gary Cohn, former CEO of Goldman Sachs.  They meet for the first time and Trump is impressed.  He suggests a deputy position though he isn’t clear on the duties vis-à-vis an assistant, deputy assistant etc., nor which department so he asks Cohn what department he wants.  Cohn makes it clear that he is not interested in a deputy anything and he expects a cabinet position.  Trump suggests Treasury, despite the fact that Mnuchin is in the room and was recently offered that job.  I will leave the “what happens next” for you to discover.<br/><br/>There are a number of passages that deal with educating the new president.  Not all of the attempts were successful.  Early on, Cohn tries to explain money, specifically the US deficit.  He gives a quick overview of bonds, interest rate impacts, growth, debt ceilings, etc.  Trump asks “why not just print money?”  Cohn explains the costs of printing money and its impacts on economic factors.  At the end of the session, Trump comes back again and again to printing money.  On other issues, specifically trade deficits and tariffs, the White House was somewhat split.  Wilbur Ross and Peter Navarro pushed for tariffs while Mnuchin, Porter, and Cohn were opposed.  Trump ended one meeting recognizing a strong case had been made for free trade but acknowledging that though he couldn’t make a counter argument, he liked tariffs, and he wasn’t going to change his mind.<br/><br/>On occasion, Woodward reveals a softer side to the President.  Trump was genuinely moved by the cruel deaths of the youngest victims of the Syrian gas attack.  He was also very upset at attending a service at Dover AFB, greeting the remains of a fallen hero.  He spoke at some length with on the phone with surviving family members, adding his own, somewhat made-up but much appreciated personal comments to the prepared notes in front of him.<br/><br/>“Fear” covers an incredible first year of a presidency, filled with daily “breaking news” and “distractions.  Woodward has done an excellent job of choosing critical events, and in most cases adding a good bit more to what we may have heard on news broadcasts or read in the paper…..or Facebook, or….. I felt he also did an excellent job of choosing the supporting characters upon whom he focused.  There were many passages starring Cohn, Mattis, and most surprising to me, Rob Porter.  Until I read “Fear” I dismissed Porter as somewhat of an errand guy, a paper shuffler.  When he left the White House, I was a bit stunned to learn that he was Harvard grad, Harvard Law School grad, and Rhodes Scholar – and a bit of a White House Radar O’Reilly, the guy who gets things done and keeps the boss out of trouble.  To a lesser extent, I was impressed a bit by Reince Priebus, while unsuited for the Chief of Staff job,  occasionally and at some critical junctures, a peace-maker.  In my view, Tillerson and McMaster do not come off as well as I expected; based on what I read here I would characterize their contributions as a good bit less than what I expected and had concluded even upon their terminations.  Similarly, there are some White House big names with relatively few mentions, which of course can be both good and bad news for them.  In that group I would include John Kelly, Conway, Ivanka, Pence and the three to six communications directors over the period.  Read the book and come up with your own slotting.<br/><br/>I recommend “Fear” highly, regardless of the reader’s politics.  I hope there will be a Fear 2018 (but I don’t want to go further than that).
 Very disapointing. One has the feeling this is the rough draft of the first chapter of a book. It certainly does not deliver on the strong strong statements woodword made in order to promote the book. You get very elaborate records of one on one discussions between key figures around trump and trump himself (pretty obvious who the source is and surprise surprice, the source presents itself in a positive light). But these recordsare not connected with any bigger picture. I read the book and had not the feeling i got a new idea or fact.
 There is little new news in this book (except for a harrowing account of how close Trump came to declaring war with North Korea, with no understanding of the ramifications of doing so!), but Woodward is every much the historian that Doris Kearns Goodwin is writing about past presidents, and this book is an alive blow-by-blow meticulous record that will be studied by students who have not yet been born—if we live to see that future. (I am not usually a history buff, so sometimes the details become overwhelming; but I made the choice to be a student when I read both Doris Kearns Goodwin and this book, and that choice has me applauding the value of the detail for posterity.)<br/><br/>There is nothing mean-spirited about this book. Everybody is presented at times sympathetically—even Trump in his albeit fleeting upset about the chemical-weapons-killed babies in Syria; Jared and Ivanka (who have a miniscule role in this book) come across on the side of DACA kids and the Paris Climate Accord; advisor Rob Porter is heroic in slow-walking terrible orders from Trump; Lindsay Graham is a great deal-maker willing to find ways to make sane things happen; General McMaster tries so hard to do a good job. And this even-handedness highlights the horror of the chaos—everybody is working against each other, undercutting somebody else, running around secretly to “save the world” or “fight for the president.” The horror of this book is that our president has no understanding of truth and has evoked absolute pandemonium in the White House and subsequently all over the world, creating problems where none existed—in trade, in immigration, etc.<br/><br/>For me the value of this book is to better see the whole story, which for some reason makes it both more and less horrifying. It is an alarming story that will result in either the destruction of the world (via WWIII) by a child president who is incapable of learning or understanding the consequences of his hyperbole, or the activation of all of us who love the planet and want peace.

 Some damaging gossipy style content but on the whole not a lot new in the book that we didn’t already know from other reports.  Maybe the fact that staff are taking memos off of Trump’s desk to keep him from signing them.
 Excellent, factual, loaded with backup. What Bob Woodward says is correct, Trump, this White House, and you can throw in the Republican Congress, are waging a war on truth.  Also Trump is so scared that the Mueller investigation is going to discover his corrupt background that it rules everything that he does, every decision he makes. Fear an apt title.
 Author is trustworthy. Subject and defenders of subject not.
 There's no other way to describe it. Fear. As I was reading, I was once again reminded of so many troubling details about this president, that you don't know where to begin. But I can tell you this: It's hard to believe that this man is running our country. I genuinely fear for our kids in the future. The fact that this man has the nuclear code is frightening, not gonna lie.<br/>Seems to me, the MOST genuine concern that he has, is making money. It's so much about what can we get out of other  countries. All you can do is shake your head with each chapter. Which ISN'T fake news by the way, as we have ALL seen and heard the proof in front of our eyes. Making fun of a General, watching tv for HOURS at a time, the sophomoric behavior, (or fifth grade level) just blows my mind.<br/>Voting HAS to be a priority in the midterms. Two more years? I hope we survive it. Not being dramatic, as I sincerely mean it. Definitely taps into his psyche. Hard to sleep after thinking of it all.......... Vote!
 Woodward is undoubtedly a great writer. But I can't say this book was great. Many things I already knew though this provided deeper insight. What I liked about it was the impartial way it was written. This is an accounting of what transpired. Woodward doesn't offer opinion or slant. I'm left feeling less optimistic than when I started the book a few days ago. This is a presidency that should never have happened.
 I’ve read Woodward’s books on sitting presidents and eagerly anticipated reading this one, especially!  What a let down, I had to drag my ass thru this book hoping it would gain momentum, I was looking for more context, more passion, more Woodward like queasy-making details.  I think he’s headed for the green pastures, definitely won’t be another one of his #1 best sellers, save your money!
 Woodward clearly wishes to portray Trump as a scary, out of control, illiterate man.  However, the disagreements among cabinet members and Trump's own firm viewpoints only made me feel comforted.  I'm glad the President has such a wide range of voices on foreign policy, tariffs and trade, immigration  etc.  It is much better to have inner disputes than to suffer groupthink and have another Bay of Pigs or Iraq War.  Good job Trump and team and shame on Woodward for framing disagreement as chaos.
 I really wanted to give FEAR a five-star review. I did. But FEAR deeply disappointed me.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong — there is much to like in FEAR. Woodward is famous for his scrupulous assembly of details and verifying sources. That is evident here. The book provides insights into Trump's temperament and impulsive behavior while at the same time portraying a complex man who could often show more compassion than is usually reported. Woodward also demonstrated how Trump could be easily manipulated by those around him or what he last saw on Fox News. There were plenty of accounts of Trump's impulsive behavior and the dangers it poses to his administration, the nation, and the world. Those are the strengths of FEAR.<br/><br/>That said, this is a book that felt rushed to publication. History often needs time for the dust of events to settle, for all the witnesses to come forward, for all the facts to be known. It is impossible to write such a book in the midst of the ever-changing events surrounding Trump's tempestuous presidency, and on this point alone the book falls woefully short.<br/><br/>The book also glosses over the biggest story of all: the Mueller investigation. We gain little real insight into the truths of the investigation and the book was published before the convictions and testimony agreements of key witnesses such as Paul Manafort, whose accounts could dramatically change its outcome. We only see the investigation through the eyes of Trump attorney John Dowd and not from any other points of view. This is a disservice to the reader and as a result, misses the most important story of the Trump presidency.<br/><br/>Woodward never looked into the issues of immigration in any depth nor that of the new tax law that could have a profound impact on the nation's economic future. He is critical of the Steele Dossier as being shoddy research. What Woodward either does not understand or chooses not to is that the Steele Dossier was never meant to be a finished report of intelligence but rather a compilation of raw intelligence reports, something that Steele made clear in the Dossier itself. Woodward dismissed the Dossier because many intelligence sources could not be independently verified, but human intelligence (HUMINT) does not work this way, something that many intelligence experts have publicly stated. In so doing, Woodward has badly maligned Steele's work and reputation despite facts and evidence from different sources and successful prosecution vindicating many of the Dossier's key assertions.<br/><br/>Fully understanding Trump, his chaotic presidency, and possible guilt on myriad potential crimes will take time. It is a vast subject, one too big for any one book. There are other books dealing with the various facets of Trump, his life, his presidency, and his endless trove of misdeeds, particularly Russia, that do a far better job of reporting than FEAR. Perhaps the best way to gain a definitive view of Trump and whether he is guilty of the crimes many ascribe to him is to read a collective body of work, not just this one book. The brief chapters in FEAR felt rushed even though the breadth of topics in it is vast. Woodward's reliance on too few key sources gives us only one side of the story. His is a book that would have been far more effective had the author waited for five, even ten years to research, interview, compile, and write a definitive text.<br/><br/>I'm a big fan of Bob Woodward. He has done the world a great service with his journalism. Sadly, I am left deeply disappointed with FEAR. It was like watching a once lights-out All-Star starting pitcher in the twilight of a great career, a pitcher whose once devastating curve ball now only serves up home runs.<br/><br/>FEAR is worth reading. But I would urge you to complement Woodward's book with others that will tell the story of Donald Trump in broader detail, and in this case, often better than this renowned author. It saddens me to say that. But it's the truth.
 I could not put this one down, every fact, every detail about how Donald Trump became president, from the people who encourages him or people who are working  for him but trying to keep United States safe from his erratic behavior, this book brings light on issues we Americans cannot ignore. We need to stop sleep walking and wake up, anything can happen in a split second, and we all need to be aware, because this effects each and every one of us in some shape, way, or form.<br/> I highly recommend this book to even his supporters, I encourage you to have an open mind and try to understand some pressing issues we americans have to deal with together.
 Really gives insight on the dumpster fire that is the Trump presidency. The most incompetent man to occupy the office.
 This book did not instill any fears in me--it confirmed my fears. I defy anyone to lay their head down in peace at night knowing what is going in the White House right now. Thank you, Mr. Woodward, for continuing your important work. May America, and the world, survive the Trump residency.
 What I found most interesting was Woodward's account of the decision making process in the Trump administration. While the media is constantly generating content about this presidency, Woodward's account follows the developments we have all witnessed through inside accounts and first hand opinions. If you thought Fire and Fury was too gossip column then this is a much better choice
 I was eager to read this book, having enjoyed Woodward's prior work. But in Fear, the author suffocates a good story in an avalanche of details -- dates, measurements, facts, numbers. At no point does he even tell a story, really. For example, on page 91, he starts discussing North Korea. I plowed thru that chapter and then the more interesting (to me) one about Afghanistan. Then lo and behold, on page 177 we're back in North Korea, retreading much of the same ground that was covered in the earlier chapter. Woodward is so scrupulously fair that he doesn't even mention the incendiary tweets about "little rocket man." In other words, to my extremely pedestrian mind, this is not so much a book as an appendix to what should be a rip-roaring, rollicking story. I doubt I'll finish it.
 I've read several of Bob Woodward's books: "All the President's Men," "Obama's War."  This one is one of Woodward's most explosives.  Woodward is a very thorough investigative reporter and writes accordingly.  This translates into the narrative, which is often lacking quotation marks (to show that what the person said is paraphrased.)  Because this is a largely dialogue-driven book, I found switching to the audio version more engaging.<br/><br/>Not much new is revealed in this book, which begins before Trump's presidential campaign.  What Woodward shows in the beginning is how Steve Bannon took control of Trump's campaign tactics.  The Trump campaign was unsure that he would win.  But by the fourth chapter, Woodward gets to the election results and true chaos begins.  Just figuring out who would get what cabinet position was a mystery, although Trump wanted successful business leaders.  Soon after his inauguration, Trump learns that Pakistan will be his worst adversary (as Obama learned), but that North Korea and Iran would also cause his agony.<br/><br/>Trump's hatred toward the Clintons and the Obama administration also comes through.  But that's nothing new.  But what is perhaps less known is SecState Tillerson's tension with National Security Advisor McMaster (Tillerson was fired in March 2018 and McMaster resigned) and the many other tensions between staff members.  There were a lot of alpha men in Trump's White House!  Another topic that comes up a lot is Trump's insistence on getting rid of free trade and adding tariffs when his advisors repeatedly told them both were bad for the US economy.  One surprise is how frustrated Trump got with his former generals who were now in his cabinet, who were always worried about national security and safety while Trump focused more on money and the cost for that safety and security.  Trump's dislike for South Korean leader Moon Jae-In also comes to light toward the end, in Chapter 40.<br/><br/>My interest peeked with the start of Chapter 17, when Trump realizes that Robert Mueller is now in charge of the Russia Collusion investigation.  Trump went livid, and Woodward reveals why.  This explains the current tension between Trump and Mueller.  By August 2017 Woodward quotes several of the White House staffers as Trump having come "unhinged," especially after the Charlottesville, VA riots.<br/><br/>Most of the people in this book are no longer in office.  They either resigned or were fired.  Trump's temper comes through, his quick use of the "F" word, his disrespect toward women, and even his treatment toward his daughter (whom he knows is a moderate Democrat).<br/><br/>But despite the portrayal of Trump in this narrative, one positive that Woodward gives Trump credit for is Trump's insistence on not to start another war with any of our adversaries.  He will rant and rave, insult leaders on Twitter and cooerce them to make certain deals, but he's quite afraid of starting a war anywhere where US troops' lives are at stake.  That is one trait I like about Trump.
 This book is yeoman work.  It is a story carefully pieced together based largely on information gathered through an extensive interview process.  It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to discern that Steve Bannon and Lindsey Graham talked extensively to Woodward.  Woodward clearly knows how to get people to talk.  His job is made easier by the fact that Bannon loves to talk and to revel in what he feels is his own (largely imagined) eruditeness. (If you want to get a feel for what Bannon is like, Anne McElvoy has an excellent interview with him done on a Sep 20, 2018 Economist podcast.)  Similarly Lindsey Graham also loves to talk, but is a bit more circumspect in his remarks than Bannon.  So with some interviewees, like the latter two, Woodward’s challenge becomes how do you separate the wheat from the chaff.  In other words, how do you know that the person being interviewed is not embellishing what actually happened as a way to establish his or her own importance, real or imagined?  Part of the answer is that you talk to as many people as you can in an attempt to get a clearer picture.  Woodward does exactly that and that is why this is book has a definite ring of truth.<br/><br/>Early on Bannon very effectively capsulizes the strategy used to secure the electoral vote and the Presidency for Trump.  Bannon states that he told Trump “ ... We’re gonna simplify this campaign.  She (Hillary) is the tribune of a corrupt and incompetent status quo of elites who are comfortable managing the decline.  You’re the tribune of the forgotten man who wants to make America great again. ... “ That strategy worked.<br/><br/>It is also important to note that Woodward does try to factor in some of the problems Trump inherited like the stalemate in Afghanistan and the failure of Obama’s strategy there.  To his credit Trump wanted to get us out of Afghanistan, but had no success.  The entrenched bureauracy beat him down.<br/><br/>Although there are no major surprises in the book some fascinating discussions are recounted.  One such is between Jeff Sessions and Bannon:<br/><br/>  “Is there any doubt in your mind on the 9th, when it was called (the election), that it was the hand?”  Bannon asked, dipping into a shared religious belief system.  “That divine providence that worked through Trump to win this?”<br/>  “No,” Sessions said.<br/>  ....<br/>  “It was the hand of God, right?  You and I were there.  We know there’s no other way it could’ve happened than the hand of God.”<br/>  ....<br/>  Bannon said.  You’re never going to quit are you?<br/>  ....<br/>  “You promise me you’ll never quit?”<br/><br/>Okay, enough spoilers.  I have three major takeaways:<br/>1. Trump is isolated and basically — although he would never admit it — lonely.<br/>2. Trump has a very, very limited attention span.<br/>3. Trump is an ******* liar AND he cannot keep track of his lies.  Therein may well lay his downfall.<br/><br/>This is an incredible book and Woodward has done a superb job of putting it together.
 For the past 2yrs I have felt as though I have been trapped in a Mel Brooks movie gone horribly wrong.  Back in the 80s, the notion of Donald Trump as POTUS would have been great material for a Mel Brooks film.  However, as is the case with Sam Beckett's genre of "Theater of the absurd" the real thing is never as much fun.<br/><br/>Bob Woodward &amp; Carl Bernstein were instrumental in bringing down Nixon as they disinterred the deep plot behind the Watergate scandal.  I can only hope that Woodward will be as integral to bringing down the current administration as well.  It should come as no surprise that Woodward describes a Whitehouse that is as chaotic on the inside as it appears to be on the outside.  People who are fans of a mix of nihilism, arrogance, ignorance and sincere disregard for rule of law will find the present book appealing.  For the rest of us, it's downright scary.<br/><br/>Mel Brooks movies always have an ending.  At this point, nobody knows how this administration will end....or if there will be anyone left alive to observe the end of it.  When a buffoon has the power in his nimble mind to bring an end to the human race, it's a rather sobering thought.  In any case, my hope is that this movie will be cut short via impeachment.  Or, Trump can follow in the footsteps of Nixon &amp; resign in disgrace.  If you wonder why people like me get worried in the wee hours of the morning.....read this book &amp; it will demonstrate the premise behind our apprehensions.
 This well sourced book describes incidents and actions taken in the Whitehouse.  It does not give value judgements - only straight facts.  I tells us all the things we have been hearing in the news and provides context and background for each.<br/><br/>Oddly, I finished reading it with sympathy for President Trump.  He has probably always had ADD, but, having gone to a private school, it wasn't properly addressed.  For that reason, he seems to be missing the high school education that the rest of us have had.  When combined with narcissism and possibly some kind of dementia, the result is lethal.<br/><br/>Part of the result is constant conflict with the people who need to educate him.  Add to that, that those who surround him have diametrically opposed ideas about how to save the country, and the nation is genuinely in danger.  This is not actually poor Mr. Trump's fault.  It is the fault of two different kinds of people.  One set is the kind of person we all know who say, "They are all crooks, and we should get rid of the whole Washington establishment."  The others are the ones who say that, as long as they get deregulation and the Supreme Court, nothing else matters.<br/><br/>So, what I am saying is that the book made me unexpectedly sympathetic to a president who is completely underwater.  I would like to see  more sympathy to him and more thinking on the part of the voters.
 Wow! So much more than publicized
 I found this book really hard to read, not because I didn't understand it, but because I was continually dumbfounded that this man was elected as our President.  I have voted in every election since I was able to and even thought not every time did the candidate that I supported win, I never before felt the constant anxiety I do now.  I don't know how Bob Woodward got these people talking, but if that doesn't scare you I am not what does.  Its not just Trumps inability to tell the truth, and there are plenty of examples, but I also question the people in power who support him, greed definitely over country.  Maybe this all needed to happen to shed a much needed light to show the corruption of the government?  Defiantly a wake up call, a must read.
 The book is so poorly edited that it is often hard to read.  " . . . and Kathy Shelton, who, when she was 12, alleged that Hillary had smeared her while defending her client, who allegedly had raped Shelton."  So Kathy alleged a smear when she was 12?  Uh, no.  Why in the world wouldn't you put the "when she was 12" at the end?  Hillary smeared Kathy while defending Kathy's client?  Just bad.<br/><br/>Several instances where language that had to be quotes is not in quotation marks, even if right after quoted language:<br/><br/>"Donald, Donald, Donald," Giuliani said. "You've got to do this." Think about the suburban moms.<br/><br/>Why isn't "Think about the suburban moms" in quotes?  Surely, that's what Giuliani said to Trump, not what Woodward is saying to the reader.<br/><br/>Informative, but very sloppy.
 I knew he was a sociopath and far from a genius prior to reading this book. However, I never anticipated that I would be googling terms such as: signs of being mentally challenged, IQ scale how low is too low, and what is the I.Q of the average 2nd grader.<br/><br/>James Mattis said, "He had the understanding of a 5th- or 6th grader." Mattis is a generous man. After reading the entire book, I think that could actually be a compliment.<br/><br/>I would put his ability to use logic and reason closer to a child between 3-4 years old, with the emotional maturity between 18 months-3 years.<br/><br/>If an 8 year old displayed his lack of ability to: reason, order his thoughts in a sequence, understand basic facts, understand cause and effect, and learn, they would be sent for an evaluation. Doctors would want to rule out a psychiatric disorder or an intellectual disability.<br/><br/>This is like the episode of Arrested Development where Michael falls in love with Rita- a mentally challenged woman- and has no idea.
 I almost made it halfway through the book, feeling that as an American citizen I am morally obligated to know what goes on in the Oval office. Also I am curious about the president one-third of our country still supports. But the vulgarities and adolescent vocabulary of Trump, Bannon and others make it difficult for me to continue reading about the "leaders" of our country. I run an after-school nonprofit music program for children and youth. Many of the people who frequent the Oval office would be expelled from our organization for use of vulgarities and failure to treat others with dignity and respect. I understand that Woodward wanted to give an accurate picture of Trump's character, but I think he could have made his point just as well with fewer vulgarities.
 This book is a must read for anyone who cares about saving our democracy from the chaos, corruption and yes, possible treason, of the current occupant of the White House.  Mr. Woodward's reputation for well researched and accurate journalism continues with his latest book "Fear".  Even with Mr. Woodward's usual measured approach, anyone with any sense will be horrified by the workings of the current administration, and their disrespect for our Institutions, and the Rule of Law.
 I am giving this book five stars because it is well written by a much respected writer who wrote a critically acclaimed book that helped take down Richard Nixon. We have a madman at the helm of our democracy who has maintained a mysterious enchantment over about half of our population. So Trump is not the entire problem, but he is symptomatic of it.<br/><br/>There was nothing in this book that I had not heard before. I am an MSNBC News junkie, an addiction that was born upon me the first time I heard Trump was running for President. Day after day I watched Trump break all the laws and ethical norms wondering how this manic tornado would not be stopped by some collective heros’ actions.<br/><br/>I believe this book may be the nation’s tipping point.<br/><br/>The Chinese symbol for Chaos is danger and opportunity. I believe the up coming mid term elections will be our reawakening of our democracy.
 I have read the Comey and Wolff books too, which I felt were more entertaining.  This book is written in a rather dry matter of fact just the facts voice.  I believe the narrative.  (Woodward with the solid reputation so that people would feel comfortable talking with, and heck, about a third of the book is footnotes.)  My opinion is it is just frightening that someone who is a political/government/history "moron" is in that position.  I hope rational independents and moderates absorb some of this horror and vote democrats for federal positions in the November elections.
 Woodward's writing skills as an investigative journalist are top notch. And they continue with this writing. Lots of things revealed in this book were substantiation of what most readers have known about the WH occupant. What is truly staggering and most revealing are the weak, spineless, sycophant cult, formerly known as the Republican party,  that encourages the fool in the WH by allowing him to do things that they know are just wrong. Tip toeing around because they fear his temper, tirades and petty vindictiveness is tantamount to dereliction of duty. It is truly eye-opening to say the least.
 Too much dialog that couldn't possibly have been recorded, although it all seems to "ring true." I would have preferred statements like "Roughly, this was generally what was said as reported to me by those present." This would have made a lot of it seem different from fiction. But the bottom line is that Woodward describes Trump exactly the same as I would after the last couple of years of his outright lies, his tweets, speaking appearances, and stupid decisions. Weird and scary and stupid lies.
 There are a lot of shock journalism books out there, but this isn't one of them. This is journalism at its finest by one of America's great journalist over decades. While this isn't shock journalism, this book certainly doesn't lack for shocking information. In this book, you get a look inside Trump operations. You will see both sides of the goings on, and you can choose what you think is best for America. My only advice is, don't read it before going to bed. 1) It's a page turner that will keep you up later than you want; 2) It will scare the bejeezus out of you.
 This book has given me a much better understanding of the cast of characters that have been dominating our American Life for the past few years.  From Manafort's twitter account faux pas (bottom of p. 20) to Bannon's "Island of Misfit Toys" (his term at the bottom of p. 47), every page is cringeworthy.  I'm actually reading with a highlighter as I did when reading textbooks in college.  Unfortunately, the description of the chaotic nature of the Trump White House is not surprising, but it's interesting (?) to learn some of the specifics.  Lord have mercy.
 A brief, fact-filled inside look at an initially disorganized, impulse-driven executive branch whose controller is a blustering, always angry attention deficit disordered man, but one who is shrewd, in control, and has a plan to build a world that reflects his own vanity and wealth. Disjointed and unfocused, like the administration itself, the book isn't a pleasant read, and the undoing of so many critical global alliances, the uncompromisingly stubborn economic, immigration, environmental, and foreign policy positions in the face of indisputable facts, makes for a fearful outlook on what future this country will have. It's all you've heard of, but worse, because it's real. When will the rest of us overcome this guy's "base" and overturn him and his corrupt cronies? His lies and corruption are part of his very fabric, which is made so clear here. But don't underestimate him. His vision of the world is being realized, and for that he is something of a genius, but a perverted one.
 A very disturbing book about a very disturbed President.  America and the world is in a dangerous place now with a dangerous man in the White House.
 There were a couple of surprises in the book. Most we had already heard over the last year and a half. Trump should not<br/> be in the white house. The only reason he is still there is because republicans are aiding and abetting him. If our country<br/> survives this they should be held accountable.
 Read All the President's Men and saw the film when it came out. Woodward has done it again, but this time the politics are different in the GOP. Woodward's style is objective but not detached. Any claims of fake news are refuted by all the footnotes at the end. Hoping that everyone, no matter their political opinions, reads this book to consider what is happening in the White House and how it has affected this country.<br/><br/>One burning question I was left with. Did Trump really use the word, "bushwhacked" because that was the only part I had a hard time believing!
 Woodward writes a well researched, highly detailed account of what Tom Clancy called a “clear and present danger”. The horrifying reality is that the danger is in fact the current President, and we could only wish it was just a nightmare the country could wake up from, but sadly, its all too real.
 If you aren't a news follower, read this book because it will bring you up to speed on the MANY, MANY issues and shortfalls of the 45th POTUS, his administration and the many cast of characters that were and are complicit in the current decay and undermining of our democracy.<br/><br/>If on the other hand, you've been paying attention these past 2 years, you already know 99% of this book (other than a handful of harsh but accurate descriptions of 45). That said, well worth the read and a nice addition to your home library as a cautionary tale to the grand kids on the tragedy of what can occur if we all don't do our homework and duty and VOTE INTELLIGENTLY.
 When you pick up a Bob Woodward book, there are some things that never change: (1) It will be boring. Woodward writes more for the historical record than for readers. He wants to get the facts right so he will be quoted in the future as the most reputable source. He doesn't speculate or entertain. (2) You will respect his book more than the work of sensationalist writers who are out to stun us with gossip. But it is slow going. (3) You don't have to commit yourself to finishing the book. There is no horrifying conclusion. If you skip around and read chapters that interest you that may be enough. While Woodward portrays Trump as a jerk, he also offers some glimpses of a softer side of his personality. I was surprised. You may come to respect the intellect and advice of Trump's lawyers. Also a surprise. If you are not a political junkie, this is not the book for you. You have to love the minutia of politics - and law - to get into it and to stay in. Since I am a political junkie, I savored every vignette.
 Other than the teasers released shortly before the book went live, there is very little new in this book. Every day of the trump adm. is like Groundhog Day over and over and over.  trump is ignorant about all things foreign and domestic and seems determined to keep it that way. He is very much like a toddler who throws tantrums until he gets what he wants, no mater whether it’s true or not or in the best interest of the country. There are very few who will actually challenge him. The two people who come off the best are Cohn and Porter. Cohn resigned in disgust and Porter was forced out because of violence against his ex-wives. The last third of the book is about trump’s lawyer, John Dowd, who, despite overwhelming evidence that trump is a liar, is determined to save trump from trump. So much for the American people. I couldn’t wait for the book to end because it was like being trapped in a room with an obnoxious child.
 This is a very disappointing book. I admire Woodward but this book is not one of his best. Almost every incident in the book has already been covered in the news. The writing is just terrible and there are many details and factoids that are never pulled together into any kind of coherent narrative. If you are thinking of reading Fear you already loathe Trump because people who like Trump don't read. So just keep on hating Trump and donate the purchase price of this book to a progressive candidate for office.
 The prose is uninspired–one review I read called it “wooden.” I’d agree. The book seems hastily thrown together. In addition:<br/><br/>It’s advertised as being 400 pages long, but is really only about half of that. Notes, acknowledgements, index, and other back matter make up about 40% of the total.<br/><br/>Woodward surfs through choppy waters avoiding the sharks and shoals, but never plunges into the depths. People who are obvious sources come off well (Porter, Bannon, Priebus, Lindsey Graham), while others who didn’t speak with the author fade into the wallpaper. There’s almost nothing about Kushner or Pence, for example.<br/><br/>There are huge holes in the story. Woodward takes up a theme, pursues it for awhile, and then moves on to something else without bringing it to a satisfying close. For example, he begins following the story of Kim Jong-un’s and Trump’s mutual belligerence but cuts off in the middle. Very little said about Putin and/or Trump’s various quarrels with the leaders of Canada or Germany or Mexico. Not a single mention of Puerto Rico or the various corruption scandals. Rob Porter features prominently but virtually nothing about his inglorious exit from the White House.
 The book is written in a journalistic style, very familiar if you have read Woodward’s previous books. The chapters are short, but each one emphasizes the dangerous personality of the man in the Oval Office. Each member of the staff learns about Trump’s habits of lying, refusing to change his mind, disinterest in examining any issue in depth, making outrageous demands, and being very difficult to work with.<br/><br/>  As I read it, I found myself dismayed and frightened that the American people had chosen such a totally incompetent leader. I only pray that the midterm elections will bring a Congress that can provide some control and prevent a looming disaster. Trump reminds me of some totally uninformed jerk who spouts off nonsense from the next barstool.
 The most discussed subject of this book is what he tells us or confirms about Donald Trump. But there is a lot more to this book. Among other things:<br/>1. We learn more about Chief of Staff Kelly. He is an enigma. On the one hand, he is described as saying some very very negative things about Trump. But yet he stands up for him from time to time and does not seem to forcefully speak out with his own views. He is described as having a hot temper and hair trigger. His previous assistant says Kelly is not a detail guy, you have 30 seconds to talk to him and "never put more than one page in front of him."<br/>2. Mattis comes through as the adult in the room who, unlike Cohn, expresses his views in a calm but forceful manner.<br/>3.  Bannon may have been fired but he remains a very important influence on what Trump says or does, partly because his protege Miller is in the White House.<br/>4.  Mueller is not exactly described in a flattering way, primarily because the description primarily comes from Trump's former attorney, Dowd. What surprised me is the fact that, according to Dowd,  Mueller gave Dowd a list of 16 topics they wanted to ask Trump about. "Nearly all dealt with Flynn, Comey or Sessions." There has been more than a little speculation that Mueller has some potentially devastating information about Trump that has not been made public. There is no indication from Dowd's comments that this is the case.<br/><br/>Some commentators have suggested that Trump has a brilliant strategic plan behind his imposition of tariffs. If so, it does not come across in the book. Instead, Trump's comments to Cohn seem to indicate that Trump has the simplistic view that all the goods that are made in China and shipped here can be made here.<br/><br/>The book does nothing to dispel concerns about Trump. In fact, it increases these fears.
 While there appears to be no surprises about Trump, the insights into the inside conflicts around him present a frightening picture.  Trump is who he is...a pathetic, insecure little boy.  He made no effort to hide his flaws from us during the campaign and does not hide his flaws now.  That task falls to those people around him.  He cannot abide being told "no.". So the role of the cabinet and White House staff to keep the president informed has to be subordinated to the need to protect him and the nation from himself.  This is an administration which appears doomed to failure.<br/><br/>The book provides explanation for many of the troubling things we see regularly in the news reports.<br/><br/>I would have liked to have more information about those who have and who continue to put forward Trump's lies.  Why have they not resigned?
 A number of Trumps' supporters disparaged the previous books written about his ineptness as President.  They claimed the books were written by authors who had agendas and in some cases, they may have been correct.<br/>However, Bob Woodward could well be one of our most respected investigative reporters, one who has to my knowledge never admitted his political leanings.  I recall a number of times when he appeared on talk shows that he revealed information not flattering to the Democrats.<br/>His credentials have never been questioned so this book, which I just completed, can well be used as a history book detailing our current political state.<br/>The picture he draws of a person sitting in the oval office, the most powerful individual in the world, is frightening.<br/>As described in the book, his lack of knowledge of the most elementary issues, his manner of speaking, his lack of any attention span, and his treatment of his staff and cabinet members, all of whom he appointed should be an embarrassment to every citizen.  I've lived through a number of Presidents and while I may not have agreed with all of their policies, nevertheless I respected them all and was proud when they represented me while visiting other countries.<br/>When this President goes overseas I hold tight to my armrest, fearful of what words will be uttered.<br/>I am not one of those so-called flaming liberals.  My politics lean to the right and recently visiting the Reagan library in Simi Valley, Ca. I couldn't help but think that President Reagan made me feel so proud to be an American.  Then I drive home and reality sets in seeing who occupies that hallowed office today and I feel sad.
 I have not read any previous biographies about Donald Trump, but because this was by a journalist I trust to be factual, I bought this one.  It is well written, but not a quick, easy read for certain. There is a great deal to digest, and I found myself switching back and forth to fiction. BUT, I do believe, no matter which side you're on, this book likely gives us the most clear, and truthful, insight into Donald Trump's manner of running the country, his personality and how he treats his staff. It's troubling, to be sure, but we already knew that.  This is a book that needs to be read, whether you believe there's a problem or not.  It's fair.  I expected it to be all negative, but it seemed to stick to the facts, and the reader can determine if this is how we want our country led.
 "Fear" is probably the best book I've read on the lunatic sitting behind the desk in the Oval office. Woodward describes what sounds more like a lunatic asylum than the Executive branch of the US government. Trump's malignant narcissism has damaged everything he touches. His "SWAMP" is even worse the one he said he was going "to drain." He's moved in lobbyists and men who want nothing more than to disassemble protections which took decades to put in place (and more money for polluters and law breakers of all stripes.) His appointees, who are running US agencies, have no agendas except to demolish the very agencies they're supposed to head. Trump is a malignant narcissist and unfit to serve. He's so busy raking in more and more money for his "family" while the republicans sit back and cheer him on, completely ignoring the prohibitions of the emoluments clauses, which he's been doing since the day he took office. He's cheered on racists and white supremicists; he's made hatred the name of his game; he's created internment camps for CHILDREN, where they are being separated from their families, lost, drugged, and otherwise abused. He's diverted FEMA money to ICE, which he has turned into the closest thing to Nazi "brown shirts" that we've seen since Hitler's Germany. He's abused and turned our allies into enemies while cozying up to our REAL enemies - like his good buddy Putin, whose interference and hacking got him into office in the first place.He's cheered on police brutality.
 There are tons of reviews but I wanted to mention that I had read 60% of the book and suddenly I was into endnotes, acknowledgments, a few pictures and a comprehensive index. The book ended abruptly with the resigning of Dowd and I still had 2 hours to read. It didn't seem like I was at an ending. I thought the book hadn't entirely downloaded since I had 40% more pages to go. So I called Amazon to complain and we went through it and indeed the last 40% was the above. We had a good laugh about my mistake and the last sentence as well. A conclusion of sorts in four well chosen words.  Sort of left you hanging there. So be aware. I guess he shouldn't have done a traditional THE END when the content was done.<br/><br/>I liked that the book taught me a lot about how a government normally runs, not that things shouldn't change from time to time. But I basically got GOV 101 which maybe Trump should have signed up for. I now understand why we are messing around in various parts of the world and why, for instance we got into Afghanistan, why we can't just quit like we did in Viet Nam and why we also can never win and may be there for a long time. I understand how the economy works and why free trade is important, why allies matter (well everyone understands that) and also a lot about the political infighting amongst people that we voted for in the Senate and House and the fact that they really don't care about any of us - just their political futures. I don't care if you are rich, poor or in the middle class - THEY DONT CARE ABOUT any of us once they are elected. We need to wake up and smell the coffee. The book seemed very factual, well researched and really wasn't a "dish" except for the same things everyone has been saying all along. This President isn't qualified in any way to be leading the currently No 1 country.  And there isn't very much we can do about it, other than get out and vote. There are many in the Executive office who are trying to keep the status quo until things change for the better. Overall, I thought the book was fair - not a light read.
 I was quite disappointed by Woodward's book. There is very little in it that people don't already know from the news, and it seems that his coverage is limited by the people who were willing to talk to him, chiefly Steve Bannon, Gary Cohn, Rob Porter, and John Dowd. If you are looking for horror stories, you will find plenty of them. It is difficult to grasp just how shallow Trump is, or the extent of his malice. Nevertheless, there is not much here that is new.
 I’m not generally interested in biographies. I suppose it’s because I don’t find reading about how others live, or have lived a source of inspiration for me.<br/>This biography is different. This book is less about the President’s life in general then it is about his life, so far, in the White House. And, I found reading about that life very disturbing.<br/>The way I analyzed this read was to put myself in the role of President and determine how I would have responded to the issues that were put before the President. All of that was interesting to me. I’d opine that none of that would be interesting to any one else.<br/>I have no background in politics, but I have been in various supervisory positions in business attending to issues of what decision to make in a given situation.<br/>In my opinion there are three kinds of mangers: Those that make things happen; Those that watch things happen; and, those that ask “what happened?”<br/>My gut instinct is that President Trump fashions himself in the first category, but in reality is more in category two and perhaps more disturbing is willing to dabble in category three.<br/>I am familiar with Bob Woodward. I both read and watched “All The President’s Men”. I believe that along with Carl Bernstein, his investigation led to the downfall of the Nixon presidency.<br/>Typically, as a book reviewer, I start by saying that I don’t re tell the story line. I believe the author does a much better job of that than I could ever do. Present case, no exception. Bob Woodward has done a masterful job of that himself. Also, I prefer to analyze a read using various categories: plot, character development, rising/falling action, anti-climax and resolution. I do that in order to give other reviewers a different perspective on what they may expect from the read. In nutshell, there’s simply no way that type of analysis would work here. In preparation for this review I underlined passages I thought were particularly germane to what I wanted to focus on. I ended up with 84 underlined passages of text from the book, some as lengthy as half a page. There was simply no way I could incorporate any of that in this narrative as a book reviewer.<br/>I am writing this having not seen nor read any other reviewers' reviews. I don’t even know how many stars the book was given by others. As far as I am concerned, neither of the those seems relevant to me.<br/>I recognize that in finishing I must give the book x# of stars plus a caption for the narrative. I feel very inadequate doing either.<br/>All I feel I can offer is an opinion that the book was seminal in effort and off the chart otherwise. Truth truly is stranger than Fiction.
 Bob Woodward is the gold standard of Presidential journalism and has been for over 40 years.  When I heard that he had authored a book on Trump, I pre-ordered it as soon as possible because I was curious as to what he would have to say about the most controversial occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in my lifetime.  A few days before my copy arrived in the mail, Woodward published a recording of a conversation he had with President Trump in which the President lamented the publication of "another bad book."  Woodward defended his work by explaining that the book would be "tough but fair."<br/>  That is a good description of this meticulously detailed work.  Leaving aside my personal opinions about our President, what you get here is a picture of a man woefully unprepared for the job, floundering at times and at other moments relying on his own intuition.  Sometimes he gets something right and when he does, it works.  Most of the time he winds up in yelling matches with his subordinates because of his stubborn refusal to understand why things can't be done the way he wants them done.  If anything, you get a profound sympathy for everyone who works with this incredibly difficult, self-absorbed, and often mean-spirited chief executive.  No matter how much you do for the man, how far out on a limb you go for him, it seems he will cut you loose at the drop of a hat for no good reason.<br/>  Donald Trump is an incredibly polarizing figure.  Those who support him have a personal loyalty that is deep, strong, and at times irrational.  Those who hate him are convinced that he is an American Hitler in the flesh.  Who is right?  Ultimately, history will judge.  But in the meantime, Bob Woodward gives us an effective preview.<br/><br/>Lewis Smith, author of THE GNOSTIC LIBRARY
 If you've been following closely along with news over the past few years nothing in here will be completely shocking, (presumably because you have already been shocked ad-nausea by Trump and his administration).  None the less it is a compelling read.  Reads like a first person account inside The White House from various first person accounts.  My only disappointment with this book is that it ends after John Dowd's resignation.  The last chapter was actually the most riveting to me, and I just wish the events in the book went further in time.
 A substantive work, Fear comes as close as it is possible to get of an accurate account of the first eighteen months of the Trump presidency and key meetings, figures, rationales and observations.  It is extremely well-written and nicely organized in chapter form, so easily readable that even at four hundred pages I was taken aback when the book ended relatively abruptly.  I guess I was expecting it to continue right up until today!  Fire and Fury by Michael Wolfe was hastily written and without the feel of real journalism.  Fear has the gravitas that one would expect from one of journalism's giants.  And it is not a Trump hit job.  In fact, I found Trump to be more involved in important policy decisions than I would have imagined.  Yes, he's bullheaded, doesn't listen to anyone, is wholly self-centered and in way over his head, but at the times his instincts do prove correct Woodward lets it show.  And the central players are more fleshed out than we often get to see in the media.  Bannon is as you'd expect, but Gary Cohn and Rob Porter are shown to be smart and rather patriotic actors butting their heads up against Trump's biases and ignorance.  I only hope that Woodward writes another such book picking up where this one leaves off.
 "You're a f***ing liar," was the very last sentence of this salacious book.  It was a quote from former Trump lawyer John Dowd.<br/><br/>I'm no fan of reality TV or celebrity gossip but at times that's how this book seemed and I couldn't turn away.  The author Bob Woodward goes behind the scenes of the Trump presidency starting from when he was campaigning.  Quickly, you realize what a mess it all is.  As his chief of staff John Kelly was quoted saying:<br/><br/>"We're in crazytown."<br/><br/>This wasn't simply a book of Trump bashing.  In fact, I think Bob Woodward was just reporting.  More than just being a book of scintillating and scathing quotes it was a real look at Trump's policies.  From national security, to trade, to immigration, and tax reform you can read exactly where Trump stands on these issues and whether or not he's just taking the party line.<br/><br/>We not only find out more about Trump we find out more about Capitol Hill and how it operates (or at least how it operates under Trump).  Yes, at times it's juicy political gossip, but much of the book is very educational.  Whether you agree with the processes or not; whether you agree with the policies or not I think it's still good to know these processes and these policies.  For me, it made me a little more understanding of the divergent positions and certainly less rigid regarding opposing positions.<br/><br/>This is not just a Trump smear book, it's more in-depth than that.  Trump largely hurts himself with his statements and actions and the media is not to be blamed.  Maybe you feel as though the media shouldn't point out any of these glaring flaws--in that department I'd say you're on an island.  We've always been about transparency and this book makes Trump and his White House very transparent.
 Lots of quotation marks, no sources revealed, no revelations. If you hate Trump, you'll still hate Trump after reading this mess.
 Like many political books, I suspect a person's enjoyment is based on whether it conforms or challenges their current views.  A lot of the information in the book has appeared over time in other sources, such as articles, news items of leaks etc.  This, however, brings it together in a more coherent format, making it easier to look at the pieces.  While I would have liked a more chronological format, simply to help me make sense of the vast amount of crises and issues that come at us constantly from this mess of an administration, but the focus on so many of those issues was helpful.  Woodward's impeccability as a reporter with high integrity and professionalism makes this a good read and provides a lot of talking points for many years to come.
 I just finished reading "Fear Trump in the White House" - I took my time.<br/>Easy to read if a bit painful (like watching a slow motion train wreck).<br/>It is not at all written sensationally.<br/>It is entirely matter of fact reporting of specific (if defining) incidents at the White House.<br/>And extremely well documented as to time and circumstances of each event.<br/>Basically all the people in the White House spend all their time trying to prevent Trump from doing anything stupid and continually fail to be able to actually do so.<br/>Trump already knows everything he cares to know, takes advice from no one and immediately after saying he agrees with them Tweets out a response of exactly the opposite.<br/>He is an out of control Juggernaut and has absolutely no idea what he is doing.<br/>The Presidency would be in much better hands with the "Beverly Hillbillies".<br/>The continual lies and pressure produces incredible stress on all associated with Trump and results very quickly in burnout and defection as well as continual firings.<br/>I would not say the atmosphere is so much "Fear" as it is "Chaos" - unmitigatable, unstoppable and continuously growing chaos.<br/>Basically ultimately destructive to all involved.<br/>A better title would have been "Chaos, Trump in the White House".<br/>But then I suppose a fair number of Republicans have no idea what the word chaos actually means and it would be over their heads and there would go a significant portion of the reading audience - perhaps the ones who most need to read it - they won't of course, but it is a nice idea.<br/>The longer Trump continues as President, the closer we get to Apocalypse.
 Bob Woodward is one of our country's most thorough and insightful journalist.  Perhaps he is our reigning dean of journalists.  I remember during the Watergate years and I devoured his "All of The President's Men".  And an iconic movie version.  This is Woodward's 19th book.  It is compellingly written.  I believe it is a watershed book that takes us into a chaotic and dysfunctional presidency.  This is NOT about politics.  Nor were his Watergate books about policy.  This takes us into the character of Donald J. Trump.  And we see a man who is only about himself, who who lives by vengeance, who has no interest in reading or learning, who thrives in pitting people against each other, who is gleeful when he divides us, and who rules by fear.  In fact, Trump says "Power is Fear".  The book's title "Fear" is totally accurate. This is a painstakingly written book.  People around Trump are quoted and, to this day, none of any of those have really refuted Woodward.  The author captures the turmoil, the daily chaos, and the unwillingness of Trump to be guided or show empathy.  As always, Woodward has 25-30 pages at the end with complete footnotes.  It is an important book.  We all should read this and  be enraged and engaged.
 This detailed, well-sourced and fluid book should be read by all Americans in this time of political crisis and upheaval. Eminently respected Pulitzer prize-winning journalist Bob Woodward details the inner workings of the Trump White House during the first years of the administration.  He paints a stark, frightening portrait of chaos, dysfunction and blatant ignorance that threatens our national security, the global balance of power and the very fabric of our democracy. The events exposed in this book should give us all pause, and regardless of political persuasion, all critical thinking readers will find this novel thought-provoking and informative.
 easy to read but so dystopian you reread to verify that it was as you read it!.. each chapter is a short scene of day to day activities behind the daily headline . Senator Corker hit the nail on the head. We do not have a functioning White House but a barely functioning adult day care center. The terrifying thing is every chapter is footnoted to the max. Not one person employed by this administration comes off as an honest sane American except perhaps the secret service guardians. Even though Woodward writes very newspaper factual there is an underlying sense of fear that the American experiment is right at the cliff edge of death and the vultures are circling.
 To me, it seems that  America has one main challenge. It can generate growth but it cannot ensure that the country's citizens all get their fair share of the growing pie. Almost 63 million voters saw Donald Trump as the person who could fix this problem and generate more and more well-paid jobs for more Americans. The book does describe Donald Trump's unusual political and economic worldview according to which the main reasons for the challenges are to be found outside the country. Time will tell if he is right and if his approach will result in a better life for more Americans. The book also describes a person with an ego that may stand in the way. Maybe Donald Trump's biggest challenge is himself.
 OK, I hate The Dotard as much as Melanie, Tillerson, Kelly, Mattis, etc.  And in a perverse way it was kind of fun reading about just how stupid and ridiculous Dotard is, but then I stopped and thought wait - Dotard IS in charge, and just how screwed we all are.  I gave it four stars because it seemed to have been slapped together in too much a random way.  You'd get three paragraphs on subject/person X, then right into someone/something else.  Essentially each chapter is a series of anecdotes, some longer than others. It's not a big deal, and I can only imagine how hard it is to put something like together on the fly as S%&amp;T KEEPS HAPPENING, but it was the only flaw.
 In an effort to understand how a reality TV celebrity, who has been known for years to be a lying, amoral,  misogynistic, cheating,  media-grabbing, elite-wannabe, could be sitting at the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office in the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue, in Washington D.C., in this already-GREAT United States of America, I have read everything I can get my hands on, including Bob Woodward's  "Fear."<br/><br/>I think because of all the publicity that preceded the book, I was expecting too much, possibly more than Woodward wanted to give; I wanted more.<br/><br/>I'm not suggesting I didn't like the book. I enjoyed it very much. I particularly liked the chronological path the book took and the stories that made you feel you were in the room when an event was occurring, many of them cringe-worthy. (Oh, my! How did we get here?)<br/><br/>The hard work and research Woodward put into this book was extensive and I did learn a lot, but stopping this Trump White House story early in 2018 was very disappointing. I wish he would have waited until 2019 in order to complete at least two years of this administration. Now, at the end of 2020, Woodward will have to release Fear II.
 For sheer reading pleasure, Devil's Bargain by Joshua Green was a much better book. Woodward's book  is exceedingly well-researched and documented. It's just not that interesting, with one exception: the direct quotes of Tillerson, Mattis, Gary Cohen etc. about their exchanges with Trump, that  show the true extent of  the man's ignorance, are indelible.  Not just his inattention, his narcissism, his greed, his lying, his lack of loyalty or trustworthiness...but his utter and complete Ignorance. He's cagey, he's exploitative, he can spot weakness in others and put on a good show.  He is also erratic, incapable of critical thinking, unable to absorb new information, and lacks both empathy and self-control.  I've read everything  on Donald Trump going back 30 years, and watched him in real time. I would like to believe if  ordinary citizens who bought into the con job and voted for this dangerous fraud had known anything at all about him, they might have thought differently.  He has such a very long history of scamming everybody. Sadly, there are none so blind as those who will not see.
 To say I love this book is inaccurate because it really makes me realize how unstable our president is. I have total faith in Bob Woodward and he save our country once. I pray he can do it again.
 I expected a hatchet job, and lo and behold, I got a real education in foreign policy and basic economics.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised to see how many cabinet members and senators, whom I do not  normally agree with, were trying to do the right thing for all Americans.<br/><br/>Trump has his agenda...and believes in it. He is probably brilliant at some areas critical to being a good POTUS,  but he falls short in many others.<br/><br/>I even found some thing that I didn’t like about Obama.<br/><br/>But the main thesis is that Trump doesn’t listen...and on that, Woodward more than makes his case.<br/><br/>Poor everybody.
 This book is not a history but a chronicle of the Trump presidency.  The first question to be asked: is this book telling the truth or not?  Obviously it is.  Tillerson never denied his remark, others have said "non denial" denials, Bannon never denied all the reports in "Fire and Fury (a book in which he was, after Trump, the main character) and there are too many revelations, all to the same point, to be all false.  In addition Woodward has tapes, even the denials of Sara Sanders and Trump were very feeble.  The faults of the book?  Because it is partial chronicle many episodes are left out.  For instance what happened regarding the Trump tower meeting and the response of Trump is only partially reported, but I think that it is an important episode.  And the Muslim ban is not talked about.  Little he talks about the talks about DACA. So this "pick and choose" is problematic.  He also says that Trump lawyer thought that "Trump was a f.....g" liar but he does not tell us how he knows his thinking.  Finally, and this is my opinion and you may disagree, two people had a major role in the early days of the administration Steve Bannon and Hope Hicks, and they are barely mentioned.  In  essence, it is a truthful, incomplete, not overly analytic book.  Needless to say, the true character of Trump shows up in this book.
 In many ways, this book provides similar accounts of what has been reported elsewhere - Michael Woolf book and the NYT article.  The big difference is that Woodward - in his typical methodical way - articulates and specifies the issues associated with this presidency and how Trump's thinking play out in an in-depth, thoughtful manner and therefore, provides credibility in his story telling.  There is no doubt that he has the sources and this White House, today, is full of people who are so exasperated at what this incompetent president is doing and destroying this country.  Sad
 I was not very impressed with "Fear", and I don't think that this book will hold up over time as a good history of the times. I consider this book more of a "pop history" if that is even a category or genre of books. I also did not like Woodward's last book "The Price of Politics" for the same reason. Woodward's books "the brethren" and "The Final Days" are classics that hold up really well over time. I think the difference between "Fear" and his classics is that "fear" isn't particularly well-written. The book lacks a lot of context and transitions. It seems to skip from event to event without a continuous or ongoing narrative.  The book sort of ends abruptly, and again the reader is left without any context or true understanding. The book seems to rely a lot on interviews with Rob Porter and Gary Cohn, and their perspective is valuable and appreciated, but the book doesn't seem well rounded. I don't think Sean Spicer comes into the book until 2/3 of the way through (how can you have a book about Trump's first year in office without talking about Spicer in the first 100 pages?).<br/><br/>There is definitely new, interesting material in "Fear". But I guess I expect a book about the president or the presidency to be comprehensive and this definitely is not (and I understand it is only covering a limited time period). The book seems like a very long piece that would go in a newspaper as opposed to a  real "portrait" of the president or presidency. This book is just a piece of a portrait. In a few years someone will write something comprehensive that will stand the test of time- this isn't it. This book (like Michael Wolff's book was "rushed" to print to capitalize on the author's popularity and the president's shock value.  When i review Woodward's earlier works "The Final Days" or "The Breathern" I can't help but think that he should have taken more time with this book and done a more thorough job.
 It fleshes out more of what is going on and how precarious things really are. We clearly have a man who has so totally close-minded, narcissistic and arrogant that the country's future hangs in the balance daily.  I find it interesting that there is little of his girl Friday, Hope Hicks in here and lots on Porter, making me wonder how much is from her (and the same for the seemingly missing McGann).  Clearly Down and Woodward has a lot of long conversations; I find myself wondering at Dowd who professes Trump can't tell the truth but seems to believe he is innocent--does this mean Dowd is must incompetent and a dotard/confused, and that he believes the country is safe in the hands of such a man?
 I have always enjoyed seeing Bob Woodward as a guest on the Sunday morning political talk shows.  I found his latest book “Fear: Trump in the White House” an interesting yet disturbing read.  I applaud Mr. Woodward for his attention to detail and I commend those who collaborated  with him to provide the research necessary to compile such a book.  The disturbing side of the book is the fact that the sitting President of the United States came to office with no clue how government worked and refused to learn.  This book confirmed my doubts that Donald Trump is fit for office.  Trump’s ignorance, impulsiveness, attention deficit disorder, hostility, and vulgarity are far worse than I had ever feared.  I am ashamed to see such a morally bankrupt individual represent the highest elected office in America.
 This book is frightening.  Woodward is a very credible investigative journalist, and I remember Bernstein and him from the Watergate days.  Trump's wrath directed at absolutely anyone who says anything against him is extremely childish.  His emotional and mental instability, his erratic behavior, and his rhetoric are unlike anything I have seen in my almost 77 years.  Woodward has spoken about his detailed investigation into all of the allegations made by anyone because he wanted to ensure that the words were not just 'get even' or 'angry' stories about a very unlikeable man.  Along with the book "House of Trump; House of Putin", American have very good reasons to be afraid.  This is not about Democrats against Republicans, but about the destruction of America's values as a unified people.  The Republicans in my family are repulsed at what has become of their political party.  The Democrats need to step up their game as well.  We deserve what we have.  Now we need to fix the problems that are endemic in American society.
 After reading this book , there were really no surprises for me except for the last Chapter.<br/>The positives on the Trump Presidency are:<br/>Keeping his campaign promises is paramount for Trump.<br/>He had compassion for those people and children that were gassed and actually drew a red line and acted!<br/><br/>The negatives are :<br/>Everything I suspected are true!<br/>Trump is a liar!<br/>The White House is disorganized and chaotic and Trump loves it that way.<br/>Trump likes to see his staff pitted against each other.<br/>Has a short attention span - the one who screams F*** Y** the loudest gets the attention.<br/>Requires loyalty -100% but he gives 0% back<br/>Has ideas of male dominance from the 50’s<br/>Staff feel like his emotional maturity is that of a middle school student.<br/>Often determines political policy on who talks to him last.<br/>Doesn’t read but relies on gut feelings or personal relationships!<br/>Is a liar!<br/>Gets obsessed with TV - watching up to 8 hours a day<br/>The absolute surprise- the author
 He paints a picture of a President who is incapable of telling the truth, shows no loyalty to anyone but himself, is willing to gamble away our national security to carry out policies that conform with his uninformed worldview. As much damage as this Administration has done, we can take some comfort in the fact that the establishment has restrained him somewhat. This is one of the major reasons Bannon resigned, so we can only hope and pray that those around him will continue to keep us safe. After reading this book, I’m convinced more than ever that our duty as Americans is to nullify his and the GOP’s legislative agenda by flipping the House and the Senate.
 I have read every Woodward book but this is the most outstanding if sad review of our White House
 The lag between the time this book was written and when it was read seemed like a lifetime - so much has happened, so many characters have departed the White House, so much have we learned about the shenanigans there, so cynical have we become. At times, the book plodded along like a class report about some long ago war or scandal - interesting to know, but somehow not close enough to really do anything about it. And there were so many "it" moments - why did we get out of this treaty or play macho with that guy or snub another country? The personal foibles of the players have a startling effect on the standing of this country or the peace in the world or the economy. And the retelling of the goings-on in the White House (often depending on deep background) sound strangely disembodied from their TV persona. Is Ivanka really screaming? Or Wilbur Ross so adverse to everything Goldman/Cohn?<br/><br/>A head so much about this book, I anticipated so many revelations, I was disappointed in the slow, deliberate non-delivery of more.
 An excellent factual book about the incompetency and lack of morals of our president.  The title of the book should resonate with all people in the country, fear what could happen to our country because of a president who has no idea what he is doing and should be removed from office and the elected officials who will not stand up to him and do what's best for our country and protect its citizens from this insanity.
 Very thorough, but episodic. And, as usual, I could not keep the cast of characters straight. All the important stuff has already been reported, and NOW there are followups, so this book is really for history. If you are short of cash, you don't need to spend it on this.  I am not sending it back to Amazon but I will put it in as neighborhood book-exchange box as soon as possible so that somebody else can page through it.
 Parts can be a little dry, but the detail and picture it presents are alarming. Meticulous and as good an investigative book I have ever read. I now have context when following Trump. If you read this and do not vote, god help you.
 Could not stop reading this book. It was absolutely riveting and I completely lost track of time the way you do when you're reading a great book. I'd heard reports that the Trump White House was a shambles but I didn't realize it was as bad as this. We'll be lucky to survive the Trump years without being involved in a nuclear war. People like Mattis and Kelly simply must stay to be the adults in the room. Such a shame that McMaster and Tillerson are gone. Can't condone what Porter was accused of but he was one of the stars of this book as he worked hard to save the country from Trump. Every American should read this!
 I liked learning about the chaotic inner workings of the Trump White House. The book gave great insight into the various players, how they interacted with Trump and with each other. The book felt very disjointed though, and jumped from topic to topic with no clear organization of thoughts. I wonder if this was rushed to publication because even a simple mistake (captions for Ivanka’s and Bannon’s photos are swapped) wasn’t caught. It’s worth the read, but it could’ve been a lot better.
 There was little in this book that hasn't been covered in the news at one time or another.  Interesting and did put in perspective as to the various people, their former jobs before joining with Trump as well as what their positions were in the campaign and in the White House.  Also listed who was present for certain events  Worth reading but don't hold your breathe at learning anything you haven't already heard on one of the news networks or even late night talk shows.  Denials of many of the facts in this book are pointless as we have already heard the sound bites over and over  Trump's temper and name calling is well known.  Did not change my opinion one way or the other of most of the people mentioned in the book.  If one isn't well acquainted with the various people that have come and gone through the White House they would probably find it more enlightening.  Well written book.
 Reads like a crazy novel with Trump as terrifying villain no one can control - like a zombie lumbering around.<br/>Hugely entertaining.
 Bob Woodward has developed the reputation of being a truly reliable commentator on political life in America. This book clearly is proof of his expertise.<br/><br/>I did not find many totally unheard of accusations as most of what the book covers are issues that have been leaked over the course of several months prior to the release of "Fear". What the book did do was provide in depth background behind the leaks. Clearly the actions of the President prior to and following the release of "Fear" seem to reinforce most of what is covered in the book. Yes, there were a few things, heretofore unknown such as advisers secretly removing documents from the Presidents desk, but based on the total chaos in the White House, it makes complete sense and is quite believable.<br/><br/>In Woodward style, it is an easy read of a complex political quagmire yet it should very well instill fear into most Americans motivating them for change.
 This is one of those books that had a lot of hype but doesn't deliver. As other reviewers have said, it really reveals little that we didn't already know. It seems that the main sources for this book where Porter, Bannon, McMaster and Dowd. What I did find odd or perhaps less credible, is that he would include for example, a conversation between Dowd and Mueller. Obviously we know Mueller is not leaking these conversations, so it's from the perspective of Dowd.... much of it in quotes. Dowd comes off looking very good while Mueller comes off looking weak. That's what I object to ...we really don't know what happened in those conversations when it is just one-sided. Woodward does a lot of that in this book. He also skips over major issues or things that made it into the news. For example, he heavily depends on Porter's perspective but says virtually nothing about Porter's demise. Except to say that he resigned. Nothing about Kelly's role or his wanting to keep Porter on. The book is also incredibly disjointed, unfocused and surprisingly boring. He spends so much time on certain issues that it gets tiring and almost ignores others which should have gotten more play because they had a higher impact. He also seems to just jump off a cliff and then leave you hanging... not worth the money guys
 I don't like reading negative things about a current President. This is because of respect for our leader, no matter if I voted for him or not. However, I've become disillusioned, disappointed &amp; afraid (of WWIII &amp; of us being an isolated country &amp; hated by the World) in our most unpresidential President Trump, that I decided to read this account. Just my opinion, but earlier books on his Presidency seem rushed to print, premature (too early in his reign), full of typos, extremely poor grammar (did these authors get beyond the 4th grade?), full of self-hypocrisy &amp; one cannot get through them. I have just started to read this book &amp; it is thoughtfully written. With all that has been going on in the White House, I find this a book that is (sadly) believable. I am glad I got this one and can only hope the future brightens up quick for the USA under this President. Sorry - President Trump - as I have never ill-written about a President before in my life.
 I am not the most trusting sole when it time come to reporters and there species but having read all of Woodward’s books and followed his reporting, and noting his track record thought out the years I trust Woodward about has much as I can trust his reporting.<br/><br/>This is not a biography on Trump but rather pathetic story documenting his horrifying presidency.  To be honest there was little new information in this work I did not know having listened to many of the speeches this many has given and following his to twitter but the way the author articulates helps put it all together.<br/><br/>Yes folks, we have trouble here in River City and it spelled with a “T” and ends with a “P” and it if were not depressed and fearful for our country I most certainly am after reading this tale.
 While there are a few good insights in this account (among other things, this volume is an excellent study of the extent to which U.S. presidents can be thwarted by their staffs and appointees, as well as a chronicle of the profound dysfunction hobbling the Trump White House), Fear is a disjointed and unpleasant book-- characteristics it shares with the Trump administration.<br/><br/>1. The reporting is largely a series of disjointed anecdotes padded by mini-essays on recent history in American foreign policy.<br/>2. There is no protagonist, with the possible exception of defense attorney John Dowd, engaged to represent Trump during the Mueller investigation.  At the end of Fear, Dowd resigns, citing Trump's unwillingness to heed his legal strategy.<br/><br/>There are precious few adults in the Trump White House, and most of these are flawed. Gary Cohn, the brilliant former President of Goldman Sachs, is a superb economic analyst and financier, but proves largely interested in propping up the global economic establishment, rather than using his intellect and experience to benefit ordinary Americans. Early on, Cohn extolls the benefits of ballooning trade deficits and urges failing communities in the heartland to "reinvent" themselves-- a facile prescription at best. Rob Porter, the disciplined White House secretary who almost single-handedly imposes a semblance of order on a chaotic administration, is revealed as a wife beater.  Defense Secretary James Mattis, while astute, pragmatic and unflappable, nonetheless engages in ongoing palace intrigue with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.<br/><br/>The end result is an unsavory, poorly constructed and entirely dispiriting read that leaves the reader in need of a hot shower.  While much of this is due to the dysfunction embedded in the Trump presidency, Woodward's poorly organized and superficial narrative doesn't improve matters.
 Bob Woodward is a respected and seasoned  journalist. He has been around long enough that he knows to carefully choose what is important information and not rely simply on salacious gossip.<br/>I know that a few people mentioned in ‘Fear: Trump in the White House’ have taken issue with certain things but have otherwise refused to be more specific about what they object to, and Woodward stands by his research. It is important to be aware of this issue as you read the book to determine for yourself the credibility of Woodward’s work.<br/>For me, circumstances that have happened since the book was released only serve to confirm the veracity of the events covered in the book.<br/>It is a fascinating look into a chaotic and dysfunctional administration like the U.S. has never seen before. I will admit that I have never been a fan of Trump, so it shouldn’t be surprising that I looked forward to reading ‘Fear’, so keep in mind that Trumpers are generally not going to read and review it. My ‘fear’ of Trump as the most powerful man in the world was affirmed to a ‘T’. (I didn’t vote for Hillary, either, by the way, and I consider myself to be a conservative to moderate Independent, so my dislike of Trump has nothing to do with party lines). I was willing to read positive things about Trump, too, and there are a few places in the book where I suspended my dislike of him— but only for a moment.<br/>In my opinion, Bob Woodward’s book is as truthful of a picture as you are going to get about a person as polarizing as Trump. There were parts of the book that at times didn’t amount to a page-turner for me because it got a little bogged down in the tedious procedural part of politics, (but I read them anyway because it is germane to the subject matter) — hence, only four stars.<br/>This book is a portrait of a deeply flawed man who is willfully ignorant, power-hungry, boastful, a pathological liar, crude and almost completely unlikeable — a train wreck of a person, and for that reason I ultimately  couldn’t put it down.
 The title of this 2018 book by Bob Woodward comes from a statement made by Trump in a March 31, 2016 interview with Woodward and Robert Costa: “Real power is---I don’t even want to use the word---fear.’”<br/><br/>In the “Note to Readers,” he explains, “Interviews for this book were conducted under the journalist ground rule of ‘deep background.’ This means that all the information could be used but I would not say who provided it. The book is drawn from hundreds of hours of interviews with firsthand participants and witnesses to these events. Nearly all allowed me to tape-record our interviews… When I have attributed exact quotations, thoughts or conclusions to the participants, that information comes from the person, a colleague with direct knowledge, or from meeting notes, personal diaries, files and government or personal documents.”<br/><br/>He wrote in the Prologue, “Despite almost daily reports of chaos and discord in the White House, the public did not know how bad the internal situation actually was. Trump was always shifting, rarely fixed, erratic. He would get in a bad mood, something large or small would infuriate him, and he would say about the KORUS trade agreement, ‘We’re withdrawing today.’ But now there was the  withdrawal] letter…  Top economic adviser Gary] Cohn was worried Trump would sign the letter if he saw it… ‘I stole it off his desk,’ he later told an associate. ‘I wouldn’t let him see it. He’s never going to see that document. Got to protect the country.’ In the anarchy and disorder of the White House, and Trump’s mind, the president never noticed the missing letter… Cohn and  staff secretary Rob] Porter worked together to derail what they believed were Trump’s most impulsive and dangerous orders. That document and others like it just disappeared… It was no less than an administrative coup d’<br/>État, an undermining of the will of the president of the United States and his constitutional authority.” (Pg. xviii-xix)<br/><br/>He adds, “The reality was that the United States in 2017 was tethered t the words and actions of an emotionally overwrought, mercurial and unpredictable leader. Members of his staff had joined to purposefully block some of what they believed were the presidents most dangerous impulses. It was a nervous breakdown of the executive power of the most powerful country in the world.” (Pg. xxii)<br/><br/>In a briefing of Trump, “Cohn repeated… Interest rates were going to go up over the foreseeable future. I agree, Trump said. ‘We should just go borrow a lot of money right now, hold it, and then sell it and make money.’ Cohn was astounded at Trump’s lack of basic understanding. He tried to explain. If you as the federal government borrow money through issuing bonds, you are increasing the U.S. deficit. ‘What do you mean?’ Trump asked. ‘Just run the presses---print money.’ ‘You don’t get to do it that way,’ Cohn said. ‘We have huge deficits and they matter…’” (Pg. 56) Later, Woodward notes, “The president clung to an outdated view of America---locomotives, factories with huge smokestacks, workers busy on assembly lines.” (Pg. 137)<br/><br/>In a discussion about Afghanistan and the Taliban, “Trump began repeating a line he had hear at a meeting: ‘The way we’re going to win is to run an insurgency against the insurgency of the Taliban.’ Trump loved the idea of a renegade operation, a campaign that the establishment was sure no one could win…  Chief Strategist Stephen] Bannon  said], ‘We spent a trillion dollars to take the world’s best fighters… and turn them into the world’s worst army.’ Trump loved that also… They were trying to make policy on a string of one-sentence clichés.” (Pg. 127)<br/><br/>Ultimately, “Having failed in efforts to control or curtail the president’s tweeting,  Chief of Staff Reince] Priebus searched for a way to have practical impact. Since the tweets were often triggered by the president’s obsessive TV watching, he looked for ways to shut off the television. But television was Trump’s default activity. Sunday nights were often the worst. Trump would come back to the White House from the weekend at one of his golf resorts just in time to catch the political talk on his enemy networks, MSNBC and CNN… Trump had a giant TV going much of the time, alone in his bedroom with the clicker, the TiVo and his Twitter account. Priebus called the presidential bedroom … and the early mornings and dangerous Sunday nights ‘the witching hour.’” (Pg. 195) Later, he adds, “The tweets were not incidental to his presidency. They were central. He ordered printouts of his recent tweets that had received a high number of likes, 200,000 or more. He seemed to way to … find out whether success was tied to the subject, the language or simply the surprise that the president was weighing in. The most effective tweets were often the most shocking.” (Pg. 206-207)<br/><br/>After a meeting, “Cohn concluded that Trump was, in fact, going backwards. He had been more manageable the first months when he was a novice. For Priebus… he could see vividly that they had a fundamental problem of goal setting… The distrust in the room had been thick and corrosive. The atmosphere was primitive; everyone was ostensibly on the same side, but they had seemed suited up in battle armor, particularly the president. ‘This was what craziness was like,’ Priebus concluded.” (Pg. 225)<br/><br/>He notes, “Trump liked to do things spur of the moment, Porter concluded, to fly by the seat of his pants. He acted like doing too much advance preparation would diminish his skills in improvising. He did not want to be derailed by forethought. As if a plan would take away his power, his sixth sense. What the president would bring up in the morning most often was what he had seen on television, especially Fox News, or something from the newspapers he read more thoroughly than the public generally knew. Throughout the day Trump would seek opinions from anyone who might be around---from cabinet officials to security guards. It was his form of crowdsourcing.” (Pg. 231) Later, he adds, “During Trump’s first six months in the White House, few understood how much media he consumed. Trump didn’t show up for work until 11:00 in the morning. Many times he watched six to eight hours of television in a day.” (Pg. 299)<br/><br/>He points out, “Porter wondered if trying to repair any of those divisions after Charlottesville was almost a lost cause. There was no turning back. Trump had crossed the point of no return… There was so much fuel on that fire already, and Trump had added so much more…. It was not an almost permanent state of suspicion, disbelief and hostility. ‘It’s just all-out war now.’” (Pg. 252)<br/><br/>He points out, “The president often made decisions with only one or two or three people involved. There was no process for making and coordinating decision. Chaos and disorder were inadequate to describe the situation. It was a free-for-all… Trump had no understanding of how government functioned. At times he would just start drafting orders himself or dictating. The basic tactic Porter had employed from the Priebus days until now was to stall and delay, mention the legal roadblocks and occasionally lift the drafts from the Resolute Desk.” (Pg. 261-262) He adds, “Eventually Porter developed a routine and would bring in two to 10 decision memos for him to sign each day. Trump liked signing. It meant he was doing things…” (Pg. 263)<br/><br/>While meeting with his attorney John Dowd about former FBI Director James Comey and the Mueller investigation, “Trump was raging. Dowd worried that if he had been Mueller that Trump would probably have fired him on the spot. It was almost as if Trump were asking, ‘Why am I sitting here answering questions? I am the president of the United States!’” (Pg. 331)<br/><br/>Woodward concludes, “Some things were clear and many were not in such a complex, tangled investigation… Dowd believed that the president had not colluded with Russia or obstructed justice. But in the man and his presidency Dowd had seen the tragic flaw. In the political back-and-forth, the evasions, the denials, the tweeting, the obscuring, crying ‘Fake News,’ the indignation, Trump had one overriding problem that Dowd knew but could not bring himself to say to the president: ‘You’re a f_cking liar.’” (Pg. 357)<br/><br/>This is a well-written, very engaging, and vastly illuminating portrait of the Trump presidency, that will be “must reading” for anyone wanting “inside” information.
 What more can be said about this administration that has not already been said?  While I waited patiently for this book, bought it mainly because of the respect I have for Woodward, I was irritated at the talking heads on MSNBC and CNN giving away most of the book.  Luckily there are things in there that are not discussed previously.  Also, seeing the scenes unfold before your eyes is really interesting.  The bottom line is enough is enough.  Show us your tax returns, Muellar please finish up and give us an answer, and please someone bring respect back to the Oval office. Just getting tired of the nonstop nonsense. Thank you Bob Woodward for all of this work.  Please don't stop.  Get your partner back in interviewing mode again too.  This is worse than Watergate.  This is a national emergency!
 even if a fraction of this is accurate it is horrifying.  perhaps the surest signs of intelligence are the ability to admit you may not know everything, can be wrong and are open to other perspectives.  trump lacks every one of these traits.  his ego, entitlement and misguided vindictiveness are dangerous qualities for a commander in chief.  he only tolerates sycophants and "yes" men.  as this presidency unfolds and cornerstones of american governance are degraded and eroded we should all be concerned.  the trump base thinks he stands with them but he does not stand for anything; he just says what he thinks will capture their attention.  he identified a desire from the undereducated and underemployed to have a voice.  the ability to market and get votes should not be confused with the ability to lead ethically, effectively or intelligently.
 Bob Woodward clearly has some of the best (if not THE BEST) inside governmental resources of ANY person alive.  Extra-Terrestials like Rudy "cybersecurity" Giuliani, or Trump's/Bannon's/Duke's/Miller's unwashed masses, 'the barely literati' and 'the all-vanilla lemmings meringue" may reflexively  discard Woodward's sources (similar to Faux News or Sarah Huckleberry reflexively discarding facts and the truth); those of us who did not need to attend the Jethro Bodine Middle School for.the Middle Aged, however, believe and appreciate Woodward's truth-telling (and, further, believe his source material).<br/><br/>I've read five books about Trump and/or he and his administration since his electoral college win.  While the best and most compelling is "The Destruction of Hillary Clinton," by Susan Bordp, Woodward's book is magnificent!  His ability to take his contact's information and spin that 'straw' into chapter after chapter of golden prose is nothing less than outstanding and miraculous - particularly when he had a significant overabundance of material with which to work!<br/><br/>I believe he would have been better served if he wrote the book in a more linear fashion; while it may have seemed an impossible task to him, given the 'Cloud Cuckoo Land' nature of Trump's quotidian lies, tweets, tantrums and idiocy (ditto for Huckleberry), the greed and incompetence demonstrated by most of his cabinet members and his administration, the manure which flows out of ANYONE'S mouth in Trump's White House (someone in the White House vomit's out a lie's every 15 minutes...a cow patty Old Faifhful!), It was, notwithstanding, difficult sometimes to keep.up with characters, when they worked for candidate  Trump, when they worked for President Trump, when they worked for Impeachable Trump, what they were doing and when they were doing, some policy discussions/implementation/promulgation, etc.<br/><br/>All in all, an outstanding book and a terrific read!
 “Real power is—I don’t even want to use the word—fear.” Donald J. Trump<br/><br/>Bob Woodward’s book covers the campaign and first 19 months or so of the Trump presidency. While not a flattering book, it is also clearly not a hit-piece, as it showed a side of Trump and his confidants that was more altruistic and idealistic that I expected. It also provided a few examples of Trump’s more human side—genuine sorrow over the loss of soldiers, and anger at the killing of children in Syria. Nonetheless, even those ideals are riddled with a deep lack of understanding of how government works and the interconnected consequences of decisions. And any sorrow or empathy Trump shows for the death of a soldier or child is quickly swallowed by his narcissism and very unique relationship with the truth.
 President Donald Trump is mentally ill and therefore incompetent. We knew that,  but this proves just how bad he is and how much trouble as a country we are in. Who ever wrote the NYT anonymous letter is right on, there ARE hero’s in the White House keeping us safe at this time. Thank you to them and Mr Woodward for writing the book.
 When this current presidency began, I eagerly awaited Bob Woodward’s take on it.  I have read many of his insider views of several presidencies including his books on Watergate, the Clinton Whitehouse, and George W. Bush‘s war on Iraq.  All brilliantly showed his mastery of the craft of writing about insider politics.  I had expected much more from Fear, so I was surprised I found the book to be a bit of a letdown.  It was a little too disjointed and scattered for my taste, and sparsely detailed at times.  Yet, it provided a somewhat different perspective than Michael Wolff showed in his comparable book, Fire and Fury.  Woodward however has impeccable credentials as the consummate scribe of the insider view while Wolff was more suspect in his writing.  Woodward however presented a more balanced view not only showing a dysfunctional administration, but also showing president who is somewhat under siege from some members of his own administration who thwart his wishes.  Woodward’s shows their motives — fear of what his actions might do to our system.  Yet on the other hand, his book begs the question to what length should administration officials go to carry out the directives of the president, even when those directives are far from well-conceived or thought out.  Someone who favors this current administration will no-doubt find this book infuriating.  Those who oppose this administration will find the circumstances depicted in this book infuriating.  So Woodward has done his part to bring these two disparate groups to a common emotion, no mean feat in these divisive times.
 Bob Woodward has long been one of my journalist heroes. When he and Carl Bernstein wrote about the Watergate Scandal for The Washington Post they made history and won the Pulitzer Prize. After reading reviews for his new book, Fear, I knew it was a must read.<br/> The presidency of Donald J. Trump, a “businessman” who vowed to “drain the swamp” that was Washington, DC has been unlike any administration before. Woodward compiled information from a variety sources inside the turbulent White House.<br/> From the first quote in the book, Woodward captures the soul of Trump’s method of governing, fear. “Real power is – I don’t even want to use the word – fear.” He said this directly to the author and journalist Bob Costa on March 31, 2016, when he was one of the candidates for the office he now holds. Interestingly enough, Trump declined to be interviewed for the book. However, Woodward was able to speak with “firsthand participants and witnesses” to the events he recounts.<br/> The picture of the president Woodward presents is the portrait of a man who entered the Oval Office totally unprepared for the job of leading a world power. His temperament, which is volatile, is guided by his mood at the moment. Thin skinned, Trump is a prevaricator of the highest degree. Regularly contradicting himself, surrounding himself with yes-men and women who seem to fear his wrath, he drives the United States on a roller coaster ride of disasters.<br/> Trump’s admiration for dictators like Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korea’s Kim Jong-un while he insults world leaders from Germany, Great Britain, Canada, and France. This behavior alone raises questions about Trump’s ability to negotiate with America’s allies when he often alienates them.<br/> Under his “guidance” the United States has withdrawn from the Paris Agreement, a global agreement signed by leading nations to strengthen “the global response to the threat of climate change.” Denying the research and observations of prominent world scientists, Trump defies the reality of global warming.<br/> Consistently throwing the United States into turmoil, his relations with the Senate and House of Representatives rely on his Twitter responses to anyone who disagrees with him. Trump regularly attacks the free press who point out the inconsistencies in his remarks, his often irrational behavior, and his continued encouragement of divisiveness of America at large. Playing to his base, promising unrealistic and dangerous changes, Trump instills a false sense of entitlement to his followers.<br/> Woodward, using interviews and public knowledge, pulls back the curtain on an unstable leader who has engaged in possible criminal activity, yet remains at the helm of the land of the free. The question arises, how long can the United States of America stand by while a failed businessman and television reality performer drives the country to the edge of disaster?<br/> Fear: Trump in the White House is an eye-opener that I recommend for all readers, whether Republican, Democrat, Liberal, or Conservative. Read with an open mind then ask yourself, what can we do to steer America back to the course of being a conscientious and responsible world leader?
 I had high hopes for this book. Woodward is typically an exhaustive researcher and I know that was the case here, too, many interviews, thousands of transcribed conversations. The construction of a narrative from such a wealth of material is quite a task. I know he has a team, but it's still daunting and, although the end is abrupt and the structure overall is episodic to the point of being disjointed, still, with so much material for Woodward to choose from, it's an easy read (and even easier to listen to--I have both hardback and Kindle as the audio book is identical in content--and very convenient ).<br/><br/>Unfortunately, something that bothered me in other Woodward books was even more of a problem here, probably because like a lot of people living through it, I know a lot about the subject. So, it's annoying as ever that he takes a particular source/interviewee's version (often self-serving with this crowd), and presents his/her spin as if its actual fact.  This is particularly annoying given Woodward's reputation for "accumulating and presenting facts". No, no. Much of this is not established fact at all -- but Woodward writes as if his source is telling him the truth.  (Sometimes, you'll recognize when that absolutely is NOT the case, particularly with Bannon and with Dowd).<br/><br/>It is, for example, painfully obvious when Bannon is grabbing the narrative--an apparently skilled attention-seeker, Bannon keeps his language colorful and provocative in interviews and many writers including Woodward just can't resist incorporating his spin--or the temptation to give it far too much weight, including parts where he's an unattributed source.  We all know that Bannon has reasons behind everything that he says and its something readers need to be reminded of; he is not reliable.<br/><br/>There are many examples of that here, of sources who grab the narrative and, with Woodward's help, make one-sided spin come across as fact. Two particularly annoying examples come to mind. First, is pretty much everything Woodward writes about the Russia investigation (although he at least makes his own bias evident at one point, describing his appearance on CNN blasting the intel agencies decision to tell Trump about the Steele dossier. He gives short shrift to the opposing point of view--that it was going to become public knowledge very soon through the press--as BuzzFeed and CNN would just a few days later--and Trump needed to know it was out there.<br/><br/> It's typical of the odd dynamic in this book-- at some points where critical thinking is needed, he is overtly sympathetic to the administration and doesn't do justice to any other viewpoint.  But then, he'll surprise by including some -highly- unflattering interviews that show negative portraits of the president for different reasons.<br/><br/>Similarly, with the Russia investigation itself--a huge historical event far surpassing Watergate if Trump is found to have been colluding with a foreign power--or even to have obstructed justice, both the concerns of the Mueller investigation. . That thought doesn't seem to have much weight to Woodward, who barely mentions the Trump Tower meeting and email planning it with Trump's top three campaign advisors (or whether that blocked number Don Jr called was his father's.) It's surprising that the journalist who broke the Watergate scandal is so disinterested in this one, with its own parallels.<br/><br/>Sometimes, Woodward just gives his own opinion as if its fact, simply ignoring the many facts and narratives that would contradict him. For example, he quotes Comey's book (selectively and somewhat unflatteringly--Comey looks petty with his description of Trump) but ignores his testimonies to Congress. Woodward didn't interview Trump (although he asked to), but much of the spin from those he -did- interview is repeated uncritically, which is annoying at times (I admit my own bias; it's less annoying when these insiders are recounting some outrageous and unflattering anecdote about Trump--and there are many.).<br/><br/>The final chapter is odd--both as anecdote and as conclusion. . it's about Dodd and Mueller--a description of their meeting. But Woodward doesn't bother to point out that Mueller's team doesn't leak and doesn't talk to the press, meaning that the entire description is purely from Dowd's point of view (and from his self-interest. There's a lot of posturing here--some of it is truly eye-rolling, but might pass as fact with Woodward's retelling)..<br/><br/>Unfortunately, as we've seen over 20 months, nothing Trump lawyers tell a reporter can be taken as fact (not surprising, really, since their foremost duty is to present their client in the most favorable light--something the facts may not actually do, as Dowd and Sekulow demonstrate in a funny moment when they role play to Mueller--per Dowd--with Sekulow playing the part of Trump and lying over and over.  (Dowd attacks Mueller as sneaky and setting Trump up for a "perjury trap" --then he admits in the next breath than Trump is a complete liar … and abruptly quits (apparently before Trump can fire him, which he expects is coming).<br/><br/>Well, that's something that I -did- enjoy a lot about this book: the ongoing unspoken theme that there's no honor among thieves. Whether Cohn or Porter or Kelly or Tillerson or Dowd or Huckabee Sanders or, especially, Trump himself anyone will knife anyone (metaphorically), anyone will sell out anyone. Everyone, including the president himself, has derogatory things to say about others behind their backs.<br/><br/>Woodward is sounding a warning here (included in the title alone which is Trump's answer to the question, "What is power?") I have issues with the way an interviewee's spin often becomes fact here, but it's still an important read.
 Woodward has a clarity of mind and deft pen hand to be able to put together a complex and bewildering story so lucidly while maintaining the excitement and the intrigue of the office of the President of the United States under President trump. Can anyone imagine the President’s staff stealing documents on his desk, awaiting his signature just so that the President doesn’t sign them and jeopardise the country? It happens, not once but on and on.<br/><br/> How then was Trump elected? There are many books answering this question today, but Woodward’s is the clearest and seems most objective. It was a perfect storm that engulfed Hilary Clinton and blew Trump into the White House. The brilliant strategist Steve Bannon is now gone, but his role in putting Trump in the White House is clear, and Woodward gives him credit for it. Bannon saw the stats and understood them. Americans were not enamoured by Hilary. All Trump’s team needed to do was to shift the focus away from Trump and onto Hilary – and hope that Trump stays out of their way long enough for them to complete the job for him. His stats told him that people want change.<br/><br/> The next part of the book concerns Trump, now President, lording over everyone, and firing everyone. Woodward is watching the poker game between Mueller and Trump’s (ever-changing, evolving) team, and is giving us a clear view of what’s at stake and how the players are playing it. Trump’s legal counsel, John Dowd, seems to play the game well with Mueller, but like all Trump’s men, he left.<br/><br/> The best value of this book is that Woodward provides us with many glimpses into what goes on in the White House (goodness knows how he got that much information). An example will suffice. This is found at page 236:<br/>‘Months after his departure from the White House, Priebus made a final assessment: He believed he had been surrounded in the West Wing by high-ranking natural killers with no requirement to produce regular work products- a plan, a speech, the outline of a strategy, a budget, a daily and weekly schedule. They were roving interlopers, a band of chaos creators. There was Ivanka, a charming huntress dipping in and out of meetings or the latest presidential business. Jared Had the same rights. Theirs was a portfolio without experience.’ The other two named were Kellyanne Conway and Steve Bannon. Both were themselves out of the White House.<br/><br/> Will Woodward be writing a new edition with an epilogue? By the time the game ends, Trump will either go down as one of America’s most amazing presidents – or in flames; with Trump, there is no middle way. Stay tuned – will we see a fairy tale ending for America, or grimace at the by-line of horror movies – be careful what you wish for?
 I marvel at how Woodward obtained such in depth detail of the inner workings of the White House executive. When presented with the extremely complex political and economic issues that are in dynamic play continuously one almost feels some sympathy for Trump whose general ignorance and lack of political experience is so vividly exposed. It’s frightening how much more dangerous the world has become in the last 21 months with a US president unable to grasp the potentially catastrophic consequences of his profound lack of knowledge of world affairs and economics, personal immaturity and fragile ego. The book reads like a thriller. If only it was fiction !
 I just finished reading “Fear” by Bob Woodward. It describes President Trump’s story from the last days of the Trump Presidential campaign in 2016 through early 2018. This book appears to be well sourced - there are 26 pages of source notes in the back by my count. My perception is that Woodward has done his best to honestly describe the events and reactions within the Trump White House.<br/><br/>I had previously read “Fire and Fury” by Michael Wolff and “Unhinged” by Omarosa Newman. I am reminded of the story of the blind men describing an elephant. Omarosa described President Trump through the lens of her personal experiences with Trump starting from her days on the first season of “The Apprentice” and through her time with the Trump White House. Michael Wolff seems to draw especially heavily on information from Steve Bannon. Woodward’s book seems to draw from more sources within the Trump White House and is somewhat broader because of that.<br/><br/>At first I was puzzled over the title “Fear”. Trump is quoted a few times in the book as saying or implying that the essence of power is to inspire fear in others. It’s something straight from “The Prince” by Machiavelli who says that it is better to be feared than to be loved when you are a ruler.<br/><br/>The book is well written and appears to be well researched. It is also a good read, though it is less exciting than “Fire and Fury” and less personal than “Unhinged.” If you follow the evening news on Trump on anything but Fox, you would probably already be fairly well aware of much of the continuing drama of the Trump administration. What “Fear” adds is a more detailed version of the events inside the White House. While this is by no means a Fox News type whitewash of President Trump, I found it to be a somewhat more sympathetic portrayal of President Trump than I had expected based on the initial quotes in the news from the early release copies of “Fear.”<br/><br/>By the way, the book has a full color set of pictures in the middle of the book that identifies many of the major players in the book.<br/><br/>I will not attempt to summarize the book. But I found the following items to be of interest:<br/><br/>A very succinct description of the issues that led Donald Trump to win the presidency was from Steve Bannon:<br/>1 Stopping mass illegal immigration and limiting legal immigration.<br/>2 Bring manufacturing jobs back to the USA.<br/>3 Get out of the pointless foreign wars.<br/>4 Making the election about Hillary Clinton instead of Donald Trump.<br/><br/>The infighting within the Trump White House is astonishing. Trump has no government experience which we all knew. The majority of his cabinet and upper administration are likewise novices to government and politics. Not surprisingly among a group of Alpha types, most of them came with their own agendas and priorities and were as Reince Priebus, Trumps first Chief of Staff expressed like bringing together a bunch of predators in zoo without walls or barriers. There was a lot of infighting as each tried to get their particular agenda implemented.<br/><br/>President Trump’s Legal Council John Dowd (2017-March 2018) believes and behaved in his legal strategy that Candidate Donald Trump did not conspire with Russia to swing the election. He also seemed to think that Special Prosecutor Robert Muller had no evidence indicating implicating Donald Trump on these charges but that Trump’s inability to stick to the truth without making stuff up would wind up making Trump guilty of perjury if he were to attempt to answer questions under oath.<br/><br/>I noted that Trump was described in many ways. For example he seems to genuinely want to fulfill the campaign promises he made to his base. It is admirable when a politician actually takes that seriously - But it is troubling when a President is feeding the divisions within America instead of trying to unify.<br/><br/>Trump is ego driven - He feeds on the adoration  of his base and Fox News. Criticism in the media by other news organizations hurts his ego and drives his anger. Trump seems to have anger control issues and can be easily distracted in meetings and interactions and his staff has trouble getting him to focus on priorities. Trump sees personal relationships between him and leaders of other countries as his strength instead of relying on his staff for complex issues beyond his experience.
 I was disappointed with Bob Woodward's book. If you watch Fox news you already know about what is reported in his book.  I will not buy another of his books.
 The last time I read a book this fast was Harry Potter when I was 11 years old... This is real page turner, incredibly detailed, intimate and without a doubt 100% accurate, as if you were a fly on the wall yourself.<br/><br/>This book will go down in history as a book that shows what happens-- and (eventually) the consequences-- of blatant, selfish ignorance
 Fabulous. Bob Woodward is one of the quintessential writers of our lifetime. Watergate plus five stars! A journalist and writer who had perfected his craft. Many are called but few are chosen.
 No smoking gun. Just Trump being narcisistic Trump.  This book is just a record of conversations- nothing new here. No deep insights as to who he really is.
 It's difficult to actually write a "review" because of the subject matter.  Nearly everything written are things that the World knows about and this novel lays out a time-line of events and reminds us all, what a horrible situation our Country is in and the need to remove trump from the White House and maybe even put him in prison.
 But helpful when trying to remember the timeline. Most of this was either publically known about or easily guessed at, when it comes to how the President acts behind the scenes. And how he thinks.<br/><br/>When it comes down to it, I'll trust Woodward's word over Trump's any day.
 (caveat- I am only ~ 20% into this book.)<br/>Given the title, which sums up my feelings about Trump (among other emotions) I was surprised at what I found within.<br/>While I would not describe the book as a hagiography, it definitely has a Trump "lean".<br/>It puts Trump in a positive light, at least in the chapters I have read thus far.<br/><br/>The writing is plain, journalistic. The MO seems to be a chapter for each of the major developments in the Trump Presidency. For example, the time right after the election and the presentation of the Russia evidence and the 'dossier". Woodward refers to the Steele dossier as "unsubstantiated garbage" (the same thing he called it on Fox news) and questions why it was included with the CIA's and FBI's best intelligence work.<br/>Another example: The Yemen raid. This was presented in the media as a great failure. According to Woodward it was an Obama plan merely carried out under Trump. He spends quite a few graphs describing how Trump met the dead soldiers casket at Dover and how he then honored the widow at his first State Of The Union speech. He also describes Trump calling the families of other fallen troops and being engaging and compassionate.<br/>This is the pattern so far: Describe an issue that put Trump in a bad light in the press, then explain the "behind the scenes" action that actually makes Trump seem rational and clever, if not wise.<br/><br/>Surprising. And to me at least, a bit disturbing.
 Yes this is another book about Trump, but its a must read.  This man is sorely unprepared and uneducated, with his views on how the world works and how government works.  It is the reason that so many have thrown up their hands and left, like Gary Cohen and HR McMaster, they like General Mattis try on several crucial occasions have tried to explain to him over and over again how the world of trade and diplomacy interconnect.  But Trump is living in time  around the beginning of 20th Century, he sticks to that.  Now Bannon didn't help that situation, he found in Trump someone that was not a "Globalist" and so he was happy filling trump with getting out of Trade deals.  But what you also see is our worst fears, this man is not grounded in anything about history or facts.  Also what should alarm all of us that his stump speeches about taking the OIL,or other natural resources of a country that we are helping to defend in payment, like Afganistan.  Gary Cohen and Mnuchen have tried to explain to him over and over you can't do that, for diplomacy and international law, but no this man child goes right back to it after they explain it.  It same with KORUS or the South Korean Trade agreement, he thinks they should be paying for rent for our troops being their and for the THAAD missile defense system, he would start on it and Mattis and Cohen would go in explain, then Trump would be find and then hour later he would right back at it again.  As far as the Russian Probe they do go into his attorneys trying to protect him, Dowd on one hand wants only to protect him because he feels shouldn't be bothered because he to busy being President.  Now that thought is baloney, this man watches TV most of the day, he sits around all morning till 11 am watching FOX and whatever he has TIVO'd.  What people don't want to see is that this man is fraud and fool, you didn't need to NYT article, but it proved it. But this man is corrupt, amoral and uninformed, and would be happy to sit in front of TV like a geriatric old man with nothing else to do.  We as Americans have alot to Fear.
 THis has got to be Woodward's crowing achievement. He relays an absolutely terrifying insight into the Trump Whitehouse and what led up to it. This will be one for the history books for sure.
 Well done Mr. Woodward.Your efforts have shown how the Trump Show we are watching is produced. The big question is how did this great country go from cherishing George Washington's "I cannot tell a lie" to resigning ourselves to Donald Trump's "He cannot tell the truth".
 Maybe one way to approach this book is discussing what it is and what it is not.  It isn't an expansive full biography like maybe "The Trumps" by Gwenda Blair and it isn't a sizzling fast-paced narrative with many summations in quotes from multiple sources like "Fire and Fury" by Michael Wolff.  Here, you have chapter by chapter a series of catastrophes and one or two triumphs which when analyzed will eventually have negative future impacts for years to come.  The book focuses in on Trump and his leadership style and interactions with subordinates.  Yet, it shies away from larger issues such as who voted and who did not and who his supporters are in day to day life outside of the hate groups and radicalized fringe.  Trump is a very different President than Reagan or Nixon and both Bush Presidents.  All of them had a network of advisors, friends and stalwart subordinates who would move mountains to gain their trust and thanks.  Trump at the end of each day is essentially alone, on a bully platform getting tinier and tinier as truth, data, world history, decency, and Senators and Congressman who do know how the U.S. Government works and understand and uphold the Constitution do the real work around him and despite him.
 After reading Bob Woodward's book you  would have to think that Donald Trump would surely be just a one term President. He recently described the Senate vote for Justice Kavanaugh as a 'great victory', while others said it was the 'narrowest margin for a Supreme Court nominee in many years'. (50 votes for, 48 votes against)<br/>About one third of the book is given over to comprehensive 'Source Notes' and to a detailed index, so it's hard to believe the President's comment that the book 'is a just 'a work of fiction'  It's probable that the President has not read the book !  And even today, October 13, he has publicly attacked the Federal Reserve, blaming them for the current stock market falls.<br/>Instead of Making America Great Again, this book shows us how Donald Trump is dividing America.
 If you read this book with an open mind, you might pay attention to the on going debate between tariffs and no tariffs. Except for Navarro and Wilbur Mills, and Brennon, of course, no one wants tariffs. But President Trump does and so after a few hundred pages, he gets them. There are a lot of people to remember and by the end of the book many of those are gone. I had a very favorable impression of Rob Porter and a poor impression of Rex Tillerson. My general impression is that President Trump has an agenda, mostly based on his personal opinion, and he believes strongly in his own ideas. When he brags about his very big brain, he is serious. Kelly is trying to encourage a process by which decisions are made but he cannot watch him 24/7 and there are people like Navarro who are just as convinced that they are right as those with different views. The situation with Korea, our troops and the trade, seems to be the most risky situation. China may be a bit more difficult to deal with that Canada, Mexico, and Europe. Am I afraid? Yes, somewhat. I am waiting to see what happens on November 6,2018.<br/><br/>The book is easy to read except for the mutiltude of people to remember, but I have to wonder who the sources were. There are many direct quotes and so I’m guessing the sources were people in the room such as Rob Porter or Hope Hicks. Possibly Gary Cohn who left just after the tariffs were announced. The book ends there and it has obviously been written in haste and could have used another round of editing.
 I haven't read all of Woodward's books, but I've read most of them them for the last 20 years. This was the most entertaining and engaging of them all. But, then, how could it now be? It's about Donald Trump. It's an account I trust. Trump is over the top and swears a lot, but the narrative itself is not over the top as the nonsensical Michael Wolff book that made bizarre tabloid-style claims. Woodward, by contrast took us through Trump's fiery arguments with advisers like Cohn over tariffs and his lawyer Ty Cobb over testifying to Mueller. The book never seems to take a side on whether there's anything to the the Russia collusion scandal. It's interesting to see how Trump would lurch from one end to the next on what do do about certain things--such as whether to clarify or apologize for his his moral relativism regarding Charlottesville.<br/>It's fairly clear who some of the sources are. Steve Bannon (shocker there), Lindsey Graham and William Cohn are near certainties as sources for Woodward. Despite his denial, seems clear to me that John Kelly cooperated some with the author.<br/>There is a backstory on trump not giving Woodward an interview for the book. It could have been a better book had Trump given an interview as George W. Bush and Barack Obama granted. But, this won't be Woodward's last book.<br/>The market is flooded with Trump books, mostly mindlessly fawning or mindless hysteria. Woodward is refreshingly neither, while still capturing the unusual era we live in.
 With authoritative reporting honed through eight presidencies from Nixon to Obama, author Bob Woodward reveals in unprecedented detail the harrowing life inside President Donald Trump’s White House and precisely how he makes decisions on major foreign and domestic policies. Woodward draws from hundreds of hours of interviews with firsthand sources, meeting notes, personal diaries, files and documents. The focus is on the explosive debates and the decision-making in the Oval Office, the Situation Room, Air Force One and the White House residence.<br/><br/>  Fear is the most intimate portrait of a sitting president ever published during the president’s first years in office.<br/><br/>My Thoughts: I will admit that I was devastated by the outcome of the 2016 election. But I was also hoping that, somehow, Trump would surprise us. That we would discover layers of integrity and competence beneath the blustering façade he loved to show the world. His Twitter madness was a sign, to me, though…there were no hidden depths.<br/><br/>Fear: Trump in the White House, by Bob Woodward, pulled me in and validated what I was already seeing. As the author revealed interviews and observations that confirmed the chaos behind those doors, I had to keep reading. Was there a ray of hope somewhere?<br/><br/>Instead, as time marched on, the chaos grew, and the staff around the president worked hard to try to manage and contain his worst impulses. They had numerous processes to help keep him on track, since their advice most often fell on deaf ears. He didn’t like to read, he didn’t listen, and he clung to his own belief system, ideas that he had held for many years. He believed that he had good instincts and should follow them, rather than to listen to those with expertise and wisdom. His temper tantrums were often punctuated by damaging Twitter rants, or firing of those who were trying to help him.<br/><br/>His day to day operations showed an unraveling, like a Trump rally on a continuous loop.<br/><br/>Staff complained about how, in his persistence of his ideas, they had to constantly explain to him and justify their positions. In frustration, some said he had the understanding of a fifth or sixth grader.<br/><br/>Attorney Dowd fought hard against Trump being interviewed by Mueller, finally resigning over his inability to persuade the president. That issue is still unresolved. These thoughts at the end summed up some major issues:<br/><br/>“In the man and his presidency, Dowd had seen the tragic flaw. In the political back-and-forth, the evasions, the denials, the tweeting, the obscuring, crying ‘Fake News,’ the indignation, Trump had one overriding problem that Dowd knew but could not bring himself to say to the president: ‘You’re a f…king liar.’<br/><br/>A brilliant 5 star read that left me frightened, but sometimes hopeful: that perhaps calmer heads would prevail…or at some point, someone could put an end to it all.
 A much-needed dose of sane and sober from a true master, beautifully written. About 15% of the book is devoted to the meticulous documentation of the sources. I think the media is not doing the book any favors by promoting the least factual and most scandalous snippets.
 Because this is a book review, and not a political commentary, I'll try to stick to the literary side of the fence -- realize, however, that the book deals with politics.  Woodward is a good writer which makes the book an easy read.  It is essentially a compilation of anecdotes and vignettes about events in the campaign and the White House.  It's not a flowing narrative like you might expect in a novel.  It's a collection of episodes which you must knit together to form your own picture -- like the tiles in a mural.  It takes you behind closed doors to get a sense of what life is like around Trump.  It's not a pretty picture, but none of it will be much of a surprise.  Actually, it is downright scary when you consider he is the president.  Someone with the temperament of Trump would make a risky garbage collector, let alone commander in chief.  But that's my conclusion.  You should read the book because it will give you insight on how and why Trump behaves as he does.  That will be useful going forward through his next two years.<br/><br/>The book is based on "deep background" which means the information is not for attribution to the source.  Anonymity is good for getting to the truth, but it also encourages the source to bend it to his/her advantage.  When you cross check sources you can filter out the biases.  I trust Woodward has done that.  Based on the details in the book, it would appear his major sources are:  Steve Bannon (strategist), Rob Porter (presidential secretary), Gary Cohn (economic advisor), Lindsey Graham (senator), John Dowd (attorney), Reince Priebus (chief of staff), and to a lesser degree Rex Tillerson (secr. of state).  If not these players, then certainly people who were regularly with them in meetings.<br/><br/>I'd recommend several other books if you like this one.  Killing Democracy, Trumpocracy, On Tyranny, How Democracies Die, the Death of Democracy.  All are on Amazon.  I'd read them in the order listed.  That will take you from a current rendition of how Trump is dismantling our democracy (Killing Democracy), to more insight on Trump himself, to historical perspectives on what has happened to democracies.  If you are subject to depression, you may wish to ignore the list.<br/><br/>Spoiler Alert:  These are conclusions about the book that you may want to skip so you can draw your own independently.  Trump feels he must always win and never lose or back down.  It drives much of his visible behavior.  He is convinced about certain ways to run the government that go back years.  Now he has the chance to make them happen and he resents interference with his chance to dictate what's best for the country (in his view).  He can be influenced sometimes, but it is very hard to do.  He likes people until he hates them and then he abandons them.  He is a compulsive liar -- so much so that he will say anything to look good or get what he wants.  He wants a lot of attention and adulation which explains his tweeting and continual rallies.  He has an insatiable ego that feeds on TV news coverage and is more obsessed with his image than with what is good for the nation.  He thinks that diplomacy is all about his personal relationships with other leaders and seems not to understand that he is easily played by them as he constantly overestimates his knowledge and skill.  Hard work is not his greatest virtue and he ignores briefings and presentations because he is most interested in expressing his view rather than listening to others.  He will never be wrong in his own mind so others always carry the blame.  At times he can be personal and human.  Those times are rare.  Not everything Trump wants to do is wrong.  However, many are and for the ones where he may be right, he chooses to pursue them in a fashion that alienates those involved.  He thrives on unnecessary conflict.  None of this should surprise anyone who has the slightest ability to perceive and interpret human behavior.  It will be a miracle that we survive four years of president Trump without some terrible event.  If we get through this, it  will only happen because people around him are holding the government together for us.<br/><br/>You heard all this from an independent, conservative-leaning reviewer.
 I have read and enjoyed previous Woodward books, particularly his Supreme Court book, "The Brethren." After all the hype,  if you read the paper and watch news, "Fear" does not teach you much. We knew it was bad, but Woodward just gives you misery quotes from obvious sources  Bannon, Preibus, Rob Porter, Gary Cohn, etc]. By the way, I'm horrified about Trump, but I did like Woodward reporting Trump's frustration with our generals and Afghanistan. My 2 cents.
 I would consider this book as an impressionist painting of the chaos inside the Trump White House.<br/>Some of the threads were hard to follow, but the general picture was more than clear. Woodward’s first rate journalism gives the reader a detailed background picture of the way the US President and his senior staff come to decisions on economic and foreign policy, usually ignoring all conventional wisdom on the way.<br/>The political inexperience of many of the senior staff that accompanied Trump into the White House should make any admirer of the USA as the leader of the free world shudder.
 First let me say that I am not a political scholar.  I am not an English professor nor a writer.  My review may not be the best but I will give it a go.  I recommend this book.  The more I learn about politics the more frightening it is.  So I half wonder if it's possible that ignorance really is bliss.  What I like about this book is how it puts everything in a nice neat order that is easy to follow.  Short sentences without the babble.  Easy to understand even if you're new to the subject.  There wasn't a lot new.  Some things that were lost in the barrage of maddening headlines maybe.  This brings some forgotten facts to light.  It is more of a refresher course.  So much craziness has happened in the last few years that when you look back you wonder how  this happened.  How, when or will the madness end?  If anyone would have told me even 10 years ago that I would read this book,  let alone buy it,  I would have laughed.  It would have been funny to me.  Who cares about politics right?  They all lie don't they?  It is all a joke.  In this case however the joke isn't funny anymore.  Maybe I didn't pay enough attention all those years go.  Well,  I'm paying attention now.  The  “Only Thing We Have to Fear Is Fear Itself”  As FDR said in his first Inaugural Address.  I wonder if that really is the only thing we have to fear.
 The author this book with specifics to details leaving little doubt about the authenticity. Well written.<br/>It gives great insight to people's motives within the political world.
 Woodward's book is packed with facts and information about the Trump White House. BUT....it is so boring I find myself losing track. Often a story is told about some incident that has no back story. A person is mentioned and there is no clue as to who this person is or how he or she got hooked up with the Trump gang of thieves in the West Wing. If some one leaves or is retired or fired he does not say where they went or what they are doing now. It is as though they never existed. Through out the book, I felt as though there was to solid conclusions to incidents he wrote about and I was therefore left hanging.<br/>Woodward is a great writer. But he is ,after all a Republican. I think he soft peddled one of this nations hottest political stories and wrapped it up in old news paper with a tattered bow. Sorry I could not have been more positive.<br/>Should you pass on this book? Hell no. If you work all day and are generally burned out on the evening news then read this book and you will learn a lot about the shenanigans of the Trump administration. If you are like me and are retired and listen to cable much of the day then most of the book will seem familiar.<br/> Don't pass on this book if you like Woodward's style of writing. And for heaven' sake, read all of the reviews.
 "Fear" is an excellent book detailing Donald Trump's first year-plus in the White House. Those who follow politics still get a lot as Woodward builds the story you with lots more you don't. And you have it all as a one-source timeline. It's well-written. There are a handful of gossipy and still useful components, but not as many as what Amy Chozick built into Chasing Hillary.<br/>Sadly, Fear would most benefit people who don't follow politics day-by-day; they're unlikely to read Fear, either.<br/>This is not a spoiler. You will come away believing that Donald Trump has very short attention span. He believes he's a great negotiator and he's the opposite. His staff, which broadly has a similar political bent at the start of the administration, soon realizes it needs to step in and buffer / hold off / ignore some of the more dangerous moves Trump makes. He attended Wharton School and doesn't understand economics 101-102, for instance if you slap a tariff of $100 on a $500 item from China, the Chinese slap all or most of the tariff onto the price and the American buyers wind up paying the tax. Woodward concludes, and you probably may too, that Trump has trouble telling the truth, and that makes him, in plain terms, a liar as President.
 Consider the Prologue, which describes a letter surreptitiously removed from the Resolute Desk. That letter announced Trump's intention to pull out of our trade pact with South Korea -- which would have unraveled a network of arrangements, including surveillance of North Korea that provides the most timely warning of hostile actions from the rogue republic.<br/><br/>That withdrawal never happened, thanks to an act that is technically treason. It isn't the only time that staff derailed a destructive Trump idea.<br/><br/>Then there are the many conversations that Bob Woodward reconstructs in the book, like the one on pages 220-221 in which Trump angrily rejects the best advice of economic adviser Gary Cohn and other staff on trade policy. The man running our country flatly refuses to listen to advice. If that doesn't scare you...<br/><br/>I wish Bob Woodward had put more effort into organizing this book. But, chaotic as it is, it reflects the chaos hobbling the White House. I suspect that was its author's intent. Woodward's warning is worthwhile. I won't call his book a keeper, but it is a must-read.
 Nearly two years into the Trump presidency, the only truly surprising aspect of Bob Woodward's inside look into this atypical (to say the least) administration is how unsurprising are all of the surprise revaluations within. Trump has worn himself on his sleeve since he rode an escalator into the primaries, and the only people who claim he is anything else beyond the cultural running joke of the last four decades are the people who have supported and defended him for exactly those reasons.<br/><br/>Like Woodward's previous works, Fear is exhaustively researched and documented; the last 20% of the book is comprised almost entirely of footnotes and sources. Those proclaiming that Fear is little more than "fake news" willfully ignore the fact that at least half of the material in this book is a matter of public record, and there isn't a passage about Trump's actions or behavior that feels out of character or beyond the realm of possibility.<br/><br/>Fear doesn't necessarily expose the Trump administration as much as it confirms what we've already experienced, helping to reject the hopeful mantra taken up by more and more people as a psychological defense, "This can't really be happening." Woodward reminds us that it is, and expertly makes us face our Fear.
 Bob Woodward is no stranger to the Halls of Power, and the ways of American presidents. The list of his published books about American presidents he has been professionally acquainted with, and worked with, listed in the front of this novel includes 18 published works, and his writings cover presidents from Nixon to Obama, and now Donald Trump.  In his prologue to this novel, he asserts that the research done for this book was done with the same methods as in the past. He does "deep research" using interviews with individuals who are close to the president he is profiling, who could lose their jobs, even go to jail for sharing what they know.  Of course, the book is well written, carefully edited...but more than that, it was a gripping read for me because I am a liberal, and a democrat, and I am educated...so I read broadly and often--and frankly, Donald Trump scares me, greatly.  I have felt for awhile now that he has a secret agenda--that he has a vision of our American government becoming an authoritarian state, a dictatorship over which he can preside as a leader without a deadline for occupancy, like his friends in other authoritarian nation states.  I was looking for evidence of this in Bob Woodward's book.  I found it.
 It was fine. It might have been better for me if the TV interviews didn’t give the most shocking stuff away, but it’s hard to balance hooking readers with not spoiling everything. The big issue is that unlike some of his earlier books, some of the most key sections **feel** like they’re biased because they’re from one obvious source. That may well not be true, but the deep background format and never saying things like, “according to 3 sources,” like they do in newspapers and magazines, leaves you having to decide how much you trust Woodward’s judgement. If anyone deserves the benefit of the doubt, it’s probably him. The book sure shows that that place is a hot mess on every level. Interesting stuff.
 Lots of details. Makes you understand the roles people play in the WH, and quite a few relationship dynamics. Very entertaining and illuminating. I wish Mr. Woodward would continue chronicling this very different (with a few exceptions, not good different) political and social times we are living, and what the consequences might or will be for us, our children and their children. Very compelling, it shows the level of research he completed. This book left me not able to wrap around my brain to the way our government is working and deeply concerned about this country. But a point of light is that the more you know.....the better you can stand up for what you hold dear. When a book author has integrity and facts, their work doesn't need to shout at us.
 This is an interesting take on the Trump administration. I appreciated that Woodward lets you see the perspective of people from inside the Trump administration. This really fleshes out the decision-making that was done and lets you see the logic behind what was reported in the news. I found it even helped explain some of President Trump's behavior. While it does not paint a flattering picture of Trump, Woodward also seems to take Trump's lawyer's (Dowd's) view that the Mueller investigation does not have anything on Trump.<br/><br/>This book has many reported stories that cast doubt on the temperament of Trump for the presidency. If they are all accurate, then it is easy to see why the Trump staff seem to find their jobs so miserable.<br/><br/>The real limitations of the book are that it is clearly from the perspectives of people who were in the Trump administration and so wish to put themselves forward in a good light. It is possible to guess some of the sources based on how often people show up in the story, and so one should always keep this self-interest in mind.<br/><br/>Overall I found some of the stories to be rather surprising even if they fit in with the picture I get of the Trump administration in general, and I found this book to be an enlightening read. It does not inspire confidence in the White House, but it does let you peek into how the White House was being run.
 Every voting adult from both parties should read this book.  This is not a "dissing" of Trump by Democrats.  It is a sober  description of what it is like to work with/for Trump by high-level advisers, for the most part, Republicans, who actively worked to place him in the White House or were hired by him to fill important and sensitive positions.  Much of it is direct quotes with notations of where and when it was said.  A very clear picture emerges of just who it is the country has elected to this position of awesome power.
 Over and over, the scenes play out for an actor that is ill-prepared for the role; unschooled in diplomacy, economics, or public policy to govern a nation; and unable to think outside himself is exposed in the unrated version.  Even in the private conversations, there is little that is new or was hidden from speculation.  Unfortunately for the US, Trump is a big bully, but a terrible fighter who telegraphs his every move.  Sad too that real issues languish, because his focus is creating then attempting to win a new battle everyday.  His obsession with Clinton, Obama, Comey and Sessions prove he is pedantically watching his own feet, not looking out for the country.
 While some key points in this book have been revealed in the press, only reading the book itself gives the background and context required to understand the grave problems facing the nation under this administration.  A masterful narrative, at times a bit disjointed, but ultimately rewarding for serious observers.
 How on earth did we elect this buffoon?  This book is well worth reading... both for the wild ride toward the election (when his team was amazingly clueless), and for actions of the administration. (We will be working toward recovery for decades.  Maybe centuries.)  The ending is sort of abrupt... but in writing a book about a train-wreck in progress, the author needed to just pick a place and stop. Hoping he will write v2 when this nightmare has ended, finishing the story for us.
 The theme of this book reminds me of President Reagan's speech at the Berlin Wall, when he declared, to the distress of State Department officials, "Mr. Gorachev, tear down this wall."  The State Department removed this line from his speech three separate times, and Reagan kept putting it back in.<br/><br/>That's the difference between visionary leader and a bunch of government bureaucrats.<br/><br/>If  Woodard's unsourced book is to be believed, it's the same with Trump.  He was elected, not those who serve him. Most of the time he's right, not the bureaucrats or cabinet officials who strive to contain him.  In his book The Briefing, Former campaign advisor and Press Secretary Sean Spicer put it this way:  "What made the Trump campaign so different was that eight times out of ten they would break the rules and be proven right.. We'd say you can't do that, and they would do it anyway. And it would work.. It was a humbling experience to give professional advice only to see it refuted time and time again."<br/><br/>Trump governs the same way.  He ran on disrupting the status quo and that'e what he does, moving much faster and more decisively  than his advisors. Assuming it's true, the resistance to his methods described in the book is both insidious and unconstitutional.  Trump was elected, not a bunch of wimpy advisors who may disagree with him.<br/><br/>The biggest problem I had the with book, however, is its reliance on unsourced material.  There's no way to know how much of it is accurate. Alleged quotes are immediately followed by unquoted conclusions presented as facts.  It's a constant commingling of alleged quotes with unsupported and unsourced information presented as factual.<br/><br/>After reading the whole thing, I can't tell if it's legitimate history or largely  fiction.  Woodward's apparent desire to promote book sales by creating controversy detracts from his legacy as a serious journalist.
 I am thinking of setting up a account with Amazon to sell books such as this.  Whether you love him or hate him, my real problem with this book is that the author gave away too much of the story trying to sell it on all the talk shows.  The President is a bombastic pathological liar but a master politician!  People imho who hate President Trump always make the mistake of under estimating him...  The book is O.K. and if you hate the President you will be well served to order up a used one.  I do not hate President Trump and even agree with him on some policies.  He is a crude individual who in some ways I feel sorry for..
 It's an easy read.  Has some juicy insights.  Made me laugh here and there, and tell myself we can survive all this.
 I couldn't wait to read this book and ordered it the day it was released.  I didn't know what to expect, but wanted to know what Robert Woodward had to say.  I respect what he has to say and consider whatever he writes to be true and fully researched.  Well, as I read this book I not only became concerned about what's going on in the White House, but scared too.  I didn't vote for the president and don't particularly like him, but kept an open mind as I read the book.  I found the book to be fair, not a Trump bashing book, non political, and fascinating.  It really made me think about what goes on in the white house when no one's watching.  This has been a tumultuous couple of years and after reading this book I see why.  All I can say is after I read this book I couldn't pick up another book right away, as I usually do, I had to wait a day or two.  Too much to think about and yes worry about too.  Great book by an excellent author.  Whether you're a Trump fan or not this is a great read and should be read by his every American.  It's got so much to say about our current state of affairs.
 Bob Woodward covers several notable events of the Trump presidency in ‘Fear’ from a seat at the table POV. Cohn and Porter are identified as the men slipping documentation off the Oval Office desk in a bid to fend off Trump’s impulses. We also get to see Ivanka and Jared’s residence machinations- Ivanka’s support for the Paris deal and Jared’s hand in landing MBS and Saudi money- and their feud with Priebus and Bannon. Guess who won that one? Mattis and Tillerson were lunch buddies while McMaster was left out in the cold.<br/><br/>Sen. Graham’s rather close relationship with DJT was the only bit of the book that was surprising given his BFFship with the late Sen. McCain and generally convivial relationship with some Senate Democrats. The late night phone chats with Trump and the musings of wanting to remove McConnell from Senate leadership gives quite a new view of the Senator from South Carolina.<br/><br/>‘Fear’ is full of such accountings.<br/>However, given everything that has come out daily on the NYT and WaPo, much of what’s in the book should not surprise. A good read to close out 2018.
 The book sets out in a serial chronological order, residential within each section the comments of all the players in policy making positions.  But gives little insight about the activity and activity of the support staff.  Thus, there is a marked discontinuity to the story. I got the sense that there was a lot of repetition, which detracted from.The narrative.  All in all, however, Woodward sets out a most disturbing account of a president who.is so far out of his league as to be fundamentally incomletent
 I have great respect for Bob Woodward, and purchased his book to gain insight into the administration of the worst president in the history of our republic.  I am glad I purchased it, but am also more concerned than I was before.<br/>What I nightmare we are living through.
 The strongest aspect of this book is that Woodward excels at making the reader feel that he/she is actually there in the White House, witness to infighting, bitter debates, and frequent personality clashes among President Trump and his top aides.  The chaos and confusion of White House operations is presented in fascinating and frightening detail.  On the other hand, a major weakness of this book is the reliance on those (few?) inside sources who actually were willing to speak to Woodward.  The narrative too often was tilted toward these sources trying to make themselves look good.  For example, Steve Bannon is obviously a major source for much of the behind the scenes action described in this book, some if which seemed very self-serving.  The reader sees President Trump primarily through a few top aides, especially those critical of him.  Trump himself comes across as an impulsive, immature egomaniac woefully unprepared to be President, and unwilling (or unable) to grow into the job.  Readers can draw their own conclusions, but this book at least makes one seriously evaluate our President and future direction of our country.
 I don't know how I want to rate Fear. Yes, it's an interesting read, with some great takes regarding the dysfunctional white house and the people who occupy. BUT. I can't help but feeling it's only half a story. All the interviews that make the story are on deep background with people who have an agenda. They all want to be painted in the best light, and don't want to burn bridges so they paint Trump with a biased brush.<br/><br/>The takeaway I kept picking up was: yes, Trump is a blowhard with a lying problem, but that's only because he's too busy and important to remember details. And honestly, I don't care because he's an unhinged monster.<br/><br/>I'm not mad that I didn't get what I wanted from Fear, I just feel it's not a fully fleshed story.
 Thank you for writing this informative book.  It is a page turner!
 If you have been reading the papers, there is not much new or surprising here.  Yes, Woodward adds some details with respect to conversations, contents of some meetings, and a few choice quotes, but there is little here that will alter the big-picture view.  The emphasis is on national security, trade policy and the Russian investigation, and there are some national security details that were new to me.  You will read nothing about Pruitt and the EPA, education or housing, for example.  Dowd, Trump's lawyer, gets a lot to say on the Russian investigation, but the merits of the investigation are given haphazard treatment.  In fact, the whole book seems more like a summary of Woodward's conversations with those people willing to talk to talk to him (mostly on background) rather than an attempt to provide an overarching history of the first 14 months or so of the administration.  Woodward paints a picture of Trump as an inept, indecisive, self-absorbed, bumbling conman who is a compulsive liar, but that much has been crystal clear since 2015 if not before.  That those who work most closely with him, including his lawyers, should reach the same conclusion is no surprise.
 Enjoyed the book,  even though I have lived it though the news daily... sometimes hourly.  It was especially entertaining,  however,  to feel like a fly on the wall when it all was happening. ﻿ The documentation  and research notes were very complete.﻿
 Good authoritative reporting, but If you have followed the pres coverage of the book, it's really not necessary to read it.  Lots of padding. It could have been a longish magazine article and not left anything important out. Listen to the "Fresh Air" interview and you've got it.
 Vacillating between four and five stars---A very good read, but ya just gotta take it as one mans view with nobody to refute or challenge what is said.  I'm not a Trump fan, and he often really embarrasses me as an American, but the book is unrelenting in it's attacks and bashing on and of the man.  This book is making me seek out more things to read on the subject of this president and his administration, in an effort to get my head around how badly I really feel about the whole deal.<br/>In any case, I'd recommend reading the book while keeping an open mind and looking for more to read to fill out your knowledge of theses onerous times.
 Pretty much confirms what we've heard and seen about a President who wants his own way, despite strong advice. What I didn't expect and found fascinating was the "facts" behind the issues . Tariffs are just bad, period, and the President just can't relate to it (much of his decision making is based on Campaign promises, whether right or wrong). Trump to me is right about Afghanistan and the discussion and conflicting advice from the generals reveals a real waste of personnel and money. But to continue to support a child-like President who just thinks he can have his own way on everything  is foolhardy.  Who in your own lives would you accept this kind of behavior from?
 I have the utmost respect for Mr. Woodward.  I've read many of his books beginning with Watergate to Fear.  I think Mr. Woodward is honest and trustworthy.  With that said, I was disappointed in this book.<br/><br/>The information in the book has been all over the news, so no bombshell there.  Quite a bit of the dialogue had quote marks on some of the dialogue, with a lot of a conversation had no quote marks, but seemed to be a continuation of the same conversation.  That may just be me and being rather critical of that type of writing.<br/><br/>This is what I learned from this book.  Donald Trump is an arrogant man, with an ego larger than the Grand Canyon.  I learned that he is abusive and dismissive to anyone that he perceives as being smarter than he is.  I learned that most of the people that work for him think he's an idiot, an egocentric and a baby in a man's suit.<br/><br/>Sorry, but that really is nothing that everyone out there already knew.  I felt like I was reading a year's worth of newspapers.
 Woodward is an amazing author and journalist.  His behind the scenes look at the Trump White House is eye opening
 As a political independent who has ‘wild’ (unrealistic!) dreams of the GOP and DNC working together again for the benefit of the US and the world, I was strongly against Trump from the very beginning of his presidential candidacy.  My opinion was based on observations of Trump’s long-term erratic and self-centered behavior, in which he has acted in an unethical, racist, sexist, and narcissistic manner.  This book provides detailed confirmation of these behaviors in a credible ‘insider’ (you are there!) non-judgmental format.  I would highly recommend this book for everybody, and sincerely hope that it will assist with derailing the Trump train before the consequences of his leadership are truly catastrophic to the world.  It is quite a nightmare to have someone with a junior-high-school maturity as president of the US.
 I give this three stars mostly because I have the highest respect for Bob Woodward as a journalist and a man of integrity. I grew up with Woodward and Bernstein and they chronicled history in a way much more understandable than any of my modern American history classes. I believe that Woodward is the stuff that legends are made from. But. I was expecting more about the brief presidency to date than war, war strategy, complete conversations between generals, and complete conversations regurgitated from everyone. Way too much detail. I do have a better understanding of the calamitous behind-the-scenes workings of the West Wing, but I wanted more in-depth descriptions, from interviews, of staffers other than military. If you love war details, decisions, and military strategy from the last year and a half, this book is for you.
 This book mostly confirms what I feel that I have known all along. It's helpful to have my suspicions confirmed by a reliable reporter such as he.
 When this book came out, all you heard about were the 'shocking' revelations from members of his cabinet and staff, so basically everything you heard about in the promos you already knew going into the book.  Much of the book revealed recycled news stories, but in many cases it expanded in areas where I might've had limited knowledge.  It does prove though, that when his staff condemned the book as 'total lies', they didn't read it at all.  Much of it had been reported already, and every source was well documented chapter by chapter at the end of the book.  I wish I had referred to that after reading each chapter but I didn't.
 I'm not sure how I feel about this book. I follow the news and other reports so didn't find that much new here. I abhor Trump - his language, his disdain for almost eveyone, his inability to tell the truth, the generations of damage he's inflicting on our country, his assault on women. I was hoping to find my own vindictiveness against Trump ratified in these pages. To some extent, I did find that. But more, I finished reading with sadness. I don't find any good guys/girls here. I don't see a way to undo the damage in the near future or even for a long time. Today, in a casual, apolitical conversation, a friend said, "I don't worry too much about anything because we're heading into Armageddon anyway." I wanted to hate Trump. At some level I probably do. But more than evil or amoral , he seems like a pathetic, lost, lonely human being.  We need to remove him from office and then pray for his soul.
 Bob Woodward (of Woodward &amp; Bernstein 'Watergate' fame) has written a book about every president in his adult lifetime.  This is another very accurate portrayal of the traitor that Vladimir Putin &amp; Russia helped put into our White House.  They used to shoot traitors...hopefully, the Democrats will take over the House at midterms this Tuesday and proceed to start impeachment proceedings.  I NEVER thought I'd live to see a traitor in our White House; but, obviously, I have - along with his whole 'fandamily' (as my late husband who was born and raised in Brooklyn, NY, used to say).
 Woodward is very even-handed in his writing, which is excellent, and isn't a go-for-the-throat author.  That said, reading this book both answers and raises a lot of questions.  I'm definitely not a Trump backer and, if you are, well, I sort of feel sorry for you and angry at the same time.  Many of Woodward's "revelations" are a matter of public info, and that alone, assembled in one place, is enough to give any thinking person pause.  Now, if you enjoyed this book and want to be totally scared, read House of Trump-House of Putin.  It really might pull things together even better, tho Unger doesn't dive into any major, unsubstantiated conclusions either.
 with all the hype i was really looking forward to this book being the definitive take down of trump. that said, i was disappointed ... it's a laborious read and contains a lot of "quotes" which aren't attributed to anyone. while i beleive woodward accurately describes the general look and feel of the whitehouse the way the dialogue is portrayed makes "fear" less than credible.
 Purporting to be an account of Trump's first year as President of the United States of America.<br/><br/>This is an entertaining read, and it left me feeling unexpectedly sympathetic for our president (who I find divisive, unlikeable and risible on most occasions). You could have knocked me down with a feather.<br/><br/>I'm sure that the story is much as is told between these covers.<br/><br/>BUT.<br/><br/>A careful reader will note that conversations that start off in quotes often continue outside those quotes, which were closed after the first few words. Woodward is writing a story here, not a biography or a history, and a wise reader will make note of when he switches voice from quoting to storytelling mode.<br/><br/>I expected nothing else so I'm giving the book five stars. It makes riveting reading, but one should be careful about engaging one's outrage at an anecdote that is not, when all is said and done, direct quotes from those involved.
 Captured me from page one. I only wish it was fictional. Regardless, Bob Woodward creates yet another masterpiece that readers get to enjoy.
 I was expecting a book written by someone who just doesn't like Trump.  Instead, the book starts with only very mild disapproval of him.  Then it goes, day by day, discussing how this White House works, and the reality slowly sinks in.  It isn't filled with gotcha moments, but it does capture the endless incompetence of this President.  Well worth reading, and will probably be a movie eventually.
 Disappointed the book makes broad accusations without naming sources.  Sorry...an entire book that is double hearsay is fiction.
 Excellent book, I could not put it down. It's a cross between a diary &amp; a horror novel, only the horror is our own real life nightmare. These people slithering around in the white house are a million miles away from ever being heros. They are lower than cowards just like 45. This administration is no swamp, it's a disgusting cesspool. There is absolutely nothing that is even remotely decent about trump, his three eldest kids, kushner, or the gop. 45 is a very destructive, sadistic, imbecile &amp; thrives on turmoil &amp; runs on complete ignorance &amp; hate. We're in danger. It's happened before &amp; it's happening again.
 Initially, I thought Woodward's " Fear" added little to the now infamous anonymous Op Ed published shortly before the publication of the book.  Both writers address the grave existential dangers posed by a U.S. president unfit for office. Woodward's "Fear" presents and corroborates more than enough evidence to reasonably conclude that Trump is dangerously unfit for office and needs a minder 24/7, a conclusion shared by and acted upon by more than one member of his inner circle. My one quibble is that  "Fear" jumps from incident to incident in seemingly random order, and the text proper  ends abruptly with the departure of Trump lawyer John Dowd.  Woodward witnessed a White House so chaotic and dysfunctional that he may have felt that overtly organizing the chapters might underplay Trump's dangerous disdain of facts and agreed upon procedures. Not to worry. Woodward's fidelity to facts clearly shows the devil in the details.
 Anyone who read this book already knows that Trump is an international disaster. He lies, he doesn't read, he can't control his temper, he makes decisions based on no rhyme or reason. Did I mention he lies? Over and over. Like, the man simply cannot tell the truth. Veteran White House Reporter for the Washington Post, and multiple Pulitzer Prize winning author Bob Wooward pretty much confirms these traits, and provides some surprising insight into the workings, or lack thereof, of this White House. Supporting Woodward alone is worth the price of the book.
 I bought the book expecting a screed given the pre-release hype. I should have known better given that the author was Bob Woodward. A balanced and seemingly well researched perspective of the first 14 months of the Trump Administation, there are few surprises, some interesting perspectives, and a very unexpected view of the Mueller investigation. Read it, come to your own conclusions, but I was pleasantly surprised.
 Bob Woodward is a preeminent reporter, thus it should not surprise that his best selling book about the Trump administration is a work of meticulous reportage, and purely reportage; it is not an opinion piece. It is based largely on interviews with White House staff and other participants in or bystanders to the unprecedented events of the first two years of a historically aberrant presidency. The interviews were mostly recorded, leading Woodward to adapt an unusual style that I found jarring at first: Parts of a conversation will be in quotations and others, though continuing in a conversational manner, will not be, implying that they were recounted by the source. Sources are given in extensive endnotes; and the flow of the narrative draws the reader in.<br/><br/>The revelations are of course stunning: the lacunae in the president’s knowledge of issues; impetuous orders given in the morning and forgotten by afternoon; his mafia-style obsession with loyalty. His economic advisor from Goldman-Sachs was astounded when the president suggested that the Treasury could solve the deficit problem by printing more money. Staff had to quash an order to withdraw support from South Korea when Trump refused to believe that vital intelligence on the North was part of our treaty relationship. On the golf course with Lindsey Graham, he solicited the senator’s “100 percent” loyalty, complaining that his was only “82 percent.” Graham was nonplussed.<br/><br/>The fact that White House staff and career civil servants at other government institutions are having to hold the fort against their own leader is the most revealing thing about Woodward’s work. They are thrust into this position by a Republican congress that stubbornly refuses to exercise its constitutional responsibility of oversight. The situation is strongly reminiscent of the presidency of Andrew Johnson following the assassination of Lincoln, when General Grant rebuffed the president in no uncertain terms. Johnson was the first president to face impeachment.<br/><br/>Though a bit wonkish in places, the book is hard to put down by virtue of its accumulation of dumbfounding information. Even as I lost track of the players at times, I kept reading in amazement, and aptly, given the title, in growing fear. But the title is from Mr. Trump’s own words during his campaign that “real power is fear” - an ironical statement from a man whose supreme insecurities are now on such public display. Woodward’s book deserves to be a best seller; it is foundational to the history that is unfolding. After reading it, I will be surprised if there is not a challenger to Trump in the Republican primary in 2020. It will be one of the Generals already serving in loco.
 This book could have been entitled 'Your Worst Fears... Are True.' In meticulous detail, Woodward has produced a compelling indictment of the Trump presidency, exposing in excruciating detail the malevolence and amorality that permeate this, the most corrupt administration in history. Anyone who did their homework before the election knew that a Trump presidency was going to be bad, very bad, but Woodward's research, described in this riveting and profoundly disturbing book, makes clear that it is far worse than anyone could have possibly imagined. A must read for every thinking American.
 I felt as if I were a "fly on the White House wall" as I read the book, "Fear".  Woodward gets right to the meat of many of the meetings that Trump had with his Senior Staff and with those under them and didn't drone on and on with irrelevant bits of information.  I wondered as I read, How did Woodward get all this information?  I'm still wondering as is, I'm sure, Trump and his staffers.  Although I'm a registered Republican I could not bring myself to vote for Trump and, almost 2 years post election and after having read this book, I'm very relieved that I did not.  I realize that I am very grateful that we have a government that has stood the test of time and that there ARE people in the White House (various staffers) who know how our government should be run.  I pray that they are able to keep things under control.
 I thoroughly enjoyed this. It felt like confirmation of what I already suspected with the additional benefit of background and context. It took me a while to get through this because life gets busy. As a result, and because of the rapid fire news cycle we’re living in, the book already feels outdated and it just came out. It’s a wild ride and “Fear” is an excellent field guide.
 Woodward clearly interviewed a ton of people (especially Rob Porter and Steve Bannon, the latter loves to blab).  I'm sure everything he tells us about Trump is true, which is very depressing.  I just wish the book wasn't so disjointed.  It isn't chronological, it isn't topical, it seems to jump around a lot, so it's easy to lose track of somebody being discussed who you last saw 10 chapters ago.  A good editor might have made it more coherent.
 Woodward writes I a strictly he said, then he said, then she said manner. So no narrative arc at all. each chapter covers completely different people/meetings events...sometimes paragraph to paragraph within a chapter.<br/>nevertheless, once you get used to this somewhat choppy style the book is riveting. I kind of fills in why Porter was kept on so long even after Kelly knew of his spousal abuse. the level of back stabbing, undercutting and out and out shiftiness described as SOP behavior in the White House is truly breathtaking.<br/>the level of amateurism and downright ignorance of important subject matter - defense, geopolitics, economics, statecraft - is astonishing. For that many people to be making decisions about economic policy who really (no kidding) have difficulty understanding the difference between the federal debt, the federal deficit and trade deficits. Who do not understand the interconnectedness of fiscal policy, economic trade agreements and international defense treaties and domestic security.<br/>Its so much worse than rah-rah, rally rally, wall wall....that's only the distraction from the true horror of the keystone kops  blowing smoke up the butt of a self-deceptive, ill-informed rage-aholic.
 An important book by an incredible journalist.  Trump and his supporters can cry, "Fake news!", but the facts don't lie.  History will rememberTrump as an incompetent, dangerous (in so many ways), amoral, self-obsessed pathological liar... just like he is shown to be in this book by Bob Woodward.
 It's a short book - shorter than I expected. It mostly follows a timeline and covers the various important events in Trump's campaign and presidency, many of them I wasn't aware of or had to realise their importance in hindsight, but I found the ending a tad abrupt., even if the ending line is a nice one. It's very matter of fact written, without obvious biases, but scary once you realise what's happening.<br/><br/>What I didn't like was that the direct quotes and other quotes were often mixed up - you had a direct quote in quote marks, followed by a sentence that was written as if it was a direct quote, but wasn't in quote marks, in a dialogue. That was confusing, in my opinion. That would have been better with indirect speech being used instead.
 If you read no other book in 2018, this is the one to read. To Trump opponents, this reveals why you oppose him. To Trump supporters, this should give you pause and to think why you support him. This is not  “Fake News”, unless you believe all his sources are liars and colluded against Trump. Bob Woodward has too long a history of telling the truth to be a liar at this stage in his life. Read the book.
 Toddler in  charge of our country.  Sad!  Believe every word written in this book -  not only sad but extremely frightening.
 Bob Woodward's expertly reported account of Donald Trump, the key players in his administration and the events that have unfolded over the past two years in the White House paint a devastating portrait. He provides a detailed behind the scenes look at an administration that seems to be in a perpetual state of turmoil. Many of the stories are based on deep background interviews, but it's frequently easy to spot who the sources are. Sharing their perspectives on what they went through while working at the White House with Woodward perhaps brought them a kind of catharsis. A scary account of what goes on there. At times, the telling of the story seemed a little choppy, especially toward the end, and it seemed to kind of break off at an abrupt point when I thought I was only about 62% of the way through the ebook. But otherwise a commendable piece of reportage.
 I have long been a Woodward reader, and this book is rewarding and discouraging all at the same time.  The window he has look through is discouraging---how can a government function with this kind of leadership.  How did this man get elected.  Woodward leads one through how the system works, the emotion insecurity of the President , his almost total lack of understanding, or willingness to learn, and self centered approach to governing and decision making.<br/>  But one question nags me throughout the book.  How can Woodward quote a conversation when he was not in the room, and I find it hard to think anyone involved would have reported the content of the conversation.  He claims to have sources, and he has lots of footnotes to document things, but I still wonder about the accuracy of some things he reports on.  how did he get that information?  (But this does not detract from it being a worth while book !)
 Bob Woodward is an exceptional writer.  Very thorough, detail oriented and I trust him to accurately tell his story.  I have far more confidence in Woodward than in Trump.  The book is an expose of some truly troubling actions taken by Trump and I hope it leads to further scrutiny into his competency to complete serving his term in office.  After reading the book, and particularly yesterday's breaking story about tax fraud and illegal receipt of funds from his father, I would hope Trump will move back to New York sooner rather than later.  That's if he doesn't wind up in prison.
 Overall I enjoyed the book.  Unfortunately, all the news channels, at least here in the U.S. had given away some of the more shocking allegations.  The only real surprise for me was getting to 65% (Kindle version) and that was it.  After that was thank you's followed by a LOT of footnotes on sources outside of "deep background" which was then followed by an index.  So don't be surprised when you get 2/3 of the way through the book and it just sort of stops.
 Although I have not been not a fan of Trumps, this book gave me a different view of him.  I honestly thought of him being a conniving ego centric person, but I came away thinking that he really does want to do the right thing, but unfortunaly does not have the mental tools to pull it off.  Contrary to the hype, he is not a very bright guy.  He can not seem to get out of his own way.  He does not follow the advise of those he put into place to advise him because he really does not have the faculties to understand what he is presented with.
 Trump is dumber than I thought possible. He is ignorant of most things and yet he has zero interest or curiosity to learn. Woodward lays it all out for the world to see. Love the last sentence of the book.
 Honestly, for those who follow politics (from a balanced variety of news outlets) this book offers very little new revelations. It's just another source that offers verification that Donald Trump is in fact a sociopathic liar who has no clue what he is doing. Maybe the pedigree of the author lends some additional weight to the words for some people. It didn't for me.<br/><br/>In addition, all the juicier details were already revealed in the media storm surrounding the books release, so I'm not entirely sure who this book is for.
 It is more confirmation of the state of disarray in the White House but adds very little new to what has already been discussed ad infinitum on television news and online. Still it is chilling once again to read  in black and white how disconnected the man in the White House is from the realities of world and domestic situations.  Woodward's style is breezy and it is a quick and easy read. Still the true scholarly book about this situation has yet to be written. Perhaps in such a volatile situation, it cannot be right now (look at the past week.)
 One major floor in the product is that you cannot get to individual chapters from the index. It is very hard to read This way. The book yourself is very interesting.
 What I have read so far provides interesting understanding into the man who is now president of the United States.  This book is well-researched with documentation that in many cases reveals what has been going on behind the scenes.  I find that one of the most chilling statements is right at the beginning of the book that then candidate Donald Trump made to Mr. Woodward on March 31, 2016.  Trump stated "Real power is--I don't even want to use the word--fear."  Readers should draw their own conclusions after reading this book.
 Although tidbits of some of the information in the book was already known and analyzed ad nauseum on network news, the backstory is what I appreciated reading to get a better understanding of many of the issues and the mind/behaviors of our president. I found the book well written with credible information. Whether you are supportive of President Trump or not, I believe readers will be challenged to analyze and understand why our country is in such turmoil, and have a clearer understanding of why world leaders are laughing at Trump and why many Americans fear Trump in the White House. Well written by a well respected journalist. A must read to better understand why there is so much chaos in the White House,  in America, and around the world. Trumps management style is evidently via using and creating  chaos. Unfortunately, the butterfly effects it is creating is dangerous and unsettling.
 I was expecting to read more about how Trump operated and less about how the White House operated around him. If one wanted to know just how dysfunctional, conniving, despicable politicians and generals can be, it is textbook. What little respect I held for Republicans is not long gone and not retrievable. I was disgusted. I'm surprised this book was touted as being about Trump... it really wasn't so much. It did, however, show him to be weak and pretty much an ignorant moron in every way ... there is nothing there to admire.
 This is the third book I have purchased that is about Trump and his administration. It got the most respectful hype from mainstream media of any of them, because of the reputation of Bob Woodward. But something seems to have happened to Mr. Woodward as he made the journey from young upstart scandal-breaker to elder statesman. He became the quintessential beltway insider. A lot of the book was just plain boring, minutiae about policy decisions and disagreements about them between factions, not anything that I really was interested in. The book gave a lot of ink to Rob Porter, the wife-beater, and only at the end of the book mentions his predilection for abusing the weaker sex. I think that the other so-called gossipy books were much better than this. But it was interesting enough to rate three stars - just not as good as I had expected.
 I pre-ordered the kindle version book and my only disappointment was that of the 400 pages, a substantial chunk was eaten up by the back-notes.  When I was at less than 70% done, the book ended. I wanted more! Besides the pre-publication tidbits, I got several new perspectives.  Earlier I did not have a sense of Rob Porter; I'd missed him in the previously published sagas. I also felt that I understood Mattis and McMaster in a clearer context and I felt more positively toward them than before.  When reading history, I often ask myself who I'd most like to have dinner with. After reading Fear, I'd go with Bannon! He's a strange figure with whom I agree about nothing, but it would be a fascinating dinner.
 Lesson for pols: Always talk to Woodward.  He'll make you look like a hero.  Clearly, the people who talked are Cohn, Porter, Priebus, Graham and Dowd, probably McMaster and Tillerson, and maybe even Mattis and Kelly.  Woodward's skill is in getting sources to talk—he’s the best ever—but, he's actually not a very good writer.  The book is somewhat disjointed.  A bunch of very interesting/shocking/alarming insider war stories—some long, some very brief—strung together to give you a fly-on-the-wall spot in the Oval Office.  And then it just ends.  No wrap-up or conclusion.  It feels like this book was rushed to hit a certain strategically-determined publishing date.  Clearly this is just the first of a series of books Woodward has in the works about the Trump presidency.  It’s almost too easy given how much crazy stuff happens on a daily basis and how many new sources will emerge as more important players leave the administration.  I can’t wait to read them all!
 ...and Woodward is good at describing the chaos within the White House.  He fails to master his main thesis, however:  how Trump uses fear to gather and use political power.  The "details" of the book are quite remarkable, but if we are to believe that Trump collects his strength through fear, how does he do it?  Machiavelli was strategic.  The only strategy in Trump's world is to be spontaneously and self-righteously angry, spewing molten insults whenever he is blocked, mocked, or criticized.<br/><br/>Still, I had fun, in a horror-stricken way, reading this book.
 Reading this book was almost historical. It's like once Bob Woodward writes a  book about a political subject. You know and expect this to be a higher level of investigation, more accurate than most. With no disrespect to other authors of the many books I have read on this shocking political event Bob Woodward is the writer that all other books of political issues are compared to. It's like in country music all writers are compared to Hank Williams. There are just legends in all creative fields that are the measuring stick of success. So I had high expectations of this book, and it exceeded beyond ....
 Followers of the legitimate news already know that the current occupant of the White House is a self-centered liar with a short attention span, a love of flattery, little knowledge of or interest in history, impetuous, and generally unqualified for office. This book substantiates these impressions with many examples, most of which are amply supported by extensive notes and evidence cited at the back of the book. We learn how easily Mr. Trump is manipulated by flattery, how needy his ego is, and how many of his staff work to moderate Trump's worst impulses. For all of this, Woodward deserves great credit and has done a public service.<br/><br/>The book is not especially well written.  Partly, this impression is due to the straightforward use of items without transitions or editorial comments. At other times, the writing is simply not good. These gripes of mine should not dissuade readers from buying this book. One hopes that Republicans and Independents will read this book and see how Mr. Trump is a threat, and how Congress must stop playing dead and start pushing back against the President.
 This was not an easy book to read.  Reading how the Trump campaign and administration blundered through one crisis after another of its own making was incredibly demoralizing.  The presidency is the highest office in the land.  Is it unreasonable to expect the person we elect to that office be at least moderate competent?  All Americans should read this book to understand how we were tricked into electing a unstable, egotistical, criminal.
 You will not be able to stop reading this book. Joe Biden once remarked that Trump is “woefully unprepared”to be Presidenlt.  Beside the fact that he is amoral, his intellectual laziness is apalling and scary.
 Well, I just finished this book, and all I can say is that I wish that every citizen would read it since we are living a history that will be studied for hundreds of years if climate change doesn’t get us first.  My main takeaway: Trump is only the tip of the iceberg of greed, derangement and willful inability to learn along with putting himself over country. He is surrounded by syncophants he’s hired and in Congress who perpetuate the lies that everything is okay and functioning in the White House and won’t speak the truth directly to the American people.  Shame on every last one of them.
 I pre-ordered this in hopes of getting some real meaty "VIP only" information. But, I was greatly disappointed. Anyone who wants to read this book could likely guess the contents. There is nothing really revealing or "smoking gun" oriented. It is an uninspiring read and likely to attract more dust than attention after you read the first chapter (not that the first chapter is that enticing, but if you pay for it, you will want to at least finish the first chapter).<br/>If you just listen to the news and talking heads, both sides of it, and you will get almost as much insight as this book gives. There were a few moments where it was "wow, that was interesting", but in the end, it was a disappointing waste of my time. If you hate Trump, it just made you angry, if you love Trump, it just made you think it was a liberal attack.<br/>Think of how many times recently when you have watched political TV and had this book or its contents mentioned. I would guess zero, and that's how many people I would recommend it to.
 Well written and researched account of chaos!  A  deep reminder of our responsibility as citizens to  VOTE!  We must take control of our country.
 An amazing read. What you're hearing in the media is the tip of the iceberg. While Trump shouts, "Work of fiction," we know Woodward's historical relevance has been high with his other "president" books. And he claims to have taped most of the interviews. Let's see how this one plays out. Fantastic reporting. Quick read. Damning conclusions.
 The reader is dramatically injected into a dizzying whirlwind of unrelenting drama with non-stop melt-downs, spectacles, and confrontations in the world's most fully engaging reality show. The book leaves you with a feeling of how precarious things may be, hope for a change that is inevitable and immanent, and a greater sense of how the Trump administration operates, both good and bad. You feel you are in the room as the decision making is happening, recalling all of the "breaking news" moments from the past two years. It may liberate you, it may disgust you, but surely it will not bore you. A great read.
 The book is actually excellent was a bit skeptical after purchasing Fire and Fury. Bob Woodward built a reputation of authenticity still until I was able to read the book remained uncertain.  In the period of Trumpism, everyone has lost faith in truth.  An important book to educate all Americans on the importance of voting and changing the manner we elect for any office
 Surprisingly detailed insight into how the White House functions or – far too often – doesn't. Not a lot of new headlines but when strung together with the everyday minutia involved in running the World's biggest Superpower, it makes for an interesting read. Bottomline, if you like Trump and the way he thumbs his nose at the establishment, 362 pages later you'll likely feel the same. But if you're convinced he smells of  sulfur and walks on cloven hoofs... Woodward does little to disabuse you of that notion. The biggest surprise? Hmmm... Maybe that Trump allegedly watches 6 to 8 hours of cable news each day. (Can't be healthy!) Oh, and that little thing about nearly going to war with N Korea over a tweet. Biggest disappointment? That I still don't know the ending.
 The book is excellent.  It's also a fast read.  Well written by a journalist who is trusted to check and recheck his sources.  In some ways, the first part of the book seems like things we already knew - if you've been paying attention to the news coverage of the Trump administration.  The last half bring forward things not well known, but certainly concerning, if not downright frightening.  Everyone in the country should be reading this book.  Whether you love Trump or hate him, it's necessary to see how the man approaches the most important job in the world.
 Kudos to Woodward for his important book.<br/>He brings decades of journalistic integrity  and experience to this inside-look at Trump in the White House.  The book chronicles the near-constant chaos and dysfunction behind-the-scenes,  fueled by an erratic, impulsive and aggressive President with no experience in global foreign policy or the fundamental workings of government.  It is still staggering to me that this blustering showman is at the helm of the country.  Woodward’s book illustrates why there is so much cause for concern and alarm.<br/>The book is straightforward and exhaustively-researched.  Amid all the spin and lunacy that we’ve become accustomed to,  it’s refreshing to find a factual account from a trusted source.  A highly-recommended read.
 Give Mr. Woodward kudos: he managed to write an entire book about our current White House without expressing opinion.  I give him four instead of five stars however because of the paucity of facts.  This is not to blame Mr. Woodward.  It is difficult to see how anyone could get any meaningful fact out of our current White House, much less anything approaching uncomplimentary.  Who amongst those working there, whose livelihood and reputation depend upon those facts, would in our current climate step up and be honest and forthcoming?  Fear is a worthwhile read, however in the hindsight of history it will be no more than supplemental to those works that will follow, that will benefit from the blessing of the 20/20 vision the future provides.
 To learn that the orange leader of our doomed country knows so little about foreign policy, nor does he care to learn or even listen to people who have been in 'the-know', is utterly terrifying!  Its already bad enough that he shows no empathy or humility but that he is also a blithering idiot with the attention span of a newt is even scarier.
 With measured tones, Woodward recounts what his sources reveal about the workings of Trump’s mind in different situations.  The parade of White House staff and administration players reveal different nuances of what may drive Trump, and how he maintains the Oval Office seat using these dedicated workers, and then turning them aside when they get in his way.  Strangely, I feel less fear over Trump’s era knowing that men and women of sanity are still working around him, trying to keep a lid on the madman who sits behind the desk..
 In these confusing, tumultuous days, this book is simply a must read. Being the respected journalist/author he is, it’s my opinion that Bob Woodward did more than his due diligence in gathering his information. This book illuminated for me why things have happened and are happening as they are with the portrait of a deeply troubling president possibly teetering on the edge of mental illness or at the least, being a confused, unempathetic narcissist and pathological liar. While I needed to take a break between chapters early on to digest what I was reading, the further I got the more I felt I “knew” what Trump was and the shock value decreased.<br/><br/>It also helped me to not take anything he says remotely serious since it is VERY apparent throughout this book, and what I’ve long suspected beforehand, that the WH is being run by everyone EXCEPT the president. Although Bannon and many of those that surrounded the Trump campaign are not my favorites, I must admit they were masterful (particularly Bannon and Conway) in turning a self destructive campaign into one that won the highest office in the land. Whether they will believe that was the right decision rests with them, but I readily give them complete credit, as does Woodward. Brilliant strategists is an understatement. That said, this book could literally have continued to the present day since the problems present in this president show no signs of abating as he completes gaffe, after gaffe, after gaffe. My sympathies and empathy actually go out to those who Woodward described perfectly as doing their damnest to help the country and to those still trying. It’s comforting to know that those people do exist in the WH and I thank Woodward for providing that hope to me.
 Not only a great read, but ties together a lot of information out there that Michael Wolf, Omarosa, Tony Schwartz, David Cay Johnston have also said about the Carnival-Barker-in-Chief.
 FEAR is written in a comprehensive way, allowing the everyman to follow along and understand. The content of FEAR is terrifying. Having a window into the Trump whitehouse gave me nightmares. This president did not expect to win, has no idea what he is doing, and had no plan how to govern the country after taking the oath. Scary stuff, good read.
 You feel like you’re a fly on the wall. The chaos and uncertainty in this administration is mind blowing. Thank you, Mr. Woodward for you’re incredible work.
 This is an important book covering very depressing material about a President that is clearly not qualified for the job.  It is also clear that his VP and Congressional Republicans are not doing their duty to the country.
 Bob Woodward gives us the background behind the daily news about the White House. The sad thing is that it is worse than we imagined. Excellent writer and storyteller so quick read
 If you have not followed the news for the last 2 1/2 years, this book would be educational. Anyone who has kept up with the daily developments of this administration would see this only as a recap.
 The book flowed smoothly. I had a much harsher opinion of Trump before reading this book. The authors were very fair in their presentation of him and although I do not want him to be our president, I realize that some of his decisions were done by recommendations from other people.
 Goodness, this will make your hair stand up. My suspicions are confirmed. We are in deep trouble by this leadership. He is not suited in anyway to be a leader of a powerful country. He has no real qualifications for the job. His children being there with him is ridiculous. They are not qualified either. I believe Bannon is honest with his views regarding this presidency and the WH staff and cabinet. I don’t have any respect for bannon as a person. He helped a fake person become a fake, ill equipped  president.
 Bob Woodward is a respected journalist.  If the behind the scenes episodes reported here are accurate, it is indeed frightening.  Who is in charge?  The president seems to be easily swayed by the most current proposal by a strongly motivated confidant. He is forgetful and ruled by his emotions. The book is aptly titled.
 Well written, veritable, well-balanced, understated, this gives the reader a sense of having inside info into the operation of current politics in and around the Whitehouse. The chapters are I suppose necessarily incomplete, the story being ongoing as it is. The portrayal of Trump's attorney, John Dowd, and his involvement with the Mueller investigation was interesting, as was the way Trump's generals blocked the President's plan to pull troops out of Afghanistan (and Trump's meeting with service members who had served on the ground there). Though the President's character is subtly satirized, the book is reserved and doesn't come off as a harsh criticism as much as wanly regretful.
 I'm about halfway through the book that I received four days ago from Amazon. It covers all the major issues and the discussions between the president and his advisors. This is a book that everyone who has any interest in how our government really works should be reading, and they should be encouraging their children in high school to read it. And yet I know most people don't read anymore  it's the truth], instead they turn on the TV to their preferred "news" channel and rely on the commentators to tell them about the book. I tell my granddaughter that no two people think alike. And yet books of this nature  and Woodward has written books about Clinton, Bush, and Obama] are so important. Seems strange that I might appear to be some kind of a snob for encouraging people to read a book.
 There are too many big words and not one picture! Such a boring book. I fell asleep while Ivanka was reading it to me in her bed. Also, who is this nomemiss…anewnoose…minniemouse person who keeps stealing my coloring books off my desk? Bad!
 Woodward paints a realistic and balanced view inside the Trump White House.  To be clear, I am not a trump supporter, but I discovered areas from the book where I am aligned with Trump’s thinking.  That was a pleasant surprise.  That said, Woodward descibes a shocking level of disfunction and disorganization in the West Wing.  I believe this is a mostly accurate description of the daily activities and actions of our most important government function
 Woodward does it again, another well written book that will keep me up at night (reading and worrying as well)
 A factual in depth analysis of participants involved in the ongoing time line of the trump regime.  The palace intrigue that exists at all levels and personalities involved are described at length.  The manipulation of the political environment that occurs daily to conform to an ever changing cult of personality is dismaying.  Overall a very in depth and factual expose’ of a president who is uninvolved and a regime leveraged to accomplish the same...
 I skipped most of the trump tell-alls except Michael Wolff's. Read Malcolm Vance and Corn/Isikoff on Russia so I pretty much knew what to expect. Bought this one solely because of Woodward's reputation for diligent reporting. No disappointment there.  Written in a series of chronological vignettes ending with Dowd's resignation, the book doesn't focus on any one event. Don't expect gossipy drivel but mostly attributed accounts of how trump (mis)handles  issues of state. If you only read one trump book, this is the one. Very frightening how completely unqualified trump is for the job.
 There is little you will read in Fear that you haven’t already heard before.<br/><br/>If you like Donald Trump, I don’t think you’ll dislike this book. He’s treated fairly, and I would go so far as to say he’s treated more fairly than many of the other figures that Woodward likes to take shots at in the book. If you like Donald, you’ll be sympathetic to his portrayal here. I think the recording Woodward released was just intended to gin up more publicity. This isn’t a “scathing” review of the Trump presidency.<br/><br/>There is no over-arching theme in this book. It’s not about how Trump is unfit. It’s not about how a former game show host got elected president. It’s just a series of anecdotes. It’s mostly just gossip, and Woodward flattering himself about his “access,” and how much he “knows” about the inner circles of national security.<br/><br/>It’s interesting, Anonymous, in The NY Times op-ed piece, mentions that there were early discussions regarding invoking the 25th Amendment. There is nothing mentioned in Fear about that. Either Woodward didn’t have as much access as he suggests, or Anonymous is a fraud.<br/><br/>The book ends rather abruptly, and Woodward seems to hint why. The end of the book has Dowd confronting Mueller and not understanding why the investigation is still going on. Dowd is convinced, through much of the book, that Trump has done nothing wrong, neither colluding with the Russians, nor obstructing justice by firing Comey. But he has seen first hand how Trump dissembles, and begins to have his doubts. He seems to think Mueller must have something.<br/><br/>This suggests to me that Woodward had a bunch of material about Trump, but it wasn’t very relevant to the real story he wants to write, which is the Mueller investigation. So he puts out Fear, which is really little more than a bunch of gossip, and kind of tees up his next book about the Mueller investigation.<br/><br/>Fear is not a great book, it’s not even a good book. Apart from some embarrassing quotes, it’s nothing we haven’t heard before from the leakiest administration in modern memory. I regret buying it.
 For all of us that have watched and followed this President, and his media circus...this only confirms and solidifies the extent of his pathology. Even the people with a vested interest in him succeeding...are amazed,  confounded, and scared .For those who support this abomination of a person...they will just write this off as another set of well documented lies. I do appreciate what I believe is a real representation of this individual through many different accomplished individuals experience. VERY scary ....
 Good chronology of first 14 months of probably the most dysfunctional presidency in US history. Trump lost the popular vote by almost 3 million. He still thinks he has a mandate to undo accomplishments of his great predecessor ( who was ranked 12th among 44 by presidential historians). The book had a lot of information known before but is an important historical document.
 Written like a reporter- he tries to report a series of facts and events but it comes across as a series of tedious details that seemingly have no point. No attempt to create a relationship with the reader or capture interest whatsoever. I was eager to see what this book would hold but the style had me skipping pages to try to see what his point is. Would not recommend.
 Mr. Woodward opened the White House doors for this reader. I enjoyed the progression and learning about all the different personalities (and egos) at play.  I am very concerned about a person with absolutely no knowledge or experience running this country, this book confirmed those fears. The people attempting to work with or around the current President are brave souls and, in some cases, sacrifice their reputation and careers.  Anything accomplished by the current administration will not be a result of solid Presidential leadership but from men and women surrounding the President and protecting the interests of this country from him. Thank you Mr. Woodward, for another thoughtful, factual and interesting book.
 The most recent from a great reporter.<br/>A lifetime of interesting insights.  I read this in two sittings.<br/>Highly recommended
 It is hard to read these books and not because I like trump,I don't. It is hard because his base loves him no matter what he does or says. I overheard some people talking the other day about trump. Two men and a woman the men loved everything trump but the wife said she likes his policies. It seems that it is ok what he is doing as long as they seem to be getting what they want. This book should be required reading to his base but they will just shout fake news
 This fleshes out the undisciplined and mercurial personality that is currently serving as President of the U.S., and though he is a known liar, I found myself having for someone who so thoroughly lacks the ability to self-reflect. If he were not in such a consequential position to affect the affairs of the nation, one would see it as a personal tragedy...but he is in this position, so it is just and right that judgement be made.<br/><br/>Trump did not create our national political and existential chaos, he just exploited it by using what has been created: idenity politics.<br/>We have gone from support of national creed in ‘e pluribus unum’ to fragmentation based on identity and politically motivated reasoning. When Trump is gone, this will remain.<br/><br/>Woodward has given us a mise-en-scene like view of the Trump presidency to tell a story that should disturb us, not just because it tells us about Trump’s dysfunctionality, and thus the presidency, but our own political dysfunctionality and inability to compromise on issues that fester and drain our national energy and will to act. Where it all goes...nobody knows!
 All the juicy bits have already been flogged to death in the media. Unlike Michael Wolfe's "Fire &amp; Fury", which was a fun read, "Fear" is a bit of a slog. Many of the chapters feel like newspaper articles that were stretched until they hit book length, without much thought about how to end them.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint, however, is it's clear who Woodward's sources are. Bannon, Rob Porter, Preibus and a few others are quoted at great length, and always in a positive fashion. I don't dispute the accuracy of their claims, though it would have been good to hear the rebuttal.<br/><br/>Honestly, if you've been watching the news regularly, you can give this one a pass.
 Review of Fear by Bob Woodward<br/><br/> As a mental health professional, I can see things about Trump from a psychological as well as a historical/political angle. Trump is politically illiterate. He doesn't know left from right. He doesn't know where the issues line up left and right. Being politically challenged makes a person vulnerable to a political spin trick that was perfected by the Fascists and is now used by right-wing libertarians. Phony Populism. The strategy is to appeal to the left and the extreme right at the same time and bet that politically illiterate voters do not see the contradiction. Hitler did it. Mussolini did it. Read The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. I think that's where Bannon found it. Bannon sold it to Trump. Bannon knows it's BS, but Trump swallowed it whole. Phony populism seems like a consistent philosophy to some. It gives Trump what he thinks is a moral compass. He desperately needs a moral compass. Everyone does.<br/>  Trump gave the Republicans the tax cut that they wanted, but he supports things that get him in hot water with the GOP. Most of his policy positions that anger the Republicans come from the left, not the right. He's against NAFTA. He wants out of Afghanistan. He says he hates globalism/free trade. He favors Tariffs. I'm a progressive, and I agree with those positions. They come from the left. Trump does not understand the bait and switch strategy. (Appeal to the left and right at the same time during the election, but after winning the election, you dump the left and serve the extreme right exclusively.) To run the bait and switch, you have to know what campaign promises go on the left and need to get ignored after winning to please the right. Trump is a patsy for the Republican Party, but he doesn't get the scam. (Populism goes on the left, not the right.) He's under pressure from the right to dump the populism, but he doesn't understand why and the Republicans are afraid to tell him why. This will not end well for the Republican Party.<br/>  Educating voters is important. I wrote a free political primer, and I give it away online. I wrote it to protect voters from the Fascist bait and switch, but I never expected a Republican president to be part of the scam without understanding how it works. Basic political science needs to be mandatory in HS. Political science is blocked out until college, and even then it's just an elective. For democracy to work, it is necessary that people have the information needed to make a rational political decision and be immune from simple propaganda tricks like the bait and switch.
 Wow! No wow though! Great read. Informative. We truly elected a nobody!  Trump comes off as he does in his tweets...... An amateur.
 A very interesting look inside the current White House, especially the people besides the president who are (or were) there. It's true that most of the juiciest stuff was on TV in excerpts but there's a lot of good info in here that the media didn't touch.<br/>I did deduct one star because it seemed like it was RUSHED out: there were tons of things such as quotation marks either not being where they should have been, or being where they should not have been, that should have been fixed before it was called done and ready to sell. Maybe it's been proofread and fixed by now, I don't know, but I'm not really likely to read it again, at least not any time soon.
 This book is like reading a true account of events that have been happening at the white house, It's NOT GLOOM and DOOM, simply a narrative of our Nation at risk. I also read the New York Times OP ED, I think our President is running scared with all of his denials and lies. He only goes to little towns for his base supporters. He has spent over 77 million tax dollars on his golf outings, yet never went to a war zone where our Warriors are at risk.
 I listen to it via audible. I am going to buy the book so I can read along with it. Where there is smoke there is fire and President Trump obviously shouldn't be in the job. The book was easy to listen to and reader was great. I'd buy copies for my family but it won't change there minds Thank you Bob Woodward.
 Everything we warned people about, only it’s worse seeing it in writing. This book only represents a portion of the Trumpnado and barely touches the TR’ussia GoT.<br/><br/>Woodward writes a good story and I can tell when he flubs some details, but none of his errors or omissions changes the fact that Trump is a runaway train that will run off the tracks at some point. But, will someone stop him before he takes the economy down with him?
 Not up to the minute and leaves you hanging.  Don’t bother.<br/>Might as well just read USA Today or the Post.
 After three solid nights of reading, I’m finished. Am I the only one in the country who is underwhelmed with the book? You know the story line, we’ve lived it day by day. You know the OMG excerpts, they were broadcast when newscasters got an advance copy. Yes, Trump is stupid, impetuous, and a liar. Brannon is a prime source in the book and portrays himself as the knight in shinning armor. Porter and others with reputations to rebuild do the same. And there is no commentary, no synthesis, just story line.
 Fear is the much-anticipated book by Bob Woodward about the first part of the Trump presidency. I didn't find much new, but I've followed Trump and news about him closely. I'm sure others were surprised by a lot in the book.<br/>The only thing that did surprise me was how much influence Rob Porter had. I suspect he was the source for many of the anecdotes, but up until now I thought of him as the 'wife-beater' and not someone who had that much power.<br/>Woodward is one of the deans of American newspapers, so he had access to a lot of sources, though it did seem that Porter and Bannon made the bulk of the contributions. The weight of the Woodward name is what gives this particular book its power.
 I was determined not to let this book defeat me! It seemed like it would never end! I almost gave up when my Kindle told me there was still 40% left. However, when I reached 65%, I found that the remainder of the book was basically a list of sources &amp; references. Obviously, Mr. Woodward did his homework.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of President Trump.....you will hate this book.....and probably wouldn't have purchased it, anyway. Not a fan? It will basically reinforce your belief that an idiot was elected as our president.<br/><br/>Either way, Mr. Woodward's writing style is very dry; making this a difficult book to read.
 4.5 stars.  This book is very good, and of course Bob Woodward's credentials are impeccable.  I did find the reading a little dry at times, and it really is nothing we haven't heard before.  Also be aware that if you are paying attention to the % left on the Kindle, the last 40% or so is notes and such.  My take:  We are in big trouble.  We need to rally and fix this, starting in November!  DJT is dumber than I thought...and Rob Porter was smarter than I thought!
 Unfortunately, Bob Woodward write like he talks: s l o w  a n d  m e t i c u l o u s. Managed to get through the first hundred pages and then gave up. Fantastic subject but terrible writing. Where is Carl Bernstein when you need him?
 Woodward's 'Fear' is receiving attention for the new anecdotes it provides, illustrating what everyone (at least those who pay attention to our current politics) has already known - our current White House operates like none before, and our current President is as Un-Presidential as one could have ever imagined.<br/><br/>There is more to this story, however, and Woodward begins at the beginning, going back to even before Trump announced his candidacy, reporting on his first meeting with Steve Bannon, after which Bannon concluded that Trump would never run for President, given the lifestyle that he enjoyed.<br/><br/>Woodward continues from there, giving a new perspective on the story of how the Trump candidacy progressed, how Bannon and Kellyanne Conway were brought into the campaign and why, and how the campaign focused on Trumps ability to draw large crowds and motivate voters who were unsatisfied with the status quo and were ready for a drastic change.<br/><br/>Woodward provides some surprises, for example his criticism of the decision of FBI Director Comey to brief Trump on the Steel dossier. In Woodward's view, it (the dossier) was not confirmed sufficiently to merit briefing the President, and of course the briefing led at least in part to Trumps distrust of Comey and eventual decision to fire him.<br/><br/>When the book reaches current day events, the specifics of how Trump's subordinates appear to be working to mitigate his worst impulses, the stories are interesting and can be disturbing, depending upon how concerned the reader might be that Trump would really go off the deep end and get us into a war (trade war notwithstanding!).<br/><br/>I read this as the serious reporting on the part of Woodward, and I have no doubt of the accuracy of the events as he has related them in the book.<br/><br/>Disturbing, yes, but no more than our daily headlines. Where this will all lead, and what our country will be like when the Trump era is behind us, I cannot predict.
 I have only started this book, but I can tell you that it is hard to put down.  Well written.  I have only spent the "big bucks" on a couple of new releases and best sellers for my Kindle.  I was waiting for this book to be released. So far it has not disappointed.
 What intrigued me the most was that at at least half the book was in quotes.  Assuming that Woodward is accurate, whomever provided the quoted material was very close to the President.<br/>To quote our fearless, rudderless, leader...Sad, very sad.<br/>The final line is telling.
 Really grateful Bob Woodward's still around and writing.  Reading how Donald Trump had to be lobbied again and again to knock off the threats to rip up free trade agreements, disrupt America's relationship with South Korea and testify before Mueller.  Not too happy to know his trademark rage isn't an act but close to the real deal - like when Trump fired Comey.  For somebody who says he hires "the best people", sure needs a lot of persuading to listen to them.
 The truth of what is really happening in our White House since Trump managed to gain power.  Written by a well respected reporter.  Bob Woodward is an honest man and gave an honest account that should produce fear in your heart over the fate of our great country if Trump is allowed to continue the destruction of our democracy and keep undermining the values Americans hold dear.  All the white privileged old dinosaurs in our Congress need to be voted out.
 Have read Woodward since Watergate. Not that they are new facts but well verified. Time to vote him out as quickly as possibly
 As with Woodward’s other books, this work is well research and startlingly, the revelations of the extensive and dysfunctional incompetence of governance is beyond comprehension. The title of “FEAR of Trump in the White House” is well chosen for it is not only repulsive but frightening of the potential consequences both domestically and especially internationally. While recognizing that Trump is not an aberration but the culmination of political policies and strategies since at least Reagan to the present the comment by Dowd of Trump’s pathological lying without regard to reality is and will be devastating to American democracy, security, and well-being.
 The vivid, detail and logic oriented Woodward's latest book is as good as his "president's last men". I use the word logic oriented, mainly because after finish reading this book, I get the impression :" how is that possible and if possible, how it makes sense". Perhaps we shall once again return to the Skeptics view that " the only thing make sense is that nothing make sense". Reasonable doubt can be risen by any readers that Woodward may deliberately portrait President Trump in a way best described by a conglomerate of negative wordings, but the momentum, facts and the logic underneath the chain of events really cast that doubts to the outer space.
 I was surprised by the reactions I had to this book.  Not having been a fan of Trump, I was surprised at some of the human portrayals given in this book.  Clearly, he's dishonest, has a temper, and can't control his administration, but none of this is new.  I appreciate the candid and unsensationalized style of this book.
 The main takeaway from reading this book, is that it is thorough in its details, and is probably the best or near the best of what an unauthorized "biography" of the inner workings of the White House could be.<br/><br/>Starting with members of Citizens United in 2010, through the campaign, election and current presidency, the book attempts to deconstruct what/who/why influences the man who is currently President and controls his decision making processes and in the White House especially, how advisers function with the president and with themselves.<br/><br/>I mostly care about whether this book gives accurate reporting of what is going on, but here are some of my other takeaways about what is going:<br/>* Chaos, definitely chaos. Dementia as some people suggest? Highly unlikely. Trump comes across as a perfectly capable adult who knows the actions that he is taking. I think a valid comp is the Pajama Don from New York Italian mafia who tried to portray himself as having mental problems and thus is innocent, but really aware of what he is doing and really running criminal activity. A good example is how angry Trump gets when reports surface of bank records being subpoenad from Deutsche Bank. He clearly knows what he is doing. Instead of having psychological problems or dementia is more likely the work of a man without morals and character, decades of unconfessed sin, being the Shrewd Manager from the Book of Luke, being blackmailed by a foreign government, etc.<br/><br/>* This book ends with John Dowd quitting. I was a little disappointed as I was hoping to see more recent stuff.<br/><br/>* My intuition says that most of the sourcing for the book is from Priebus, Cohn, Porter, John Dowd. Possibly Tillerson, McMaster and Bannon. So when Cohn, Porter, and Dowd left within a short period of time, the sourcing probably dried for details. That doesn't mean that there were not other sources to confirm these details, but those 4 were the primary sources.<br/><br/>* Most of the details of the book are regarding who gets access to advise the president to make economic and foreign policy decisions, or the Mueller probe. For example, there was almost nothing about selecting cabinet members, confirming Neil Gorsich, or the NFL tirades. One major exception of the book covering domestic issues, was details of what influenced his speeches regarding Charlottesville riots from August 2017. For example, who gets to advise the president regarding tariffs and consequences? Who drafts memos and runs meetings? Which advisers discuss together and which room? Or the famous Tillerson quote of calling the president an "f****** moron" with regards to the North Korea situation. Much detail in the book went into who was at the meeting, where it took place, why it took place in the building that it did take place, which advisers were trying to persuade which POV to the president, which meetings and adviser battles had already existed which made this meeting necessary.<br/><br/>* Since Cohn and Porter are probably the 2 biggest sources, they come across as 2 of the bigger heroes, for doing behind the scenes work to make sure WW3 doesn't happen and Hoovervilles don't spring up. So I start taking judgement of Cohn. Is he a chicken because he decided stay when he wanted to quit? He wanted to quit after Charlottesville because his daughter was targeted with Nazi symbols and he felt the president gave the green light to the white supremacists. He stayed along in order to just help with the tax plan which is often stated as along with the confirmation of Neil Gorsich, the only 2 major achievements reached by Trump. So is Cohn a hero or a failure because his work ended up legitimizing the president which means the president's values of hate get further solidified? Would I have done the same thing if I were in Cohn's shoes? A good book should get you thinking about the characters and whether or not you can relate to their situations. Similarly, Porter had previously been publicly known as the guy who had to quit because he abused his wives and covered up the abuse. Of course he is going to want to paint the picture that he is a good guy doing good work behind the scenes, but he was staff secretary so he probably would know the most of the inner workings of the White House and who said what and who was present when. So I am sure Woodward corroborated as much as he possibly could, otherwise would not have included the details.<br/><br/>* Also, the profanity? Is this how all presidential administrations occur? Is this how executives always talk? Are there really this many s-bombs and f-bomb that fly in the every day, adult, professional world? When Rahm Emanuel spoke like this it stood out. Now that looks like it is tame and that's how everyone talks. In my own experiences, I only hear this frequency of profanity while working with teenagers (part of my day job) because teenagers cuss out of habit for no reason because they don't want to look like a nerd. My only experience hearing adults speak like this in a work setting has been in a blue collar environment and people don't want to come across as nerdy. Is this how government officials always talk? If I were to be a fly on the wall in any mayor's office, governor's office, county board of supervisors office, Sentator's office, would I hear this amount of profanity being discussed to each other? Telling each other that they better not f****** try that s*** again? Or you're full of s***. That's a bulls***. We need this s*** cleaned up, it's a mess.
 This book is worth reading, if you are looking for reliable, objective reporting.<br/>I read the whole book.  However, it felt like a transcription of reporter's notes.  More like a rough draft.<br/>At first, this bothered me.  But, realizing this is a collection of observations, quotes, comments by people in or close to the current administration - it is difficult to do analysis or conclusions.  The Administration in 2018 is still a very destructive work in progress and the the book reflects where we are now.<br/>I imagine Robert Woodward will do a follow-up at end of term or end of administration (hope both are the same)  and  based on info in this book, will read the next one.
 Famed journalist Bob Woodward has written a book about an undisciplined narcissist who also happens to be a congenital liar; unfortunately he is the President of the United States. Much of the juicy tidbits in Woodward’s book have already been widely disseminated in the media so I won’t bore you by repeating them.<br/><br/>What comes across loud and clear is that Trump hates trade. He even writes in a briefing packet “Trade is bad”.  Like a stubborn 14 year old he is unyielding in his beliefs about trade even the face of strong evidence placed before him by his staff. As was widely noted Trump was ready to blow up the Korea –U.S. trade agreement just when we were working hand in glove with South Korea on the North Korea nuke problem. Woodward demonstrates how that jerk, Peter Navarro with his mercantilist views, plays to Trump’s worst instincts and somehow has easy access to the Oval Office.<br/><br/>Woodward was very successful in getting leading administration figures to talk to him mostly on deep background, but sometimes on the record. We can hear the voices of Steve Bannon, Gary Cohn, Trump lawyer John Dowd, Lindsay Graham, John Kelly, H.R. McMaster, Rob Porter, Reince Priebus, and Rex Tillerson. We continually see Priebus, Cohn, Porter and McMaster valiantly trying save Trump from his worst instincts. Although they had some successes, in the end they failed. It is a shame that Porter’s domestic difficulties forced him out; he was a real check on Trump.<br/><br/>The book ends in March so there is no discussion of the North Korea, G-7 and Putin summits. Hopefully Woodward will soon give us some insights into those events. Further for those looking for evidence of a Trump-Russia conspiracy, it is not here.<br/><br/>Let me close with what Steve Bannon said with respect to the effects of #MeToo on the coming election.<br/>  “Trump is the perfect foil. He’s the bad father, the terrible first husband, the<br/>  boyfriend that ******* you over and wasted all those years and (you) gave up<br/>  your youth for, and then dumped you. And the terrible boss that grabbed you<br/>  by the ****** all the time and demeaned you.”<br/><br/>Woodward gives the reader a real flavor of how the Trump White House works and he proves that Jeb Bush was dead right when he said that Donald Trump would be the “chaos president.”
 I felt these real life characters were telling a terrifying story directly to me. The detail is chilling! That such chaos and coverup exists is our nation’s house is disturbing. I would recommend this read to all citizen’s attempting to follow the thinking of this twisted president.
 I'm starting Chapter 10.  Haven't read anything that I don't already thus far.  Waiting for the real stuff!  Also can't understand how Woodward has all of this dialogue.  Was he a fly on the wall?  Don't get me wrong, I'm no fan of Trump and I do respect Bob Woodward as a journalist.  Dear ole "I'm not a crook" Nixon knew him too - but a bit late.  Of course in those days, the government was still functioning.
 This is an excellent easy to read book with a very appropriate title.  It is scarier than any thriller I have read.  I could only read a few pages a night because it upset me so badly.  What is happening in our government is beyond comprehension.  I am sure our founders are spinning in their graves.<br/><br/>I love that Woodward just sticks to the facts because those alone are over the top.  This should be required reading in every school government class as an example of the loopholes in our system that allow these abuses to occur.<br/><br/>Be afraid, be very afraid and then rise up and make this the America you want and expect by getting involved.
 Another wonderful book by Bob Woodward, full of detail, madness and quoted sources. And, as always, a very disturbing description of a person driven by their ego who is was sitting in the highest seat in our government. Chilling. Maddening. Frightening.
 As I think even Woodward would admit that, while his research is scrupulous, he's not an outstanding writer. Maybe Woodward tries to avoid what could be interpreted as authorial flourishes, as he obviously strives to convey credibility and extreme seriousness. (He's the polar opposite of the fiercely colorful Carl Bernstein, his erstwhile reporting partner.) I don't know, of course, but I find his style almost dull. I'm not sure I learned anything new from this book, given the extensive media coverage of Mr. Trump. The book confirmed my suspicions that working in the Trump White House is scary.
 It's everything we knew..but hoped we were wrong.  I keep shaking my head in disbelief and shame for what this country has become.
 I have read every book written by Bob Woodward. Before Fear: Trump in the White House, I thought the Bush at War trilogy was the most frightening example of an administration that had gone off the rails. I’ve read Woodward’s Fear twice, and it feels like a punch in the gut. Woodward’s research and analysis is unparalleled, and the evidence of a dysfunctional, incompetent presidency is undeniable—frightening. Fear captures this reader’s emotional response to Bob Woodward’s masterpiece—Fear!
 Nothing new revealed in this book. From day one we all knew Trump was a moranic liar.  Reading this book is like Chinese food....an hour later you’re hungry again.<br/>The ending was sudden. By the time the book came out so much more had happened and in my opinion much more interesting.<br/>Basically it’s Woodward giving credibility to all the gossip out there.  However if you need a reason to go out and vote this book will provide it.
 Excellent writing and reporting, and I would expect nothing less from this author. Five stars for quality, no stars for the subject of the book, who is an embarrassing pig.
 First, let me say I am NOT a Trump supporter.  The reason I purchased and read this book was because Bob Woodward wrote it with overwhelming insider information.  The contents are easy to believe knowing what we do about #45.  If anything, I laughed through it reading example after example how inept our 'leader' is.  In addition, I acquired much information regarding foreign policy and the Afgan war.  A good read.  I highly recommend it.
 Some facts we already knew and a heck of a lot more, we didn't.  So glad Bob Woodward wrote this enlightening book about a President who should have never been elected.<br/>Every eligible American needs to get out and vote against Trump and the GOP, this November and in 2020..
 Most of us know and believe that Bob Woodward is one of the finest journalist this country has produced. That is why we purchase his books that is why when you read a bob Woodward book you know that it has been very carefully accredited and all notes preserved and not just in the end notes but he has a place where he keeps every single piece of paper or scrapped that he wrote on as he was writing this book to remember to put it inside the book. I could write forever about this book but the best thing to tell you is somewhere in your house there's a space that needs history for others to find and it belongs on your shelf after it sits on your lap. Read it. Believe it.
 Very well-reported and balanced, and I came away with more pity for Trump than I had prior. If you'd like to know what is happening in the people's house, and not a bunch of breathless hyperbole, this is your book. Of course, one would expect no less from Mr. Woodward.
 Little that wasn't already know. Lots of dialog that is difficult to get through. Too many players to keep track of in the revolving door of the White House. I'm sure this is accurate, coming from an award winning journalist, which is why I bought it, as opposed to Omarosa's book.
 You read this book knowing that this is not what the Democrats are saying about trump, but what his insiders are saying and going through just to try to keep trump from ruining our democracy.  If the loyal trump supporter reads this book they have to be worried, too. Someday these insiders will be known as unsung heroes to our country.  God save the Union because trump only cares about trump.
 This book is outstanding.  The book makes me twice as scared as I was already when Trump got elected. Very enlightening!
 There is a psycho in the White House.
 Midterms 2018! Go out and vote. Trump has no idea about how international trade works and its benefits towards economic well being.
 glad i read the book, but maybe the book should have come out a little later. there are unresolved issues, but what is in the book is fair and impartial. the book mostly confirms what i have suspected from following the news (you know...the "fake" news). since reading the book i've shared it with two other readers who also enjoyed it and felt it was important to read.
 Scary, true account of how unqualified and dangerous this President really is! Personal observations confirmed for me!!!<br/><br/>My fear is the good people that keep him straight are all being fired or leave the Administration in frustration. Who’s going to be left during the next two years to keep Trump from doing something REALLY stupid or get the USA into an unnecessary conflict?
 The intended audience for this book is Americans that place their patriotism above politics.  But independent voters and those on the fence for the upcoming mid-terms will benefit the most from reading this chilling book.<br/><br/>The two biggest benefits the reader will gain from reading this book are:<br/><br/>1) A chronological and easy to understand look at the chaos and dysfunction in the White House.<br/><br/>2) A startling and chilling look inside the perspectives of the senior white house staff: “It seems clear that many of the president’s senior advisers, especially those in the national security realm, are extremely concerned with his erratic nature, his relative ignorance, his inability to learn, as well as what they consider his dangerous views.”<br/><br/>Woodward’s writing style is conversational and instantly engaging. He has the uncanny ability to stay on topic and make difficult concepts simple to understand. I felt the book was the perfect length. I was a bit surprised but not disappointed when I came to last dramatic sentence.<br/><br/>As has been noted by the media, the book is meticulously researched and his sources carefully documented in the appendix.<br/><br/>At times it seemed like Rob Porter and Gary Cohn were inordinately quoted, but I can only assume they were major sources for the book.<br/><br/>This is the third book I have read about the Trump White House, but Woodward by far offers the most thoroughly sourced and documented information. This book is a damning and thoroughly researched story of a professional liar that somehow became president<br/><br/>In summary, the book’s title is very appropriate.  Trump aims to strike fear into his opponents, “Maximize aggression to conceal vital weakness.” When someone attacks him, he attacks harder. No heeding Jesus teaching of turning the other cheek for him.<br/><br/>This quote by Trump sums it all up: “Real power is fear. It’s all about strength. Never show weakness. You’ve always got to be strong. Don’t be bullied. There is no choice.”
 As with every Bob Woodward book, he crafts a narrative that draws you in, and is clearly well-sourced and researched.
 If there is fact and truth in this book ( which I believe there is) then the American voters have a lot to answer for in putting this man in such a powerful position. It’s certainly not ‘God bless America’ but God help America and the rest of the world while this man and his acolytes are in the WH!
 Very important to know about what's going on behind the scenes as this president moves us closer and closer to a dictatorship in the exact same way so many other democratically elected leaders have done in their own countries. The title comes from when Trump said, "As much as I hate to say this, the basis of power is FEAR" and you can see how he uses fear to motivate people and get them to support him in a cult-like frenzy (my words). Bob Woodward is not alarmist or a user of hyperbole. He just reports what he's being told by the many insiders who leak because of their deep concern for our country.It's a MUST READ.
 Although it ends early in the Trump administration much of what Woodward has reported portends the events which followed. The firings, the resignations, the emotional eruptions, and the general incompetency of the Trump staff as well as Trump's own shortcomings are on display. I gave this book 4 stars rather than five since I found the book at times a slow read. However, it was written by a journalist and historian who was less concerned with entertainment than he was with documenting the events of the past two years. Recommended for students of politics and history.
 As juicy and delicious as you'd expect. The fact that Woodward includes flattering moments, like Trump trying to reconcile with Lindsey Graham and John McCain once he gets into office, only makes the overall book (and the more unflattering stuff) more believable.<br/><br/>My only disappointment with this book is that Evelyn M. Duffy is not credited as a coauthor, even though Woodward writes that she should have been, in a preface to the book. I don't know what behind-the-scenes drama went on there, but it left a bad taste in my mouth to see a woman's contributions being minimized. :(
 I read Michael Wolff's book "Fire &amp; Fury", but had trouble believing some parts of it. It seemed to be short on "authority." I had read Woodward &amp; Bernstein over the years - - got used to their style and sources, even if some sources were not named -- so I sought out "Fear." It met my expectations. I had followed the many issues, faux pas, responses of Pres. Trump to reporter's questions, and found Woodward's view of them consistent with what I'd read in published papers -- not that they necessarily agreed with the papers, but referred to a consistent set of facts. "Fear" was great reading.
 Bob Woodward is a very gifted writer. I am not a fan of Trump, I find this book to be informative.
 I never had a lot of patience reading old history books, I started this book thinking I will never finish this one fully. But to my surprise, I was reading it continuously till the very end. Perhaps be cause I can relate all the events . The authors writing style was also very captivating. Thanks!
 Fear?  I’ve been afraid since 2015 and been glued to cable TV ever since.  Someday there will be a clinical name for this.  Certainly this book confirms that fear in a most credible way.  Trump is the Pied Piper of Hamlin, the emperor with no clothes and the boy who cried wolf.  I pray for America.
 I felt like I was in the room with the players. I kept trying to figure who was background on each of the interactions.
 For those Americans who believe in Truth, Justice, and the American way, a must read. Wonderfully written, makes you want more of the truth, and it does give rise to "Fear". Thank you Mr. Woodward!
 I have no doubt that this book is 100% accurate and true, but if it's even 50% accurate and true, America needs to get rid of this feckless "president" ASAP.
 Very readable, although the accounts of who the decision makers are and how they came to decide that Donald Trump should be President, however well researched and written, will make you feel the need for a shower at the end of each chapter.  Russian oligarchs joining forces with American oligarchs, even if only through a coincidental confluence of interests, created a culture of corruption and incompetence that is a national train wreck that you just can't keep staring at. If our republic survives this era in its history the docudramas are going to be amazing.
 Bob Woodward again demonstrates what a professional journalist is supposed to do. Report facts. Identify editorial opinion clearly. Provide documentation for future generations and inform the present generation.  A worthwhile use of one's time.
 Even though Bob Woodward has written a LOT of books on the presidency, I have to admit "Fear" is the first one I've read. But it's a very good book, I think.  It's probably not for the faint of heart, because the reader should be able to determine for himself the serious nature of what is going on in Trump's world.  It's a disturbing picture the author paints; one that will likely cause the reader to reflect on what might be in the future for the country because of the choices we, in the collective sense, have made. Some parts can be a bit tedious; I think. I first thought of giving the book just 4 instead of 5 stars, but because of the overall quality of Woodward's book I decided to give it 5 stars.  It's well worth your time, but be prepared to enter the real, gritty, profane, brash, rough and tumble world of politics; one you rarely get to see. It's not a pretty picture, but it is a true, distressingly accurate one, in my opinion.
 I actually read this book through... which is highly unusual for me. I was hoping to see something I didn't know already. There were a few details and events I had never heard but no surprises for a reader who has been tuned into the multitude of real news outlets. I considered it a waste of my time because of this. A long read to say no more than it did.
 Whether you like Trump or not, this book provides some very frightening insights into the habitrail of Trumps mind. You will not feel more safe, in fact if you have been paying attention to the news of that past 2 years, this will only validate what you suspected. If you live in a box with blinders on, you won't be able to wrap your head around how much our Democracy is under threat.
 Wow, wow, wow! I just finished Woodward’s latest Fear and all I can say is that it is unbelievable that our country is still standing. The man in the Oval Office seems to have a serious case of dementia - so much so that his own (former) lawyer, Dowd knew that he should and could never go on the stand...because he is such a massive LIAR. And that is a quote.<br/><br/>Anything could and would set this crazy cartoon character off... anything. And he has the ability to really destroy our country. Now with the unheard of and very UNNECESSARY tariffs - our country and especially his base of supporters are to suffer the consequences of his knee jerk actions.<br/><br/>This book is not for the weak of heart, as teeth grinder, I’m back to wearing my guard at night... glad I finished it up as the sleep was definitely not sound. Looking forward to a day when we can all sleep a little better knowing that someone new -with a sane mind- is in charge, until then... pray the staffers can keep the wheels from falling off this clown car!
 I have followed the course of Trump 's rise from the campaign to date. Woodward 's synopsis greatly assisted my memory and corroborated my suspicions with well researched reporting. I think Mr Trump is the greatest showman in one hundred years.<br/>His T V experience has allowed him to capture a gullible public and electorate.<br/> He does not wish to govern but to mandate.<br/> This work illustrates the real danger to our Republic if a majority continues to blindly follow his rantings. The constant rallies are reminiscent  of Germany in the 1930s.
 Woodward does not disappoint. He's one of or greatest journalists, so thorough and so informed. you know everything he writes is  fully researched and you can depend on him for the true story.  Great buy.
 If you want a great inside look at Trump's White House, you'll enjoy this book. Parts are actually scary. Everyone, including the ones who voted for Trump, should have had an idea of what would happen when you put a man with absolutely no understanding how government works in the most critical position of the executive branch. It's NOT like running a corporation. It's a staggering tale.
 For people who don’t like Trump, Hillary and the Media, the book makes Trump looks better, Hillary looks more ridiculous and the Media is almost as bad as Trump coined “Fake News Media”.<br/><br/>Highly recommended reading!
 Ir normally takes me months to slowly meander through a book, but I had trouble putting this one down.  I read it in a couple of weeks, which is fast for me :)<br/><br/>The text is full of details and since it is so timely feels more dramatic than most non-fiction.  I appreciated how carefully Mr Woodward stuck to what is known and factual.  Also, the back of the book carefully documents the way all the material is sourced.<br/><br/>After writing about the last eight Presidents, Bob Woodward truly is a master of this type of biography.
 A sobering read, but then so was  The Final Days.  This book has the same attention to detail, some of it quite shocking.  Hope  many read this so those wishing to stop total disaster will be able to continue to do so.
 The details in this book are eye opening. Woodward is an excellent reporter and author.
 I found the book very informative about the disturbing personality and behavior of Donald Trump. It is an important view into what is going on in the Trump White House and how unprepared and educated he is to perform the duties of POTUS. Unfortunately, I also found the book very disjointed and unorganized. Frequently it was difficult to keep track of who was being quoted and what statements and positions were being attributed to which character. Maybe that was just Woodward’s way of helping the reader get a feeling for the chaos that is the Trump White House.
 I like the fact that such an esteemed writer as Bob Woodward wrote a book on the Trump White House and just when we pretty much knew it was bad, we now find that it is worse...much worse.
 This book was very informative and I'm glad somethings have been exposed. There were several places where quotation marks were misplaced. This was very distracting. Editing could have been better.
 If anyone voted for Trump, this book is a MUST READ!
 Reading Trump's tweets about this book, I expected that there would be some shocking new information regarding his White House but that really wasn't the case.  Woodward does his usual excellent job of giving a behind the scenes view of the decision making process and there is plenty that is troubling.  However, I don't think it is a shock to anyone, at this point, that we have a President who doesn't read, makes decisions impulsively and abhors any process or structure.<br/><br/>Overall, the book is excellent and sheds additional light on the dysfunction of the White House under Trump.
 Riveting revelations that we all suspected that was going on in the White House.  Well written and presented.  Another award winning book from Bob Woodward!
 There are incidents that happened in this country that I was not aware of. I had to re-read several paragraphs, and underline corresponding dates. This book will be placed with my history book collection. However; I am no way surprised at the president's attitude and demeanor. I felt for the people who have to deal with him on a regular basis.
 So far read up to election and though many of the reasons for Trump's election are known and documented, Woodward presents a balanced behind the scenes rundown of what transpired . His analysis and presentation just to this point should be a must read for those seeking or helping those seeking election. I have no doubt the remainder of the book will be as good.
 If you are not an avid Trump watcher or one of those that watch our television twenty hours a day to see what our President is up to, this is a great purchase.  If on the other hand you are hooked on Cable News, there is not much in this book that you don't already know.  Having said that, in true Woodward fashion, he has taken us through the facts, introduced us to a few people we hadn't heard much about, and done it an an unbiased fashion.  Once again, Woodward proves himself to be an outstanding reporter.
 Well written and easy to follow story. Factually documented. Left me more concerned knowing the administration is in such chaos with so many undermining each other. He is the mad king.
 I purchased this after seeing Bob Woodward several times on TV being interviewed.  He is a respected journalist and presidential historian.  This is a must-read if you want insight into the circus happening in the White House.  It didn't make me feel better about goings-on but at least now I have some context, especially on why they like to keep Trump out on the road. (Seems it's all they can get him to do and keeps him out from under foot.)  It's an eye opener and makes this adult civics class reading.
 I’m not hysterically against President Trump, but I trust Bob Woodward’s objective journalistic integrity. His work, Fear, outlined the true day to day mishaps that happen in the White House.<br/><br/>President Trump is as bombastic, paranoid, and infantile as you’d expect. I’m only in the first two chapters and I’m already surprised.<br/><br/>The book reads in standard journalistic formatting. So it may be a little dull to the average reader expecting more bells and whistles. But I like it
 My favorite movie of all time is All The President's Men.  Knowing what we learned living through Watergate time, I knew Bob Woodward would tell the truth all the way.  It's sad that our country is in this mess but people need to wake up and face the truth so we can save our democracy!!  Our country cannot be left in the hands of an unattended daycare!
 I’m halfway thru the book and very enthralled and appalled . Well researched and I think a fair view of what’s happening in the White House ...I find it a great follow up to Fire and Fury ... and probably more honest
 Mr. Woodward has written a behind the scenes look at the beleaguered Trump presidency. Most of what he has written can be gleaned from the intensive news coverage this presidency has generated. The account is  well written and the sourcing seems to be incredible because he takes inside the room. But the story does not hang together and leaves us hanging. This understandable given that we’ve yet to arrive at a conclusion to this chaos. It feels as though this was a rush to publish and it left me wanting a bit more.
 I purchased the book for Kindle and the Audible version with it. It’s a very in depth and interesting look at how we ended up with this president.  I think the only way to improve the Audible book would be to have Stephen Colbert read trump’s part.
 I'm not sure I loved the book because it's so upsetting.  That said I think it's a must read book for all voters.  Woodward's reputation is impeccable and the idea that he printed lies is not, in my opinion, to be believed.  I'm old enough to remember Watergate and the protestations of the White House then. History repeats itself.
 Bob Woodward presents a chilling in-depth review of Trump's attempt at being president.  The events in the book are of course all well publicized, but the degree of Trump's ineptness is examined and better explained.  This book tells us exactly why we shouldn't have an ignorant-about-government, ego-driven, old white really rich guy as president.  FEAR TRUMP
 And then feel sad for our country. Feel sad for the world. Feel sad for the men and women who serve our nation as appointees, government employees, and soldiers. And feel sad for a man who seems to be cunning and yet has such low self esteem that he is willing to destroy so much that makes America great.<br/><br/>And then vote to throw this guy and the folks who enable him out of office!
 Enlightening, horrifying and a must read.
 Wonderfully well written and researched.  Scary as one is forced to think of the crazy in charge of our weapons, foreign policy and courts.
 I'm looking forward to reading this book, but it was delivered to my IPod, and not my Kindle, because my Kindle was not on at midnight, but my IPod was. Now I cant get it on my Kindle. (default device). This is not a product review, but a service review, but see no way to get this problem fixed. Disappointed.
 Mr. Woodward has mastered a form of recent "living history" journalism that is addictive, but clearly requires a healthy caution.  And, taking some intellectual license, he would begrudgingly agree.  The narrative is fluid and breezy which means that it levies the reader with a responsibility that they know the underlying issues without affording a background précis.  The view is clearly of people, personalities, and roles: bluster and egos abound.  The account focuses on certain events that are designed to capture the attention of the media for its daily mastication, but there is enough reporting to avail some serious rumination.  I guess I am jaded because I have read a little less than half of his oeuvre.  The result is consistently that his efforts to be the Joe Friday "just the facts, mam" behavioral scientist merged with a lightweight version of the Barbara Tuchman "surgical depth" historian works.  And in the case of this breakout presidency of Donald Trump, this is desperately needed.  One key problem is that Trump is a pathological liar and he's giving pathological liars a bad name.  All the of the media coming out of the White House is strenuously skewed to appeal to an ardent base while eschewing any appeal to the larger majority of the American public.  I respectfully extend my gratitude to Mr. Woodward for his efforts.
 I’ve been reading and loving Bob Woodward books for three decades but this one has a big flaw. While it follows the classic Woodward way to the truth, one problem becomes obvious in this book: many of the sources Woodward interviews don’t quite understand Donald Trump. So the story quickly feels out of date and out of touch with its main subject. Woodward is the best journalist in Washington but he needs a more diverse group of sources to explain this unique individual.
 Mr. Woodward has a flawless reputation.  ALL his books are meticulously researched and all his interviews are recorded.  This book unlike previous ones makes be boiling angry.  Angry at how America was tricked and cheated into voting for one of the most horrible people imaginable.  How is is destroying everything American has stood for over the years.  Destroying America's reputation in the world.  The book shows how Mr. Trump dies not study, does not read, does not listen, and does not care.  He has no empathy or anyone but himself (and a little for his close family).  He does not learn and really only has his 30-40 year old opinions.  This books shows that is the few adults around him (which are getting less and less) have saved America from even more horrible decisions of his.  He is America worst nightmare and will go down in history as the WORST President EVER in America.
 Republicans are complicit in this grand betrayal of democracy.<br/>Trump is a con man, a grifter, a liar, and a phony. Emoluments clause violations and tax crimes investigations are likely incoming.
 Books ok, but nothing earth shattering.
 The title, Fear, is Trump's theory of the case of leadership.  To lead, one must be powerful and to be powerful, fear must be the guiding principal - trust me and no other, not what you see, not what you hear and fear everyone and everything else - the government, the judiciary, the intelligence community, the foreigner.  People gave Bob Woodward extraordinary access, and he laid it all out with clarity and the no-nonsense style we've come to expect of him.  This book did not disappoint.
 Not only do we have a political neophyte in office, we have one suffering from narcissism, OCD, and a severe case of ADHD. Donnie lived in a bubble universe. And who knew that the one good leash on him was the guy with a past history of domestic abuse? After Porter 's resignation it truly became "let loose the dogs of war"!
 Not like you don't hear all the machinations as they happen, but when you read them and put it on paper, it is a wonder we put such a nut in charge of our country. Even his own people think he is crazy and spend all their time just trying to keep him in line. A good read for sure but it is a little disheartening to see it all in writing. Bob does a good job of the writing and 1/3 of the book is the notes on where the information comes from so no one can say it is made up. No fake news here!!
 After reading this book, there were no new revelations, nothing that no one probably knew already, it just solidifies the case of a man trapped in a position that he really has now power in, and his frustrations lead to anger, his anger to tweeting and his tweeting, well, we all know what that leads to.  It never changed my mind about Trump, however, it somehow managed to give me sympathy for this current day P.T. Barnum, who somehow managed to squeeze his way into the highest office in this country.
 This book is EXCELLENT and long over due.
 Incredible read that paints a vivid picture of the dysfunction at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. What’s most jarring in my reading of this book was Trump’s infantile understanding of some of the most basic functions of government and the Oval Office. At times (in fact most times), he painted that picture of Trump with the psychological make-up of a child without the most basic grasp of  concepts which President’s are expected to be experts in.<br/><br/>Totally clear in the writing that we are in a dangerous time with unequipped leadership at the helm.
 No real surprises will be found for those who’ve followed the Trump administration closely, but Woodward confirms and fills out gaps in the record. This book will be one of the sources History builds upon when studying the Trump administration in the future.
 Bob Woodward, whom I greatly respect, has made a huge error in the opening of his otherwise marvelous book “Fear”.<br/><br/> Woodward says White House Economic Adviser Gary Cohn stole from Trump’s desk, and hid, a Presidential directive that would have withdrawn the United States from its trade agreement with South Korea.  So far so good.<br/><br/>But then Woodward, atypically for him,  decouples from reality.  He argues, based on what Cohn inexplicably told him, that withdrawal would have ended America’s ability to defend against a North Korean ICBM attack on the United States.  Woodward claims that, whereas detectors on the ground in South Korea would warn us of a North Korean missile launch within seconds, absent such detectors we would be forced to rely on sensors in Alaska which would not see the North Korean missile until (it came over the Alaska horizon) 15 minutes after launch. This, he says, would zero what he considers to be our existing ability to defend against North Korean ICBMs.<br/><br/>Yikes!  Cohn means well but is dead wrong, and Woodward should not have believed him.  Woodward and Cohn are disastrously out of their expertise lanes when they get into nuclear strategy.<br/>The Korean trade agreement has no connection with our ability to defend against North Korean ICBMs, and this ability in any case doesn’t exist.<br/><br/>Being a recently-retired nuclear weapons program manager, I offer these countervailing facts:<br/>Fact 1:  For timely early warning of an ICBM launch against us we don’t need ground-based sensors in South Korea -- or anywhere.  For decades we have used space-based infra-red (heat) sensors on satellites for early warning.  These satellites are large and expensive but stunningly effective and reliable; they can see everywhere in North Korea. They will warn of any ICBM launch as soon as the exhaust flame rises above the cloud cover (seconds after liftoff).  We don’t need sensor installations on the ground in South Korea to do that.<br/>Fact 2: There is no ability to defend against ICBM attack in any case.  Nuclear anti-missile defense is an emotionally appealing delusion, but a delusion nevertheless.  Warning time may be 15 minutes or 15 nanoseconds, but neither will produce a successful defense.<br/><br/>In any contest between ballistic missile offense vs. anti-ballistic missile defense, both technology and math favor the offense.<br/>Technology: Consider that an anti-missile defense must work -- the first time! --against a Pearl Harbor-like surprise attack, but it has never been tested full-system in that mode and there is no plan to do such a test.<br/>Math: Consider also that if the offense launches, say, ten ICBMs against ten cities and the defense destroys 90% of the ICBMs, the city is 100% gone and its citizens are dead.  Defense may win some debating points but offense wins the contest, very bigtime.  If I wipe out ten of your ICBMs and you wipe out a million of my citizens, that’s not a good trade for me.<br/>In post-1945 nuclear conflict, everybody loses.  It really is different from football or other child’s games in which the side with the most points wins.<br/><br/>Bottom line: The trade agreement with South Korea may be a good thing for other reasons, but it does not enable anti-ballistic missile defense to work.
 A searing indictment of the current administration...  a definite must-read for every American concerned about our country's future under the "leadership" of a seriously deranged and dangerous individual.
 Book was well written and a fast and easy read.  Could almost say it was enjoyable, except the subject is not something to be taken lightly.  As far as content, incidents were fleshed out, but not many revelations, as this administration has more leaks than a strainer.  As an independent voter and reader of presidential history and biographies, it is still so disappointing to me that 47% of American voters knowingly voted in this well documented unethical, immoral, dishonest, narcissistic clown as leader of the greatest country in the world.  Guess we're not that exceptional after all.
 You can always depend on quality and truthful reporting from Bob Woodward.  If he reports it, you can take it to the “bank”.  His writing is of the highest quality and this is a “report” all Americans need to read.
 I have great respect for Bob Woodward and his many years of reporting, especially his investigative reporting on the Watergate fiasco.  If it wasn't for him and Bernstein, Nixon would have destroyed our Country just as Donald Trump is on his way of doing right now.  However, this book is nonsense as far as I'm concerned.  It does not give you any more incite into what is going on than turning on Cable News on a regular basis (you learn the same things).  I, for one, am very anxious to see what the Russia Investigation being headed by Mueller is going to uncover, that is where we are going to get the best, reliable information.
 This book details the inner workings of the presidency at a time when democracy and basic freedoms are at risk. Mr. Woodward continues to be one of the best investigative journalists ever, whose work has been characterized by his relentless pursue of the facts. His ability to bring the truth forward without masking its tone hits you to the core.
 Wish had not spent the money. Old news.
 I've read most of Bob Woodward's books and always found them to be meticulous in the research and well written, cover to cover. This was different. First, there were a lot of glaring and distracting typos which should have been caught before publication, and the writing didn't grab me as his previous works have done almost from page one. It did provide some illuminating information and filled in the background a bit, but overall I felt this work did not stand up well against his earlier books and I came away feeling mildly disappointed (not because there was no grand reveal, or some jaw-dropping factoid, but because the book came across as dull, at times really boring and considering the subject matter, that is really startling.
 Woodward describes the situation in the Trump White House; pretty scary, if you believe in the principles that I was taught our country is founded on.  Not all of our Presidents have been Saints, even Lincoln in my maybe not so humble opinion; and a number of them have been mediocre.  However, if you put all of the incompetence possessed by all of our past Presidents together in one man, it wouldn't equal that of Trump.  We live in dangerous time.
 If you have been paying attention there is very little new here.  In addition the treatment of the Russia investigation is cursory at best.  The episodic structure makes for a very disjointed presentation.  There is no organized treatment of any of Trump's problems other than his obvious personality disorder.  Very disappointing
 I finished reading FEAR 3 days ago; I am still shaken, with a level of anxiety never experienced up until now. The book is very well written as if the reader is sitting  in the room during these meetings.One gets the "picture" of how this president makes his decisions. Basically, when ones and many display information, graphics, statistics that do not corroborate  with Trump personals beliefs and understanding of the situation, he simply dismiss the data. "I don't want to hear about this" Obvious to me, he does not grasp information, too complicated for his thought process, on top of not being interested in learning. Mr.Woodward is a very decent investigator: I  thrust his reporting He seems to have had conversations with Porter,Cohn,McMaster,Mattis,Tillerson, Kelly, Ross and other important players at the White House. Very convincing.<br/>I am in a sate of shock, still : there is an ignorant small mind and very volatile emotional man running this country and making decisions on the "mood of the day" Basically, there is one constant in this man's mind: It is all about money and how USA is taken advantage of, how he will retaliate with wars on tariffs, NATO, NAFTA, name it.  REVENGE.I suspect he is a paranoid  on the loose. Nobody at the west wing seem willing to confront his insanity. AFRAID of his major outbursts, put down in front of others? all of that.<br/>Reflecting on the message Mr.Woodward want to convey to readers: WAKE UP, we are in Clear and Present Danger, Eminent Danger, WW3 at the next corner. A president who do not care one way or another because he does not get it.<br/> 50 years later,History will not be kind to voters and congress for NOT having ACTED on information given by many whistler blowers,who ring the fire alarm bell. We did not listen. That is SCARY. A loony bean sitting at the oval office, the one close to him who KNOW, and do zip to take action, and us, voters, sleeping and walking with a gas mask on our nose.
 Excellent detailed description of the people we elected to run our nation. Seems to be factual, not emotional. Overlaps with info from other books by other authors. A pattern is very visible to those that read with an open mind.
 I had expected something extremely hard hitting and, on reflection, I suppose this is just that but it somehow seems softer than my expectations. I guess that’s perhaps the absurdity’s of the daily news with the president. Anyway, this is a decent read for anyone interested in US Politics and what Trump is doing in and to America. It’s hard to believe that such a person can attain the office ... and it’s frightening to think that such a person has.
 Anyone other than republican koolaid drinkers see trump for the dangerous child that he is, but this chronicle of the mayhem inside the White House needed to be written. Give copies as Christmas gifts, if for no other reason than sales will make trump crazy (crazier).
 Simply scary.  FEAR clarifies as well as amplifies what we all already know... Trump's ignorance and disregard for fact.  Even though you may have already read much of what is outlined in this book over the past 3 years, it's a shocking awakening seeing it all put together.<br/><br/>You've heard the analogy of a person playing checkers while another is playing chess.  Trump is a little boy playing with blocks, not even capable of listening to "Grand Masters" that truly know the cause and effect of tampering with delicate relations.<br/><br/>A fast and easy read, impossible to put down, impossible to be comfortable after the book is finished.
 Wow.  Good book.  It's pretty obvious who are some of Mr. Woodward's sources.  And the sources seem biased.  Because 1-3 people always look good and the rest of the administration looks bad (as told by the book).  But Mr. Woodward is a good writer and did a great job sourcing/writing this book. Even if it is not 100% objectively true (i.e., it is sourced by people with subjective outlooks, etc), I found the book fascinating and informative.
 You need to read this book before the Mueller report is published. It tells of the scary disorganized White House and how staff needed to prevent president Trump from doing dangerous and scary decisions.  If you read this book I advise reading The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump. The book is a summation of 27 leading psychologists about the mental health of the president.  It forecasts everything Bob Woodward tells about in his book.
 Even if you’ve read the news coverage of this book or seen and heard the interviews with author Bob Woodward, there’s more here. No — not smoking guns or clear exonerations either. But a detailed, moment-by-moment recreation of the president’s first year in office that paints a portrait of Donald Trump, as described by those around him. Woodward makes brief cameos, but he and his views are mostly out of sight here. The views of his sources, on the other hand, are quite clear. Also: A hell of an ending, cliffhanger as it must be.
 While the content and details were substantive, the organization of the story make it too difficult to follow the timeline. Each chapter takes on a new topic or thread, and with Trump, there are many, many threads to follow. However, each new chapter either jumped too far ahead or too far back in time making it a clumsy read.  Even so, I'm glad I read it.
 Bob Woodward is a real journalist with the credibility to do this story. It’s well researched and readable with no bias from politics. It’s what is going on even today in the most important office in our land. It’s not so much the poor decisions but the process that what was used to arrive at them. It’s pretty scary!
 Disturbing disbelief chaos no regard self center lies and deceitful all in one chapter at one time. Hard to image this is Non fiction ! One of the best inside scoops of  our white house in total world wind everyday . This book sews the loose seams  and the other reports from media and leaks coming from this shameful house. Author did exception job  this book a real page turner of events. The story does not end ..to be continue
 Incredible book. A must-read for anyone who cares about their country.
 Well now what can I say. Today is 8 Jan 2019. Tweeter wants to build the wall.  Everybody that was in this book has either quit, retired or commited suicide. The govenment shutdown is at a record length. He's going back and forth on pulling the troops out of Afghanistan &amp; Syria. The Kruds are going to get smashed on. And Kim is in China. Seems like everyone is making alliances hope we're not heading to a show down of the century.
 Positive. Preordered. On time. Thank you
 Still in the middle of this fabulous book!.. Its so reassuring to know that Im reading a book of such high quality journalism. Trump and his band of mobsters are even worse than I imagined.  Unbelievable.<br/><br/>As Woodward has said, we had better wake up to what is happening.  We need to save our country!!
 Read this in one sitting.  If anyone could possibly still believe that Trump could ever Make America Great Again,  please read it and ask yourself why.  Scary stuff, even worse for our country than I believed possible.  Fear is the perfect title.  I will find it hard to sleep tonight.  Thank you Bob Woodward - This book , so well done, is a true public service.  Hope America wakes up...and Congress finds a spine before Trump ( the man-child) destroys our democracy.
 Balanced  and fair view of a complete moron. Woodward puts readers in the room with exhausted staff trying to reason with an adult child.
 I trust Bob Woodward.  He has proven over four decades that he seeks the truth and can be trusted.  Nothing in FEAR surprised me and I don't think anyone in the White House was surprised.  What is astonishing to me is that the members of Congress have chosen to ignore this information  No one has proved Woodward wrong, what is the matter with our elected leaders in the Senate and House of Representatives, the facts are well established in this book.
 An interesting view into the back room dysfunction of the Trump White-house complete with the back ground of the infighting between staff and their efforts to prevent the President from making decrees which were not in the best interest of the nation, by simply removing signed or draft letters from his desk.
 The  book is well written, but there really was not that much new in it.  Some of the interactions among the people at the White House was interesting.  But the best part for me was seeing the whole picture in one reading.  One can forget the past craziness as each week presents so much more craziness.  This book gives you a review of the past 18 month and you  get reminded of the administration's actions that you might no longer have remembered.
 Woodward has done his homework and lays out various incidents during the Trump campaign and down to the early part of 2018.  He makes no judgements and offers no opinions...just reporting.  So it is somewhat of a shock when he simply stops reporting...no summary, no conclusions...just pictures of the principals.  For those who have been paying attention, the book offers no surprises about Trump...just confirms what thinking people know.
 Yes. We live at an odd moment in history. This book delves into just how unique, and very, very frightened we should all be during this frightening moment in history.
 Honestly - I just can’t get into this book.  Nicely colored pictures in the middle. I leave it on my desk and people think I’m educated on more than I really am!
 I am taken back at the production quality of this book! The jacket is great. But remove the jacket &amp; the construction of the book itself is of very poor quality for a hardbound book! The outer portion appears to be a very thin red &amp; black paper that has multiple wrinkles and air gaps in it. Within the pages of the book, the 4 locations of the double strand threads that hold the pages together are completely exposed and the hole punches for the threads are also exposed and it is obvious that neither are matched as the pages appear "torn/drawn" to where the bands of threads are. Bottom line, the binding work was not concealed nor protected from future reading damage that will occur just from turning the pages once or twice. There are visible gaps of space between the binding threads. It's multiple aspects of poor quality binding as I would not expect from a Simon and Schuster produced book.
 I just finished reading this book in January 2019, so the information here about Trump's ignorance and the ongoing train wreck that is the White House operation seems like Old news.  The book is a series of disjointed vignette s about Trump's interactions with a few White House staffers who decided to spill the beans about how they tried to control the uncontrollable Trump.  The few interesting quotes in here were already revealed in reviews a few days after the book was published.  The author seems to have accepted the White House line that there was no collusion with the Russians, no obstruction, no emoluments violations, no criminal activity at all in the Trump organization though it was pretty obvious to the objective observer from day one, and recent indictments, guilty pleas, and jail terms  have confirmed these suspicions.  Woodward bends over backwards in this book to see no evil.  What happened to the Woodward of Watergate fame?
 Perhaps my expectations were set too high for content from "Fear". Bob Woodward is a time-tested investigative reporter whose credibility holds up under close inspection. "Fear" largely confirms suspicions held by many about the tumultuous Trump presidency, while adding insights not already a matter of public record. Had Bob Woodward elevated the narrative to the analytical level more consistently then "Fear" would merit a solid 5 star rating.
 My biggest complaint about most news these days is that it has an emotion attached to it. I grew up w Walter Cronkite, Peter Jennings, and even studied the works of Edward R Murrow.<br/><br/>This has the feel of truth. There is no angle. There are no political sides. It's just the story of what happened, researched well, documented and recorded (for the naysayers, yes, there are tapes). Every bit of into was cross-referenced.<br/><br/>There are parts where Trump makes perfect sense. He asks the right questions - is the loss of life or limbs worth being in Afghanistan, etc. Then Trump asks the same thing of the custodian or a bodyguard and you realize he has his core belief and that's that.<br/><br/>I had hoped that Woodward would have read the audiobook but it's a lot of work, and he already spent a long time weaving the info into an amazing historical document.
 Beside what my title states he is also a misogynist. Woodward pulls no punches.  What he writes comes from actually being there a witnessing what he writes.  A large part comes from the public record.<br/>  I could only so much before the greed of the family got to me and I could read no further.  I gave it  3 stars because Bob Woodward co-wrote another book. (Most people won't remember "All The Presidents Men".)
 I was hoping for something no one else has provided on the inner workings of 45's administration. Unfortunately, the book is just a rehash of what has been on social media.  The hostile relationships are obvious just by watching the resignations and firings.  Nothing new here.
 Much of this we've been hearing about in the news. But seem together, in totality, it paints a very scary picture. Unhinged, indeed. Extremely well researched and documented.
 I liked this Author's statement in the beginning that he had multiple sources that could not be named, but in his follow-up at the end, provided sources that could be validated. I believe most, if not all of what he has written here is indeed factual, based on my observations of Twitter and daily news reports. One thread runs through every book I've read on this President. Chaos and lies. Everyone of them can't be wrong.
 Excellent
 That last line in the book pretty much sums it up.<br/>Expertly written and meticulously sourced and footnoted, Woodward’s book is based on FACTS.
 I am not a fan of President Trump.  This book confirmed for me, over and over again the reason why I am not a supporter of our current President.  Although the intention of this book was simply to inform , it served as an affirmation of my impression and sincere dislike of our current POTUS.  I am both sad and disturbed.  Mr. Woodward delivers once again with truth and awesome reporting of the sign of our sad times.
 What are we Europeans supposed to do? Yes we are afraid.  We have had our share of people like Trump in Europe, but never in a position like the President of US.  We had our Trump as PM in Iceland.  It took us very short time to get rid of him.  Unfortunately this is not possible in US.<br/>Each chapter has a new horror story to tell (there are over 40 of them).  How stupid, how useless, how lazy and how dangerous this guy is to the world as we know it.<br/>Very interesting book and well worth spending time to read, along with a good book about Putin (for example “The man without a face”).  This book is well written.
 Ok disclaimer, I’m not particularly drawn to either side of the political spectrum. I did find this election and Trump’s subesquent  presidency fascinating to say the least. So much in fact that I have read, Shattered, Fire and Fury and What happened.<br/><br/>Comparing this to the other books, i’d have to say with it’s sourcing, it’s probably the most credible account. Clinton’s book lacked any real introspective into her campaign and Fire and Fury took way to many liberties with the facts. I did find this book some what boring after the first few chapters. Partly because nothing particularly new or damning was exposed.  And partly because there was no real direction in this book (which may have been the point) The short version: The president is impulsive, arrogant and doesn’t know what he’s doing. His staff tries hard to control him. They fail repeatedly. I did gain some introspective into Steve Bannon and the part he played in all this. So if you want to reinforce subjects you already know, buy this book.
 Although I didn’t really learn much new, I did find the manner in which the information presented was fact based with backup notes.
 Bob Woodward's book on the Trump presidency is well-worth taking the time to read. It's not an easy read, to be honest, but it's clear and cogent in its reporting. This isn't a gossipy, name-driven celebrity bio. It's painstakingly researched, documented reporting. I highly recommend it.
 Woodward is the most reliable journalist in America.  Trustworthy account of the Trump White House.  Great insights not just about Trump but the people around him.  A must read for the political junkie as well as all Americans , especially those who voted for him.
 Donald Trump is a disaster and every American who cares about true democracy and freedom (liberal or conservative) should realize that unless this evil tyrant and his enablers are removed from power, it is very likely that this Republic will perish. We are not dealing with policies and the intricate workings of the American government, military, economy, and system of justice in the normal give and take that has always allowed Americans to disagree and simultaneously build the greatest nation on earth. We are dealing with a man who would willingly destroy this nation in service to his own ego. We are dealing with a source of such evil that truth has no value and ripping families apart does not weigh on his conscience in the least. Trump is a racist, and his words cannot be misunderstood by anyone who does not share such shameful opinions. This book is a compilation of facts about what this horrific man has done to America. The facts, presented in this excellent work and by virtually every legitimate news organization for years now, leave little choice for Democrats or Republicans (as I used to be) to do anything but VOTE to regain control of the government of the USA by electing large pluralities of Democrats and then holding them accountable through a fair electoral process for returning us to the functional bipartisanship that has served us Americans so well. One hopes that the Republican Party can somehow find the courage and leadership necessary to transform itself back into a party that stands for American values and principles. I ran out of profane epithets to describe Donald Trump long ago. However, reading this superb but horrific account of how Donald Trump supported by enemies of the US, executed an unbelievable attack on America, has caused me to recycle most of those epithets many times.
 Well documented by describing in fighting and highlighting valour by a few individuals to protect the American public by removing strategic malevolent documents from Presidents desk. Tend to agree with commentary regarding the intellectual capacity of the President. The book should have been more appropriately entitled ‘Danger’ as ignorance  coupled to power equates to dangerous, dangerous,dangerous.
 I've only gotten through the first 120 pages or so, and find myself wondering about the book: the first 130 pages seems far more positive on this admin's achievements than I might have expected - in fact, one of my very pro-Trump friends had enunciated the very same achievements, prior to be general availability of the book -  I wonder if the next 200 or so pages continues this theme - for all the apparent chaos and circus like goings on, the admin has achieved much of what the candidate Trump had promised -
 I was a little hesitant to order as I thought it was going to be a condemnation/rant against trump; however, it simply lays out the facts and lets the reader make up his/her mind.  I found there was very little of  the author's opinion on various scenarios.
 "Fear" is a good name for Bob Woodward's book.  It is scary when you realize what is going on with Trump and this Administration.  Everything is documented and there is PROOF about everything written.  I have voted for Both Parties through the years, but I am betting most Republicans won't read this book, because they don't want to know the real truth and  sadly, they believe everything on Fox News.
 In my judgment Woodward is the most respected reporter of our time. If he reports it, it is accurate and fair. It is real news.
 If you watch the news at all then there probably isn’t much in this book that you haven’t already heard. This book merely confirms our worst fears rather than reporting any bombshells.<br/><br/>As usual, Woodward’s book is rich with details. There are plenty of quotes and behind the scenes meetings. But it lacks the coherent storyline of his other White House tomes, likely due to the fact that the current White House lacks any coherence itself. This is a collection of anecdotes of a sad isolated narcissist not a grand political expose.<br/><br/>It is perhaps a good work of journalism and historical evidence but it is not much of a page turner. Sadly there are no heroes in this story. Those that look the best are probably he sources that put themselves in the best light after the fact (namely Porter and Cohn).<br/><br/>It was a quick read, however, and worth the effort required.
 This is a scathing and enthralling read.  I could hardly put it down. As a middle of the road political person, this scorches and smacks of truth.
 FEAR doesn't really start until page 200, but then it packs a whallop. Everything your suspected about Trump is true. He is a narcissist, sociopath, liar, and is delusional. His doctor (Ronny Jackson) gave him a clear mental health check, then "Dr." Jackson was promptly fired from his job. So is Trump demented? Woodward portrays Trump as possibly having early dementia, why else would he forget so easily and be so thoroughly deluded? Trump is "amoral" at best, criminal at worst.
 Great read. Helped brush off the cobwebs on how Trump thinks. Woodward reinforces my view, he's not fit for office as leader of our nation. Bad news is it left me wanting more. Well written but ended way too soon for me, but maybe that's because since publication a lot has happened in DC.
 I'm about halfway through the book, but I can confidently say that it makes for compelling reading. The narrative style of the writing may be criticized by some who would like to discredit the author, but in a credibility contest between Trump and Woodward, I think Woodward wins every time.<br/><br/>I think everyone--EVERYONE--would benefit from this behind-the-scenes glimpse of the Trump campaign and presidency. People have been trying to make sense of the collective lunacy that would put a con man in the Oval Office and this book serves as a great place to start.
 Horrifying, but honestly, other than some revealing quotes that were out before release, most of this material has been available in the news since the first days of the campaign
 This book is very well written. The behind the scenes look into this White House is scary. This book makes you sit up and take notice. Bob has done a great job reminding us why it’s so important to vote and hold our elected officials accountable. I was surprised to learn just how close Lindsey Graham is to Trump. Knowing that answers a lot of the questions as to why Lindsey supporters Trump on things that he wouldn’t have in the past. This book is proof that this country is in trouble and we had better take notice.
 Thorough and well documented, much more so than other books about this president. Woodward is an artist in crafting all of the sources and painting a picture of what is happening in our government today. He reports the truth, without an edge or ulterior motive.
 The 45th President of the United States of America is as bad as you have been warned he is. Inept, clueless, out-of-touch, and unsympathetic are just a few of the adjectives/phrases to describe America's Commander in Chief. This book details many situations and conversations that will curl your toes and question how anyone could have been duped into believing anything  Donald Trump has to say. We are doomed.
 This book is filled with times, dates, places and details. The tone is completely neutral and straightforward reporting. I was supprrised to learn that there are people concerned about his childlike behavior and shocking lack of interest and his  ignorance of the US Constitution, history and the mechanics of government. Nothing in the book surprises me, as Trump's very public behavior, statements and tweets since before he took office are consistent with everything in the book.<br/>It is a necessary book, and strikes at the urgency of every American to be informed.
 I can imagine the picture drawn by the Author and fully believe it's the truth and he tell the truth.  God bless the America!
 This book will open your understanding as to what goes on into the Trump White House.  I have learned things I would of never have, unless I bought this book.  Whether you are Republican or Democratic, the blinds of your eyes are surely to be opened up by purchasing this read.  WOW!!!!
 What thoroughly hideous people these are.  I can't believe I am filling my mind with depraved people with absolutely no regard of their destruction of democracy or their native land.  I am glad that all these people will soon be where their schemes will not succeed.
 I had seen on the news some of what was in this book, but this book takes you to the room. I've always thought very little of Trump, now that he is the president, I'm scared to death! This book confirms all of my fears. I don't know what scares me more that we have a president that can not tell the truth, and truly believes his own lies, is totally unable to learn, or that he is  surrounded by people that allow this and enable him to be our nations worst nightmare. After researching Bob Woodward, a well respected author, I believe he wrote what he was told by the people involved, and they were telling the truth. Trump is a "professional liar" s stated by his lawyer. I just pray that someone is able to restrain him before it is to late.
 I hoped for more explosive data, although the sourcing and hard work he did is worthwhile. I just felt he held back too much. Then again, a mere collection of presidential tweets do more to fill in the blanks (and would scare any rational person).<br/>An OK source for future historians trying to piece together how one man came close to destroying our country, if not the entire flat earth.
 This book opened my eyes as to just how nasty,  middle-class hating, and how much of a dishonest criminal trump is. I think the way trump uses fear, manipulation of the masses, and how he encourages the creation of tumultuous riots among his followers and lacks empathy towards others who are suffering. I would encourage anyone who has an interest in the true observations of trump to read this book.
 ...not because it isn’t well written (it is).<br/>-not because it isn’t well researched (it is).<br/>-not because it isn’t well sourced (it is).<br/>Don’t read this book because it is clear evidence that we have a narcissistic, lying and DANGEROUS person ruining our geo-political alliances and placing our republic on the road to ruin.  The book is simply damned frightening.  I’m hugging and holding my family and friends close having read this book.
 It gib=ves me information to use when I talk with a trumpling!
 For all the same reasons that you can't make a great wine out of poor quality grapes we are handicapped by  " The Donald" .<br/>Really enjoyed this book, tho saddened by the knowledge that our relationship with the leader of the Free world has taken on a soap opera flavor.
 I love how Woodward just lays the various reports he's collected out in a slightly disjointed line and lets the reader make his own conclusions. There's no narrative explaining how you should think of this, no berating the President, no moral admonitions. Just the facts, who said what, where, and when.  The result is a very scary view into the White House and how people are dealing (or not) with the chaos there.
 The author and publisher were obviously trying to get this book out the door as fast as possible to maximize their sales. The thought, writing, and construction of the text is sloppy. It apparently went to press without the attention of a good editor.
 You are probably only considering purchasing this if you already think Trump is a ding-dong.  The book arrived promptly and in good condition.  The content is....  Well, shocking.  I recommend it.  Just don't expect your brain is going to hold all of it.  By chapter 3 I was overwhelmed by the daily chaos as outlined in the book.  Recommend also purchasing some nice tea to go with the book.
 The characterization of an impulsive leader, blissfully ignorant in how Government and the international community works hits the bullseye. Scene after scene depicts the roles and efforts of political opportunists, seasoned professionals loyal to the Nation first and relatives focused on their post-administration wealth vying to shepherd and corral the President. The most important task  for most days was to thwart, delay and undo the President's agenda and goals.
 This is  a rare glimpse at how policy is made at the highest levels of our government.  For that alone, it is worth reading.  It also confirmed what I already thought of Trump, and sheds light on just how unqualified he is.  His lack of understanding of both economic issues and foreign affairs is scary, and I only hope his senior advisors can last long enough to prevent him from acting on his worst impulses.
 I do consulting at a lot of companies and would always worry about working with "leaders" that didn't know what they didn't know, or they thought they knew everything.  DJT is the true definition of an ignorant racist slime ball that has surrounded himself with supportive lying puppets that only want to KHA - if they don't they're gone.  What a horror show.
 I'll say this:  Woodward couldn't have picked a better title for this well-researched book.  Basically, it solidified everything I believed, but it presented in a fashion that pulls this mess altogether and makes moving to Canada a possible decision...OK...maybe not realistic, but we are in such trouble and this book stands out above all that has been written about this person up till now.  I'm glad I read it..and wish it was fiction.
 This book was well written, compelling, insightful and engaging.  I couldn’t put it down.
 After reading Rick Wilson's Everything Trump Touches Dies,  this read almost like a textbook.  But talk about fear:  I came away feeling like  it is a miracle we  aren't in the middle of a nuclear war right now.  Everyone,  no matter where  your  party loyalty lies, should read this book.  And remember to vote in the midterms for reasonable people  that will  not destroy the earth and  will put their country,  not themselves, first.  Vote Blue.
 An interesting read, but a bit disjointed and definitely biased. It was a series of short vignettes with sometimes large gaps between them, and it's hard to tell whether they are a fair representation of the bigger picture or if they were carefully selected to support a particular political slant. Nevertheless, they paint a believable picture of a dysfunctional White House that pretty much aligns with what we see externally.
 Woodward's account of the Trump Whitehouse supports other accounts of the narsastic madness of caeous in reviting detail with documentation.
 I am not certain what Trump is so upset about, this book actually paints him in a much more favorable light than his own tweets.
 I took a star away because there were times that the book was a bit confusing , with going back and forth in time when changing topics.  It just didn't flow as well as the writing I've come to expect from Woodward.  Perhaps it was from writing about ongoing events, things still in flux.  Whatever the reason,it was disappointing in that way.  Also, I was aware of many of these situations, but was glad to go more in depth.
 Confirms everything we suspected about Trump himself - the stubbornness, egomania, delusional thinking, habitual lying- and sheds much light on those around him and their constant jockeying for influence. Nobody emerges unscathed from this story.
 Bob Woodward gives an outsiders view into the Trump admin and Trump himself. This is not totally slanted to the left view but rather gives facts and one man's interpretation of those facts. Well written. Last quarter of book is mostly footnotes.
 I grew up with Nixon, Vietnam, and Watergate. Woodward's years of award winning Washington Post reporting made this a difficult, agonizing book to tead. Horrors like the Vietnam experience reading how Munchkin tRump's Sec of the Treasury, struggled to explain to POTUS why he can't just order the Mint to print paper currency 24/7 until the national debt is paid off. Oh, The Horror.
 I haven't been tempted to read any of the numerous books out there about Donald Trump...until this one.  Bob Woodward is a respected journalist and a good writer. This book is based on hundreds of interviews with people inside the Trump administration.<br/><br/>I recommend book for anyone interested in seeing what's going on inside the Trump White House. Prepare to be scared.
 How would I know? I wasn't there. However, this account seems true to the character of the president as I see and hear him on TV (not to mention on Twitter.) He can deny, dissemble and distract all he wants, it still seems accurate to me. This book, as all his others is extremely well written. It's comforting that there are still authors who have  command of the English language.
 Yes, I was terrified when I learned how things work in the White house.  Woodward takes you inside to watch decisions being made (or not) and how little the president actually understands about how the country works.  Yikes.
 Woodward has written an  important and necessary account of the  worst president the country has ever had.  It's  clear that  Trump  is unhinged and  dangerous,  and that the  Republicans are  complicit  in propping him up. Vote them all out!
 Well, fascinating  and horrifying at the same time; reads like a work in progress (which of course it is); a huge subject pretty well covered; probably too soon for Woodward to write it, although it was a public service to publish so much info before the midterm elections. His own commitment to journalistic “true news” is the key reason to pay careful attention to this book.
 No need to get your facts from crony politicians when there is Bob Woodward.  Using real journalism he provides very specific examples of what turns out to be chaos happening at the White House.  This is a rare opportunity to hear the truth.  Read this book and you'll find yourself running to polls in November.
 Thought this book was well written and really don't know what to say about the subject, except our country seems to be going the wrong direction. Hope we only have to endure 2 more years of this BS. I apologize for the politics, it's only the second time in my life I've every been politicized as I call it. First time after coming home from the nam and marching against the war in 1971. And now this time protesting against a lying crook in the White House.
 This book is a series of instances and events told in a manner of statements given in an interview. Bob Woodward has a reputation of integrity as a journalist and known to well research and fact check his work. It is believable and frightening.
 Love Donald Trump or hate him, one has to admit he has no idea what he is doing. It is sad and scary that a man who obviously could not pass a written immigration test, let alone high school History and Government is at the helm. He askes questions like, "why can't we just print more money?" No wonder so many of his business ventures failed and American banks will no longer loan him money.
 This is an absolutely fantastic book. The tidbits in the book are too many to list here and have been mentioned in previous reviews. The only thing to add at this point is that the people quoted in the book and now trying to push back (SecDef Mattis, Rob Porter) are lucky this book has moved out of the headlines. I have no doubt Woodward has tapes of each and every interview and quote.
 Those words define the current presidency. No one knows what is going to happen next. Not his opposition, not the press, not his staff...not even the president. The most telling sentence in the entire book....the last one.....Bob Woodward is excellent...
 I had never read one of Woodward's books. It was a bit disappointing. Very factual, but dry. I guess he didn't want to be put in the same category as other "tell all" books about the Trump Whitehouse, full of gossip and innuendo. So, he went in the opposite direction. It's not going to change any minds, but this point we're all pretty much set in our opinion of Trump, good or bad.
 Very detailed, remarkable information and obviously, the man is unfit for the office.
 A necessary documentation of the current political arena!!!  A trustworthy, credible work.
 There were times, while reading this book, I needed to look things up to have a better understanding of all the people and names involved. I truly do not know how Mr. Woodward kept such meticulous notes to write this book in such depth. This book was well written and kept me intrigued.  The shock of what staffers had to do in order to keep overzealous mistakes made by the POTUS in moments of  spontaneity were mind boggling. A fantastic read!
 This book did not disappoint. Example after example of what is disfunctional in the administration. We have been lucky up to now
 Hopefully, the passage of time will free us from this electoral mistake. Please, no crisis till 2021!
 It is a shame that the book was underwhelming DUE to the insanity of the daily reports on this President and Administration. The next President will have a LOW bar. Just because you have some sort of business success does NOT negate character and behavior.
 Amazingly detailed account showing how unprepared, and disrespectful our president is for and of his role. Driven by ignorance, ego, and vengeful action he is dangerously playing a high stakes game with no skill or ability.
 This book is a good, informative read.  It is well written and I especially like how Woodward explains things and puts things in context for the average reader, who isn't familiar with the White House staff protocols or the complexities or history of foreign policy.  I also did not get the sense that he was biased for or against a particular political view.
 Excellent insight though a bit rambling.  A series of ‘then this happened’ kind of storytelling.  Important but scary.  Can’t say any of us are surprised, except why is this guy still supported by his party?  He’s not even a republican he’s a scam artist who chose to run Republican bc educated voters with a conscience would never tolerate such a sheister.
 It is what it is everyone already knows that he is a pathological narcissistic man with an obsession of lying it's in his his DNA.<br/>fear is weakness and this individual has placed our country in grave danger. Treason right around the corner.
 Overly detailed regarding rather mundane issues.<br/>Numerous subjects left unfinished, mid chapter with abrupt changes to unrelated topics.<br/>Shades of the Comey descriptive on rather pedestrian material.<br/>Easy reading but sleepy content at times.<br/>Jake in AZ
 Woodward tells a tale that is both fascinating and frightening of how corrupt Donald Trump is kept propped up by others who keep forgiving his monstrous faults and covering up for him.  What is in it for them, though, Woodward never tells...
 I was so excited to read this book.  Until, that is, I read it.  It seemed already outdated, and frankly the revelations were not much.  Each chapter started with a 'history' lesson to set up that chapters gotcha moment.  But, since I had just lived through the incidents, there was really nothing new here.  Woodward's writing style is dull and mechanical.  Not impressed on any level.
 I was afraid before reading this book...terrified after reading it and now double-terrified knowing that nearly fifty percent of America’s voting public think Trump is rational, sane and a great President. God save us.
 Another excellent book from a renowned author. Goes deep into the White House to expose Trump's shortcomings: temper, disorganization, inability to learn college-level material, short attention span, needy, narcissistic, shallow, spiteful and untruthful - to name just a few things. The book comes to what I consider a sudden end. Of course, its not a novel. Every adult should read this.
 I’ve read a few political books and 2 primarily focused on Trump! This book was so easy to read! It provided direct quotes of actual conversations that took place in the Trump presidential world! How often can you feel like you’re in the room with some of the most powerful men in the world &amp; be privy to their conversations and thoughts! I would highly recommend this book!
 I think this is an important work and I subscribed to both the Kindle and the audio format.
 Good read I almost felt sorry for the whitehouse staff... but they must have known what they would be dealing with! I found president trump to be sympathetic as he is a victim of his own conceit and unwillingness to even consider the opinions of those seeking to advise him. The only question is how long will people be willing to cover up his total failings?!
 I couldn’t get through it, a bit disjointed.  Or maybe I’ve bought too many books on this topic, already.  I need a good book about how America can recover from the damage done by Herr Gropenfuhrer.
 Trump is pathological.  He's vindictive and not a bright man.  This book  exemplifies why there needs to be a better system to nominate presidential candidates.  The book is long, but entertaining. You  feel as if you're in the room listening to these discussion. Throughout the book, I kept thinking, "Is this the best we can do and is this how we hire those in high levels in the federal government to run things?" Over and over, you find He Who Has a Short Attention Span,  talking to people and then doing what he pleases anyway.  I hope that an electronic update contains a chronological list  of his "untruths" and an update containing three lists; those Trump fired,  those who got fed up and resigned and those who were prosecuted.<br/><br/>Pence is somewhat invisible in most of the book.  Which is disappointing, since he is next in line should something happen to Trump.<br/><br/>Perhaps both parties will realize that the whole Presidential selection and election process is broken. This presidency will be the phoenix/catalyst for change.  One term should be enough. With respect to my headline, I don't think a lot of his constituency purchases books or reads newspapers.  Perhaps magazines while standing in line in grocery stores.  ;)
 This book is so full of factual interviews and observations - it makes you really wonder why Trump got elected. - Oh ya - Putin really wanted him in office so he could be manipulated.  Trump is truly a threat to the stability of our country.<br/>Thank you Bob Woodward for writing this.  Let's see if the GOP will grow a spine and do something about this trainwreck we call a President
 Personally, I was disappointed in Bob Woodward's narrations.  I just expected better &amp; can't really pinpoint why I did not like how he wrote it.  Most of the info I knew or had read elsewhere, but Woodward rambled &amp; I found myself rereading something because of how he wrote it.  IF you don't know what's going on in DC, this will be most interesting.
 The book provided more depth to stories which I have read in newspapers. You get to experience what it’s like to be in the room when major issues are being debated.
 This one took a long time for me to read – partly because of trying to keep all of the names straight, but mainly because it made me mad and disgusted at what our political elites have become.  Regardless of your political affiliation or if you are an independent, if you accept the fact this is a well-researched book it should get you thinking.  Why do we put up with this?
 After reading this I can’t believe that those in the White House don’t get together and invoke tge 25th Amendment!<br/>Please save our democracy from this narcisist.
 "Fear" provides a gruesome, up close &amp; personal view of how the sausage is made in the Trump White House.  As expected, this is not a pretty picture.  The book confirms what you probably already know but will no doubt reinforce your desire to work hard for change from this unprecedented dysfunctional, so-called leader of the used-to-be free world.  There was no logical "end" to Woodward's book.  He could still be writing more chapters as the Trump madness continues.
 The book had accurate detail where I could get a good idea of the setting, people, timeframe and points being made. I wish there had a been a table of contents with titles for each chapter. I like chapters. I read a book from cover to cover. Once I read over the chapter titles, I have a better understand of where the book is going beforehand. Overall, an excellent read.
 This reads like you are in the same room when things are happening.  It was much as I expected, only much worse.  It seemed credible as it was consistent with other information coming out of the White House.
 I guess the trouble with writing about Trump, especially when you are one of the few people who could gain the kind of access Bob did, and have the historical perspective that Bob has, is that some people (i.e. me) would have expected more than Bob just doing his job as a journalist. I would have expected him to draw upon his experience with Nixon et al, the effect Watergate had on American politics and the development of events between then and now.<br/><br/>Trump seems hell bent on destruction. All his motivations seem to be to destroy / break / remove / isolate - never to create or engage. "TRADE IS BAD." Trump writes on a document, one of this book's most searing revelations. Somewhere out of all those interviews, Bob surely had some thoughts on what on Earth is driving a US president to believe that.<br/><br/>There are several moments when a fuller picture could emerge. Trump was apparently, genuinely moved by the images from Syria of dead children. Barron, his young son comes into the office with a terrified friend who wants a selfie with Trump. Trump happily obliges. It doesn't take a genius to start piecing a picture together of a deeply disturbed man, permanently traumatized by his brutal father into a child-like state of permanent rage and fear, who nevertheless feels a connection with scared / harmed children (unless of course they are part of an "infestation").<br/><br/>If you are not expecting any of these things, but simply an account of life with Trump without the colour and intrigue of Wolff's book Fire and Fury, then this book is for you.
 For starters, incredibly written book. As a disabled Veteran, I didn't think I could get more disgusted by what this administration is doing to our country and our relationships with our allies. I was wrong. VOTE this traitor out!
 As usual, well constructed book that is a must read for anyone living in this country and current times. Although based upon interviews mainly, there is enough reality to be considered very factual. This book certainly changes opinions about the circle of staff both former and current having to work with our presidential administration.
 WHATEVER THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION REVEALS, WOODARD’S FEAR DETAILS AN ADMINISTRATION INCOMPETENT TO NOT ONLY LEAD THE NATION BUT ALSO ONE WHICH EXHIBITS AN IGNORANCE OF BOTH INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMACY AND AMERICA’S STANDING IN THE WORLD. WHILE THERE A MULTPLE BOOKS EXAMING THE CURRENT ADMINISTRSATION, WOODWARD HAS THE GRAVITAS TO EARN THE CONCERN OF EVERY AMERICAN.
 This is an amazing example of reporting at its best. You have to believe there is no such thing as “false news” when you read this.
 Wow! I was frightened before reading this novel! Now, I am terrified! It's one thing to hear  these things. It's another to read actual quotes. Unfortunately, the only people going to read this are people who already understand!
 The main takeaway for me is Trump's willful ignorance and disregard of the advice of experts and expertise. Very dangerous in a complex world. Anyone who says, "I alone can fix it!" surely cannot.
 Excellent presentation of Trump and how his appointed staff had to work around his inability to review and absorb information and rush to judgement.  It is extensively referenced and does not come across as a hit job on Trump.  The recent anonymous op-ed in the New York Times is an additional endorsement of what it is like to serve a president who has a thin skin, can’t and won’t admit that he is capable of making mistakes.
 I have just finished reading "Fear....Trump in the White House" by Bob Woodward.<br/><br/>My opinions of Trump haven't really changed as a result of reading this book, but my deep reservations and outright fear of what Trump could do to harm our country have magnified exponentially, and I believe he is genuinely dangerous.<br/><br/>Long before Donald Trump ran for President, I thought he checked all the boxes of a certifiable psychopath, and nothing has changed my opinion by reading this book. I am just more terrified of what Trump might do while holding the most powerful office in our land, and being the most powerful person on our planet. Trump does not have the mental or emotional capacity to fulfill his duties and responsibilities. Whether I agree with his politics or policies matters not at all in my serious concern about his fitness for office.<br/><br/>This book is brilliantly written, weaving a chronology of events beginning with the decision to enter the race, the campaign, and the inner workings of the White House through March of 2018. It describes the absurd level of chaos prevalent from the beginning, and the genuine concern by many within the Trump orbit about the dysfunctional atmosphere promoted by Trump himself. Trumps bombastic style and sheer incompetence are present and alarming from the beginning, and only worsened as Trump continued to be more agitated and paranoid by the Mueller investigation, and as the pressures of being the U.S. commander in chief in this polarized world became more serious.<br/><br/>“Mr. President, I cannot, as a lawyer, as an officer of the court, sit next to you and have you answer these questions when I full well know that you’re not really capable,” Dowd told Trump.<br/><br/>Porter told an associate, “A third of my job was trying to react to some of the really dangerous ideas that he had and try to give him reasons to believe that maybe they were not such good ideas.”<br/><br/>“It’s not what we did for the country,” Cohn said. “It’s what we saved him from doing.”<br/><br/>“When you put a snake and a rat and a falcon and a rabbit and a shark and a seal in a zoo without walls, things start getting nasty and bloody. That’s what happens.” In July 2017, Priebus was replaced by Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly.<br/><br/>I recommend everyone read this book and draw your own conclusions.
 It tells it as it is, nothing more and nothing less - the good and the bad. Unfortunately, there is a lot of bad. Corroborating existing reports throughout the last record years, we see a disjunctive and uncoordinated administration that suffers from a lack of true leadership at the top. Partly responsible for this is trump’s character flaws.
 I knew in my heart that this manbaby was out of control, but reading it , oh boy! Mr Woodward’s style of writing is such that I can visualize &amp; “ hear” the individuals as they speak. Authentic, I truly believe all that I read as it correlates with all the behavior that I’ve seen on tv, read on Twitter &amp; on ALL news outlets ,both here &amp; overseas.  I truly hope our country comes together to return it (USA) &amp; learn  from the “mistake” of keeping an archaic system ( Electorate College) that determines who the People want in the White House. Thank you Mr. Woodward for your devotion, loyalty to truth &amp; love of country🇺🇸✊🏽
 Reading how Trump manages his staff and how he responds to negative feedback helped answer why he behaves publically the way he does.  I am afraid it will take 20 years or more to repair the damage he is doing to our national government.  That's assuming the American electorate selects future leaders who are not mendacious bullys.
 This is a very well documented book about the present Trump administration. Bob Woodward is a highly respected journalist who has won the Pulitzer Prize twice for excellence in journalism.  He has interviewed many government officials who have dealt with Donald Trump. It is a must read for any concerned citizen in this country.
 This book unlike the other 2 books I have read about Trump’s White House, does not seem to have any particular agenda. Although all three books portray the same dynamic in the White House, I thought Woodward went out of his way to show all sides of the story without pointing fingers
 Unlike, he who shall not be named in the White House, who makes up his own reality to suit his needs, Woodward's book is fully documented with pages and pages of sources following the book's conclusion.  The first scenario he shares from 2012 about a Trump Tower meeting when the one in the White House was thinking about running is repeated throughout the entire book.  Whatever needs to be said, regardless of what the truth is, is what will be said, which is exactly why today the people in the United Nations laughed at his address to them.  Woodward does a great job of putting headlines in context with what was going on and interjects his own thoughts appropriately.  He is a formidable journalist...probably the greatest of our nation and he does not disappoint in Fear.  And yes, I am even more afraid for our nation, than I was before reading it.
 Valuable insight into the Trump presidency from the most trusted journalist in America.
 Woodward is trustworthy and a book by him has credibility which others do not.
 I am not a Trump supporter but Woodward gave me a little insight into a somewhat more human Trump.<br/><br/>Having said that...holy cow.<br/><br/>As usual with Woodward, extensively researched with obvious attempt to be impartial.<br/><br/>It's not just Trump who scares the heck out of me...the people he surrounds himself with.  If this is the best our election system can do, maybe we need a revolution after all.<br/><br/>The chaos, greed, inability to think critically by pretty much  everyone in the administration could get us all killed.  I was afraid when Trump and Kim were trying to out bully each other....all the other stuff Woodward exposed that we didn't know about made the tweets look benign.<br/><br/>To have Woodward bring out the facts of how this administration runs is blood curdling.<br/><br/>This book isn't about politics...it's about endemic corruption of the law and of the soul of those in charge.
 This book shows how much vetting of the policies that have actually been implemented have gone through, and just how different they are from Trump's world view.  I'm very happy that he has had some fairly reasonable and knowledgeable people surrounding him to stop him from totally destroying our country due to his arrogance and complete lack of understanding of foreign affairs and how politics is supposed to work.
 I remember the news reports on many of the accounts in this book, but getting the inside information was eye opening. I trust Woodward to report events using old fashion techniques of collaboration and documentation, however, I still wonder if all the accounts are accurate. But if even two-thirds of of what he reports is can be trusted, it's a very scary book.
 This book wasn't written by a political hack or a two bit reality TV star with her nose up Donald's butt, pissed off about being fired.  This is Bob Woodward, one of the most respected journalists of the last 50 years.  If half of what he writes here is true that man is morally, mentally and intellectually unfit for anything but cheap reality TV crap.
 Good journalism, you aren't manipulated, just told the facts.  Its enough.  You aren't reading a novel, you are reading a diary like the original Dracula.  The only think missing are the fangs.
 I knew Trump was crazy, but wow not like this. It concerns me that he doesn't really grasps how the government really works. Seems really out of touch with today's world. Vote Blue is all I can say!
 Woodward is spot on the the description of events in this book.  All is backed up with both named and unnamed sources, meeting minutes, and first hand accounts of events.  I loved the plain truth ..just the facts and no off the cuff opinion.... as with other books about this presidency.  Amazing how history shows us that fear can be a powerful motivator.  If none exists...just create it.
 This book was and easy read that will leave you afraid for the country. It has descriptions of a president who is determined to do what he feels is right even against experts who try to convey information and advice. It is a shocking behind the scenes story in how inadequate this White House is to handle complex issues.
 The biggest problem with this book is that there’s still so much more to know than what’s presented in here. As with Nixon, it will still be another few years and a lot of facts coming to light before a great Trump book can be written. That said, it’s interesting and pretty well written, though Woodward falters a few times with the facts (as we all do) and the book drags by the end (I mean, how many stories of this guy’s idiocy do we really need to read?)
 I highly recommend this informative book, and will leave the detailed reviews to the better writers.  I just finished reading it on the eve of the mid-terms, and what I am am feeling is Fear, of Trump still in the White House.
 I wanted this to own rather than getting it from the library. Well written of course. Good read. One of the many books to come out about this adm. with a mountain of books by different authors sure to follow. I would have bought it even without the good reviews as I like and respect Woodward's work. Good buy to keep in my personal library.
 Woodward is very thorough. Based on Past and current work -Nothing goes into the book that hasn’t been confirmed by multiple witnesses.<br/><br/>Book is organized like a story timeline. Very informative. With no (political) thought interjection. Highly recommend if you want to know what’s going on inside the White House.
 Truth is truth. Bob Woodward has always been a trustworthy reporter/writer.
 Well written book.
 If even 10% of this work is true, we as a nation are in big trouble. I've been following presidential politics for years and am amazed at the ineptitude of this administration.
 A very disturbing chronicle of the trump White House, from the very first chapter,  from the first page. It's chilling, how we came to this. Chaos and confusion has been a part of his presidency from day one, from the campaign onward. Chilling.
 I hadn't bought any other book about trump (I can't seem to capitalize his name) waiting for this one. So, so disappointing. First of all the good stuff was already out on t.v. The rest of the book reiterated the same fact...trump is incompetent, doesn't read, doesn't understand economics. And thinks very highly of himself and no one else. I thought it was a 400+ page book but really barely over 300 pages with repetitive footnotes. Am I the only one to think it jumped around a bit too much?<br/>Five stars is crazy insane<br/>Four stars is crazy.<br/>Three stars is being nice<br/>It is a 2-star book at best.<br/>Save your money.
 Unlike James Comey’s book, Bob took dispirit recordings and interviews to create a journalist’s report of data as it was revealed by people in the know.  Regardless of their individual agendas, by and large the staff at the White House is actually attempting to ensure the security of our Nation regardless of the whims of the Commander in Chief.
 wow!!!!
 It’s a well written, well researched, very thorough book. It did give me anxiety while reading it, seriously.  To know the inner workings of the WH and how people are helping to save our country from disaster from DT who really doesn’t have a clue is disturbing on one aspect but relieving on another, hence the anxiety.
 Trump is exactly what he appears to be, this book absolutely cements it with hard facts, a lot of research, and interviews with Trump's former key staffers.  This whole presidency is a global nightmare, and 2020 cannot come quickly enough!  This book is well penned, researched, and every line is capable of scaring the American public. It is a book that I consider a Must-Read for anyone concerned with our nation.  Thank you to Bob Woodward for his hard work and allowing the American public access to the Circus that our White House has become under Trump and his sociopathic methods. I find this more informative than anything I have watched or read before. I am well and truly frightened for our nation.<br/><br/>As Always, I Wish Happy Reads to All from the Unapologetic Book 😉!<br/> (But you're not likely to be happy reading this, however you will be glad that you did, IMHO!).
 Bob W. Takes us where others fear to go - to the real workings of the worst presidency in the history of this nation. I’m so afraid that my grandkids as teens&amp; young adults think that this is normal. This book may help them realize it’s not- that Trump is really a madman. As far from normal as it gets. BRAVO!!!
 Almost too much information. Our nation has been jeopardized by a foreign power. We have been given the opportunity to reclaim the union. The author is an honorable man with a legacy of patriotism.<br/>There is no doubt that we as a people need to stand as one; We as a nation must fight with our very fiber. The time is now to act. Thank God for men, and women like Mr. Woodward. IMHO, our democracy would crumble.
 It's a sad time in our history to read Bob Woodward's investigative reporting on this presidency. The daily outpouring of lies and fake news have tarnished the office of the president while he attacks our intelligence and law enforcement agencies. This president seems to lack the character, intellect, and empathy to lead a divided nation at a time when unity is sorely needed! His attacks on freedom of the press and the ongoing Mueller Investigation are shameful and troubling. Perhaps this book will open a few eyes to the train wreck at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
 Excellent reading and the information provided in the book make you think twice of what is going on in the Nation's House. As a true independent, I refuse to be affiliated to any party, but reading this well written book does open your eyes to new aspects of what really  "might" be going on in the White house and the power to be.
 I enjoying learning the inner-working of Trump White House. I also found that entertaining the way the author describes the chaos in the Administration. That said, doesn't it make you wonder if the world is much less safe than before.
 Woodward is masterful.  I have always been a big fan beginning with All the President's Men.  This book is so well done.  His research is the best possible.  The picture he paints is so scary and he should be applauded for his fortitude in going the extra mile to produce this information.
 Through exhaustive research, Bob Woodward has given us a deeper insight into the chaos that reigns in Washington and spills over into the rest of the world. Fearfully unsettling.
 Bob Woodward is the Sergeant Joe Friday of journalism. The people interviewed can be assumed to have given him the best spin possible, and as more people leave the administration, and as more documents are revealed, the story will just get uglier. This is the best Trump and his supporters can expect in history books a couple of decades from now.
 Bob Woodward has written the best horror story in current literature. There's graphic detail of every bad decision, all the lies, plenty of times and places and names. What a horrific mess we're in.
 This is an easy read, hard to put down, and well sourced based on recordings and transcripts of first hand sources as well as public records  where available to back up the reporting.<br/><br/>This peek behind the scenes helps flesh out much of what's already been published and reported in the last two years.<br/><br/>Here's what Steve Bannon thinks of diehard Trump supporters (Chapter 4): "hammerheads in red ball caps" - direct quote of a first hand source, recorded and transcripted by  Woodward. Chew on that for awhile.  Trump's chief strategist thinks his core followers are fools to be manipulated; and Trump bought into that readily. Everything else in Trump world flows from that self-centered cynicism. Trump has said that he loves the uneducated - now you know why.
 We already knew we need to be afraid, very afraid.  There's a lot in this book that is known but enough that is not out there, that is maddening and/or very frightening, that it is well worth reading it.
 I like Bob Woodward's documentary style of writing.  His use of times and dates of occurances in the White House add a depth of credibility to "Fear" that other writings don't offer.
 I knew some of the things in the book, but this was so much more then I realized.  This rings true as to trumps nature, although there were a few things that surprised me, such as his views on DACA.
 The truth hurts...it's been said over and over again since forever.  Forever is today and tomorrow.
 I find Trump personally repugnant and utterly unfit to lead this country. This book, given Woodward's credentials, does nothing but reinforce my concerns about #45, the current administration, the GOP, and politics in general. I already assumed the WH was and is a dysfunctional mess. In such a scenario, the actions taken by the many individuals quoted and otherwise referenced in the book are no big surprise but it still made for some interesting and eyebrow-raising reading with more than a few "WTF" moments.<br/><br/>Definitely worth its purchase cost and the time spent to read it. A couple of tips for readers: 1) Read and keep in mind the Note to Readers in the front matter; it will help you understand the source of quoted statements better. 2) After each chapter, review the associated Source Notes in the back of the book -- they add considerable insight to the book's content.
 Just the name is enough for me.  Bob Woodward always writes well written books about political figures.  This one is no different.  Each topic is well researched. You have no doubt about his sources.
 I recommend this book to all who are interested and curious about what is happening in our government.  The quotes are real-time and unbelievable.  Many thanks to Bob Woodward, those who assisted him as well as all who are in government service and help hold our government together.  These are indeed troubled times.
 A must buy. If you like Trump, don't read this. Things in this book show just how corrupt he is and how loose his mind works. He doesn't care about anything except himself.
 The author --- Bob Woodward a most respectable and great writer tells us everything we need to know.  The facts are given -- its up to us to access them and decide what decisions we want to make for our country.  Do we sit back and do nothing, do we contact our representatives and demand action  --- its really up to America who they want to be ...
 This should be required reading for future generations, to remind them the risk of not voting, and hopefully never make the same mistake again of allowing such a "leader" to be placed in the greatest office in the world.
 Painstakingly sourced and expertly reported, “Fear” is the missing piece the public needed to truly comprehend the degree of dysfunction in the 45th presidential administration.<br/><br/>Woodward relays conversations with officials in breathless stream of consciousness; “Fear” is a must-read for anyone who’s wished to be a fly on the walls of the White House during trump’s residency.
 Again an excellent read by Bob Woodward. What would we do without him? Another touching part is how he thanks his wife at the end for being his constant companion. And yes, people should be fearful...
 Essentially a rendering of a series of interactions between Trump and several of his now ex-staffers and cabinet members, the book consistently demonstrates the President's impulsiveness, rigidity and distrust of expertise. Sobering.
 Very interesting, well researched and balanced reporting of the Trump White House.  Compelling and hard to put down.  Thanks for an accurate glimpse into the psyche of our president.
 Enjoyed an inside look at the current administration. Or should I say, former administration since most of the people have now left. Did give me some hope that there were people who do try to do the right thing even though they faced an uphill battle.  Picked this book because of the author’s reputation and amount of first person interviews.
 I was actually amazed by the significance of seemingly unrelated events that had so much more going on sub rosa. There were items that never made it into the news cycle and other events that I had actually forgotten as they slipped<br/>under the daily deluge of fake news (propaganda) from the administration.
 VERY GOOD READ--HARD TO UNDERSTAND HOW HE GOT ELECTED
 This is a must read for all American adults.  It is unbelievable how this administration is operating.  It is putting our democracy and our national security in serious danger.  These are American issues.  I imagine after reading this book everyone will agree that Trump is not fit to be President of the United States of America. Get out and vote!
 Very informative book.  I've read and learned much from all Woodard's books on past administrations and this book is no exceptions.  His work always well documented.
 Received it promptly on the 11th. Thank you Amazon.  The best chapter was the last one,  where Trumps attorneys trying to negotiate with Mueller to avoid his disastrous  testifying.  The book ends on March 22 when Dowd resigns.  The most horrifying, since I have family on active duty, was when Trump asks his 25 yo body man, MacEntree, if he should send more troops to Afghanistan.  Tillerson’s anger over how Trump insults and disrespects the generals was interesting.  Bottom line:  Our country is in danger, wake up GOP!
 It truly is overwhelming that a book like this must be written, but it does. Sorting fact from fiction is a monstrous task all by itself. But, again, it must be done. Truth is still the backbone of our country and key to accurate history. Praise to Woodward for keeping us on task with truth by exposing the lies. Well done.
 Ordered this book on my Kindle.  I am about 1/3 of the way through it.  It is a heavy read, but very informative.
 It's an interesting look behind the scenes.  It confirmed that we should all be afraid and disgusted about Trump being president.  The only thing I can say negative is that the best parts of the book were revealed in so many articles and reviews that I felt like I had read half the book already.
 Woodward paints a picture that is Shakespearean in it tragedy. This is a portrait of an emperor with no clothes who insists, despite all evidence to the contrary, that he has the nicest, the best clothes. The most terrifying part of the whole thing is how it will affect the world for a long time to come. Mandatory reading.
 Great insight and reporting from a respected journalist with decades of experience, Better title: FEAR &amp; CONFUSION.  DJP approach to leadership makes a mockery of the position of US President. This book is such an important read, I gifted to my Aunt.  Volume 2 for the second half of this debacle, Mr Woodward?  PJB
 Despite the howls of "fake news!" this is by far the best sourced of the White House tell-all books.  A full 30% of the book is appendices explaining the sources used to write each chapter.
 Well, it's an eye opener to be sure.  Well researched and written, as you'd expect from Bob Woodward.  A sorry state of affairs, actually, but not unexpected to anyone from NY or NJ who's familiar with Trump's antics over the years.<br/><br/>Can't wait for his next book or two on the Trump administration.
 Another great book by a great journalist. This is a must read. Before 2020 elections, every citizen of the USA should read this book. The press is NOT the enemy. We should be grateful that our nation has journalist who find out the TRUTH for us so people like Trump are not able to turn our nation into a dictatorship. Don’t be fooled by Trump’s hate and Fake News rhetoric. READ THIS BOOK before 2020 elections!
 Amazing insight into today's White House which is much worse than could be imagined. If anyone can support Trump as our U.S. President after reading this I am amazed and horrified.
 This book went in some detail to tell me stuff I really already knew. It’s interesting before Bannon pitched to Trump to run for president, Trump was giving the lions share of his donations to the Democrats. I’ve actually worked for people like Trump, it’s not fun. With my one little vote, I have zero control over any of this, but I would hope we could do better as a country.
 In my opinion this is a well written book that portraits several points of view consolidated into the author’s conclusions.<br/><br/>Only the future will tell whole story. Maybe in one hundred years our beloved country won’t be so polarized. Time will tell.
 The WH approach to the Meuller investigation was unique. I found the speed with which 45 goes from normal conversation to full blown raging, as well as his inability to remember what's going on from one day to the next, provided much insight into who he is as a person - and why, in my opinion, he is unfit for true leadership.
 A must read for everyone. A frightening insight into how our democratic process is being totally compromised. Those that believed that a businessman with no knowledge of being a leader should be the president of our great country need to think again.
 What this president does and has done is a crime to the American people.  Can the damage ever be undone and how long will it take.  After reading what has gone on how can people support this president with all his lies he tells over and over.  What Bob Woodward reports in the book is the same events that the media has reporting following Donald Trump.  This is a man who lie about releasing his taxes and the women that he assuaged.
 sorry not worth the money... read something else
 Superbly written, extremely detailed and horrifically informative. This book reads more like a conversation I'm having with the author rather than your run of the mill novel about a president. I am a first time reader of this Author however I am familiar with all his his works and I highly respect his unbiased accounts of this current administration. this book has made me a true fan of Bob Woodward and I will be purchasing everything he's ever written. If I could give this book 10 stars I would.
 Fear does just that...it creates FEAR in the minds of everyone. even the most loyal trumpist in America.  If half of what is in there is the truth, and Bob Woodward is known for truth, we can all take a step back and see what the future holds.<br/>It is not very uplifting and does not breed feelings of safety and security.
 This is a most aptly titled book. After just reading the prologue, I was shaking with fear.<br/><br/>Our nation is so polarized now, but I do think that every American who loves his/her country and truly believes democracy is the best form of government, will find this book really, really, really scary. It is utterly shocking to me how little Donald Trump was prepared to be president and then once he became president how little he has ever tried to learn how to fulfill his duties. Exhibit A: "There's a deficit? Just print more money." Yes, he really doesn't understand that this isn't a viable solution.<br/><br/>In my perception, this is not an anti-Trump book, although his base most likely perceives it as such. Rather, it is a book about Trump and how the White House works during the Trump administration. Author Bob Woodward, the consummate reporter, has an acute sense of fairness and comes to Trump's defense multiple times when Woodward deems Trump was unfairly or inaccurately maligned by various news stories.<br/><br/>The big talking points of the book were revealed a full week before it was published, and while those may be the most sensational parts, there is so much more to this book. To say Woodward did his homework and research is an understatement. He says right off the bat in the author's note that he recorded his interviews, as well as having access to the key players' meeting notes, personal diaries, files and government and personal documents. This book is grounded in facts—undisputable facts.<br/><br/>The most FEARful parts of the book for me:<br/>• Trump won't pay attention to policy details or even listen to his own experts he has hired for his cabinet and White House staff. He blows up angrily and becomes apoplectic when he hears something contrary to his own opinions.<br/><br/>• Trump's staff and cabinet view him as incompetent and unhinged so they frequently do things to purposefully nullify Trump's presidential power, but they say they do it for the good of the country. This includes surreptitiously swiping controversial documents off his desk so he can't sign them or purposely stalling and delaying so Trump forgets his crazier ideas. And Trump is apparently clueless this is happening.<br/><br/>• Trump has a very short attention span, even when our country's safety and security are at stake. It's as if he just can't be bothered.<br/><br/>• Trump won't read reports. He embraces pithy "one-liners" as a way to make policy, rather than reviewing the data.<br/><br/>• Trump lies—even to his own staff.<br/><br/>• Trump has become so consumed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation that he becomes extremely distracted, angry and outraged—and is largely incapable of functioning as president on his worst days. Top staff members cancel his meetings on days like this and just let him stew.<br/><br/>The last sentence of the book is a quote, and it is especially chilling—actually, terrifying—not only because of what is said, but also because of who says it.
 Well written, as one would expect.  Some of the content confirms many of the things I've read in the press about the Trump administration.  I was saddened to learn of the competitive behavior of those that advise and serve the president, to the extent that they sabotage one another.  Not what I want in the nation's Executive branch.
 Too scattered, great info but really jumped around too much. Amazing all the damage trump has done and also absolutely terrifying the forces of evil in our Own country that work this moron in chief's strings. He is proven to be bit only a dumber than dumb puppet but a disgustingly evil cretin interested in only his appearance.
 Fear: Trump in the White House by Bob Woodward<br/><br/>“Fear” is an insightful book of the turbulent Trump presidency. Highly respected journalist Bob Woodward meticulously exposes the broken Trump administration. This candid 357-page book includes forty-two chapters, photographs, and source notes.<br/><br/>Positives:<br/>1. A professional, fair and vivid depiction of Trump’s White House.<br/>2. The topic everyone is talking about in the hands of the master, Bob Woodward.<br/>3. Mr. Woodward is meticulous. His reputation precedes him and we the readers are the beneficiaries of his thorough work.<br/>4. The prologue establishes the foundation of Fear. “The ability to detect a launch in seven seconds would give the United States military the time to shoot down a North Korean missile. It is perhaps the most important and most secret operation in the United States government. The American presence in South Korea represents the essence of national security.”<br/>5. Woodward is a master of setting the stage. Every chapter begins by setting the stage of what’s to come, which includes the players involved, and the timing and location of events in vivid depictions.<br/>6. Bannon’s agenda clearly depicted. “‘Number one,’ Bannon went on, ‘we’re going to stop mass illegal immigration and start to limit legal immigration to get our sovereignty back. Number two, you are going to bring manufacturing jobs back to the country. And number three, we’re going to get out of these pointless foreign wars.’”<br/>7. The behind the scenes chaos after the Access Hollywood tape was released. “‘If you want to do it now,’ Priebus continued, ‘Pence is prepared to step up, and Condi Rice will come in as his VP.’ Rice had been national security adviser and secretary of state under George W. Bush.”<br/>8. Describes national security concerns. “‘Mistakes on the domestic side have a correcting mechanism. You can get a do-over. There are no do-overs” in national security. “When we make mistakes, it has huge consequences.’”<br/>9. Key traits of Trump are disclosed. “He was advised that Trump routinely kept meetings to 10 minutes.” “It was clear that Trump did not understand the way the U.S. government debt cycle balance sheet worked.” “President Trump is a good listener, Mattis said, as long as you don’t hit one of his third rails—immigration and the press are the two big ones.”<br/>10. Senator Lindsay Graham plays a surprising prominent role. “You can accept they’ve got a missile and tell them and China that if you ever use it, that’s the end of North Korea,” Graham said. “And have a missile defense system that has a high percentage of knocking it down. That’s scenario one. Scenario two is that you tell China that we’re not going to let them get such a missile to hit our homeland. And if you don’t take care of it, I will.”<br/>11. Trumps mistweets. “The president had to knock off the tweeting. The week prior, on March 4, he had sent out four tweets accusing Obama of wiretapping Trump Tower.”<br/>12. Trump’s many views on international policies. “Trump was one of the most outspoken foes of the 16-year-old Afghanistan War, now the longest in American history.”<br/>13. A look into the Iran deal negotiated by Obama.<br/>14. Much of this book has to do with the internal clashes of personalities inside the White House. One of the key clashes had to do with the globalists vs the nationalists. “If we can buy cheap products abroad and we can excel in other areas—service and high-tech products—that should be the focus. The global marketplace provided immense benefits to Americans.” “Cohn “has amassed a large power base in the West Wing and his two top aides on trade . . . are skilled political operatives fundamentally opposed to the Trump trade agenda.”<br/>15. Interesting insights on Mueller. “Worse, Trump said, he had interviewed Mueller just the day before to come back as FBI director and he had turned him down. Now Mueller was suddenly in charge. “So two times I’m bleeping bushwhacked by the Department of Justice.”<br/>16. Legal issues. “The major problem might be allegations of obstructing justice by urging Comey to drop the Flynn investigation, and then firing Comey. But Dowd believed that the president’s Article II constitutional authority clearly encompassed firing an FBI director.”<br/>17. Trump’s views on dealing with bad behavior toward women. “‘You’ve got to deny, deny, deny and push back on these women,” he said. “If you admit to anything and any culpability, then you’re dead. That was a big mistake you made. You didn’t come out guns blazing and just challenge them. You showed weakness. You’ve got to be strong. You’ve got to be aggressive. You’ve got to push back hard. You’ve got to deny anything that’s said about you. Never admit.’”<br/>18. The war against the EPA. “‘We need to get out of Paris,’ Pruitt said, handing the president a plain sheet of paper he wanted him to read withdrawing from the Paris Accord. We need to get out, he said. “This was a campaign commitment.”<br/>19. Trump’s views on Session. “Recusing himself made the attorney general a “traitor,” Trump said to Porter. The president made fun of his Southern accent. “This guy is mentally retarded. He’s this dumb Southerner.” Trump even did a little impression of a Southern accent, mimicking how Sessions got all mixed up in his confirmation hearings, denying that he had talked to the Russian ambassador.”<br/>20. The Big Problem. “Mattis and Gary Cohn had several quiet conversations about The Big Problem: The president did not understand the importance of allies overseas, the value of diplomacy or the relationship between the military, the economy and intelligence partnerships with foreign governments.”<br/>21. Noteworthy observations. “The president has zero psychological ability to recognize empathy or pity in any way.” “Trump had failed the President Lincoln test. He had not put a team of political rivals or competitors at the table, Priebus concluded. “He puts natural predators at the table,” Priebus said later. “Not just rivals—predators.”<br/>22. The Charlottesville debacle. “Trump touched a nerve with the phrase “many sides” suggesting an equivalence between the neo-Nazis and those who opposed white supremacy. Biting criticism of the president spanned the political spectrum, including many Republican Party leaders.”<br/>23. The lack of discipline and procedures. “The president often made decisions with only one or two or three people involved. There was no process for making and coordinating decisions. Chaos and disorder were inadequate to describe the situation. It was a free-for-all.”<br/>24. General Kelly’s views of his boss. “In a small group meeting in his office one day, Kelly said of the president, “He’s an idiot. It’s pointless to try to convince him of anything. He’s gone off the rails. We’re in crazytown.”<br/>25. Much more, photos and source notes.<br/><br/>Negatives:<br/>1. Didn’t provide links to the source material thus not taking advantage of the electronic book capabilities.<br/>2. A lot of the most provocative insights have been leaked to the public. The trailer of the movie depicted the best parts you may say.<br/>3. Not a lot new but just more accurately described.<br/><br/>In summary, this is the book on Trump you’ve been waiting for. Bob Woodward’s integrity is second-to-none and this book is yet another validation of his legacy. Woodward meticulously depicts a White House in chaos in which Trump’s very own people must protect the country from him, scary and thus the title of this book, Fear. A must read!<br/><br/>Further suggestions: “A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership” by James Comey, “Fire and Fury” by Michael Wolff, “Trumpocracy” by David Frum, “What Happened “ by Hillary Rodham Clinton, “Can It Happen Here?: Authoritarianism in America” by Cass R.

 A must read for every American who cares about out country.  Even if you knew much of this already, this is still insightful.  Too bad the people who need to read it won't.
 Bob Woodward shows in. This book  the Tragedy of Donald Trump.A man who is complex in his views of America.A man who is relentless about getting affirmations from those who know him A Narcissist Psychopath who believes the world revolves around him.I recommend this book to those who have doubts about his Authenticity.
 Mr Woodward attempts to give background on foreign affairs, rulers, and countries to the reader , but misses the mark with too little history, and no clear understanding of real world problems. The way in which Trump handles and faces these problems is not very informative.  If you are expecting a juicy, entertaining book, this is not the one to buy.  At least don't pay full price.
 This was a Christmas gift for my wife. She is not a reader, but can't put the book down. She is pushing me to read it when she is finished.<br/>I certainly recall Bob Woodward (and Carl Bernstein) from the Watergate days and know this is a factually driven piece of investigative work.
 A shame so much of the juicer disclosures were revealed before the book was released. Needed a spoiler alert. This book could keep going up until the day before it was released. There's been almost as much worth writing about since the book stopped as was in the book. A new chapter could be added daily. Waiting for the sequel.
 This book was well researched and thorough, but lacked a narrative. Reading about Trump’s narcissistic and demogogish behavior “in action” was enlightening but none of it really surprised me. It would’ve been better if Woodward would’ve drawn some conclusions and predicted potential outcomes if we let this clown serve out his term. Surely a journalist with his credentials, armed with all this research, has an opinion on that.
 More substantiation of a man unfit to be president. The greatest indictment is for his base who, regardless of how many times they are confronted with evidence of their poor choice, will fail to recognize it. The base will attempt to give him a second term, especially if democrats can’t get their sh... together.
 If I didn’t know better, I would think that this is a work of fiction. Sadly, it is not. The dangerous man whom we have in the White House is all too real, and America is paying, and will continue to pay a big price for such a collectively uninformed, moronic, naïve, and dangerous choice. Poor America. Poor world.
 This guy Trump will scare the heck out of you. This is a very good book and factual with sources dates and times. Trump denies it but facts don't lie....only Trump lies.
 I appreciate the clarity that this book gave regarding this administration.  That said, Dr. Hunter S. Thompson would have written Fear and Loathing in the White House and it would have been a far better read.  Damn you, Thompson, you needed to stay alive for this macabre surrealism of today's current affairs.
 A well written and factual account of what occurs in the White House, makes on frightened. Woodward is professional and evenhanded with his writing; a must read.
 Same atmosphere described as Fire and Fury and Unhinged. It's difficult to deny that disfunction appears to be a constant in this whitehouse.
 This was a outstanding book.........make a movie
 This book was written after the author spent time interviewing and just talking to White House staff, so it is informative. Since reading it there have been many of these people who have left their positions, but after reading this book that is not surprising. No matter how you feel about present politics, this is a must read.
 A wealth of interesting surprises that go beyond what has been mentioned in the media particularly some that are actually quite sympathetic and surprising to the subject.
 I appreciated the deep insight and coverage, but many of the chapters were plodding and repetitive.  Perhaps the intent was to show how many times Trump could hear the same thing from several trusted advisors and still refuse to follow their learned advice.  They may have felt the need to do that for Trump, but I didn’t need Woodward to do it for me, so I found myself skipping pages frequently.  That said, it was a good insight into the inner workings and disfunction in the WH and the multiple personality conflicts within the staff and outside advisors.
 This book provides an interesting look into the White House and President Trumps administration.  It also humanizes people that are usually only seen through the lens of various news agencies.  Very interesting
 ws. Thanks Mr. Woodward!! Lee investigating!!! Your insights to this president are right on and are filled with things the😊  moments they  need to know!!!!!
 This is an excellent book telling how President Trump is controlling the government,  doing whatever he wants without anyone saying anything publicly  and how the president took control of the Republican Party.  Any one who is interested in Donald Trump, this is the book to buy. Highly recommended.
 It’s worse than you think. Not the book, the state of the administration, and by extension, the country. Another great book by an accomplished political writer. And Scary!
 It’s time to take voting seriously. We need to have the people whose interests are the well-being of the people, not the party or their own beliefs. We’ve had enough since January 2017.
 Bob Woodward's book on the chaos that exists in the Trump White House is a reminder that this President has lied his whole life and treats foreign conflicts, trade, and people as if he is getting through another bankruptcy. History will remember this presidency as the WORST in American history. Move over, James Buchanan.
 It was very well written and very interesting.  Our president is uneducated and needs to be removed from office but saying that it offers insight into the Oval Office and what is really going on amid the chaos.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I already knew a lot of this stuff
 The book reveals that we are being led by an old narcissist.  There is however no attempt at insight.  Though it is careful to avoid error, it is ultimately a bit superficial.
 Everything I expected yet more
 If you are hoping for a news-paper like, well edited, well documented view of the political Trump reality, this is a very competent work. It is very down to earth and stays with the news as I remember it. It is not particularly fun to read, but fun sometimes causes in the reliability zone.
 Just read the book and enlighten oneself . The truth will set you free . It’s almost to late just like climate change ! The church is a real let down  ( evangelicals and. baptist ). A world in chaos .
 This is why we don't elect blowhards! ....he is a fantastic dumpster fire of a president.<br/>No proctologist needed to identify
 It is a horror book.<br/><br/>I found the accounts credible and plausible (as opposed to Fire and Fury, which was gossipy).<br/><br/>The last chapter is a gem. The last line of the book is a knife at the chest.
 While Bob Woodward is a respected journalist, the reader must consider the sources:  all right wing Trump lovers and Trump administration officials, current and former.  So while the book reveals some of Trump’s ineptitude, it does so from the perspective of people who generally agree with him.
 Typical Woodward.  Thorough, correct, and detailed.  Another Woodward classic, but I feel "Fear" is only Chapter One of a Gothic novel with a horrendous ending, but its not clear how tragic the ending will be.  If you worship at the feet of Donald Chump, I suggest you avoid this work.
 I like and respect Bob Woodward.  It is nonfiction and still very interesting. You might be surprised at some of the contents. Easy to read.
 Sad we have a POTUS who's a crazy racist without an ounce of intellectual curiosity... fun read if you like understanding the chaos occurring at the white house.
 I leaned nothing new and was really anticipating something profound.  But, in the book's defense, what really would be profound about Trump or this Administration in a book with a publishjng xyxle far behind Trump's Twitter screeds and noise? That he or it is a souless, dis-organizational disaster? Not new or revealing. That he is a living and breathing wrecking machine? Not new either.  Again, its a fine read but not eye opening.
 This book is not as gossipy as Wolf’s Fire &amp; Fury but the storyline is nearly the same which should tell at least 65% of us that the times they are very scary in America.  Hope we can all survive for 2 more years and hope the 65% turn out to vote in the Nov 2018 midterms because popular vote WILL count this time.
 Have to admit I found the style incredibly choppy.  I started out thinking it wasn’t a very big rip on Trump, but as it went on, it portrayed things as more and more chaotic  But was hard to keep track of all the players because so many came and went. A list would have helped
 Woodward writes so well and describes conversations in such detail that you feel like a "fly on the wall" listening in to meetings that closely relate to the daily news about the White House. The book is very believable except for one startling quotation in Chapter 3 (page 23). Steve Bannon admits (in quotations) that he fellated Reince Prebus on the 15th of August in order to keep the "establishment" with Trump. I can't imagine anyone admitting to such an act.  A colleague suggested that this might be a "literary device" - but even that I find questionable since Bannon gave the exact date the activity happened. How would Mike Pence or Vladimir Putin view such activity during a Presidential campaign?<br/>In the final chapters we get a better sense of the President's rationale for why he feels Mueller's investigation is unfair to him and we learn what an excellent advocate John Dowd is when he tries to give the President some sound advice. However, the book ends with a clear statement of what everyone already knows about this President.<br/>Great book. Way too much profanity, but I guess that's the way some of our leaders talk these days. Sounds more like a locker room than a White House.
 This author has a very, straight-forward writing style that is light on suggestive or descriptive language.  He does not make emotional appeals or offer opinions but instead  presents a picture of the current white house through an objective portrayal of events and conversations.
 Fantastic read and I trust everything he wrote to be the truth as I grew up through Watergate and know that this man writes the truth thanks Bob
 Nothing new or surprising here. By the time the book arrived much had been writing about it in the press; and much had been leaked; and the author had been interviewed. This is a story of the first year of the Trump Administration.....it will change no one mind.
 Great book that tells the truth
 I found it amazing that this "confidential" information could be shared.  All the personalities and their interaction, the competition between them, the reckless abuse of power by those who would literally remove important documents from the President's desk--remarkably never missed by him.  An eye opener from cover to cover.
 Offers insight into Trump’s inability to stick to a strategy, restrain his use of Tweets or develop some organization in the White House.  If this White House fails it will due to Trump’s inability to move beyond opinions developed 30 years ago.
 I would like to say it was shocking, but what can you expect from a President that has a "Mafia" air to him? President Trump revealed himself to the public early on and they still elected him. I believe the author was telling the truth. I have many friends in New York, and I understand the general opinion of Trump was "a mafia-type" guy.
 One had watched the reports on TV so by the time one came to read the book there were no earth-shattering surprises. The writing was honest as far as I could tell, but not elegant – journalism, not literature. No surprise there. On the whole, glad I read it. Slight feeling of anti-climax but can't blame the author for that.
 "Fear" is a must read for anyone who wants to gain insight into the Trump Administration. Every source is checked several times and nothing in it is "fake news." I was mesmerized by the revelations about this dysfunctional government and highly recommend this book.<br/>Richard Brumer-Author of The Chemist's Shop
 I thought a great leader should be wise, trained, prepared, honest and a good person, well, T is not any of all.<br/>The guy is not fit to be the US president and this is what the book is all about.<br/>America I pitty you.
 Didn’t think the book was too bad (and I’ve been a Trump supporter). It’s not like any of the “juicy” moments weren’t things we weren’t aware of already. Overall, it’s a decent read but I don’t think anyone who reads it will end up being satisfied if they were wanting a Trump downfall.
 I was expecting to read something I had not already read or heard from other media.  However, I read a great deal of source material on my own and have many contacts at every level of government, so perhaps I'm not a fair reviewer.  I gave it three stars for the the apparent amount of research that went into the book, but came away feeling like, hey, I already knew all of this.
 As always, Mr. Woodward has produced an exceptional piece of literature that is eye opening, credible, authentic and scary as he takes us thru the chaos of the Trump White House.  The behavior of Trump as explained in this book should be of major concern to all Americans.
 Much of this information has come to light by now both from this book and other sources. A lot has happened since it was written and for better or worse will continue to happen in the White House.  Still a great read on how it all began and a little chilling while reading knowing how some things have turned out.
 This book exposes the wide gulf between people who know how a White House *should* operate and Trump's White House. What's dismaying is that most of the people who work for Trump "go along to get along" or simply walk away, as so many of Trump's appointees have done.
 There is no way to explain the madness and wondering where America is heading. It is indeed a zoo with predators and without walls. What is going in the minds of Trump supporters? Hope this comes to an end before he aggravates further.
 If you like Trump, you won't like this book. If you don't, it will reinforce everything you already know, plus offer some new information which won't surprise you in the least.
 Truthful and believable tales of the horrors going on in OUR White House.  I trust and believe in Bob Woodward.  Excellently written.  Certainly an eye opener.  I knew it was bad...didn’t know it was this bad.  Some will call this fake news only because they don’t like what’s being said.
 This book provides details on a lot of the ongoing themes about the Trump administration on the news.  Highly doubt that this is "fake news" as this is written by a highly respected person. Sad to see the state of our government. Seems like we have become the joke of the world. Good read.
 Excellent read.  Very simply a terrifying story about the state of the presidency and the white house. Bob Woodward is a great writer.
 Well....and scary as well.  Nothing particularly new but confirmation by a respected journalist of many of the stories released in the news.
 This presidency needs the spotlight on it.  It needs to come under a magnifying glass.  Mr. Woodward keep up the hard work as I hope others do.  Eventually this debacle of a presidency shall pass but a large swarth of destruction will be left in its wake.  I fear only after his presidency ends, will we truly know the poisonous and toxic hole mess we allowed him to create.  Please keep writing.
 Haven’t finished reading it yet but I learned a lot from the book. It makes me even more terrified of the predicament that this country is currently in.
 I have read 10 books authored by Bob Woodward. This was not my favorite  partly because of Woodward's over exposure on his media blitz. He told us most everything in the book. The other factor that diminished the impact of the book for me was the subject. How many times can we stomach the despicable behavior of Donald Trump?  The repetition of his dishonesty and his inability to be a President ore me down. '
 Given Woodward's reputation for endless fact-checking, it is impossible to ignore his record of the disaster that is the current White House. There is no trust, apparently very little integrity, and the only thing that flows from the President is vituperation. Well worth reading.
 Woodward is one of the best journalists around. He does his research and works from recorded conversations. But as there are no references to these recordings, it lacks the validity that he could have included. I’m glad I have this, CD form so I can do other things while I listen.
 This book brought to the forefront how many of us independent thinkers know that our president believes the end justifies the means.  The style of the author is captured in a concise organized history of what could become a maniacal presidency in our country's history.  Readers must not be prejudiced to his historical facts.
 absolutely well written with integrity as all of his books!
 There is no denying that Bob Woodward gets people to talk, but, in this case, he has delivered a book of static. There’s no through line, nothing that impels the narrative. The book is a slog. 42 chapters that end with one of three conclusions.: The president is incapable of doing the job, the president is a liar, or both.
 I think i have read all of Woodward's books and been generally impressed positively. This one didn't really seem to go beyond the headlines or in any case nothing surprising. Trump lies, cheats, steals, etc. Seems like it was cranked out to make money.
 Resending this again, after no response from you.........When I ordered the Kindle version of Fear in early November, for some reason the audio version also showed up in an order confirmation.... the Kindle version also showed in a confirmation, but it has never been downloaded to my Kindle.<br/>There was no 'problem with this order' option on this page, so I'm hoping you'll see these comments and provide me a way to get Fear downloaded on my Kindle, or offer an explanation perhaps on how to download with USB. Thanks!
 Reading it right now. However, the construction of the binding and the terrible quality of the paper - not to mention the moldy smell - make it a book I’m doubting I’ll keep. As a former book designer for Scribner’s, I’m a bit embarrassed to have it one my shelf. It’s a shame for wonderful Bob Woodward to have his name associated with such tacky qualities. However, I love the writing; can’t put it down. (My doctor says he’d put it next to his Bible!)
 Although Amazon listed the number of pages to be 449, only 283 are devoted to the written story.  The rest of the book contains photos, acknowledgements and an index. At that rate, the cost of the book should have been $10.00 instead of $15.99
 I was eager to read this book.  I quit half way through.  Very poorly written and edited.  It seems like a series of articles, notes or interviews that the author had "on the shelf" and he put together so he could rush a book to print.  He certainly did a lot of promo for it, and likely made a lot of money........after very little effort.  The book is not worth the time or money.
 It's Bob Woodward. I can't imagine you'd be interested if you don't admire Woodward's work.<br/>It's a breezy read. Lots of accounts and stories of the first year you have had known from keeping up.<br/>To read in one volume you shake your head.
 Very interesting and a great ending.  It will (and should) make you very uncomfortable with how the White House is being run, and how our current leadership has no clue as to ethics, compassion, honesty, or any semblance of class.  After all, they appear to know only one swear word.
 It's hard to go wrong with this author and this subject.  I had expected to read this in one or two sittings, but for whatever reason it just didn't pull me along.  I finally did finish, learned a thing or two, and will pass it along to a friend.
 I thought I knew how dumb Trump was, but Woodward's book proved me wrong. In reading throughout the book, I was consistently amazed at how stupid he really is. He has no motivation to learn about foreign policy, how global trade works, &amp; how our economy works. What is really scary is how he feels he doesn't have to follow the "Rule of Law." And, this book just shows how off the rails &amp; mentally &amp; intellectually unfit he is to be the leader of the free world.
 Five stars because his excellent writing style, thorough treatment of subject matter, and courage to tell the truth.<br/>I recommend for anyone who desires an inside look at the working of the Trump administration.<br/>Dear is a most appropriate title.
 While I generally like Woodward, I found this book to be pretty boring after the first couple of incidents mostly already reported in the media ,I get it,he's crazy,impulsive ,egomaniacal,and a compulsive liar. Other than that a great guy!
 While the media has chronicled Trump's presidency on a day-to-day basis, this book compresses the first years, and it gives a good look at what people in his administration were thinking.  I hope there's another book on the next years of his term in office.
 Bob Woodward is my hero. I read All the President’s Men in high school and I was so impressed with his (and Bernstein’s) tenacity and integrity that I wanted to become a journalist for about three years straight. Anybody who doesn’t respect Mr. Woodward’s integrity is not an honest person and highly suspect.
 Woodward is a reliable and vigorous investigative journalist who does not resort to writing fiction. We humans - some of us - sure like playing the fear card in our leadership. I will be happy when this president is voted out of office. Fear is no way to lead our America.
 And I thought "All the Presidents Men" was good. This is real time or as close as you can get in a book which outlines the rise and lunacy of the twump white house.<br/>Everything is true, no fake news here...we did this to ourselves and we deserve every bit...<br/>Great book,
 "Fear" is a very well-written book by Bob Woodard, bringing to light more 'highlights' of a very controversial Presidency.
 Excellent book. Actual “Factual” written accounts about Donald Trump, whom lies every other time he opens is mouth. When any President is caught lying over 2,000+ times and can be proven, it is refreshing to get the actual truth about the man who is doing the lying. Great book!!
 The headline says it all.<br/> Excellent reporting as always with Bob Woodward.  No sensationalizing. Just reporting the facts.  Scary as hell.
 While reading this book someone asked me about this controversial book.  I replied it was not controversial because facts are not controversial they are facts.  This book is so well documented that it even lends weight to other books written about this administration by authors that do not have the gravitas of Woodward.
 I've been an admirer of Woodward's investigative skill and his ability to craft an interesting narrative.  Here, he provides us with a chilling look inside the chaos that is the Trump administration.  Regardless of your opinion of Trump, Woodward's book serves as a cautionary tale of what goes on inside a divided government.
 Detailed insight Into the narcissistic personality of Trump and his disfunctual White House.<br/>The book came to a very sudden ending. I would have liked a prologue from Woodward. I guess we will have to wait for that till the end of Trump's first term!
 An absolutely terrifying look at the Trump Whitehouse. If you ever wanted to know how a Narcissistic Racist Misogynistic personality 'functions' this is a nauseatingly realistic look.<br/>I know,  too many adverbs, not enough _______ (fill in the blanks).
 Woodward gets to the point in a very unbiased way. Everyone, whether you're a republican or democrat, shouod read this book!
 I could have written this. It is nothing more than a bunch of notes and he said she said. I will not be wasting any more money on mr Woodward.
 Some of the issues covered in this book are pretty scary and alarming.  I figured that would be the case.  What I was not prepared for is that it is so poorly written and muddled that I lost interest in the second chapter.  I expected much more from Woodward.
 Woodward provides many episodes from the first year of Trump's presidency, but failed to go into depth on any of them. He treats the Donald as a distant figure, sort of like the Wizard of Oz, rather than bringing any light on why he is who he is. On the other hand, I can't wait to read "Fear, the 2018 version" whenever it comes out.
 Bob Woodward is the most professionally done and the best out of all the Trump tell-alls! Woodward depresses at the same time as he impresses, with the reality of what's really happening in DC. His style is the norm for journalists of his caliber but sadly, so few writers of today have the same distinction. This book is the best!
 This book will be quoted and studied by historians and citizens for decades.  Whether you believe the information or not, the research and meticulous detail is impressive.  Hard to read.  Take breaks often to think and cool down.  I’m so glad I read it.  I’m so glad I’m done.
 I was pleasantly surprised at Woodward's even-handed presentation of all the players in this Trumpian saga.  They tell their own stories.
 This book tells the truth and should wake one up.  If you are one who is in denial this may shake you into a certain reality.  There is no leadership here.  Only lies and mayhem.  A leader should bring peace and guidance.  Not confusion and insecurity.
 Bob Woodward is legionary!  Have always enjoyed his writings.  In this book, there was a lot of detail on war and the backside of conflict.  My expectation was for more info on how Trump arrived at some of his decisions.  Evidently, there is no telling!  Or reason!
 Those looking for a scathing indictment of Trump and his presidency are bound to be disappointed in this book, which is not to say that the irrational, impulsive, paranoid, narcissistic, fantastical, uninformed, and temperamental Trump does not appear on most every page. The book is choppy and diary-like in that it jumps from situation to situation, which is seen in that the 42 chapters are untitled - lacks good flow. It essentially ends in early 2018. Perhaps surprisingly, there is relatively little on Russian collusion and obstruction of justice.<br/><br/>There is a lot frustration among the principals in the book because some are traditional Republicans and others want to blow things up, while Trump constantly waffles on everything. It is clear that policies and decision-making are erratic and often almost spur-of-the-moment. It is perhaps mildly interesting to see the infighting among all the various secretaries in such areas as troop deployments, trade agreements, tariffs, etc. Trump evidences little concern for chaotic meetings. The entire tone of the book is rather understated given the obvious dysfunction of Trump and his cabinet.<br/><br/>The book is not ground breaking. It merely confirms and repeats what is well known: Trump is intellectually and emotionally the least qualified president we’ve had in decades. And, most importantly, he could bring real harm to the US if not constrained.
 Excellent read.  Scary read. About chapter 3 I had my buyout bag ready and the family in the truck.....this can't be real.  It's not possible that the electorate has put an idiot in the oval office....yet there he sits.....  read this book, then read it again..
 I didn't really like this one as much as I thought I was going to. I appreciate the incredible reporting and it's definitely worth reading. After all the hype and TV interviews, I didn't feel like I learned anything I didn't already know.
 Excellent book by Bob Woodward.  I knew things were bad in the current White House, but this book brings it all to the forefront.  If, after reading this book, you don't get out and vote, you are part of the problem.  Right now we need every voter to go to the polls and make your voice heard.
 A typical Woodward book - tells the story well, based upon numerous interviews and extensive research. As someone who believes Trump to be mentally ill, evil, and incompetent, I was actually surprised by Woodward's portrayal, that Trump is not quite as bad as I had thought.
 Not more than I can say.  Scary but needed to be said for country.  Read it and vote in November
 Factually accurate and backed by credible sources. Very little new information that is not available in the general media. A topical current events media, that will not stand the test of time as to it's being a beacon for the enlightened.
 This book only confirmed my fears with Trump ever since he came down the escalator to announce his candidacy. He hasn’t shown me anything different. He’s only getting worse. Trump is wholly unfit to lead. I don’t doubt Mr. Woodward’s book at all.
 I started to read this book fully expecting to read that Trump was incompetent and unfit to govern. I was surprised when I found out something else, that Trump was surrounded by people, mostly globalist, who tried, sometimes succeeded, to thwart his efforts to dismantle world order which globalist world elite build in the last few decades.
 Very informative. Very well researched by a famous investigative well known reporter. One of 2 reporters to bring the Watergate scandal to the head.  Well known author.<br/><br/>If you want to see an insider's view of the present White House, this is a must read.
 Loved the detail and conversations and what narrator was thinking<br/>Also what a bozo Drumph is and was<br/>He was helped and was in right place at right time<br/>This realization will never dawn on him<br/>Has no self reflection
 This is a must read for everyone regardless of your political view. Top notch detailed journalistic style and documentation - the footnotes are as fascinating as the actual book. There is a softness to the style that, given the subject matter, I didn't expect.
 Bob Woodward gives us a clear and calm account. Amazing that he can do that! Maybe the book is a but too calm and clear.
 Well written. Good read
 What should read as a satisfying confirmation of the ineptitude of the current administration works more as the most spine-tingling horror story I have read in a long time, because I know that it is all-too real and I dread its horrible and demoralizing ending.
 NOBODY is running the country. Trump is clearly mentally ill and governing has become roller derby. VOTE, people... our survival as a free republic depends on it.
 Become a fly on the wall in the white house and you will see the pandemonium for yourself. Pray for America.
 Informative like none of the other trumpeter books I have read ,takes me more inside the narcissistic circus that seems to treat money above all else
 Really great so far
 To people who have been paying attention this book is of no surprise, it just confirms what many of us knew already. This book is actually more for the Trump supporter/voter &amp; the FOX NEWS watcher who really doesn't get all the Trump news<br/><br/>It paints a picture of a man that has the emotional stability of a teenage drama queen, with a 7th grade understanding of U.S policy.  It corroborate's the recent New York Times oped.  Which described high level officials within this administration that are continually having to stall, divert attention, and actually having to remove documents from Trump's desk so we don't end up in a catastrophic situation, either militarily or economically.  Obviously, this is also the reason this administration has a turn over rate that beats Der Weinersntichel.<br/><br/>As a former Republican myself, what is most disturbing to me is that Republican members of the house &amp; Senate know all of  this.  They live it everyday, and do not have the backbone to remove him from office under the 25th amendment for being wholly unfit to hold this office. The POTUS is the National Security risk, and they sit by and do nothing, except to obstruct, formulate conspiracy theories to his defense.There is no honor in being a Republican today.  This is no longer the party of Lincoln or Reagan.  It is now the party of Trump.  Stuffed full of bigotry, anger, fear, misogyny &amp; ignorance.<br/><br/>This book coming from Bob Woodard, the Washington Post writer that brought attention to Watergate, at a time when Nixon had an approval rating of 60% and no one believed him. I am certain he is right on track here. Again, this book is great for the Trump supporter, because it goes into Trump's campaign promises, and you learn very quickly which of his promises can be done and which ones can't.  So you get a very good education of U.S. policy by reading this book, while learning civics at the same time.
 We all need to wake up and learn here about the deep trouble this country is in with Trump at the helm.
 Living in current American times, about the most painful is what is going on in our government. This book provides important information that should make us all aware of how vital our vote is, our knowledge of government is.
 What the title says. Very well sourced book from one of the best. Wish there was more, and I was surprised to start reading about staff members 67% of the way through. Thought there'd be more. Definitely recommend to even the staunchest of Trump supporters.
 Mr. Woodward gives credit where it is due and criticism where it is earned. Disconcerting read from a writer with great credibility.
 I've seen all of the Trump books out there but never bought. As soon as I heard Woodward wrote one I jumped on pre order.<br/>There is no journalist I'd trust more with this topic. He's the premiere writer on administrations and what goes on.
 I bought the book last fall and just recently started to read it. To my surprise page 6 is followed by page 17 with header Abraham and the header on page 18 is Leadership in Turbulent Times. The next 30 pages through page 48 are part of the book "Leadership in Turbulent Times" with headers of Abraham, Theodore, Franklin. Then page 39 is next with header Fear.<br/>So about 5 chapters of Fear are missing, replaced by pages from Leadership in Turbulent Times. Total screw up. Very disappointing.<br/>I will return the book if you wish.
 What else can you say about Bob Woodward's ability to dissect the inner workings of US presidential administrations?  He's only been doing this since Nixon.<br/><br/>So much of what you've heard...much of what you've feared...<br/>yeah - it's all here.<br/>If you're looking for a perspective of this administration that extends beyond the headlines, this is a 'must read'.
 I'd recommend this book to anyone and everyone.  Amazingly documented.  Although complicated, easy to read.  Shouldn't be missed by the pro Trump people!
 Bought this book because of the commercials of how great it is.  Well, its not.  Easy read however, but Trump sucks and this book kind of does not put him down that much.  I didn't even bother to read the last 125 pages.  Don't bother with it.
 Brings together all the barrage of news items relative to the Trump campaign and White House in an understandable and organized format.  Believable, perhaps because of its occasional recognition of positive moves by the Trump administration.
 I haven't finished reading Fear yet, but I am learning a lot about how many areas of our government's bureaucracy work and just how much Trump doesn't understand as well as who he listens to and why. It explains a lot about what is happening in the Trump White House.
 Written by Washington Post's Bob Woodward, this book offers a view into Trump's White House. I will spare retelling everything already covered by the media. Woodward backs up his written with almost 40% of the book being dedicated to his sources.
 Barron might as well be running our country... our country is in grave jeopardy with Trump! We’ve got to pull together not as  republicans and/or democrats we must be united as Americans. All of us will be seriously affected financially, trade, economically, world relationships and the threat of war to our scared America!
 Scary book.  I knew that Bob Woodward would write an accurate account of what is going on with Trump.  I pray for our country every day!!!!  Book arrived on time and in new condition.  Shared it with two friends so far.
 This book thoroughly explains why every American citizen should **FEAR** the Trump Presidency.
 For all who have been following the Trump years, a lot will not be new.  But it is good to have it all in one<br/>location.  A very troubling history of Trump's first 24 months.  Makes one think of moving to Canada or Scotland..or....
 Trumpers will hate it, Moderate Republicans and Independents will shrug, Democrats will laugh hysterically.  Bob Woodward has written about many presidents, the good things and the bad.  No difference here except that he finds little good.
 Our country is not in the hands of this idiot. Thank goodness. But I feel deep sympathy for all of his babysitters....past..present ....and future.
 Shows what a POS we have in the White House, hope he resigns soon!
 Awesome book from Pulitzer Prize winning Bob Woodward. All the hype is well worth this meticulously well-written book.
 Bob Woodward is a treasure.  It reads like a movie script. Everyone regardless of political ideology should read it.
 I picked up this book a while ago.  Just finished it today.  I read the news pretty regularly, and there wasn't much that stood out in the book.  It was a good deep dive into what the Trump White House looks like and operates, and how embarrassing it should be for all Americans.
 This book really does shine a light on the total dysfunction of this Presidents White House!  Despite rumors to the contrary, there really are no adults in the room!  Read for yourself, and find out for yourself what a zoo it really is.
 Although there were no big surprises, the book was full of well researched anecdotes about the Trump White House and how it's working, or as seems to be the case, not working.  It was a good read, and I enjoyed every minute of it.
 The book is interesting but doesn’t draw many conclusions or really have an ending. The subject hasn’t ended so it’s more like a news summary up to the end... much has happened since and continues so it would be a Part 1......
 Far better and more informative than I had imagined!!!  And from an author I trust implicitly!!!
 After reading this, I better understand Trump's leadership style and personality.  It also gave me a view of how the presidency works from a procedural perspective.  The writing appears to be totally without bias and presented factually with great detail.
 What can be said? Get It!!Bob Woodward is still the best reporter/chronicler. READ IT!
 I found it informative and well written, as Mr Woodward always does extensive research and interviews. It was not as dry as I thought it might have been. It was an easy read that read well.<br/>I recommend it for those who want pure information without a political slant.
 see above -I find it very annoying that I have to review every book I read before I can close it - I gave the book 5 stars as it was very interesting and informative - Mr Woodward is a great writer and I have enjoyed many of his other books
 I read the entire book - carefully. I realize that the information was provided "under deep cover" but it appears to me that Porter, Cohn, Dowd and even Priebus conveniently come across as the "good" guys. I also noticed that women are hardly mentioned or involved in any of the policy discussions. In fact, women are barely mentioned at all. Also, the way the last few chapters were written, I was getting a negative impression of Mueller, which seems too convenient given the timing of the book and the anticipation of Mueller's report.<br/>The last sentence of the book where Dowd says to himself that Trump is a liar seems abrupt and appears added as an afterthought. The preceding chapter seemed to present evidence that Trump wasn't so much a liar but rather as someone who couldn't remember the truth, so he made statements he wanted to be true.<br/>I'm not a Trump supporter. I voted for Hillary and have wanted Trump to be impeached ever since he brought the Russians into the oval office and laughed with them after he fired Comey - but this book didn't convince me of the need to impeach.<br/>My feeling is that Woodward wanted to write a fair and even-handed book. The result is a book that has same the problem I had with the press coverage during the 2016 campaign - Trump's outrageous behavior and lies are normalized. The last comment was thrown in to try and negate appearing this perception. Excuse me for saying this, but I feel the book is an altered version of the O.J. defense: "If the gloves don't fit - acquit."
 Journalistic anthology. Interesting collection of what present and past presidential aids reflection of their CEO’s behavior and attitude. Worth reading for background information of the intricacies of the Administrative organizational workings.
 I no longer see him as a malicious, bad actor, but rather a sad and lonely old  man. If he weren't so stubbornly driving the country into the ground, I'd pity him.
 This book supports a lot of what Wolff wrote in "Fire and Fury".  I highly recommend this book.  One gets a real sense of just how entitled and yet, incompetent Trump is. He is a really great flim fam man. Anything that goes right has nothing to do with Trump. Someone is cleaning up after him.
 You can't make this stuff up. It's just insane that a country is being run by this moron.
 Other than following some degree of chronological order, there didn't seem to be any real direction or purpose to the book, and then it just ended when I thought I had about a third of it left.  The rest were just notes and references.
 A book full of vignettes about various meetings and the ongoing trash of the Trump administration. There was nothing in-depth about this book, and much to my surprise, I didn't think it was well written.
 Sadly, we are seeing that this is just the tip of the iceberg. A walking lie machine that borders on the pathological. There simply is no defending this abusive clown show. The movie will be spectacular.
 I am only 2/3rds through the book. Had to stop &amp; listen to the news because so much was unfolding supporting Bob Woodford’s information. Must finish before Robert Mueller’s findings give even more credence to Woodford’s account.
 Interesting read about criminals and a New York slumlord.
 I thought it was a well written book. I have one question-why is this sick man still in office?
 Woodward's fly on the wall perspective revealed exactly what I FEARED... a mad house filled with anger, greed, and a complete lack of intelligence. Book was difficult to read. Wish it didn't confirm what I see on the news every day.
 I think it's a great book and very relevant for today's times but it delves into things that it takes a person who has followed politics for a while to get a handle on all of the different players. In that sense, it can be hard to follow.
 As many have commented, reading the many books on Trump's history are gripping but you won't sleep at night. Reading of Trump in office and world affairs will lose sleep,  and will terrify you.<br/><br/>'This book while fascinating  in detail is better pursued in the news media and online, and then getting some sleep. I returned it.
 Woodward was thorough. Having read this I don't understand why Trump is so upset. Woodward was fair and provides no evidence of criminal activity. If Trump's only beef is not everyone likes him, now he knows how Obama felt. Congratulations to Bob Woodward for showing the same high standards he always has. Recommend  read.
 Woodward is precise and thorough in his depiction of the Trump Whitehouse; that is what is so frightening- this is real and happening now.  Will we be plunged into another world war or gradually continue our decline as a world power?
 This is a very scary book for me. I always have admired Bob Woodward. He is a great journalist. Trump seems to be very set in his ideals of what is right and wrong. He seems to have trouble listening to his own advisors.
 This book is written well and in a fashion that makes it easy to read.  Only criticism is that not all the material is sourced and some of what is has been disputed.  So, you can't be sure what's true and what's not.
 See SCIF on page 207. Just one of many examples where Trump disregards security protocols. If there had been a crisis at the G20 initiated by a foreign power, or a terrorist, the nation's secure communications could have been compromised.
 4-star rating because the time line is sloppy, goes ahead with a thought action sequence then you realize you are back in time on new thought action...  But the shame of it all is that EVERYONE is hiding from the incompetence of the President.  THAT is the bloody shame!
 Easy read, not much different from paying attention to CNN /MSNBC. It isn't anything that hasn't been discussed. The story continues, and the protagonist never ceases to be himself. Not amazing, just very sad period in the history of our great country.
 Excelente libro, lástima qué lo terminó para mi gusto, antes de tiempo. ¡Es una pena! Hay tanto más qué reportar. El mundo está en crisis y con ese presidente (en minúscula) Trump, estamos en serios problemas mundiales.<br/>Tenemos qué leerlo
 While we know almost all the Trump traits outlined in the book Woodward is a master story teller again! Thanks bob
 I'm not too crazy about the writing in this most recent Woodward book.  Mr. Woodward has a great reputation that was built over decades, but this book left me feeling like I didn't learn anything new.
 What can you say about telling the truth? This "man" is a rich idiot, that got his money the old fashion way, he inherited it. Everything HE touched imploded, he is a genius in his own deranged mind.
 An enjoyable read. The author has given an unprecedented look into the chaos inside the Trump White House. It was an eye opening experience.<br/>I felt like it could have been longer/more detailed - the book missed out on a few events (Cohen and Stormy, etc) which I believe are important. The flow is inconsistent at times.<br/>Nonetheless, a good read.
 I've been a Democrat my entire life.  When we were young my wife and I lived in Washington D.C. during the Watergate era.  We actually went to watch Judge John Sirica preside over the criminal trial of Nixon's main men, Ehrlichman, Haldeman and Mitchell.  We think very highly of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, liked their book "The Final Days" very much and wish that it was made into a movie as a sequel to "All the President's Men".  I find that everyone I talk to who has teenaged kids has used the movie version of All the President's Men as an introduction to what is going on in Washington today.<br/><br/>As a result I made 2 separate copies of "Fear" one for myself and one for my adult son.  I am an Amazon Prime member so my son's copy of Fear was promptly delivered to him on 9/11/18 in the "very Blue" State of Nevada.  My son is enjoying reading the book.  My copy of "Fear" was supposed to arrive on 9/13/18.  It didn't.  Late in the evening on 9/13/18 to look at the Orders page to see where my book was in transit.  Well surprise, surprise Amazon did not bother to ship my copy of "Fear" to me in Texas, even though it was ordered on the very same day as my son't copy of the book.  Amazon now says they will ship my copy of the book to me so that I receive it on 9/22/18 even though I am an Amazon Prime customer and was promised by what Amazon wrote on its web pages that my copy of the book would be shipped to me so I would receive it 2 days after "Fear" was formally released, i.e. 9/13/18.  I find it amazing that Amazon chose not to ship "Fear" to customers in Texas who had pre-ordered the book.  Could it be that Amazon's owner and management don't want people who they presume to be Red State Republicans to read the book?  What's up with that?  Discriminating against Amazon customers based on "perceived political preference. "  That's profoundly stupid on Amazon's part.  It's people who live in Red States who liberals/Democrats should want to read this book.  My son tells me that the book is, in essence, a very long newspaper article telling readers what is going on with Russiagate and why.<br/> Sadly by the time people in Texas receive "Fear" by Bob Woodward from Amazon the facts on the ground probably will have changed.  Receiving "Fear" on or after 9/22/18 may be like reading last month's newspapers.
 I saw Bob Woodward do many interviews for this book so much of the book did not reveal anything new to me.  But, I love Woodward and if you didn't catch his interviews you may rate this higher.
 I have great admiration for relevant writing. Truth in journalism is not easily available these days but when a book stays true to its character, it takes  its proper place in history! This is such a book.
 I liked the behind this scenes stories,but was dissapointed in the lack of insights into how the Trump Presidency may end. The ending was abrupt and left me wanting a summation and prediction of the future of the Trump Presidency.
 As usual, Bob Woodward has done very thorough research. The book is readably written. It just confirms what an absolute mess we have in the White House and what a tremendous lack of dignity and expertise exists there.
 Love his writing style- no criticism or opinions- letting his facts and voices of the participants speak for themselves!
 I’m a fan of Woodward so I was surprised I liked this book. I say liked but reading it was often tough. Getting an inside look at the chaos of the Trump Administration was often unnerving and made the book tough to read at times.
 Based on the hype, I was expecting to learn a lot about the inner workings of the Trump white house.  I was very much disappointed by the often shifting stories and very little new information that is not real hearsay.
 Only Woodward could tell this story so effectively and so clearly. We do have a president whose job is over his head and when you read this book, you will understand why. The book is fabulous.
 Well what can I say. I had expected that Mr. Woodward would do an in-depth job of reporting which is evident after reading.  Frightening to think that the White House is operating in such a disorganized and rather uninformed fashion.
 This book decluttered all the bits and pieces I’ve learned from the news. It takes you behind closed doors to get to know who’s who and what’s what. It explains in detail all the things that I could not understand by just watching the news.
 Woodward's on target. Too bad the administration is anything but.
 We are passengers on a big plane. The pilot is a brain dead doofus nourished by paranoia and Diet Coke. A wing has snapped off and the plane is in a free fall. Unwilling to look at the altimeter, the pilot sees the speed increasing and proudly proclaims, "I'm the bestest make-plane-go-fastest guy in the world."
 Interesting that the first review I wrote about El Claudio del Mar-A-Lago was rejected. I have read three books about this man and none, not even the meticulous writing of Bob Woodward make me feel safe about this guy. The only way we're going to get out of this mess is to vote him out.
 Engaging from the very first page. I couldn’t stop reading. Truly frightening! How much longer can this craziness continue.  I wouldn’t be able to tolerate the idiocy?
 I do not like Trump, have never liked Trump and will Never, Ever like Trump.  But sadly, he is our President and as an American I support this country.  I found the treatise very twisted, knowing that this man is our leader.  And the saga continues.
 Received this book today, excited to crack it open. Need to caution those who support the man over the presidency about what's in the book. Uncork your bottle of wine and bring your tissues.
 I have started a collecting of all the books that portray Trump in a negative light.  It's a real conversation starter for anyone that comes over to my house, and everyone that hates the president of the Republicans.
 Woodward is simply a great writer and meticulous researcher. Every detail, every account rings true. The Emperor has no clothes type expose and this book bares Trumps personality and sanity as our President. God save us all
 Everyone should have a copy of this in their home. It really opens your eyes to things that are going on behind closed doors. Remember  win following the masses. Sometimes the M is silent.
 This is the best tell all regarding the current dysfunctional and dangerous political regime from an author you can trust implicitly!  I only wish this was a book of fiction instead of non-fiction.
 Most of these vignettes are known already. Many pages were devoted to individual photos of the "cast of characters." I was a bit disappointed. It is a good book for readers who are not news "junkies."
 If this were fiction, it would be a great read. The fact that most of this likely true has me up at night - far more unnerving than any horror story. So alarming what has happened to the presidency...
 A very good read with lots of insight into what makes our narcissistic POTUS tick. At times I felt Woodward was in the same room where all this took place. One can guess who many of the sources were and it's a great achievement that many of them revealed the facts. This is an excellent portrait of a man who tends to govern by fear and threats. Be afraid! Thanks to Bob Woodward and to many other journalists who fight keep us all informed. You do us all a service by keeping our government in check. Don't ever give in or give up.
 I found this book extremely interesting, and though Trump insists that the book is fiction, I am quite confident he hasn’t actually read the book. Though much of theis  story an unflattering portrayal of Trump, it’s not all unflattering. I learned quite a bit about his character without the interferrance of network news rhetoric, as well as the more intimate relationships and interactions with his staff. I now feel more equiped with a base of knowledge of what is going on currently in our country as well as the mindset of Trump.
 I haven’t completed reading this book yet, but I like it a lot! It’s an insight into how odd trump is and how crazy and disfuncional his presidency and government really is. How he has lasted this long is anybody’s guess!
 Interesting stuff, but I expected better sourcing from Bob Woodward. The story line jumps around erratically and the editing is poor. Was it pushed out in haste to profit from a trend?
 I don't read many political books. This is the second that I have read on Trump. I don't think I much respect people who choose to work for him. Despite this, I acknowledge their efforts to restrain him from his worst impulses. I suppose that is a form of respect.
 FEAR is right. Terrifying may be more accurate. Whats going on in our country is a crime (literally) and this book explains why. Excellent writing, in depth reasoning and well founded facts. No fake news here.
 Well researched, therefore scary. How will Woodward report Trump's meltdown?
 Unfortunately the book suffered in the final stretch by being largely comprised of Trump’s defense attorney’s one-sided account of his clients (flawed) innocence. Is Dowd’s account of Mueller’s case accurate? Are the conclusions Dowd draws sound? Or is it, at best, the attorney’s best attempt to portray his client, the President, in the best possible light given Mueller’s silence.
 An excellent book. It should be required reading for the nation. Especially registered voters. How could a country vote for a bully and a liar?
 Some people may find  parts of this work to read like  a textbook.  NO TO WORRY -- completing it is well worth your time.  I have learned more from this book than any other political writings I have read.
 Powerful factual information! A must read. This country is being destroyed!
 book is so well-written and researched and true.  It scared me so much more than I already am that I can only read<br/><br/>small portions at a time without getting sick.  You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free.  Thank you fearless writers.
 Reputable reporter/author Woodward tells the story of inside the White House.  The only solice is that the small group of cabinet members and staffers seem to be "running the joint."  Well documented!
 "Fear" disappointed a bit in not bringing much 'new' to the table, but it was a good recap of the first couple years of Trump's presidency. Pretty even-handed, and fairly well written.
 Much of importance has happened in the Trump presidency after the events reported in this book. So, while it is a good review up to the departure of John Dowd, it leaves one hanging.<br/><br/>Woodward is no doubt working on “the rest of the story”—which hopefully won’t require too many more chapters.
 Arrived on time and in good shape. Good book, judging by its cover. Lol. I'm not sure if this was a First Edition or not. Seriously, it is well written, easily read, and scary as hell. Time to move on; the 2016 experiment didn't work.
 The book itself is good. I'd give it 5 stars but the book I received had pages 39-52 that were about a half inch longer than the rest of the pages.. I read a lot and I've never seen that in a book.
 Amazingly well researched and written. Absolutely depressing to learn what the lack of an education can do to a democracy. If the founding fathers had any notion of a Trump presidency it likely they would have enumerated a fundamental right to education. No really, the emperor is naked!
 Honestly I already know most of this but I want to support Bob.
 I read three pages, then trashed the book because it brought out details about that narcisstic egomaniac that I had suspected but is now documented.  I chose to not read those details.
 I thought it was a noble effort. I think the main point is the administration rules by sowing fear and distraction, so those who will be hurt most don't see what's happening behind the scens.
 Woodward's writing is matched only by the work he puts into gathering the information. Read this. Then make sure you vote on November 6th.
 Our country is in trouble. Factual and frightening. Bob Woodward has related the inner workings of a White House being led by a man who is incapable of telling the truth and who changes his mind on a whim.
 A very gripping read (it's very scary at some parts and makes you worry about our Country) ...but it's not anything new that's not been splashed on the front page of the Washington Post.
 Most of what I read here l already knew. My reading rate was slowed by my frequently stopping to compare the information in the book to what I already read or heard on the news.
 Tick tock is right. The truth will never be denied. The GOP is dead as an American Politic entity.<br/><br/>Change my mind.
 After all the hype I found Woodward's writing rather colorless, predictable, and undocumented. Perhaps he should have waited until Trump is out of office, and his sources could have supported his remarks.
 While it was somewhat informative, I found it difficult to follow the voicing as sometimes it's not clear whose thoughts are being elaborated.  Good background coverage though.
 Gave only four stars because of the Cover, I had to remove it as soon as I got as I would not want any photos of this  so called president in my peaceful residence.  Bob should have used the picture of the White House instead.
 I took an entire week to read this book because I needed to digest it chapter by chapter.  I also needed down time to get over my seething anger at the trumpery and "its" regime.
 This book is well written and holds your interest unlike other recent editions about our President.  It is thought provoking and frightening, all at the same time.  The author lives up to his reputation.
 Woodward depicted Trump just as I expected--nasty, insulting, devious, cunning and over the top egotistical. He writes well, and gives the reader what counts. I was happy to get this book.
 This book explained why Trump is so dangerous to the American people. With subtle and not so subtle insights, Woodward lays out a greater understanding of who Trump is and why we should fear him.
 And ended with reading the entire book in 3-4 sittings. It is an absolute page-turner, and I’ve found myself recommending it to all of friends. It is Woodward at his absolute best.
 Decades after the Nixon Watergate scandal Bob Woodward is still a 5 star investigative reporter.  This book takes you behind the scenes with incidents that are retold having multiple sources.  I have no doubt that Mr. Woodward did he homework and has legitimate background on everything he wrote. A scary, fascinating read.
 Another well written book. An honest view, full of details and facts of things we all should fear when someone so incompetent gets into office. Our Government is for the people and for the future.
 Well documented book with very vivid scenarios and events.  It is frightening to read the incompetence of the president and the people around him.  Mr. Woodard is right, America better wake up!
 I appreciate Woodward’s journalistic style.  I learned a lot about Donald Trump, some that conformed to my admittedly preconceived notions, and others that opened my eyes to the other side of Trump.  It’s an important book, in my assessment.
 Good account of the first months of the Trump administration but I must say there is really not much to add to the record. If you regularly follow the news, this book reads like a summary
 The first half of the book i found very intetesting, refreshing memory of events and how things unfolded in the Trump camp. However, the second half of the book seemed to be just need clips run together. Lots of repeat news such as the trade war and Trumps lack of knowledge. It was boring to me. But in all i am glad I read it as I like Bob Woodward and want him to do well.
 There was too much political stuff in the book for me to fully understand.  But it confirmed my belief that if you don't agree with Trump, you're fired!  Also confirmed my belief that he lies and he's not too bright.
 The people who should read this book are either too dumb get the significance or too stubborn to take their heads out of the sand.  As for the rest of us, there’s nothing really surprising.
 Horrifying and quite believable. Mr. Woodward makes a strong case that Mr. Trump is unqualified for his position. The sections on tariffs alone are enough to take a reader aback.
 Obviously, Trump fans aren’t going to read this. Be forewarned; it’s scarier then we guessed. An easy read, Woodward doesn’t fail. He lays out the facts with plenty of corroboration. Well done and a must-read.
 Woodward pulls no punches but well written.  It becomes apparent who his major sources were (Cohn, Dowd for example) but that aside, his book fits in well with what is going on today.  Well worth the read
 A scattered read that takes the reader from nowhere to nowhere.  There's little in here that's eye opening - Trump is exactly as you expect.  I expected much more from this wonderful writer.
 I enjoyed reading this book, but do not know how much of it is factual. I didn’t learn much new. Seems like a regurgitation of what I hear in the media. I would very much like to know his source material.
 This is a must read if you are following the Trump Administration. Concise, believable first hand account of current life in the White House. Whether you like Omarosa (I personally don't) or not, her book is definitely worth reading.
 This  Book is as good as I expected. Bob Woodward did a superb job at portraying an inept and potentially dangerous president and the struggle of its administration to contain it. Bravo!
 This book shows a unfit individual who's ill prepared to serve in the highest and most important position in the world. The administration thats been assemble does not have the best interest of the nation in mind which I believe there were chosen to support the failed policies of Trump, to undermine President Obama presidency, and to further their careers.
 Well written, insightful and a great read!!!!!  Everyone should read it!
 I'm halfway through this book and it makes me angry that Americans are so blind to have voted DJT into the highest office in our country. Bob Woodward can be trusted to tell truth. I encourage people to read this book. This folks is your president.
 Readable.  Tells you what you already know but in a little more detail.  If you dislike Trump you'll enjoy it and shake your head.  If you like Trump you won't want to read it.
 Revealing, blunt, and entertaining the whole way through!
 the sad truth of the lying self serving worst president in our history
 Woodward once more proves himself to be a through investigative reporter, although he’s an awkward writer. The story he tells here rings true and confirms the alarm I feel that the evil and treasonous Donald Trump is President. I pray everyday that God would give Trump wisdom, but he clearly rejects all wisdom, opting always for narcissism, nihilism, and lies. I also regularly pray that God will bring about the peaceful removal of the Trump Administration. ‘Fear’ confirms me in doing so.
 Everyone should know know the contents of this book. Not that you don't already but it is brought into fine focus for all to see. Easy read with the lights on it's scary out there
 dislike not what I expected.
 Woodward has written another great book.  His research and ability to get people to confide in him make him exceptionally reliable.  He is right that we should be very afraid about what is going on in the Trump administration.
 As usual, Bob Woodward has thoroughly research this president. I don't think any president likes everything Woodward puts in his book; but sometimes we all make mistakes, and presidents are human like the rest of us.
 informative and very interesting. One learns many unique background facts about how things work in different aspects of  the world. This is informative about how elections should and/or shouldn't be run.
 I found the book “Fear” to actually make me like Donald Trump more, not less, when I understood how he works. A few key insights:<br/><br/>1. He’s friendly toward DACA. He actually has a lot of sympathy for Dreamers and wants to find a way to let them stay. But he feels pressure from his advisors and supporters to be a hard-liner on immigration and so he uses DACA as a bargaining chip to get his wall funding.<br/><br/>2. He wants to get out of more military conficts. Although Trump says he wants to spend more on the military, he actually doesn’t like the fact that U.S. troops are so involved in wars around the world. He doesn’t understand why we’re in Afghanistan at all and wants a plan to end it. He doesn’t think we need 28,500 US soldiers in South Korea and wants to bring them home. He’s anti-war.<br/><br/>3. Jared and Invanka are Democrats. The internet loves to hate on Jared and Ivanka. But they actually are encouraging Trump to be more open-minded to the Democratic agenda. Ivanka encouraged Trump to stay in the Paris Climate agreement. And during talks on immigration reform, Jared argued they should be looking for solutions that gave something to the Democrats and the Republicans.<br/><br/>4. Trump’s economic and trade policies are based on his gut, which is at odds with what his advisors tell him. Trump has some strong ideas about how things should be. His advisors try to educate him when he’s wrong, but he just shoots them down. Gary Cohn, his economic advisor, asked him “Why do you believe these things?”. Trump responded that he doesn’t know, but he’s believed these things for 30 years. Some of those things are:<br/>• Trade deficits are bad. Americans need to be spending more at home (Cohn argues trade deficits are good. People can buy things cheaper from other countries, giving them more money to spend on additional things at home)<br/>• We need to bring back the steel and coal jobs. (Cohn argues that if some jobs are disappearing, those people need to learn new skills)<br/>• We’re spending too much money defending other countries (Mattis, Tillerson and McMaster argue that putting U.S. soldiers in other countries strengthens alliances – for intelligence gathering, etc – and gives leverage for negotiating trade agreements<br/><br/>5. Trump doesn’t have patience to learn the details. Some of the frustration coming from Trump’s advisors, and the reasons they resign, is Trump won’t take their advice. They explain the world is complicated, that canceling trade agreements makes all of their alllies anxious, that tarrifs lead to job losses, Trump can’t seem to follow ideas if they aren’t simple. He’s impatient with data proving these ideas are correct. Instead, he waves them off and looks for the simplest explanation he can understand – which goes back to his gut instincts. This is the primary reason many of his top advisors have left. What’s the point of giving your advice if Trump just does the opposite and wants you to push his stupid ideas forward?<br/><br/>6. Some of Trumps ideas might be right. As I read the book, I wondered, “what if Obama was saying these things? We need to stop being the world’s policeman. We need to bring back coal and steel jobs. We need to reduce our trade deficits and encourage more domestic spending. Democrats would probably applaud these ideas. It may be that if a more articulate, charming, likable president was pushing for these initiatives in a respectful and inspiring way, we’d agree with them.<br/><br/>7. Trump’s a hothead with a trigger finger who isn’t afraid of consequences. The best example is the way Trump dealt with North Korea, calling Kim “Little Rocket Man”, promising to respond with “fire and fury” and tweeting the nuclear button on his desk was bigger than the button on Kim’s desk. These are all risky and inflammatory things to say. But Trump doesn’t care about consequences. In his mind, he’s done a lot of bad things and always found a way to get out of it. He wanted to cancel the treaty with Iran and said “I want a draft letter on my desk by Friday to sign”. His advisors told him that Iran was not in violation of the agreement. He said “I don’t care, just cancel it and we’ll make something up.” He has the same approach to all decisions – just do it now and we’ll deal with the fallout. That’s why he tweets so impulsively, such as the time he tweeted transgenders were no longer welcome in the Army and then had to revise that later when his generals pushed back. And he judges others’ harshly when they show caution, such as advisors telling him that tarrifs on steel might lead to matching tarrifs on U.S. products. He wants people to be fierce and fearless, like him, make bold and scary decisions and throw caution to the wind. He’s impatient with the slow pace of change because of the risk of upsetting the current order.<br/><br/>8. The most important thing to him is loyalty.  Trump doesn’t form close friendships with people. He seems to have a basic distrust of people, sees them for their utility, so the most important thing to him is loyalty, people who will praise him and defend him. Kellyanne Conway is a good example. That’s why he went ballistic when Jeff Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation. That’s why he goes ballistic when people resign. Loyalty is measured by how ferosciously you defend him and stand with him. That’s why he loves Rudy Guliani. Look at Steve Bannon, who was his most feroscious supporter. But when he left the White House, Trump said Bannon didn’t just lose his job, he lost his mind. Lack of loyalty is a kill shot to Trump.<br/><br/>9. He has a psychological need to be on top. There’s nothing that gets Trump more enraged than someone putting him down or somehow not acknowledging his superiority. He always has to be winning. Because in his mind if he’s not winning, then he’s losing, and that’s not tolerable to him. That’s why he’s ballistic over the Mueller probe. To the public, it makes him look guilty and he’s helpless to stop it. In fact, he gets so infuriated about the Mueller investigation that for days at a time he’s incapable of focusing on anything else and basically nothing is getting done. That’s also why he hates the media. They report things that make him look bad and he has to get back on top by tearing them down and making up lies. He can't let an insult or criticism pass.<br/><br/>10. He’s a chronic and automatic liar. Trump often improvises when he talks and either exaggerates or makes things up to support his point. This goes back to his need to be on top all the time. He will lie to get back on top. Lost the popular vote to Hillary? No, voter fraud! The smallest inauguration crowds? No, fake news, they were huge! Payoffs to porn stars? I wasn’t involved in that! Unpopular? No, the most popular president in the history of the world! It comes automatically, like he has no control over it. He may even have a mental disorder that makes him unaware that he’s lying. That’s why Guiliani doesn’t want him to agree to an interview with Mueller. Because Mueller will ask him something that makes him look bad and Trump will automatically, reflexively lie about it and now he’s perjured himself. John Dowd, Trump’s original lawyer, confirmed this when he did a mock interview with Trump. Trump responded to questions by getting angry, ranting and making things up. Dowd recommended Trump not agree to an interview.<br/><br/>11. He doesn’t read but he watches a lot of cable news. Many adivsors are frustrated he won’t read their reports, won’t educate himself on the basic underlying facts. But he will spend 6-8 hours a day listening to cable news, especially CNN and Fox News. He watches in the evening before going to bed and in the morning. He will often not come into work until 11 a.m. because he’s preoccupied with cable news.<br/><br/>The book basically paints a picture of a man driven by his own instincts that conflict with the established beliefs of his advisors and most others. And this might not be too bad if he were likable. Galileo was hated in his time when he insisted the Earth revolves around the Sun. His ideas were in the minority, but they were right. And Trump’s instincts and ideas may also be right.<br/><br/>And perhaps some of Trump’s adversarial nature could be a positive. He’s a fearless decision maker – some would say reckless – but he believes in taking action and then dealing with the fallout later. And he wants his team to be like him – “killers” – and make aggressive trade deals, decisive military victories, drastic changes to immigration and tax. That’s why he signed the disruptive immigration ban his first week in office. He believes in blowing things up and building from scratch. And he’s frustrated when his advisors caution him against big changes. Not timid incremental change. Big, bold bets. That’s Trump. I’m reminded of Steve Jobs who turned Apple around by slashing their product line to focus on just five winning products. And I have to admit that sounds like an exciting quality in a leader.<br/><br/>No, the bigger problem is Trump’s adversarial and dishonest temperament: his inability to build relationships based on respect, to learn or study the data, or to accept criticism. Take away the unecessary and obvious lies, the attacks on the media, the juvenile insults and boasts, and his ideas become easier to accept. Speak aspirationally instead of insultingly and you don’t have so many enemies.  In other words, as Republicans had hoped, if he would become more “presidential”. But perhaps it’s his bravado and vitriol that got him elected in the first place – his fire.<br/><br/>One weakness in the book is it doesn’t explore some of the more objectionable events in Trump’s life: the reckless immigration ban instituted in the first week of his presidency, his payoffs to porn stars, his constant lies about Puerto Rico and the size of inauguration crowds, his failed effort to change health care, his relationship with Vladmir Putin. Most of the book centers on his trade policies, tax plan and military decisions as well as the advisors who are frustrated by his stubborn refusal to understand the complexity of the world.
 I found this book to be hard to read.  It seemed to not have much of a story, just a list of hired and fired men, most of whom were not very competent to begin with.
 This book did restate news items and offered the corroboration I was looking for.<br/><br/>If you need restatement of news from another  independent source, do buy it.
 It is really about Trump's relationships and how things worked, or didn't, as one after another frustrated member of the administration tried to get things done but ultimately failed.
 Very interesting book.  However, since I pre-ordered it, I didn’t expect to wait for it. I could have bought it from B&amp;N the same day it was released rather than waiting a week.
 Gave this as a gift to someone who was wanting to read it.  I know it kept his attention and he read the entire book.  My impression is that he found the book informative and interesting.
 The book is great
 I was really looking forward to reading this and had to start as soon as it downloaded.  It was a very good read for what was there but it seemed to just end in the middle of it.  Finished a chapter, looked at numerous pages of photos and then expected to see another chapter... no, just the credits...pages of them.  That was it...
 My first observation is that this book is not as long as it seems. The first 63% (my Kindle tells me that) is the body of the book followed by a long chapter of acknowledgements, a detailed listing, chapter by chapter, of sources with lots of online links (including many of Trump's infamous tweets), and a long index. Trump assumed the presidency on Jan 20, 2016. The last date mentioned in the book is March 21 2018 so about 760 days into the present (I write this in Sept. 2018) administration.<br/><br/>One cannot help but compare Woodward to Wolff's "Fire and Fury" (also reviewed). Wolff's focus is the shifting cabals immediately surrounding the president in his first (roughly 200) days. Woodward hits all the same characters and follows them as well but more through the lens of national and international incidents and issues occurring at the time, some precipitated by Trump himself. The characters are painted almost sympathetically, even Trump, relatively speaking. The unifying issue throughout is how the staff, principal cabinet secretaries, and members of Congress struggled to prevent the ever impetuous Trump from wrecking the economy or starting world war III, while a few were eager to egg him on in support of his most destructive instincts. The influence goes both ways. Trump appears to have supported DACA recipients specifically (though he never liked any of the rest of U.S. immigration policy) but was turned away from even DACA support by congressional hard liners.<br/><br/>There are lots of missing pieces. I suppose it would be impossible to include everything. Sean Spicer is mentioned, as is the hiring of Anthony Scaramucci but there is no word about their departure. Of course many characters do come and go. Like Wolff, Woodward focuses early on Bannon, but he hardly touches (of course they are present in the story) Jarad and Ivanka. Like Wolff, Woodward paints a picture of a man whose comprehension of the world's complexity rises to the level of an elementary school graduate, a man mercurial and impulsive with uneven check on his actions by the adults in the room, often because they themselves are conflicted over every issue.<br/><br/>Washington Post publisher Phillip Graham seems to be credited with the observation that "Journalism is the 'first rough draft of history'". That rough draft is unfolding before us in books like Wolff's and this one from Bob Woodward. I expect there will be a few more before this presidential term is over. Historians of the future (if there is a future) will not lack for sources. If like me you are a news junkie, this book will be an enjoyable, if frightening and possibly frustrating (so many opportunities lost) ride.
 Terrifying book, because it’s all documented, and happening in real time. I have to read it a little at a time, because it reveals so much ugliness and corruption.
 The man is a liar.  He is a legally documented racist.<br/>If we are not careful, America will not recover from the damage he is doing.<br/>Make America Hate Again is the campaign promise being kept.
 Yawn.  Slow... Boring... Disappointed based on author s previous work
 This Woodward account provides an interesting coverage up to the 1 &amp; 1/2 year point of Trump’s reign.  It does give some insight into some of Trump’s early and abandoned supporters (Preibus, Cohen, Tillerson, Mattis, etc.).  It certainly begs a sequel to cover whatever is left of his term in office, and the circumstances of its end.  Hopefully the sequel will be written before 2020.
 A book that exposes the worst president this country has ever elected! I hope with expose’s like this, ‘Trumpsters’ will wise up and help us make him a one term boob!
 Fear is a book everyone should read. It shows a president who has problems with the truth &amp; doesn't seem to learn even after having things explained to him many times. I was amazed at how disrespectful he was to the generals working for him &amp; others on his staff. I think things will get worse with time. Who knows where this will all lead us.
 I have been a journalist all my life, so it's not surprising I like the writing style of Bob Woodward. But not much new information for someone that is up-to-speed with the news.
 A play by play of the Trump Whitehouse. It takes you inside and make you feel like you're in the room listening in. A fair, critical study of the president and his sycophants.
 Nothing we didn’t know. Be warned Woodward is anti Mueller and portrays him negatively. Yes Trump is seriously flawed as a human. Also poorly written. Does not follow chronologically.
 If Woodward’s book were a series of vignettes set in a Hollywood producer’s office, a university administration, or even a small town mayor’s office, I might call it a comedy of errors. It could make a charming sitcom; you could even use the cast of Saturday Night Live skits. But the lead character is the inept, lazy, ignorant, bigoted, lying bully who somehow wound up as the president of the most powerful country on earth. The supporting cast tries to corral the bully, maneuver him into supporting their pet causes, humor his narcissism, and somehow prevent him from starting World War III. This is not funny. It’s scary. The book is aptly titled. Woodward is a thorough and credible researcher. He has amassed overwhelming evidence, organized it into short, readable chapters, and compelled the attention of anyone who truly cares about the fate of the American experiment in democracy. We owe him thanks. Read the book. Then share, resist, and vote.
 What a well researched and, frankly, rather mild take on this travesty of a Presidency!  He really holds short of truly describing what a petulant 4 year old our fearless leader behaves like!
 Perhaps those in the administration might not have seen it coming, but give us a break, Trump had a history for anyone willing to take a look. Breast beating is fine and good, but you asked for it.
 Rerun of known gossip, which validates rumors.  For as long as Woodward has been around he had significant errors in some factual things like the military which undermined credibility of the book.
 Politics aside - this is an interesting book with a clear picture of Bannon's influence, power and savvy. Trump is the clueless narcissistic we see every day so not much to learn there.
 The book is well balanced, easy to read, and appears very well sourced and reliable. If someone has a passionate problem with this book, that could be because you really support Pres Trump and find it “fake news” (which it is NOT) OR because you really don’t like him, and much of this book reveals the shaky nature of certain ongoing investigations.  Another masterpiece from<br/>Bob Woodward!
 Woodward is a wonderful writer.  The contents are in the nightly news.  Needed to wait to the end of the Administration, only half a story now.  Wait for the conclusion , he will finish it in another book.
 I couldn’t read this. Way too depressing and horrifying to learn the horrible inside story of Trump. I’ll pass it on to a friend who can stomach the story of Trump better than I.
 Book is excellent. You have to be an open minded to read it and not  jump into conclusion. What I liked the most of that all of this interviews were taped therefore making believable to me
 As a great journalist, Woodward wrote an over- long book more like the longest newspaper article in history. Hint:  start with Chapter 13.  Second half of the book stronger and more fear-full than first half.
 I 'read' the audiobook.  It was VERY well read, and I could almost hear it in Bob Woodward's voice.  The subject matter is a little disturbing, but to be honest, I think I have a little better understanding of the man.  I highly recommend the book.  It was much better than Fire and Fury - much more believable, though the author's gravitasse may be the reason.  Ultimately the book summarizes itself in the very last sentence.  I'll not divulge, but I encourage all to read it for themselves.
 Compelling reporting. Could not put down. Reinforced all my opinions and my fears.
 Bob Woodward is arguably the most famous reporter in American history. He will ever be known for breaking the Watergate scandal for the Washington Post where he has worked for 47 years. No one knows politics and people inside the beltway better than he. Woodward is a true American patriot. All of his nineteen books have attained best seller lists fame and he has written on every chief executive from Nixon to Trump. He has no axes to grind and his books are written in simple, no frills, fact based accounts. All of the conversations in the book are based on first person accounts by people who were n the room at the time.<br/> Fear says President Donald John Trump comes with great power. After reading this book the reader will learn:<br/>1. Trump is  a non-intellectual who makes emotional and spur of the moment decisions which are often not based on facts.<br/>2. Trump is very difficult to work for and please. He has fired many folks since he took office from Chief of Staff Rex Priebus to right wing advisor Steve Bannon and many many more!<br/><br/>3. Trump has alienated our allies and his trade policy has been a disaster.<br/>4. Trump is an inveterate lier and moulds the truth to conform with his own thinking.<br/>5. Trump often refuses to follow the advice of his advisors and prefers to ramble on twitter.<br/>6. Trump acts like a media star and lacks sobriety and judgment<br/>  Whether your support or oppose President Trump this book will illuminate your thinking. Excellent reportage especially on Trump and foreign policy and economic affairs. Anyone looking for a sensationalized read filled with gossipy anecdotes will be disappointed,. This is a serious book dealing with presidential leadership and the great issues facing our nation in a crucial time.
 I read ‘fear’ to get insights into trump’s personality. Depressed by his block headedness driven by very old economic ideas proven not to work. Woodward’s portrayal is verified by public trump statements. He defies facts as he acts (Iran is in compliance).
 Good read and whether you like Trump or hate him, his behavior mirrors how he handles things even now. Sad to think the poor man may have dementia like his father.
 Most of the most interesting material had already appeared in newspapers and on TV or the Internet.  Still, it was well-done and I assume accurate given Woodward's reputation.
 Woodward's history ensures the book will sell &amp; be read a lot, but the book really doesn't add a lot to what is readily observable to anyone who pays attention.
 This book was good but there wasn't much in it that we didn't already know.  However, it did fill in some of the questions and Bob Woodward is a great writer and excellent researcher.
 As the investigation continues, this book gives the reader a glimpse behind the curtain of what has become the most corrupt administration in the history of our country!
 Loved the book but hate the subject. Trumpster, that is. Rehash of things you have probably already heard on the news but some things you haven’t heard. It’s worth a read.
 This book highlights the dynamic inside the Trump White House.  It is a good read. The writing seems to be based on interviews with current and former insiders. It’s compelling.
 Although much of what was written I knew, I did enjoy the reading about the interactions behind closed doors.  It was easy to predict and understand why Mattis quit.
 I enjoyed this read very much. I was disappointed when it ended so abruptly. It needs a sequel-so much too know! Obviously, this book will not appeal to people who are drinking the DJT cool-aid.
 Knowing Bob Woodward does great investigative  reporting and checks his sources this book was well written.  Makes you more concerned for our country's future.
 This is a must-read for everyone though I doubt any Trumpers would ever read it. They wouldn’t believe it anyway. For the person who wants to know that truth, this is for you.
 Fantastic read - clear and understandable about the terror that this country faces with this man in the white house. A must read if you really want to  know the TRUTH.
 This was a well researched book. It is not pro or against anyone. It is just a view of the workings in the white house and the president. Just like what his other books have been.
 Very detailed and insightful account (first hand - "insiders") of activity behind the curtain of arguably one of the most "unpresidential" presidencies -- in modern times!
 Good book, thought the supporting details were great in outlining how this presidency is run behind the scenes. Definitely scary stuff to unveil as we see Trump being questioned on his intentions with Russian interference with his campaign. Wish Bob Woodward waited longer to write the book.
 I did not like this book. It is written with quotes as if the actual dialogues among the various participants have been reported. I don't think that is an honest way to write a book on such an important topic. My copy is now with Goodwill.
 There's so much negative written about Trump, can it all be true - and accurate? In light of this, Woodward's book is on the boring side. I got about halfway through and passed it on to a colleague.<br/><br/>Woodward is a legendary, talented writer, and I believe this book was relatively well-researched. I read his book about Obama, and I also believed it was an accurate depiction of an inexperienced man who was anointed (by whom, we still don't know) to lead our country. So Woodward has his moments. Fear is not Woodward at his best.<br/><br/>For someone who enjoys hearing a drum beat of hate and negativity, this one may not satisfy you. Warning: the author is even even-handed in many situations. People looking for drama and sensationalism - and hate talk - should spend time with The View, Colbert or (fill in the blank).
 Woodward is meticulous and this book is no exception.
 Interesting look at the inner workings of a carnival. Woodward's book shows that a caricature of an evil dim-witted clown was elected to the highest office in the land. Woodward is known for honest reporting. This is a damning indictment of the President and our future.
 I had to think about this awhile because I don't know what I expected but this really wasn't it.  Nothing we haven't heard before.  I kept waiting for "something", but nothing ever came.
 The book is well written.  Woodward's technique is to convey specific scenes that reflect the President's behavior.  Scene after scene, we see variations of the same themes: forgetfulness, inability to concentrate, willingness to cruelly criticize people in front of others, wanting truth to be what you want it to be, dysfunction, bombast, almost pathological concern with adulation, and mental laziness.  (This last concerned me more than anything else.)  This reviewer has been a Republican and a Democrat, and I was profoundly disturbed and depressed by what I was reading.<br/><br/>Trump's ardent supporters probably won't want to read it, but they ought to make the effort.  It isn't a pretty picture.
 Besides the voyeur kind of look which sure makes this book popular, the style is boring, difficult to follow and doesn't give any analysis. Can pass
 This book should serve as an eye opener to every American. The lengths that people will go to advance their agenda and ignore our current situation
 Woodward's latest reminds me of Watergate reporting -- fact laced with editorializing. Well done in the typical Woodward style -- Yes it instills FEAR.
 I didn’t learn anything new. I should either watch the news or read books like this, but not both. Unfortunately things happen too fast these days.
 Confirms what we already knew about this clown &amp; his administration.
 Skillfully written and believable. FEAR is an appropriate title because it documents through quotes and accounts the fragile position our nation is in due to the egomania of one man. President Donald J Trump.
 Congratulations to the author and all who assisted in compilation no this enormous body of information. As hard as it is to remove ant bias when you begin to read this masterpiece, the resulting conclusion must be that our current Chief Executive is not only deeply flawed, but extremely dangerous, as this book details so vividly.
 Excellent book showing what REALLY happens behind the white house doors! Woodward digs out the TRUTH behind the incompetence of the Trump administration.
 Had to put down several times.  Too many, I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS HAPPENED, moments. Recommended required reading for anyone who cares about the continued future of America.
 THIS IS AS GOOD AS HIS WATERGATE BOOK.
 The book is interesting in what it confirms but shallow in the articulation of the fear we ought to have...
 This book has information that was discussed at length on the talk shows … many people deny the contents of this book but I take it at face value. No real juicy stories.
 Fear, Trump in the White House by Bob Woodward, is a very informative book.  Always trust Bob Woodward to find all the details.  I highly recommend this book.
 I have read every Woodward book. I have found all of them to be excellent including this one. It is obviously based on exhaustive research and countless interviews.
 Bob Woodward meticulously details life in the chaotic White House that he backs up with supporting documents and specific quotes from recorded interviews. Well done, indeed!
 Sloppily written.  Needs more editing.<br/>But very upsetting to learn even more what a moron Trump's closest advisers think he is. How will our country survive!
 Woodward is a great writer.  This is easy to read although, of course, scary.  Underscores the need for checks and balances which have been abandoned by the republicans.
 I honestly don't care for Trump, but I had to get this book. Like everyone, I was curious. When I got it, my husband said "Don't read this before bedtime, it'd give you nightmares." The truth speaks. Thank you Bob Woodward.
 I admire Bob Woodward for his on-going commitment to excellence and ethics in journalism. Those traits are on full display here.  Well done, sir.
 Must read book if you really think the president is losing his sense of reality. He only thinks of himself and could careless about everyone else except for his family.
 This book is outstanding and very informative and I would recommend anyone to purchase it. It is really a good book and a page turner. Read it!
 This book is very well written and not anti-Trump or anyone else. Just well-researched facts and quotes to back it up. I will say my reaction is one of fear. It is scary.
 Excellent work. As a fellow journalist, I've researched and reported on fear used to "control" the lives of people, from religion to law enforcement.
 Recommended highly.  I read the book "Fire and Fury" first and found his laborious writing style slow to read and sometimes annoying.  Over used commas and one sentence sometimes was a complete paragraph.  None-the-less, the content was similar to "Fear" although a much easier read.  Bob Woodward is the penultimate writer.  His message is an invitation to action to save the democracy.
 Well written, but there just wasn't anything in there that was worth buying the book for. The media ha hyped it up soo much so I went for the purchase. I read it for 80%.
 Bob Woodward is a truly gifted writer and more importantly, he is able to gather data and info from first hand sources. If the material is factual, this country is in deep trouble. I believe Mr. Woodward and his sources so consequently, I am troubled by this administration and their practices
 I enjoy reading books published by those involved in the issues deeply. For example, I read the following books focused on  our political situation recently:<br/><br/>September 2017, What Happened by Hillary Clinton<br/>January 2018, Fire and Fury, by Michael Wolff<br/>April 2018, A Higher Loyalty by James Come<br/>July 2018 Facts and Fears by James Clapper<br/>July 2018 Russian Roulette by Michael Isikoff and david Corn<br/>August 2018 Unhinged by Omarosa Newman<br/>September 2018 Fear by Bob Woodward<br/><br/>I admire the fact that Bob has many recordings of his conversations that are the backbone of his newest book. Like Omarosa, both author's decided to TAPE conversations. I love the flow and the time line documentation. He has compiled an EPIC work here that confirms our worst fears about how the current POTUS does not live in reality. Bob documented the countless lies and reversals of the Trump chaos. Trump's inability to lead, to motivate, to learn, to reason, to articulate, to remember are documented time and time again. Bob confirms how Trump cycles through endless back stabbing and undercutting of ALL sooner or later. He is not capable of meaningful, factual relationships over time.<br/><br/>Pity the Trumpers will never read this. They do not want to learn the facts. They prefer the Faux News distorted reality of Trump's brain.<br/><br/>I tip my hat to Mr. Woodward. Again.
 I wish everyone would read this book. It is eye opening and scary to think what is going on and that Trump still maintains his ratings like he does.
 It is well written and worth the price!
 Bob Woodward does a great job of sharing the struggles the various members of the Trump White House have had to live with and work with while being part of this administration.
 This is a great book about our most corrupt and inexperienced president since Nixon. ( Whom I liked.)<br/>Great insight from Woodward who never disappoints.
 I got bored. The book did not increase my insight into the political scenario more than the daily news. I was disappointed. I expected more from such a reputable political author.
 This is one of those books I felt I should read. I am more informed and a bit depressed at the chaos. Now I can reward myself and read something for fun.
 What can you say?  Woodward is an amazing writer.  Couldn't put this one down.
 I just finished reading the Kindle edition of Fear by Bob Woodward. It is a chilling portrait of a president who is clearly unfit for office. Woodward makes it clear that Trump has no idea of the extent of his lack of knowledge of international economic and political realities. He sees international relations exclusively in terms of dollars and cents and has no idea of the value of allies. Accordingly, he considers international economic relations as a zero sum game with clear-cut winners and losers. Despite the best efforts of knowledgeable economists such as Gary Cohn to explain how the economy actually works and that trade deficits are not the enemy, Trump remains convinced that the United States is being treated unfairly. His comprehension of political relations is similarly limited. Trump's sole concern regarding US-South Korean relations was the $18 billion trade deficit with South Korea. He became obsessed with terminating KORUS (the U.S.- Korean Free Trade Agreement). He could not be convinced to the value of the long standing U.S. economic and political relationship relationship with South Korea. He wanted to end the trade agreement immediately. He was restrained from this only because Gary Cohn took the letter ending the relationship off of Trump's desk. Because Trump has a short attention span and no overall plan, he never noticed that the letter was missing. Most chilling of all is the reason behind the decision of Trump's attorney John Dowd to resign. Although he could never voice his concern to the president directly, he became convinced that he could no longer represent Trump because of one big problem--namely that Trump is a liar.
 Woodward has been following politicians for decades and has the reputation of fair and unbiased reporting.  Didn't get bored reading this.
 did not contain a lot I did not already know or suspected to be true.  I was amazed to read what some of Trump's colleagues were willing to say about him.
 It is shocking how little this president understands.
 I detail an factual maker in which it was written.
 Definitely have heard most of these stories in the news which either proves the press is great at what they do or the leaks from the Whitehouse are rampant.
 Incitiful book for the times we live in.  If you follow the news was not a lot of new information, but the background information was very interesting.
 I liked knowing the truth, since one cannot believe anything President trump says.  It is comforting to know he is listening to advisers while he learns how to cope with a task beyond his capabilities.
 I don't think I'll ever be able to forgive the Republicans for voting in an openly pro-torture, climate change denying, pedophile of a reality TV star to our highest office. This books confirms that on top of all of that, he  is straight up mentally disabled. I want this country partitioned, those feral retards in the Republican party are just too dumb to share a country with.
 This had so much hype.  I had a hard time getting use to the narrative way it was written.  Some information was not very good for the white house .
 This was an interesting read from beginning to end. Woodward's account offers a unique perspective of the key players and palace intrigue of the Trump administration.
 I thought the book would be much longer than it was. About the last quarter of the book is all citing references to his story. Scary, but true.
 Time subject.  Seemed like a scam to buy  kindle version when you can't  get the actual book until the kindle version is purchased then all of a sudden it is available the next day.  Should have helped at walmart.com

 Great insight from some insiders as to what is happening in the White House with Trump as president.  The title of Fear is appropriate.
 What do you do when the most disgusting human being becomes president?  Write books.  This one should have the Orange Baby quaking in his diaper.
 Great read! Read Fire and Fury and this book is better researched and written. Gives as balanced view of the trump administration as is possible. The last chapter and last sentence sums up the man.
 Very intersting and has lots of good nuggets that aren't necessarily about Trump that are important for everyone to know. I encourage people from all sides to read this book.
 Well written.  Based on real inputs. Reenforced what i have heard over last 2 years.  Good read.
 Well written situations that happened in a chaotic, crazy, unbelievable time in the White House. Everything Mr. Woodward writes about is well documented.
 Bob Woodard does his usual good work at research. He seldom uses his own personal opinion and does an excellent job of sticking to the facts
 Bob Woodward is about the best reviewer of important people I have read. He stays focused, doesn't add his personal opinions, just the FACTs kind of like the Dragnet's Jack Webb
 I really wasn't surprised by the Trump quotes given his campaign rhetoric.  However, I was surprised that so many people around him stayed on even though they had a low opinion of him.  It says something about the lure of power.  If you're a Trump fan you won't like this book.
 Great reporting. A little dry in spots. I had just read Omarosa’s book. This one is a much better written and researched and educational book. VOTE.
 Great insight, details, background.
 It is very informative and enlightening as to what is going  on in the present administration and scary, also.  Fear is a good description.  I trust Bob Woodward to tell it like it is.
 This is a massive book jammed full of information about people, policies, and data.  So, I thought I would do a 'pre-review' before I finish it.<br/><br/>First, I am reading a Kindle edition. I suspect there are some of the usual e-book glitches: unclosed quotation marks, etc.  But, aside from that, I find the book oddly organized.  It is not enough to detract from the overall value of the book, but it is puzzling in places.<br/><br/>Second, Woodward's writing is very spare. If you want flights of fancy, this is not the book for you.<br/><br/>Third, it is, indeed, a scary book.  Much of it is very detailed relating of, say, our relations with North Korea over the years or our trade relations with China. But in the midst of all this, there are constant episodes of Trump behaving erratically, thinking he knows things about which he knows nothing (e.g., the national economy), his abuse of those around him, his forgetfulness, and his narcissism.  The efforts of his staff and Cabinet to just get him to behave normally in public are distressing. They seem to accept his abnormalities in private.<br/><br/>Now, I don't care if you are or are not a Trump supporter, nor whether you agree with his policy impulses.  His presidency is a mess, and it is mostly being run by people none of us ever elected.
 Loved the number of sources.  There’s no doubt that the stories are authentic.  There were a few missing pieces of “palace” intrigue, I wish had been touched or expanded upon.  Although, I understand, in doing so, would have increased the page count dramatically.
 Fascinating insight into the Trump presidency. Very detailed discussions are included that gave me great concern For the future of this nation.
 Excellent author, with more than enough information:  yes, it's time for tRUMP to be sent packing.<br/>Thanks for FEAR
 Downright scary! Although some of what Woodward reports is already out there by the time I got to read-it still had me shaking my head and wondering all of the potential “what ifs”!
 Pretty boring. Too much emphasis on foreign policy and not enough about what was happening here at home. I read half and put it down.
 Bob Woodward did a fantastic job. It’s so good I get anxious reading it. Pulls no punches. Will b a classic like All the Presidentls Men.
 This book is the best one I've read regarding all that's going on in the white house.  Super journalism, with some quite shocking incidences!
 Well written and researched, as you would expect from Woodward.  It is probably too much to have hoped for, but i did not feel i learned anything new with this book.
 Full of facts and observations, this pretty much describes the total dysfunction and immaturity inside the White House. I trust Bob Woodward and, therefore, feel this is accurate. What a shame that such an idiot and narcissistic creature somehow made it into this position. We can only hope it doesn't last much longer.
 Like others, I have great respect for the author.  So I prepurchased the book.  I’ve read half, cannot put it down.<br/>Well done.
 Incredible sourcing, like he was in the room. Woodward has done it again.  We should have a required reading book like this BEFORE we vote.
 Trump is a danger to society. That's what I take away from the book.  It was exciting and scary.  Everyone should read it whether you believe it or not.
 It feels incomplete. Of course, it has yet to be finished, but still, I felt a little cheated by the author. Then again, I feel cheated by the subject as well.
 The audiobook stopped working for me at Chapter 7.  It kept asking me to buy it again.  Clearly I never finished it.  I would have bought the hard copy, but having the face of a rapist on my bookshelf doesn't sit well with me.
 The author did an excellent job of telling his story. Politics is scary to say the least!  Recommend reading no matter what the political affiliation is.....
 Wonderful read and it certainly shows what an idiot this president is. I do feel a bit cheated as 40% of the Book is Index and reference notes.
 Bob Woodward has written 18 books and covered 9 Presidencies.  Fear is a very well written, very well researched and sourced exploration of the Trump  White House.  It paints a picture of an insecure, paranoid, reality TV star out of his depth in his role as President.  Woodward wrties scenes that will scare, shock, stun a thoughtful reader.  Even hard core trump supporters should read this carefully researched book.  It is evident that Woodward had access to the highest levels of the Trump Administration and the detailed incidents and quotations are stunning.
 I believe this book is an accurate portrayal of what had been happening at the whitehouse and elsewhere with the current president. It’s a pathology not a presidency.
 Scary knowing this material.  Well written and easy to follow.  Interesting information regarding the white house.  Much of which the public already knows
 Great writing, of course. That's a given. Only problem is, I can't stand the subject matter so much that I couldn't read past the first dozen pages. Not good for my blood pressure.
 Bob Woodward writes a very readable account of the disturbing events in the White House. His research is impeccable and trustworthy. Get it now!
 I really liked Woodward’s writing style and how he laid out the story. I also learned a few things, such as how dangerous Hezbollah currently is and how close Trump has and is bringing us to war.<br/><br/>I’ve come away from the book feeling that it’s less likely Trump colluded with the Russians, but I’m more convinced that he doesn’t know what he’s doing and won’t take the expert advice of his advisors, especially in the area of the economy and free trade.
 If you don't want it reported, don't talk to a reporter.  Not a difficult concept, unless you are connected to the current administration
 Another heroic doozie from the multi-award-winning Bob Woodward.  Everything we knew to be true about the conman-in-chief is verified here.  There must be a sequel already in the works and I hope to be first in line to pre-order it.
 This item was a gift. Recipient started reading it and there are 5 pages missing. Pages 5-17. Very unhappy and would like this replaced ASAP.
 I was disappointed because I expected different from a reporter.  The many quotes seem to be made up, hard to believe that they were based upon being present at the time of the conversations.  I don't dispute the likely accuracy of the tone and substance of the conversations, but it could be based upon bias.  It is unlikely to be viewed as an accurate reporting of the events.
 I have faith in this author!
 Great read. Realize how much trouble we really are in.
 A frightening view of the mind of a totally incompetent, vulgar and ignorant president.
 Working on reading it now and every page so far has been interesting.  Buy it even though you might not read it just to support the cause
 Wow, what a great book! A very sobering read as it breaks it all down leaving me without a doubt that we have an incompetent man in the the White House.
 This book fills in the gaps from what I have heard the president say,  on  TV and  his tweets  ALONE.  What is written in this book should not be a surprise to anyone who  has an ear to hear and wants the truth to make them free.  I hope this book is read by as many people as possible that claim to love this country.
 Well done
 I enjoyed this book. There was a bit of a first person and third person mix in the writing, but good research product.
 Well researched piece of history on the trump White House detailing the personality, temperament and ethics of its current resident
 Great capture of this presidency to date. It Lau’s our the pattern very nicely....and it’s quite obvious that it’s not Fake News
 THIS BOOK IS A REAL PAGE TURNER. I TRUST THE AUTHOR AND THE FACTS THAT HE PROVIDED. LOVE THE BOOK BUT I WARN YOU THAT IT IS BEYOND FRIGHTENING.
 Disappointed in the behavior of the President.  If only half of the things attributed to him were true, I can only conclude that we're in dangerous unchartered waters.
 Got this as a present for my Dad. He said he could only read a chapter at a time, it is that scary. I don't care what your politics are Bob Woodward's book is very well researched and documented. The facts in this book can't be ignored.
 A gift for my wife who has raved about all of the grim, horrifying stories it contains.  Political entertainment of the darkest type.
 His books are always factual.
 If you read newspapers regularly, you probably wont find many surprises in this book. What I found most shocking was revisiting so many appalling events in a single, concise volume. A well-written work if you can stomach mainlining so much content about this unconventional presidency in remarkably few pages...
 Anyone on the fence about the lunacy of trump should read this book.  The White House is in chaos and this book lays it out well.
 Woodward is probably the most respected reporters out there today.  Even if 1/5 of what he said in this book were true, we are in serious trouble.
 Scary reinforcement for what we already know. Thanks for your tireless research and writing ability.  Woodward book is a great read.
 This book was okay, but it really seemed like a compilation of news reports that had already been widely published.  I really thought that James Comey's book was more riveting and informative.
 Liar,  fantasize,  sexist,  but above all:  self centered egotist.  Its like reliving the past few years day by day.  Documented to the Nth Degree.
 The Trump administration looks crazy from the outside. Now we learn it's crazy from the inside too. Superb reporting, and no surprise given the author. I was turning pages late into the night. I felt I was eyewitness to events inside a chaotic and disgraceful White House. Woodward has dug deep and produced a book to warn us what is happening at the highest level of our government. Now it's up to us to pay attention. November.
 The White House is being run by people who do not realize that their actions can have consequences.  They are incapable of empathy for people who struggle with economic issues.
 This is not a one sided treatment. It has the ring of Truth to me. John Dowd's words<br/>are the right ones to end the book. Pray for us.
 Why would an author who has written so many books of distinction write such a career degrading book as this? I could not and would not recommend this book. This book is definitely biased against President Trump and is not an objective portrayal of what has gone on.
 Very good book by a veteran journalist. A must read to understand the dynamics of the Trump White House.
 I don't know which is more scary, President Trump running the country, or the career staffers telling us that they are watching out for us.
 Perfect title because we should all be very afraid.  Woodward must be feeling a sense of dejavu from 40 some odd years ago.  Wow!!
 A wealth of information stitched into a readable narrative.<br/><br/>Other reviews (see most helpful) have said everything I could mention.<br/><br/>Terrifying enough of a read to make you eat through a sleeve of Oreos for some sense of ephemeral comfort.
 A fine read. Makes one afraid of the man running our country.i don’t think it is Fake news. Men have sold their soul for this President.
 Never one of Bob’s books. He was spot on as always. What scares me the most is the virtual reality we are faced with relative to this incompetent President
 This book is scary! I have not finished it yet. I find it hard to read about the corruption in our country that worked to get Trump elected.
 This book is full of great anecdotes and stories, but the reason I give it three stars is that as a book I don't like how Woodward writes. The whole thing is disjointed, it doesn't flow either chronologically nor categorically; I feel like you could just take out 20 chapters, arrange them randomly, and the whole thing would basically read the same. Also, while there was a lot in the book we didn't know, there wasn't any real insight into most of the big players in the book - they just sort of appear and disappear with little introduction or goodbye. Frankly, of you read enough op-eds about the book, you've basically read it.
 Great quality book. My dad is enjoying reading it. Took a while to get here but they did say bbn it would. Worth the wait.
 Bob Woodward did careful research as he always does to write this insightful analysis of the early first term of Donald Trump.
 Perfect; as usual by this veteran reporter; &amp; “star” of the Watergate affair! What can I say? Gripping &amp; well sourced information EVERYONE should have about THIS administration!
 If even only a small percentage of the info is true, things are a lot worse than you thought. Very well written as one would expect from Woodward.
 Some upsetting surprises but mostly reinforced my views of a dysfunctional administration. The entire staff should resign in disgust  sad
 Mildly interesting.  Wouldn’t hurt  to read it. Informative, but if you been paying attention you may know most of the information already
 Woodward does not disappoint with his thorough research and detailed events of this very disruptive presidency.
 I bought it because Bob Woodward wrote it.  I didn't find it especially enlightening, or the structure well developed.
 This book is all about the Trump that we see day in and day out but hoped was untrue-  the liar, the con-artist, the bully and the dangerous man who is totally unfit to be president of anything.
 I’ve admired Bob Woodward’s writing since the 70s. The book is well written. Interesting and absolutely horrifying.
 Facts and data without opinion. This is a great book that is nevertheless tough to read because of its disturbing content.
 Mr. Woodward is always a must read and this one is no different. A scary insight into today's White House -- a House of Fools. Couldn't put it down.
 Loved the inside view of different reactions by senior White House staff to POTUS.  Woodward leaves to the reader a lot of conclusions about the President's style, ability to grow with experience in the position, and general competence.  Good read.
 Woodward captured the crazy that is the White House.  What a shame for this country! But better to know than let it remain hidden.
 easy to read and very informative.
 I read the book and lent it to several others who could not finish it.  It depressed them too much to realize that we actually had a fricken moron as a president.  God help us and some how forgive the remnants of the Republican Party that will have to answer for abaiding this treasonous criminal.
 Good book but it makes the trump White House somehow more terrifying. Author seemed unbiased, included the good and the bad, which is how journalism is supposed to work.
 The best Bob Woodward book ever. Hopefully it will accomplish what it should accomplish and that is to get rid of the man in the White House
 Good insight on what's going on in the White House. Some chapters ended abruptly and I would have liked to know more. Notes section showed there was more info not included
 The length of the chapters seemly match the commander in chief’s attention span. The continuing dismay and disappointment of the senior staff will continue to linger in my thoughts.
 As I read this book it was evident that most of the information was already public knowledge. I found very little to be new material.
 Told real thoughts of people in the Trump White House. Reveals how totally unprepared for the presidency Trump is.
 To hear what those who Trump hired speak of him is chilling.  These are folks who wanted to serve him and learned what he is really like.
 I did not like the fact that there was so much hype but at the end the book lacked a purpose, it shows what we can see in the news but nothing deeper.
 Woodward is at his best.  Fills in a lot of the blanks about a seriously flawed and demented Trump. Provides depth where the media leaves off.
 Bob Woodward provides valuable insight and analysis on the Trump administration,  through extensive reporting and research. I learned a lot from this book.
 Woodward made me feel like I was a fly on the wall and confirmed my fear that this President doesn't know what he is doing.
 I found the book to be very credible because it was well researched. Typical Woodward style.
 I really wanted to savor every moment of this book slowly, but a week later I've finished. No regrets. The cast of characters were so lively, their actions so jarring that I couldn't put it down. Especially the last 100 pages. thoroughly researched with copious notes, Woodward is still close to the top of his game.
 Waste of money, just a curated collection of already printed stories.
 Really good book, you can tell so many of the sources had to be true White House insiders. No matter your political affiliation, this will make want to pray for our country.
 I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Woodward presents the facts without innuendo, speculation or bias.  It may not appear pleasant but, it provides a clear window into the behind the scenes.
 The most shocking aspect of Bob Woodward's latest book is that we are no longer shocked by the litany of incompetence, malfeasance, lies and outright criminality of this president. Woodward's meticulously researched and sourced book simply confirms the day by day evidence of our own eyes and ears. Nevertheless, it is disturbing to see the office of president sullied by this incompetent fool and narcissist. And as Woodward himself has subsequently asserted, trump is a danger to our country and our democracy.<br/><br/>The final words of the book are spot on regarding trump: He's a f------g liar.
 Discussion of major and minor points of Trump' s issues &amp; difficulties,very clearly laid out for all to see… Fear an apt title…we should be fearful of what'happening to the country under Trump'watch with him at the helm.
 Try not to read this before bed.  It will keep you awake.  We are in big trouble.  Woodward is so honest it is frightening when you realize everything he says is factual.
 The book validates things you already thought about this President and his administration. I guess i thought there would be more insight into what was happening. But I guess Woodward could only write about what  he found to be true. He should be commended for that.
 Written in a non-partson way. Just the facts. All Americans should read it if they want to learn about what goes on in the Trump era whitehouse.
 This book rehashes news we have all seen but does not really go behind the scenes for things we dont know. There are no conclusions reached in the interest of journalitic impartiality. Not sure why the book was written.<br/>Lots of key events are left out.<br/>I
 As always, a great book about this administration.  But then you know Woodard would get all the scoop.
 great read, know the white house was in turmoil, but just like Watergate, Bob Woodward finds it all!!!
 Once again Bob Woodward delivers an accurate portrayal of a president.  This is a real page turner, hard to put down.
 Nothing in this book surprises me. Proves what I’ve known all along.<br/>“Our president is an  incompetent idiot.”
 Honest, forthright portrayal of a dysfunctional government administration.<br/>I think a fourth grade student could govern more honestly and effectively.
 Anyone who has ever wondered about  voting  in the elections tomorrow should read this book.  I worry about our democracy.
 A good source of information on the Trump presidency. I would not recommend this book to anyone who is up on the news.
 Well researched, easy to be follow the writing...made what I have been seeing more real and easy to see how we allowed this cluster***kt be to happen
 Had to read the book and was pleased with the professional journalism without the partisan hype and spin from other spectral sources.
 One of America's foremost investigative journalists. That in itself is enough reason to read Fear. I hope he's around at the end to write the final chapter.
 Like the Cohen testimony, this book re-plows old information.  Not much I had not already been told.
 Great book with Bannon as the mastermind.<br/>If you do not like political books as I usually don't - do not get this.<br/>If you want to know about the chaos/ back stabbing a great read.
 Woodward truly captures what Trump is like.
 Once again Bob Woodward has done great research, well documented , and has produced a totally engrossing book.
 Pretty interesting book and lots of info about politics.  Author describes behavior of politicians in a humorous way.
 Even as someone who has swam in this Trump swamp of news...for my show...everyday...Woodward doesn't fail to surprise, enlighten, and scare the Hell out of me.<br/><br/>America needs to wake up, catch up, and take action.  This book points out in vivid detail why this is all too dangerous to someday say, "...wow, I guess it really was that bad".<br/><br/>Congratulations to Bob Woodward and thank you for this book.
 I can't believe that I finished the book, it was an interesting read to say with all the foul language.
 Not impressed with the guts of the book. Just the usual crap about the staff not getting along. Not worth the money in my view.
 Interesting book, feel quite confident it tells the way it is, seems our civilized friends in politics are happy users of the word F***.... does not bother me, just they like to be seen just the opposite. yes, bastards they all are!<br/>Mike
 The. Ok was very informative and gave real life events of the Whitehouse also shows where the information came from
 Well-done, Bob Woodward. Fascinating. Well-researched and backed up with quotes and examples. I believe it totally.
 A great read. Get ready to build a bunker, because if what is written in "Fear" we are all in a world of trouble.
 Amazing window into the scary childlike narcissism that is the man with the nuclear button. God help us.
 Very well written, not salacious at all. It took me a while to really get into it but it was very, very informative.
 Great book and the information matches what we have heard plus more. However, the topic sets my "blood a boil".
 Great read!
 All Americans should read this will written book. Who is this man we now call president in the White House?
 Just think this man is our "leader" -- a constant source of lies, embarrassment.  2 years to go and hopefully he will be gone!!
 Done very opjectively by a person with great credibility. I am a Republican and all Tepublicans should read and think about
 Absolutely fascinating the amount of insanity in the white house right now is definitely nightmare fuel. Fear is an apt title
 Wordy, long, just the news repeated. Normally enjoy the author, not this time. Needed a sidekick for this one. Sorry
 This book confirmed what I already knew - we have a very dangerous and dishonest individual in the Oval Office!
 What an unsettling account of a doubled, ego-driven recalcitrant. Appreciate Woodward’s attention to detail and level of narrative fluency. Highly recommended.
 Very scary stories about the President.  Easy read but very disturbing with each turn of a page .
 A refreshingly fact-based narrative of the Trump White House over the first two years.  Incredible how many in the administration openly acknowledge that the President routinely lies, and deem it acceptable.  Kudos to those who didn't, and got out.
 Lot of detailed sourcing of the day to day running of the Trump White House.  Interesting to see everyone trying to position themselves as the savior of the Republic...
 This book is on point. Everyone interested in what’s going on in America should read this book.
 This book kept me in my chair until I finished it. so frightening to see how our country is being  led.
 Clearly accurate. Depressingly unsurprising. And it left me increasingly angry at Sen. Graham and others who ought to understand their ethical and moral responsibilities. No point in getting angry with Trump: he's just a mentally ill geriatric sociopath.
 So damn scary.<br/>Bob Woodward is the perfect journalist to highlight this frightening time in our history. Read it and vote.
 I have a much better understanding of 45 and just how out of his depth he is.  He has no concept of global politics and will bankrupt this nation no doubt.  Wasn’t what I expected although I’m not really sure what I was expecting.  Definitely a must read.  I will not be surprised if he wins again.
 If you want to know how dysfunctional the Trump White House is, you'll want to read this book.
 The writing, investigation and integrity of this book makes it the best of the year!
 After a cursory look I decided to return this book.  I don't need to wallow in the negativity.
 i love it but i truly hate having my worst fears confirmed.  Incompetency and blatant corruption  heavy sigh
 Honest and accurate, this book should be required reading for people of every political persuasion.
 Sort of like reading the newspaper, you already know he story but with a little different insight.
 The book is a great read.  The amount of information which is fully backed by the best bibliography i have read is enormous.
 Reading this from a trusted author and journalist, it was a scary proposition.  Fellini wouldn't film it.
 Gift for my husband and he says there were no surprises. Definitely not supportive of Trump.
 The book was great. It confirms what I thought of our present President and his entire family
 I knew how bad trump was running the but I didn't think it was that bad. Wow I don't how TH s country can survive unlit 2020
 Connecting the dots via using facts.  Excellent read from one of the journalists that brought down the Nixon presidency.
 This is a very interesting account of the events during the first half of the Trump administration. It is extremely insightful and revealing to see the chain of events and decisions made in a compact timeline rather than living through one tidbit of information each week in real time. The research done to compile this book is nothing short of impressive!!
 Liked.
 Great Read ! Interesting views on daily functions or lack thereof in the White House. It kind of reminds me of Alice in WonderLand  Mad Hatter and all
 I am impressed with Mr Woodward’s research on Fear.  I was able to follow many scenarios in the book that I remembered as they actually unfolded.  Excellent insight to this Presidency, a must read for all Americans!
 Really opens your eyes as to what goes on behind the scenes, scary were this presidency is right now, great read
 I enjoyed reading this book... It was factual and not surprising that we have a crazy president
 Its Bob Woodward, what else do you need to say. Someone should tell Trump about Watergate.
 Mr. Woodward presents an excellent view into the chaos that exists in the current executive office.  He shows Donald Trump to be disorganized, and only believing his preconceived ideas.  Mr. Trump will not accept any opinion or idea that he does not agree with.  Mr. Trump will not accept and facts that he does not agree with.  Mr. Woodward also presents how many people in the government are trying to soften Mr. Trumps rash decisions.  An interesting and well documented narrative, but with a very abrupt end.  I do realize, that the narrative had to end as the story is still being played out.
 Interesting insights into Trumps White House. Gives a bit of a whitewash for his two main sources. Once they leave the administration, the story more or less ends. Often it’s difficult what the opinion of the respective source ends and Woodward’s starts. It still shows Trump in all his worrying glory and provides good information on the approach to the Mueller investigation.
 Writing style is dull
 This book of 43 Chapters, none of which had a title, had a lot of Jump Discontinuities throughout but was still an interesting read describing the chaos in the White House (crazytown) with the Staff trying to protect the country from Trump's many irrational behaviors...
 Well written and researched book. Horrifying in detail. Wish I weren't also living it....wish it were fiction.
 Great inside information on our dysfunctional administration. I couldn't put it down once I started reading. What a shame it is not read by those staunch supporters of Trump!
 For a book that is supposed to scare the reader about Trump in the White House, written by the guy who was 50% of the journalist duo that took down Richard Nixon, I'm left feeling LESS scared about Trump being president than I was before I read the book!
 Excellent book.  And, thank goodness for people like Bob Woodward, and all the press, for telling us the truths they know.
 Pretty sure there's nothing I can add that hasn't already been said. I got this to donate to a little library.
 This was an interesting and disturbing read at the same time.  It is unfortunate that this administration does not have a wider view of the world.
 A well written book. Nothing I hadn't seen before but with the author's reputation, now I know it is all true.
 Well there wasn’t much New was sort of slow. On the other hand if you don’t read the N.Y. Times then you must read this.
 Heads up
 Good read with another view of what is happening in the White House!  Always interesting!
 Exciting read.  Details behind the scene actions and decision-making processes of the Trump campaign and administration.
 I thought it was well written,but I don’t know,I’m left with,Is this all the hype was about! Should of been more...imo
 A great read into truly what is the most obnoxious unprofessional and narcissistic idiot to ever grace? the oval office!
 Once I started reading this, I could not put it down.  I am hoping for a continuation of the story ...
 I liked the book a  lot.  I would recommend reading it.  Its one, I will read again in a year.
 Excellent, reads like fiction, and I truly wish that it was....highly recommend....gotta be a part 2, at least, maybe one for every year of this, er, presiduncey....
 A glimpse of the madness inside the Whitehouse. The one thing the president's attorney never told him...LOL!
 Woodward is meticulous and precise and accurate and lets us understand what is really going on.
 A very good book.  Insight into the running or possibly not running of the White House and our current government.  The dysfunction and absurdity of it all, not to mention the very real fear of mistakes being made of a novice, non-political, unknowing, unthinking President.  This short glimpse into this White House is fearful indeed.
 The book FEAR is written by a journalist with 100% credibility.  The inside look at the workings of this White House is actually chilling.  Chaos is the word most often used by many witnesses.
 I enjoyed reading the book, but he did not uncover anything new. Read the book or watch the news for free
 I have been a fan of Mr Woodward for years. I found the book insightful but seemingly one sided. Usually people have some redeeming qualities in the work which they are involved. This maybe the intent of the book or there are redeeming qualities.
 Everyone should read this book regardless of political views and further educate themselves on what we elected to represent us in the White House.
 I trust this author to research honestly. No fake news here, he pulls the curtain on this knucklehead sitting at the helm.
 A shocking and depressing read from one of the worlds most respected and trusted investigative journalists.
 My husband is reading it first.  Bedtime reading.  He can't put it down. :-)  Bob Woodward has hit a home run with 'Fear'.
 Events move so fast that this book now seems a little dated, but excellent nonetheless.
 So scary and sad.  Our USA being destroyed by Trumpisb discourse.<br/>I read first 10 pages and could not continue for 3 weeks.
 A well-documented account -- although I suspect it's only part one of a longer tale.
 Everything about this book is awesome. Read asap so you too can enjoy the sun setting on our world
 Not as interesting or as carefully written as the Comey book, but some of Woodward’s facts about Trump are chilling.
 Probably the most researched and sourced book currently available on the White House. Compares and ranks well with the prior "All The President's Men."
 Be warned - the current administration is FAR WORSE than you can imagine. If HALF of what is in this book is true, we are doomed!!!
 Anyone wanting to be informed will learn from reading this book about the absurdity of the current state of affairs. It is hard to fathom the enormity of the clear and present danger to the core values and essential fabric of our democracy.
 Such a bizarre and intimate portrait of crazy town. Surprising detail to color what we already know. Reads a lot like a news article, as it's fairly quick and somewhat abrupt. Still, colorful detail and incredibly well cited.
 Great reporting. A little dry. This author is diligent with the facts and reserves his opinion. Would live for him to say what he was thinking.
 Details the harrowing life inside President Donald Trump’s White House and how he makes decisions on major foreign and domestic policies.
 Very good story, it feels like actually being with the President. I feel sad about the President lawyer, they work very hard but get no ware.
 Was not convincing in sources,too general.I felt it wasn't up to the authors standards at all.
 More than a bit scary, but I found it very credible.  I would certainly recommend.
 Many reviews already. Choose one that fits your preconceived views.<br/>Or read the book yourself.
 Well-written.  Recommended to anybody who wants to get a closer look at the inner workings of the Trump presidency.
 It shows Trump as not to smart and has people telling him what he wants to hear.  No surprises.
 Thought I was well informed but filled in many areas that I lacked accurate information. Trusted writer
 I expected more from a book written by Bob Woodward.  I found this book boring.
 bWoodward's thoroughly researched examples from inside the White House are both impressive and terrifying! These are a series of compelling cases or scenarios that aren't particularly connected to one another, but together paint a vivid picture of a President and executive branch that has no idea how to manage a complex democratic government.
 Content seemed believable, confirming generally what I believed about Trump. Not impressed by Woodward's writing style. Liked his first couple of books better, when Bernstein was involved.
 It’s a slow read due to the plethora of detail but very interesting portrayal of how some of the ego’s work
 Well sourced and well written as you would expect from a Pulitzer prize winner. This could be a very dull subject, but somehow Woodward wrote it so well it was a real page turner. I know whatever he writes he has sources enough to verify accurate facts. Great read!
 Every one should read this and make up your own mind about the information it contains.
 What a great look into the chaotic administration.  I had to take breaks. It gives me anxiety
 A must read to understand what is happening inside the White House.  Provides a more balanced look into the situation compared to other similar books.
 Great book about trump.  It shed light on the White House and how disfunctional it is.
 This was supposed to be a gift but the both covers had dents on the lower side.<br/>I'm sure this is a great book by a great author which deserves 5 stars, but gave 3 for the reason listed above.
 If you like Bob Woodward’s style of writing you will very much enjoy this book
 Excellent, very informative and well documented. Just reinforces everything you know and feel
 Very well written, I couldn't stop reading. Woodward explains why Power is Fear...or is it Fear is Power?
 It is interesting, but nothing much that other books haven’t already stated.
 Really incredible source material. Wolff and Omarosa were there, yet Woodward's telling is so much more real. Hope he writes a follow-up.
 Written as a good reporter would. Not editorializing just relating the unfortunate facts.
 Loved the book. Well researched and an easy read. Captured my attention. Worth the time to read. Thank you, Bob.
 Just started to read.more or less what l expected !!  (He makes me so exasperated !!!!!!!!)
 Well sourced and written. Woodward does a fantastic job reporting only the facts and letting the reader drawn our own conclusions.
 Very interesting read about what happens and is being said in the current administration.
 Boy is this country in trouble!  Thank you Mr. Woodard for this fine book what is really happening in our White House.
 There is no shortage of stupidity in the United States.The people spoke and look what you got !  OYE VAY !!
 The part about John Bolton’s mustache was my favorite.
 Another amazing literary offering by Bob Woodward! Own it. Read it. Vote.
 It had a few things we didn't know. It was mostly about how much Trump used the F Bomb. I wasn't impressed
 Scary to know Trump was sometimes the only one asking the most important questions.
 This is an insightful, sometimes frightening, look at current events. Mr Woodward took great pains to cite all of his material, and I have to say it is nice to read non-fiction for a change.
 Trumps continued ignorance is frightening and this story continues to devolve as all the "adults in the White House"are now gone.
 Woodward never disappoints.  Thorough research and documentation. Frightening that this is what our leadership is in a country known for its commitment to fairness!
 I trust Bob Woodward and appreciate his candid and thoughtful presentation. He saw and chronicled what so many US citizens thought were true - Mr. Woodward validated those beliefs. Thank you, Sir.
 This book gives some insight into Donald Trump’s thinking.  If you follow the news there is not much new here.
 While the book did give a insight into the current White House, it is basically a rehash of other books I have read on the same subject
 A great read from a great author. Very enlightening look in to the Trump whitehouse
 Great book.  Obviously great sources.  I'm recommending it to most of my friends.
 This Bob Woodward book should really scare you. The book lays out exactly who Trump is. Again, it’s pretty scary.
 Bob Woodward does not disappoint!! This is an excellent read for all  of us who despise Trump!!
 Me, Woodward masters the art of getting massive numbers of high profile sources to speak to him and disclose every single detail of their knowledge about facts that public opinion normally does not get to even start to know.  This book is a fascinating read and it provides information and perspective on one of the most puzzling moments of modern American history.
 Easy to read. Not drawn out. Seemed to confirm everything I saw in this president. (If that's what you want to call him)
 It has information about Trump.  The information is probably reasonably accurate.
 Gives a lot of the back story about the past of the current president
 I'm sorry, but I had to send this book back after 4 chapters.  It kept me up the night I read it because it REALLY IS FRIGHTENING  to have DONALD TRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE!  How is it we are letting him stay there?  Why aren't the "powers that be" taking steps to get him out of there!  Not that Pence would be much better, but Trump knows NOTHING ABOUT ANYTHING GOVERNMENT/WHITE HOUSE/PRESIDENT/ETC.  The first 4 chapters had me so frustrated that we let him stay in as OUR PRESIDENT, I had to stop reading it!  It did, indeed, keep me up that night.<br/><br/>Altho I would believe anything Bob Woodward writes, his writing is very monolithic and rather boring.  I found the book did not "flow" and was hard to understand.  He kept jumping around with his "characters" ...BUT - if you want to know what's going on, this is THE book!!
 More than I expected. Dated before it was published, but still worth the read.
 Excellent. But hard to read in one sitting because it’s disturbing. But you have to read it.
 As usual, a well-researched piece of contemporary reporting from Woodward. The howls from 1600 Penn Ave can attest to its uncanny, and frightening, accuracy.
 My thanks to Bob Woodward for writing this.  What a scary president.  God help us.
 Great reporting, investigative work and writing on a terrible man we all need to fear.
 I began reading this book because I already had a fear of this man in the White House. My fear was not abated and now more than ever I am afraid of what is happening to our country. How will we all end up!!!!
 The book describes the behind the scenes chaos that is reflected in daily news clips.
 It’s unfortunate a book like this has to be written.  That said, it is an excellent read.
 One of today's great journalists and true to form it did not duusappoint!
 All the PR the Trump does to dismiss this book is another lie of his. It's tragic and sorrowful truth that Trump is incompetent as a president and a man who is not acquainted with truth in anything. Thanks, Bob Woodward, for telling the truth about a man who is incapable of telling the truth! We are in deep trouble as a nation with Trump in the white house! God help us!
 This book confirms what we already know about the idiot president.
 Nothing ground breaking that I hadn't already read about elsewhere.
 EXCELLENT READ!  WOODWARD SCORES AGAIN!<br/>MAURICIO PENELA  (Thursday, NOVEMBER 29, 2018 -- 11:29 a.m.)
 Easy to read. Not boring like some of the other books about Trump.
 Just received the book yesterday and it seems like I will enjoy being more informed
 As one expects from a great writer like Woodward, this is sheer brilliance---and it's stranger than fiction. Well sourced, well researched, and as objective as one can be telling this story, "Fear: Trump in the White House," is a fascinating and terrifying read that should serve to shape the perception of the current climate of our nation.
 If this doesn’t scare the hell outta you then I don’t know what will. God save the USA!
 I believe the author tried to be honest and true to the reality, as always. The book is chronicle of our time and new type of politician that work for themselves not the good of people
 Bob Woodward can tell a story. Wish this one was not such a nightmare.
 Great writer.  Bob Woodward knows how to put things into words.  Unfortunately...its all true.
 There seems to be consistent themes about the man Trump and the President Trump. Unfortunately his interests remain the same and focused on himself and not the overall well-being of those less fortunate who he “governs”.
 I liked the fact the author was involved in revealing the Watergate scandal.
 Anyone who has stayed up with the news would not find this a good source for new information or insight into the available information.  Not even a small value-add.
 A very readable account of what actually happens in this white house and why we should all be afraid. Aptly titled.
 WOW! Well researched book. Highly recommend reading this book!
 My book is missing pages!!! I just opened it up to read (finally!) and I got to page 6.... then page 17! I was confused... but then realized I was just missing those pages out of a brand new book. I’ve never had that happen before! I’m unfortunately outside of the return window now, but check your books when you get them!! Yours may be missing them too!
 Great Book!  2nd book on Kindle.  Better than Hardcopy.  Change with the times!
 Pulitzer Prize territory, gripping to the very end. Bravo Bob Woodward.
 There is hope.  My husband , a Conservative read  every page. Excellent research.  I trust Bob Woodward.  Fabulous book.  Thank you!
 Husband is glued to this book. Looking forward to reading next!
 The best political book in a decade.
 Great price and quick delivery.  My husband is reading and loves it
 Indispensable to understand phenomenon of chaos in government.
 Style of writing is excellent. Depth of reporting and insider knowledge is astounding. Wonderful journalism.
 This was a gift for a political wonk who very much appreciated receiving it.
 As a political Independent, I was looking forward to a book on the Trump presidency from a noted author, having read most of the others. Surprisingly, the book is not well written, repetitive, and filled with quotation marks wherein one is led to believe that you are reading conversations by unattributed authors. The picture painted of Trump, not surprisingly, is clearly one sided - he is dumb, demented, irrational, paranoid, and a liar-liar-liar.  The book offers no insight as to how the country got itself into this mess nor does it ascribe any responsibility to the previous leadership (Republican and Democrat) for failing its citizenry. If one was expecting some sense as to how we might intelligently move forward, you would be disappointed. Instead, you are left with the dread of more of the same - an small inside group (including Mr. Woodward) of elites conspiring with each other for more of the same.
 came in a timely manner..... interesting, have loaned it out
 Woodward nailed it pretty well. Definitely a page turner. Couldn't put it down until I finished it.  A must read.
 This is a good book, well written. It did cover a lot of what I already knew but added a lot more detail.
 Well researched and clearly written history of the Trump White House. This is the very best book so far on what we have been experiencing as a nation.
 Fear is a good title for this book.  That is the emotion that we all should be experiencing as long as Trump stays in the White House.
 Well written and factual. Typical of this fine journalist. Be afraid. Be very afraid
 Bob Woodward does it again.facinating look into the chaos that is the trump adminitration.Higly recomended.If you support trump you might not like it but the facts are there.You just might learn something.Read this book.
 Does not give much depth in his book, but still a good read.
 If you really want to get a true picture of the "Trump Administration" you have to read this book!
 Good reading
 Well, written, researched, and scary expose’ of the Trump Administration
 The book confirms the Donald is tremendously insecure and will lie to get whatever he wants. It shows his lack of interest in factual data and the harm he is and can do by not using the facts to make decisions.  Not too much of the book is new information if you have been reading non partisan sites.
 Trump is really, really bad at being President.  This isn't news to anyone who has been following the leaks, rumors, announcements, policies, and tweets coming out of the White House for the last nineteen months.  Rather than being a revelatory, shocking look behind the curtain of an administration run by the single dumbest man to ever hold his office, the book just confirms the stories we've already heard, mixing in additional commentary from people in or close to the White House, mostly former employees who clearly still agree with Trump's agenda, even if they could no longer stand the man himself.  Woodward presents anecdotes from these individuals--people like Sen. Lindsay Graham, a reknown proponent of endless wars in the Middle East, and Steve Bannon, former Chief Strategist, an out-and-proud xenophobe and fascist--without commentary or context, which has the odd effect of presenting these people only in contrast and comparison to Trump himself.  One unfamiliar with Bannon, for example, could come away from the book thinking that he was a fairly reasonable person (rather than a racist, white nationalist) because he is only ever shown as a foil to the ongoing circus of incompetence that is the Trump administration.  This is Woodward's style, of course; he presents himself as an almost entirely neutral presence, merely transcribing the things he learned, but when discussing such dangerous and reprehensible people, a paragraph here and there dedicated to reminding readers what, exactly, these people claim to believe would have been appreciated additional context.<br/><br/>Essentially, this book is just Michael Wolfe or Omarosa's stories, only drier and with more footnotes.
 Very interesting and amazing insight into the Trump presidency. Well worth the effort. And of course should strike some fear in all.
 Great insight into the Trump administration.  Author has clearly done alot of research.  It felt like I was sitting in the room with the people.
 Oh my! Easy and informative book. Thank you once again Mr Woodward, for great information.
 Very interesting data and resources. My husband even enjoyed it!
 Mr. Woodward is an American treasure.  The Orange Man is a monster, racist, ad nauseum.  This book says it well.
 Should have been named Terror.  Bought two copies, one for me and one for my local library.
 Ordered for my husband. Verdict still out, but he says so far it’s good.
 Superb depiction of the dysfunctional nature of the Trump White House.
 Frightening is the word, I didn’t imagine that the situation was that bad
 Woodward has set a high bar for journalistic integrity, and more than clears the bar here. This look inside the White House is both terrifying for the ineptitude of those in power, and a relief that they, too are human.
 I echo the comments of DRob, Sept 17.  Her review is spot on.  Wish I had read it before I read the book.
 Well written and well worth the time to read it, regardless of your party affiliation.
 One has to wonder why the people that knew Donald Trump the best, could ever think for one minute that this man had the makeup to serve as president.  What a hot mess this man is.  The scariest things about these times in our country is how the GOP has sold their souls to keep this man in office and all the while, Mike Pence lurks in the background.
 Just what you would expect from a reliable news person.
 I'd have liked to see even MORE reasons to get the traitor and sputnik out of the White House.
 This was a great read. I am an independent and found it fair and informative. I also found it distressing based on content. Highly recommended.
 Well written by a trusted reporter/writer.  Book verifies much of the news already presented.  Interesting and kinda scary at the same time.
 Very well written, easy to read. It's hard to believe that we have a president that so out of touch with reality.  I would recommend this book to anybody that wants to know what really does on in the White House .
 Not much more was revealed than we already know.  It paints a picture of chaos and mismanagement.  Well written, well researched book overall.
 Unable to hold my attention.  Jumped around a lot.
 Well written, carefully thought out. A provoking read.
 Bob Woodward's dedication to discovering and exposing vital informati on is legendary and appreciated. I have a feeling that there will be a second volume (at least) and will be even more important.
 Hard to turn your head away from a train wreck. What have we done?
 Reading it now. It is easy to read and should strike fear in EVERYONE!
 Exceptionally well written and researched. A must read for every American
 Not as good as the big build up, informative though!
 One of many books on the destruction caused by Trump
 Really great read. Well written, by a respected reporter.
 Good read.
 I had purchased this book half expecting a personal villification of the POTUS.  After reading it though, I found that it was  well researched, anecdotal, and interesting.  The final comclusion was not exactly what I had initially expected, but that made me appreciate the book all the more.
 i'm about 3/4 into the book and even i, a liberal democrat, couldn't believe all the incompetence and disarray going on in the white house.  of course those of us who follow the real news already know trump is very unqualified for the job and surrounds himself with other unqualified people.  but here are a few points in the book that did give me pause:<br/><br/>1. around the time james comey was fired by trump, the fbi was obtaining (or trying to) financial records of jared kushner and his family's dealings around the world.  ivanka would complain to her dad about it and then comey is abruptly fired.<br/><br/>2. h.r. mcmaster was in the oval office with trump when trump tweets out about the hillary clinton/ukraine debacle...and it was nothing but russian propaganda!  mcmaster couldn't believe trump would still put that out there even though it was false!  mcmaster would later tell other staffers he needed to quit.  trump also wouldn't listen to him and other military experts and just made military decisions how he wanted.<br/><br/>3.  when trump is running for the office, he honestly didn't know if you were a registered voter, your personal info (minus who you actually vote for) was public record.  steve bannon had to bluntly tell him when you register to vote, the gov't has your name, address, etc.  i mean, who doesn't know that??  and that trump himself rarely voted and would vote for democrats in the past to secure real estate deals in their cities and states.<br/><br/>4.  when trump 'hires' people to fill cabinet positions, esp. top ones, not only does he not pick the right people, he doesn't even conduct background checks!!  as long as they'll say yes to everything he does and says....!  when he fired someone or they quit, he'd even ask his secret service security on their advice on who should fill the spot.  i'm really surprised that mike pence (@ least so far where i'm in the book currently) didn't offer any input into any of this, but trump would often do things on the spur of the moment.  no wonder our country is so chaotic!!<br/><br/>but so far, pretty good read!  they should make a movie out of the book!
 Fantastic book about Trump. Gives you a whole new perspective!
 Scary and revealed an Adminisration in chaos.  Enjoyed the book, but left me wondering what could be next!
 Got it on time but must wait to read some ahead of it.<br/><br/>:o)
 Bob Woodward is a master investigator and writer.  This was a page turner.
 I can’t even look at Trump’s lying fat orange face. He makes me want to puke.
 Got it for my momma. It came brand new, thank you
 Gives insight to the man wielding all his power at this time
 Got this after all the recommendations to get it.
 This is a great, informative read.  Everyone should read it.
 Fear: Trump in the White House breaks absolutely zero new ground. Anybody who has been following the Trump trainwreck already knows everything they need to know about Donnie Small-Hands and then some (for instance, today's big news stories revolve around Stormy Daniels's allegations that Trump has a small mushroom-shaped penis, news that is also not very surprising in and of itself). Those who are part of the Resistance will find nothing fresh within these pages. Those who are Trump supporters will, of course, brush Bob Woodward's account off as little more than "fake news" and part of the on-going "witch hunt" within the media and the whole wide world at large.<br/><br/>Woodward's accounting, though, does lend further credibility to ousted White House staffers who have used their executive positions to pen their own tell-all novels, and further solidifies those stories published in legitimate mainstream press outlets (i.e. not Fox News). As half of the reporting team that took down Nixon, Woodward's reportage on the Trump administration is certainly welcome, as he is a credible voice, a reporter with a through-line of integrity that has been a member of the press for decades. His writing here gives us a fly-on-the-wall picture of life in Trump's Oval Office, quoting a number of administration officials such as Gary Cohn, Rob Porter, Lt. General Michael Flynn, Secretary of Defense James "Mad Dog" Mattis, Reince Preibus, and others. Woodward lets the words of these men tell the story, free of any colorful commentary or opinionated editorializing.<br/><br/>All of the principle players paint a strikingly similar portrait of Trump, and it's a familiar view, one that anybody who has been paying even the absolute most minimum amount of attention since the 2016 primaries would recognize. Trump is inarticulate, incurious, a compulsive liar, brash, addicted to Twitter, quick to anger, both wildly ignorant and profoundly stupid, unimaginative, and dead set in his ways. He's inflexible and unwilling to change his mind or opinions on anything, including his own deeply racist attitudes, as exhibited throughout his presidential campaign, again in the wake of the Charlottesville rioting, and yet again when discussing African nations, their inhabitants, and immigrants, as well as resolutely sexist. He has not a single shred of understanding of government, diplomacy, the military, or the economy. And, again, none of this news, nor is any of it surprising.<br/><br/>Because of the author's singular focus on the White House and its central players, Woodward forgoes any deeper examinations of Trump and his attitudes. Rather than an in-depth profile of the man who invented Birtherism conspiracy theories, we get the popular sketch version we see every day on the nightly news and live on Twitter. What we're told fits the common vernacular surrounding Trump, but there's never any attempt to dig deeper. Part of the sad thing (if one can ever manage to drum up anything resembling sympathy for such a rotten and disingenuous figure as Donald Trump), of course, is that any of Trump's own depth is merely skin-deep artifice. Simply put, there is nothing deeper to him. What you see is literally what you get. At the end of the day he's just another bitter, angry old man stuck in the past, sitting around watching Fox News and trying to convince everybody he's as great as he thinks he is, complaining about all the non-white men in the world. There's no question Trump thinks highly of himself, just as there's no question that his opinion is completely unfounded in fact. Facts, we know, are the one thing Trump hates perhaps more than anything, and his staffers routinely commiserate over how difficult it is to convince Trump of reality and how pointless it is for them to prepare daily briefings for him because he refuses to read anything .<br/><br/>So, is Fear worth reading? Honestly, I'm not entirely sure it is, particularly if you've already been following along since the oaf took his oath. It's a quick read, the writing breezy but plain, and Woodward certainly lives up to Christopher Hitchens's criticism of being little more than a stenographer to the stars. More than a year and a half into this national nightmare, Fear: Trump in the White House offers little in the way of actual news, and Trump's detractors will certainly find all of their worst suspicions and fears about the man confirmed. Trump's blind supporters, though, I suspect, aren't likely to ever bother reading this thing to begin with. The target audience, then, is simply the curious among us, those hoping to uncover revelations or maybe look back at the early days of this administration and chuckle knowingly to how things have played out since Jan. 2017. At one point, for instance, Trump is reported to have asked his staffers, responding to allegations in the Steele document, if he looks like a guy who needs prostitutes. I'm sure we all had our suspicions on that front, and, well, we definitively know the answer to that now, at least.
 Great book for reading about our crazy White House!
 Disappointed. Wasn’t what I thought it would be.
 puts into context all the nonsense you heard about.
 interesting to hear about the inside information
 Here is a respected observer . Cannot be ignored as fake news.
 Truly disturbing account of the Trump administration from a most respected reporter.
 I liked the directness of the reporting. Lord help us.
 Great book. If only 10% of this is true we are in trouble! East read too.
 Author is a very respected newsman. Sheds light on the man.
 Am expose into how the Trump White House works.
 Not much new, but helped put the events in order mainly and gave personnel present for the discussions.
 Woodward paints an excellent picture of the behind-the-scenes action in the White House. But readers should take note that many of the primary sources (Cohn, Porter, Dowd, etc...) are really working hard to portray themselves as the good guys despite their serious flaws.
 A must read but after it was published the hideous white house got worse.
 Excellent reporting based on personal interviews.  Very illuminating.
 Very well written, well documented and current look at the Current, troubling Presidency.  Easy to read and incitefull reporting by one of the best Reporters in  the business.
 No matter one's political leanings, this is must read!!!
 Riveting. Everything makes sense now! Must read.
 Trump seems to treat US allies as business customers. I firmly believe US allies like Kores is lot more important than business customers.
 It's okay. The writing style is kind of weird.
 Not sure what I thought I would garner from this read.  I get enough of this topic on the main stream news every day.  I wish I had saved my money because it's hard to stomach anymore of this unfortunate character.
 An exemplary piece of journalism. Feels like an objective inside look into an odd presidency. Bob Woodward treats this as any good journalist would.
 this is a good read.  good insight into the current whitehouse
 Authenic. I am 1/2 way through it and find it informative
 told the story that I already knew, a good and easy read
 I read it to learn what Woodward could tell us to explain what is actually going on in the White House. I thought it was excellent, as I have found this writer's books to be in the past. I couldn't put it down.  I would highly recommend it!
 A very scary book.  Gives you a lot of insight to the mind of Donald Trump.
 It wasn't as sensational as it was built up to be.
 Excellent, could not put down.  I really appreciated the in-depth cross verification of events.
 Excellent
 Woodward is such a good writer. Thoroughly enjoyed the book.
 Worth a read, but doubt it will change any minds.
 I loved every word of this book. It is all true!
 A terrific overview of Trump's first 18 months in the WH
 What can I say! I got the book and will read it. I give the five stars to the author!
 Extremely interesting, educational &amp; intriguing!
 Incredibly narrated. Objective and factual. Imprescindible reafing for current crazy times
 Very good, and very frightening account of what we all feared to be true in the White House and the detached from reality resident.
 My own understanding of the world..........
 Didn't tell me anything I didn;'t already know.
 Fear: Trump in the White House - good read.
 Detailed reporting on recent White House activities add color and substance to concerns over the current White House.
 Out of control thug not worthy to be called president.
 THIS BOOK SHOULD BE A MANDATORY READ FOR ALL THOSE WHO ARE SNOW-BALLED BY THE WORLD'S BIGGEST CONMAN.  PROVIDES ACCURATE AND HONEST INSIGHT TO THE WORST "ADMINISTRATION" (MORE LIKE NIGHTMARE) EVER TO OCCUPY OUR WH.  DEMOCRACY IS GONE AND REPLACED WITH A DEMAGOGUE DICTATOR.  MUST READ!!
 Another well researched book by the Master of the history of the American Presidency.
 Everyone should read this book. Our POTUS is not made of the stuff we need for our country.
 Mr. Woodward chronicles the inner working of the Trump White with an objective reporting style. The most informative aspect of the book, in general, is how the news reports the results of the White House's actions and Mr. Woodward gives the backstory.
 Nothing we hadn’t been told before, but Bob Woodward is excemplary and trust worthy.
 I’m just getting started but so far this reads quickly and is fascinating.
 Good insight into the beginning of the current administration. You can easily visualize people saying what they were quoted. I highly recommend it.
 Finally people  in and around  the White House are telling the truth  about the chaos happening  with this administration.
 I have read his 1st book on Nixon, and many since then. He has incredible sources and an ability to interview people with firsthand knowledge and turn that into an incredible read on history.
 I don't think i learned anything i didn't know but it scared the heck out of me.
 Our republic is under seige under current president
 Gave as a gift. Reader seemed to enjoy it.
 This book is boring just like the person it's about
 One of the best in understanding the Trump Circus
 Just started reading. Not far enough into it yet to comment.  Difficult time to understand and process all of what has happened and absorb it all
 I've only had it for one day. I think it is a must read for every citizen. Scary.
 Love Bob, writing, info, great. Will be good document for later in history..
 A must read book. Explains in detail what is happening.
 Show how unprepared tRump was to be president
 This book was interesting and well written. I was intrigued by a lot of the information that isn't public. It's a good read.
 Meticulously researched horror story.  Watch out Steven King .
 Shows the fear we should feel as long as he is President
 Great book and written by a trustworthy author. Right on.
 Made me appreciate our president even more
 Very insightful, from an author we can trust.
 Great Christmas gift for a history buff
 Item delivered timely and as advertised
 This book is a page turner. Worthwhile reading for all political wonks.
 Love Mr Woodward and respect him. Read his book in 3 days
 TV already quoted best parts, but Woodward is an exact writer with verified quotes
 the book was just a rehash of the news
 good book. I'm not a reader of books normally but this book kept my interest and I finished in a short period of time. Not a book for "FOX NEWS" viewers who believe in "TRUMPS" consistent lies.
 Everyone should read this book.  It's quite telling..
 Important work from an exceptional author
 May the future generations forgive us, but I know they won’t because what we did here is unforgivable. All of us.
 Eye opening and jaw dropping book. Very well researched and documented.
 When I finished this book, I realized the title was appropriate!
 Why are people still supporting the Donald?
 Amazing. The nightmare on the inside.
 The book was very well done and included a lot of detail about the inter-workings of the White House that the average person would never be aware of. Recommended for those who want to know more about President Trump.
 Bought as a gift, great value and came in perfect shape.
 It is hard to see this portrayal of the White House. A place which has been the bastion of Democratic leadership for the world at large for the last century has become lost.
 Bob Woodward is an excellent journalist. This did not disappoint me.
 Good read, author tells it like it is/was.
 I did gain some insight into the inner workings of this dysfunctional white house reading this book . Most of the focus is on the relationships between the staff members and between the staff and POTUS. Trump is just as awful as I have imagined. Well researched and written.
 Fact-based. Written to inform — not entertain.  Still, it was a very easy to read, shocking book.
 WASN'T THE GREAT TELL ALL I WAS EXPECTING.
 The entire bottom edges of the cover are broken and chewed up.
 As an ex Scot now living in New Zealand I found this a fascinating read with an insight into Trump's life at the centre of attention.  I have never forgiven him for riding roughshod over my fellow Scots to build his blasted Golf course near Aberdeen - hope it loses millions for him and his family .....
 Difficult to read, hence only 1/2 way thru
 A true and frightening look inside the Trump administration.
 Read this if you have no ability to think rationally!
 Woodward offers great insight into the chaos that is the Trump White House. My only complaint was that it ended. I wanted more!<br/>Highly recommend.
 must read for anyone who cares about this country
 I enjoyed the book very much although it’s frightening the reality of things
 Well written. VERY well researched. Full of actual conversations from Trump's inner circle and Trump himself.
 I only give five stars to all-time outstanding books such as Gone with the Wind.  Excellent books get four stars.<br/>This book earns five stars -- no question.<br/><br/>I have the hardcover -- purchased from a local bookstore -- and the Audible edition.<br/><br/>I won't spend time outlining the content.  Others here have done a great job doing so.<br/><br/>I do want to comment on reviews which question how Mr. Woodward was able to use exact quotations, since certainly most of what is quoted was not "recorded."<br/><br/>Of course, journalists do not often have recordings of what people say.  They rely on recollections, notations, and writings of witnesses and participants to make a "record" of what was said.  Good journalists and good writers follow these rules assiduously.<br/><br/>Mr. Woodward is a Pulitzer Prize winner and one of the best biographers of our time.  He has written 18 other books, many about American presidents.  All of his books have received the highest acclaim.<br/><br/>I hope reviewers won't trash this book because of their political views.  It does everyone a disservice to do so.<br/><br/>If this book does one thing it exposes the behavior of this president -- which is even more egregious than the way he behaves and the things he says in public.  Nixon thought he was above the law.  This book makes it clear that this president thinks he IS the law.
 Really good book! Scary to think the things that is happening in the White House under Trump.
 It says what i think a lot of people no and suspected
 Written way too early in Trump's presidency. Lacked usual analysis.
 An excellent work, clear and well-documented. Bob Woodward at his best.
 Very interesting book. Behind closed doors at Trump’s WH.
 It was an eye opening account of the volatility, the lack of concentration, the lack of empathy and heart, the remedial understanding of government and it’s operation, the heartless regard of people and their feelings, and the propensity to live a life of lies of the 45th, and most dangerous, President of the United States of America.
 Intensely researched, very scary book, well written.
 enlightening as well as frightening
 The book didn't tell me anything I didn't already know.
 Great book. My mon is now reading it. The book arrived quickly.
 Great book, disturbing subject matter.
 Fear is an amazing look at the Trump presidency.  It is eye opening even to me who follows news of this administration scrupulously.  It did take me a while to finish reading because I had to put it aside frequently as I digested just how bizarre is this situation.
 If you really want to know what is going on in the White House, READ THIS BOOK.
 Great book- so smart- too bad it’s about a really dumb guy
 Explained in detail the chaos, confusion, exasperation, and "walking through the looking glass" atmosphere that continually takes all the air of the White House.
 It was very informative, but it was scary to know what is really going on in the White House. Thank goodness there are a few people that try to curb his worst ideas, but I am afraid they will all leave
 If this is all true, we're on the edge of a constitutional crisis.
 This was a gift and it was very well received
 This book is not worth reading
 Great book, exposes what's happening in our country.
 Would not recommend this to my republican friends, but sometimes the truth hurts. (Sorry).
 Mr Woodward.  What else is to be said?
 It's a good book that is missing Mueller info.
 Gift for wife. She LOVED it.
 More proof that we elected a charlatan.
 This book would have been more appropriately called "Chaos". It's frightening to think about the lack of a policy, moral, or empathetic compass apparent in the man in the White House steering the U S. Titanic.
 A good read. as expected from Bob Woodward
 You won't be unhappy with this one...it was another great read.
 Factual and authentic without bias!
 I read "All the President's Men" when it came out, way back when!  This does equal that writing.
 Fascinating, well researched book.
 paints a great picture of a terrifying madman.
 Did not like dislike the man
 Scarey book.  Felt like a fly on the wall.  Chilling.
 Well written and meticulously researched.
 Love Bob Woodward’s book. Great reading. What we are hearing and what is really happening behind closed doors. Fear or a power struggle?
 Intimate and detailed presentation of the environment in the Trump White House. Bob Woodward is an authority on the subject, and it comes through in every page. Brilliantly written.
 idem as described, I found the book interesting and informative, I would deal with again
 A book that wrote itself.<br/>Nothing we. Didn’t alreDy know. Everything he says is a lie.  Everything he does is corrupt, and he lies about it.
 Great journalism, what one would expect from Bob Woodward.
 I enjoyed reading the different but seemingly same conclusions on Trump.
 The future of politicians who think this current situation of stupidity leading this country doesn't need to change is among those ranks!
 Informative and scary it reads like fiction but since it’s real it is extremely scary
 In-depth description of Trump's presidency
 "Just the facts, ma'am, just the facts..."  Sgt. Joe Friday
 why am I reviewing books?
 Every American should read this with an open mind!
 Bob Woodward wrote this withe same meticulous care he did with Bernstein during Watergate.  He quotes almost all the conversations like he was there with a recorder. You imagine yourself being there.  The  book is hard to put down.
 Book came on time. It is the page turner it promised to be (if you like politics). The author is credible to me and provides insight into how "flavor" of the current administration developed.
 As I read the first 3-4 chapters, I was surprised by the lack of criticism of Trump by Bob Woodward. The book read more like a documentary. Then I realized that is exactly what it is. The author doesn't need to give his opinion. The facts speak for themselves!
 This type of book are the kind of books that I would read. I expected to be bored. I was very surprised, I truly enjoyed reading this book it saddened me in a sense. Wow !  I recommend this book to everyone .
 I enjoyed the entire book. Read it in three days.
 Very difficult to get through this book. Not an enjoyable read at all. Woodward jumps around from topic to topic and there is no continuous timeline followed. There is no organized structure which makes for a difficult read. It doesn’t matter what the subject of a book is if it’s this difficult to get through. Very disjointed and disappointing.
 Well written and accurate tragedy of our Republic.
 don't know whether to laugh or cry.
 Enjoying this book immensely!
 Another book onvwhy we All should be scared to death by what one man in the WH has led this country to and through.
 I liked that it that it was up to date.
 Good book. Everyone should read it.
 Great book, so interesting couldn't put it down.
 A Woodward book in typical, well-researched Woodward fashion.  I fast read... not quite fast enough to keep up with the daily news.  Definitely provides insight into the mind of Trump.
 She was pleased. Fan of the author.
 This is not all anti-Trump.  Encouraging to know there are folks who really know what they're doing and why.
 I couldn't put this book down once I started to read it. Superb reporting. The details are fascinating and frightening.  If you liked "All the President's Men," you will love this one. Highly recommended.
 Too good to put down!
 Informative &amp; hilarious at the same time!
 I made the mistake of reading this book AND The Plot Against America at the same time.  Makes you want to slip under the covers &amp; just stay there.
 The Title says it all! We have much to fear of a Trump Presidency! Gross mismanagement in all phases of government!
 Excellent book, unique perspective
 Readable and some new information
 Trump is ruining our country
 I was just curious about the president that I don't like.
 Not as much info as I thought there would be.
 Excellent insight and credible source. Thank you Mr. Woodward!!
 Woodward's book details how the institutions of a democracy can be damaged by a president concerned only with self interests.
 Pretty good book. Well documented and I like the writing style.
 I read it like a book. Interesting
 Woodword is a great journalist.
 Ok.  Needs to have sources mentioned in the book but over a good read
 Every American should read this. BRING ON JOE BIDEN.
 Another great expose by Woodward!
 Interesting interactions in WH.
 I haven't read past the first chapter.  It's literally terrifying.
 Bob Woodward is  truthful.
 Very well written and informative.
 A scary introduction into the mess we are all living.
 First few pages at the beginning of the book are great. But rest of the book I’d say a fair read.
 This is news reporting not opinion.
 Trust the author completely.  Eye opening read.
 Very, very interesting. Fear for this country😁😁
 I have not finished reading the book.
 Fear the Liar-In-Chief
 frightening look at trump's mental state.  He really needs to be removed from office in 2019 by whatever means. He is an unstable  fascist dictator .
 I bought this for my political junkie husband.  He enjoyed reading it, but found that there was not much in the book he didn't already know.  It was just put together nicely.
 Very informative.
 Tells it like it is but too much like watching the news
 Too bad its true.
 I got scared reading this book. God help us.
 Another great job by Woodward!
 An important book that describes in detail the current dysfunction and bigotry in the White House. Indepth research and reporting provides a searing condemnation of Trump and many of the equally unqualified people with which he has surrounded himself.
 I didn't really learn anything new.  Seemed to be a rehash with more detail of the current news about Trump.  I have not finished reading it, because it did not hold my attention
 Tells the truth about our Liar-in-Chief!
 Well written although is not engaging, a bunch of facts with no context with the world besides the White House.it is very illustrative on the reality of power and manipulation.
 Great book. Tells the truth
 Great book.  I wish it wasn't true.
 recommended reading for all
 And the scariest part is it's true.
 Little gems amid the daily script.
 Basically this book confirmed all the rumors of dysfunction in the administration, the presidential temper tantrums, the lies, etc., that had been around for a long time.  But it also confirmed that there was at least ONE honest lawyer working there, and kudos to him for quitting.
 Everyone should read this book!
 Buy it like me if you hate republicans.
 Interesting to read.
 Great price. Cannot wait to read it 😎
 Reasonable price for an outstanding read.
 Oh my. . . . .
 As with all Bob Woodward books, Fear was very interesting and exceedingly timely.
 I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. Very disappointed in Woodward's effort.  Should appeal to the liberal left. Waste of my time and money.
 Predictable. Nothing that we didn't already know if you paid attention to the news.
 Trump actually comes out a little better than I expected but the title says it all about his approach to leadership.
 I have loved the writings of Bob Woodward since All the Presidents Men<br/>This book shows the best that journalism has to offer.<br/>Whether you are a Trump fan or not, a part of our political culture has been exposed brilliantly.
 Good book anti-orange enough said.
 I wish every person in Congress would read this!  I'm sure that every foreign leader has done so already!
 The author has great sources and presents info from sources that obviously were key players in the administration. I felt like the book was a little choppy, and maybe would have been best not to be chronologically organized.
 Very well written and well organized- easy to comprehend.
 The book does not break new grounds. Passages are repeated which leads to confusion whether Trump is bringing up previous topics or not.
 I’m up to Chapter 7.  Missing quotation marks abound.
 All adults should read “Fear”. Riveting!
 Well written book.
 Very thorough and thoughtfully written.  Filled with facts and data that we all should be aware of about our president.
 Another hit for Bob Woodward. Excellent...
 boy friend is enjoying this book
 All I can say is read it! Best yet!
 Great and frightening look into Trump World
 What Woodward obviously considers sensational, I consider ordinary. For example, Trump told the family of a serviceman killed in action that his team members thought very highly of him, but Woodward says that Trump had no proof of how those team members really felt about the slain serviceman. To me, that makes Woodward the bad guy, not Trump.
 Gave it to my son for his birthday.
 fascinating reading !
 Great book.
 Easier to read than all presidents man .. maybe because I know the actors.
 Terrifying description of Trump’s world.
 Highly anticipated and brilliant as expected.
 Accurate, and true to words.
 Factual but not sensational. Excellent.
 Read it in one sitting. Great book
 Amazing, frightful, and horrifying look into this person.
 As expected
 Easy read.
 Interesting read.
 If you weren't concerned before, you will be after you read this excellent account of our troubled times.
 EXCELLENT
 Satisfied
 The best of the Trump books!
 Good read.
 Unbelievable but I believe it , YOU HAVE TO READ THIS AND I TRUST THE WORDS IN HERE BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE IT IF YOU PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT IS GOING ON WITH TRUMP INSANE
 Good book but frightening
 Excellent book.
 Very interesting.
 Already knew info from tv
 This read may be difficult. The prologue was scary enough
 Not much new in the book
 Great book, glad I bought.
 Good reading
 Great insight on the present administration.
 Love the book
 Interesting, well written.
 I am looking forward to this read.
 Smooth, scary read! Woodward at his best!
 Great... the inside info
 Very well researched and written!
 Great journalism from a master.
 Very interesting and intriging
 Pretty much tells it like it is &amp; I don’t think it’s teally biased (I fact checked some if Woodward’s  statements &amp; they checked out).
 God help the USofA!
 Extensive research on the Trump White House
 Loved this book. It really gives insight into Trump’s personality and his ability to fulfill the office of president of the United States.
 Whine.
 Good and accurate
 A searing confirmation of everything Trump doen’t want us to know
 Perfect condition hard cover book
 Not what I expected
 Well written and informative
 Very impressive piece of journalism. It is truly incredible how much access the author has but then again he's been a Washington insider for four decades
 Fascinating and frightening
 Terrific book!
 This was an excellent read...Very informative from the Nation's #1 Investigative Journalist! A must read for ALL AMERICANS! AGAIN...Must Read!
 Readable, believable, well laid out.
 Great
 shows what a terrible mistake many voters made--- this country may never be the same
 Buy the book. The very last sentence in the book pretty much sums it up.
 Good
 gift
 An unbridled view....
 confirming all my worst fears
 telling as it is!
 Great
 Excellent read.
 Hard to read. He just seems to ramble along.
 Wow, well written and great read!
 perfect
 Tells it like it really is.
 Great read!
 Husband loved reading this!
 Nothing new here
 OK DRY
 Especially before the mid-terms
 You need to read this book by one of the great journalists of our time.
 Scary true brilliantly written!
 Good
 Thanks! Well written!
 Excellent book.  Lousy president.
 very good-
 "Fear Trump in the White House" is a must read. The coverage of Trump and Gary Cohn's interactions were especially fascinating since the amount of patience that Cohn has is astounding. It's like he's babysitting a 5-year-old.
 The wealth of information and references in this book are priceless. Absolutely worth reading, written like it was documented in real time.
 I thought the book gave a great overview of the Trump campaign/first year in the Whitehouse. I really enjoyed the chapters surrounding North Korea. It also helped me understand the key players for Trump. If you like politics/economics/law, you will like this book.
 Well written and great back stories.
 awsome!
 I appreciated being able to order this electronically, and receiving it the day it hit publication.  Wow!
 Great information about the current president!
 Scary but informative
 It's all true...just unbelievable.
 A well researched and referenced piece depicting the chaos in the White House. Woodward calls it like it is.
 Clear and transparent pic of trump
 Very fast read. You won’t be disappointed
 Ok
 😱
 Author tells it like it is. Perfect ! Behind the scenes of government.
 Great examination of the early days of the Trump White House. Many sections made me break out in a cold sweat.
 Interesting
 bought the book on kindle, before going on holiday so I would have something to read, well, It was not readable on my amazon fire, so I ended up buying the book a second time.
 GOOD BOOK!
 Hilarious and terrifying
 Wow. Disturbing and exhausting. Appreciate the info from a dedicated journalist.
 So this is a great book.
 one of the first to own it
 A riveting read, and filled in some of the blanks for me understanding what has been taking place behind closed doors.
 Great expose' of the current white house.
 A must read
 Incredibly insightful and compelling read. This provides counter views and insights into several Trump White House players that have never been shown elsewhere.
 Good book
 Good read for those who don't follow the political news daily.  Nothing really new or revealing that hasn't already been in print or TV.  I believe Woodward is spot on, but also think there is much creative lee-way in the book's alleged reported and quoted conversations.
 Excellent read.
 Well written.
 Haven't read it yet but sure it will b good
 I was struck with the paucity of empathy o the president’s part. Also, he is totally ignorant of history, of the need for diplomacy, and of economics on a macro level. It is obvious that he only thinks of himself!
 Good read, bad president!
 This book shows that Trump is no good for our country.  He is a lying, racist blow-gut with a vulgar mouth. He is greedy for money and power.
 An excellent, thought provoking insider’s view of a chaotic administration that never should have happened.  The book is well sourced and written.  The writing is not didactic. Mr Woodward presents the facts and allows the reader to draw his own conclusions.
 Good book
 Must read!
 Interesting book
 Delivered as promised.
 Saved money on this popular book. Arrived quickly.
 Terrific writer!!
 Get it.
 Yikes
 Disturbing true!
 Great read about the first years of the  Trump admistration.
 Loved it!
 Probably the best documented report in many year.<br/>Who what where when and why shown and documented time and again
 Must read if you really want to know what is driving this administration.
 It is scary
 OK
 Excellent read.
 I’ve been keeping up with the news so there was nothing I did not know
 scary
 Great read
 I had no idea.
 great book
 Outstanding read.
 great read
 Trump doesn’t have a clue about leadership and is imploding.  White House.has never been 8n a greater state of chaos. It’s nothing more than an arena for political gladiators
 It is written to appeal to men. It's informative, but not my type of literature, however I have learned a significant amount of new details. Perhaps I will re-evaluate it when our time is not so filled with anger.
 A compelling and sometimes frightening journey into trumps mannerisms and diabolical mind....!!
 Great price and shipped to arrive on first day available. Very pleased.
 A well balanced write, although I thought it was a bit to fair.
 Self reading
 Sad to read about the state of our government, especially the President, but important to have the facts as only Woodward can clarify them.
 I bought all the books about the corrupt fool in the White House
 Truthful and insightful
 Did not know what to expect when I bought this book, but it is the funniest book by far. A must read.
 true opening
 I'm a Bob Woodward fan, and this book doesn't disappoint.
 Great “ rest of the story “.  I was surprised by effectiveness of his campaign strategy
 Scary content<br/>Great contribution
 good book
 Slow read but good
 woodward comes through again with the quality expected from him.  anyone who reads book and still favors president is missing the boat!
 Great read, reconfirmed a dumb and self centered individual holding the WH
 Awesome book
 I love this book. It is so thoroughly researched. It put pieces of the puzzle together to allow me to see the whole picture.
 Great book
 Great
 Great
 Great book.
 XLNT
 Loved reading
 Good book
 What a joke of a POTUS
 Very disappointed was more about research than results.
 Great inside into the WH
 Informed and well written. We should be afraid.
 it was a good read.  One question "how did her get all the information about government matters?"
 Well written and worth reading
 Ahh Donald what a little baby blunderbumble you are. Read if you want to feel all hope fade to nothingness.
 Read this
 Gave as a gift
 If any of this is true or close to true the country is in deep trouble. I have been concerned about the president’s mental abilities. I’m more concerned than ever now.
 Good. Will recommend it to friends and families.
 Incredible detail of inner White House craziness. Have to wonder with all the smart people in USA how they came up with this knucklehead.
 I have respected Bob Woodward since his work in the 70's. We need more journalists like him. This book offers insight into the insanity that inhabits our White House these days. I would recommend this to anyone interested in politics, history or current affairs.
 Told the world about the truth of trump and cohorts
 I can trust this book to be very informed and true.
 Another brilliant book by Mr. Woodward.
 Very well written, easy to read and understand, and very insightful! Bob Woodward at his best!!
 I wanted it to keep going! It ended in March 2018 &amp; there is so much more every day!  Keep writing...I would keep buying
 Ripped from the headlines
 A) You'll learn nothing new.<br/>B) The narrative has a flat affect -- hard to believe the author feels "fear" at all.  Should have titled it "Bore."<br/>C) Time for Woodward to pack it in and let the new generation have a go at it.
 Very well written good story telling
 The last line of the book sums up everything therein. No one is brave enough to be honest with POTUS 45, who is a “f&amp;@%*g liar.”  The perpetual chaos in the White House, as reported by Mr. Woodward, recounts a sad moment in history.
 Just started the book.
 What a bunch of buffoons!
 Its what i thought would be the truth.
 This book tells it like it is, and is frightening to read.
 Well written &amp; documented
 Interesting and easy to read.
 Great book!
 Outstanding book. Helps youbput all the pieces together
 I liked the quotes from actual people who worked for Trump!
 An authoritative account of the functioning of the Trump White House which I found to be a bit dry: "these people did this, those people said that".
 The book kept me invested in it.
 It was a good read, not the expose I was expecting.  Did reaffirm my knowlege of this man, who in my opinion is not fit to be President of our Great Country.
 Well sourced. Summed up in Trump's philosophy that "fear is power".  Just think about that and how he approaches everything.  Well worth your time.
 LOVED THIS BOOK.
 Intriguing look into White House behind-the-scenes, with a different viewpoint of many players in today’s political environment.
 Haven’t read
 A fascinating and gripping read. Alas, the real story, thus begun in these pages, is sadly nowhere near its true end, giving us all the more reason to be very concerned.
 Thanks
 It's just nice to have a ridiculously well documented and sourced confirmation of everything we already know.
 Great book about a POS occupant of the WH
 Good read.  Woodward's style makes political history read like a novel and is amazingly fair-minded.  Very thorough and quite informative.
 Great condition and so far a great book.
 Great read!!
 Good book
 I am airing out the book in the backyard to hope the smell goes away.
 Thank you!
 Good read
 I own one
 Fair
 Good behind the sceens  of the tRump nightmare descending upon our Country... Hitler had his followers and we know how that ended!
 Great gift
 OK.
 made me discouraged that we the people will find a way out of this mess
 I have been waiting to read this
 Well-written, a must read for anti-Trumpers.
 Good read
 It's a book!
 Very illuminating
 What a book, from a great writer.
 I started to read this but I'm saving it for after this administration leaves office. It's a horror story that is real and it disturbed me too much to finish it now.
 This book was a gift and he likes it a lot!
 A good book for understanding the chaos in the Whitehouse and Trumps moronic ( a word?) behavior.
 God help us, he really is as stupid inside of the White House as he is at his little rallies.  I can not wait for Part 2, Cuffed And Stuffed.
 Interesting read.
 Good read!
 It shows how we are all humans. But this does not help when you think about the guy who is running the world
 Yikes!  We are in trouble.
 It was OK! Or maybe I expected more!
 See above. Any further would only reiterate information that has been presented above. Dislike being required to be more repetitious
 I like Bob Woodward. I've read several of his books. I admire the fact that he's fair-minded and ethical. I'm confident that he  would never shade the truth to make a better story. You can trust every word in this book because Woodward has a proven record for accuracy.<br/><br/>That being said, this is a dull book. There are a few eye openers and you probably heard about them in the news the week before it was published. They're interesting, sure, but there are not enough of them to make a book. This could have been a magazine article. To make it book length, there is a lot of padding.<br/><br/>The padding wouldn't be so bad if Woodward had a more engaging writing style. Woodward's vocabulary doesn't rise above 4th grade level and every sentence is just plain and simple. Unlike "All The President's Men" and "The Final Days," this book can go on for page after page with no drama, no insight, no nothing. It's a pain to get through. Woodward is a good reporter but not a good writer.<br/><br/>If you want good writing, read Michael Wolff's "Fire and Fury." He's highly gifted and he writes beautifully. But unlike Woodward, we have no idea how much he stretched the truth.<br/><br/>There are a couple of things I picked up from this book that I didn't know. First of all, Steve Bannon is a really bright guy. He's not the alt-right clown some people think. I don't like the guys political views, but he sure is smart. Second, I didn't know that Rob Porter's role in the White House was so important. It's unfortunate he had to leave. He's one of the sane ones. Third, I didn't realize that about 9 out of 10 people working in the White House view Trump as an incompetent goofball. I knew that some did. I didn't know that just about everybody did.<br/><br/>So, if you get the book and start reading it and you find that tears are welling up in your eyes from boredom, well, you're not alone.
 Woodward has a long history of writing credible accounts of the use (and abuse) of power. The narrative would be strengthened by more direct sourcing.
 Quick read
 My god it is true what I thought was going on with the President of the United States of America. The people that should read this book won’t unfortunately.
 What happens when a narcissistic game show host with brass balls &amp; no brains is elected President. A jaw dropping &amp; frightening account of the Trump White House.
 Excellent and well researched by Bob Woodward. It’s like you’re a fly on the wall listening in and witnessing the scary dysfunction in Trump’s White House.
 I wanted to just continue to read about the dysfunction and «madness» that continues to reign in the WH. Though mr T has some resonnements that may be understsbdabel, most is not - and that is the prominent factor of his «presidency».
 Lots of information but it didn't hold my interest very well.
 One of the main problems is that this book is boring because all the scandalous bits were pre-released.  I did *not* expect this book to be boring.  The book is chronological but lurches from episode to episode, depending on who Woodward had quotes from to use.  Oddly punctuated,  without quotation marks in many cases.  Trump actually comes off as more compassionate than I gave him credit for in some situations.  Maybe sentimental is the better word.  The main theme is not Trump's wickedness but his  lack of understanding about practically everything.
 Shows Trump to be the despicable person he is
 Bob Woodward's scrupulous fact based writing style makes this book an education of what really goes on in the Whitehouse and effort it takes to contain Trump. The book could not be better titled.
 All of it
 It came in perfect conditions.
 interesting novel
 It is a gift.
 We are living in a historic and terrible times for the rule of law
 Couldn't wait to read it
 The information seems unreal but we can see the effect of the decisions taken inside very clearly. It is amazing that a journalist could have access to the place and describe it so vividly
 Good book , as I expected.
 It was an intense read.  One of the scariest books I have ever read.
 The book scared me, making me realize that the Trump presidency is actually worse than I feared. The best interests of the country no longer matter, either to the president or to the Republican party.
 A “MUST READ”, hard to put down.
 Honest inside look at our President
 Really highlights human characteristics of a person and administration that most people see as cariacture. Whether you adore or despise this administration, a fascinating read and visceral view of the White House as it is today.
 Lacked any new material.
 What I enjoyed the most about this book is that it's the story behind the scenes. We see  stuff in the press everyday. (i.e. The short version), but this was the long version. Loved it
 A fast read that paints a detailed and accurate picture.
 I was really disappointed with​ this book. Nothing I couldn't have heard on CNN or MSNBC.  Every political pundit has discussed what he wrote. No profound text found here.
 Woodward shows his lifelong skill for research and detail. Although it takes place in the present, he clearly saw his job as historical documentation of our time.
 Interesting perspective supported by investigative reporting.  Bob Woodward is beyond reproach with his research and factual reporting.  It's worth the time to read.
 Ok reading. Just a rehash of news reports.
 Lots to take  in.  Makes you worry for the USA.  Thought provoking and hits a nerve.  Almost unbelievable yet the times we are in.
 Great book to truly understand how much of a moron this president really is...
 Very insightful book. Made me take another look at this president. I now have a better understanding of his obnoxious behavior.
 This is a must read in understanding our president. Written by a trusted author who can be believed. Donald Trump is portrayed as a really terrifying man.
 Real news, fake president. I am tired of the rhetoric and happy to hear from a man who handled his job with truth, respect and decency. He had nothing to gain or lose by being a real journalist. Thank you Bob Woodward!
 Some parts
 It is a good read.
 It is a new book
 I couldn't put this book down. Read the entire book in 2 days. At a time when disinformation has taken over our country, it was refreshing to read the truth. Making sense of what otherwise has been a sad time in our country.
 I received both the printed version of this book and the CD recording.  I did not want the audio recording.  There was no paperwork or return label, etc. in the box  How shall I return the audio book.  I want to keep the printed copy.  Thank you
 Intensely researched, behind the scenes gems and beautifully organized. The corruption, cruelty and ignorance of Donald Trump is breathtaking. I’m grateful this book exists to shed light on the truth and pick apart the complex lies.
 Bought it for my husband. He really enjoyed it. Great read.
 Informative
 The real truth about our current government. Well documented for authenticity.
 Great
 Soooooo very good!  Bob Woodward doesn't command all that respect for nothing.  He's the best!
 Thank you, perfect
 It seems to be excellent journalism.
 Bob Woodward has done it again! Excellent book on what goes on inside this White House. Recommend to anyone who wants to hear from those who have worked with this president and why we should all be worried.
 Enjoying this book, though it scares me that this man is in our country's highest office.
 Interesting
 I cancelled this Amazon order because my "great on Kindle" credit of $6.41 wasn't applied to this purchase, as expected.  Now the credit has expired.
 There is not a page that is boring  Compliments to the author for his under cover work; and, writing style.
 Moderately interesting , not mr Woodward’s finest , but, readable.particularly  for those of us not being impressed by the president .
 Dislike subject matter, but it told the truth.  Waiting for installment from Mueller
 scary behind the scenes look- not sure what to believe
 No comment, I'm a Democrat.
 Love Bob Woodward!!  Hard to put this book down!!!
 This is everything my wife hoped it to be. She says it sheds new light on those people around Trump and the president himself. Great, fair description of the most historic time in America since Watergate
 excellent
 Very detailed report on the mismanagement of the White House under Trump. Some very unnerving situations which put our country and the world in peril.
 Wow is all I can say.
 this is a good book.  note: reading this may make you sleep less well.  Every one who voted for Trump should read this!
 Interesting but no new information
 Not overly in depth and not much I really did not all ready know or suspect but Woodward is always fun, tells the story and lets the reader decide for themselves.
 When the check and balance system seems to be failing to keep the Republic and the democracy as they were intended,  we should be thankful that some members of the press are here to reveal how elected officials are behaving and acting on our behalf.
 A great book that everyone should read. Really makes one think, why in the world did we elect Trump to be the leader of our country.
 Detailed narrative about the goings on in the White House headed by the most dysfunctional President in the history of the United States.
 I found this book enlightening about the back story to Trump's  White House.  All of the players are there -- Manafort, Cohn, Mattis, Mueller, Comey, Kushner, and others.
 Well written.
 Very interesting to hear about the inner workings of the trump administration. So much more has happened since this book was released and it makes it such a better read.
 Informative!
 It’s truly scary to see what is happened in the White House. It appears as though our president has the attention span of a gnat and his actions, words and deeds are destroying our republic.
 I highly recommend to read this book to anyone. Well written and after reading it you will have a better understanding how Trump thinks and how he makes his decisions.
 Read several Woodward books. Never disappoints.
 Book arrived bent and fingerprinted white substance smeared on the covers. Do not recommend.
 Brutal honesty
 One of the best books I have ever read, you get hitched from Page 1. An absolutely must read for those interested in how things are done in White House.
 Insider info that will confirm what is so obvious: trump is the most corrupt, worst president ever and is incapable of telling the truth!
 I loved the book.  I read it twice and loaned it to a family member.  The book was thorough. Exactly what we would expect from Bob Woodward.
 Exactly what I expected very good
 Fascinating reading depicts every level of corruption between Donald J Trump and his associates.
 Incisive account of the chaotic Trump White House. Lots more to horrify and appall than has been recounted by the TV pundits.
 Interesting
 This book proves that my knowledge of Mr.<br/>Trump is correct which scares the living day lite out of me.
 Great read!
 Good info, well quoted, I enjoyed it.
 Great
 Eh, confirmation of what we already knew. Nothing new here.
 Woah, just read it. It is very well detailed and I'm wondering why so much of the book is in quotes
 Would not recommend.
 Excellent and scary as hell.
 Such a huge buildup to sell the book, but nothing new or shocking as was advertised
 Impeccably researched. Very very scary. Don’t read before sleep.
 Fascinating read. Insight into how people are elected in the US.
 Great read
 Bob Woodward once again delivers a great inside look of a President.<br/>During these difficult times, it is greatly appreciated to have a voice of reason.
 As usual, Mr. Woodward  was very thorough and he presented the facts as reported  in the news and personal interviews which he conducted with key players in a most clarifying manner.
 Is this what our administration is about??  Another disappointment
 Scariest book in the world.
 Awesome book! Thoroughly enjoyable. Detailed, well researched and, as always, a page turner. Bob Woodward has captured the craziness of Trump without all the harsh politics.
 Everyone should read this book.
 Good read. Similar to the headlines. Most interesting part is at the back of the book. Interviews and other information about how he talked to people.
 Great insight
 Well written and informative..  scary.
 Bob Woodward is all you need to know.
 A great read; amazing and intriguing insight in to the Trump administration. Wish Bob Woodward could provide us a book like this after each year of the administration. I’d buy in a heartbeat.
 Love it.
 Great book!
 The depth and detail behind the research is nothing short of amazing. It is sad that President Trump's advisors and staff see what he does not.  We will see what the future holds for this presidency.
 Insightful, informative, objective. The best Trump book ever by now.
 There's nothing new here...if you've been following the news of the day you already knew the stuff in this book. I must say I was a bit disappointed. I found some of this a bit hard to swallow. Bob Woodward has a pretty good reputation, but I'm not this one passes the smell test. Basically it was like reliving a nightmare....to much repetition.
 I read this book because I believe the author writes the truth.  I found this book to be captivating from beginning to end.  I just could not imagine how inept the president is.  The information was really scary.
 Frightening
 As I read this book I was overwhelmed by the details discussed of what were private conversations. I’m convinced the authors are reliable.<br/>Very interesting reading!
 This arrived at my house on Wednesday and I finished it on Friday afternoon. When I wasn't working, I was reading this. Only a few books a year have the kind of power to push everything else in my life to the side - this does.<br/><br/>If you are reading this, then you know about Bob Woodward's history with the Washington Post, reporting on President Nixon, reputation for research and books on other Presidents. When this book was released and President Trump and his surrogates complained, members of both the Bush II and Obama administrations released statements attesting that Woodward uses multiple sources, never makes stuff up, tapes many of the interviews and is completely trustworthy. In this heightened time of partisan political fighting and slandering opponents, a potential buy of this book should feel extremely confident that these events all happened.<br/><br/>The book covers the period from when Trump won the Republican nomination in the summer of 2016 until Jim Dowd resigned in March of 2018. Interactions with numerous cabinet members and staff are described in stories that range from one paragraph to ten pages. Woodward moves the story along chronologically, with only the occasional flashback in order to give important background or context.<br/><br/>1) Senator Graham clearly spoke on the record, as he is quoted numerous times. Many of his conversations with President Trump were when they were by themselves, so it would be nice to have had Trump's version of the conversations. Graham has worked hard to paint himself as a friend of the President, but also one that gives him candid advice.<br/><br/>2) Kelly and Mattis do appear, but not nearly as much as one would expect. The times they are quoted are when there are many other people in the room. This book echoes the media in that Kelly initially had some influence over Trump but was eventually sidelined. Mattis comes across as extremely competent and is probably the only person who is able to largely stay out of controversy that continually swarms about the administration.<br/><br/>3) Gary Cohn and Rob Porter provided a lot of the information for this book. It is obvious that once people left the White House, they were far more willing to talk. Cohn's role in the White House was far more important than the public realized. He fought with Trump and other staffers and officials constantly. After Trump, he is the central character of this book. Personally and politically, Cohn is the character that I found the most reasonable. Rob Porter left the White House after it was revealed that he punched both of his ex-wives while he was married. He was  universally regarded as bright and competent within the White House and aligned himself with the other officials (Cohn, Mattis, Tillerson) that tried to rein in the President's worst instincts and reactionary plans.<br/><br/>4) Neither Spicer, nor Hicks, nor Sanders appear in this much at all. If any of them did speak with Woodward, it was only for deep background and they refused to be quoted. I was hoping that Scaramucci would have been written about, but he only earned a lone paragraph. As a character, he is among the very best that Trump has produced, but Woodward decided to pass.<br/><br/>5) Ivanka and Jared come across as poorly informed busy bodies that constantly complicate matters because of Trump's affection for them. It appeared that no one in the WH, other than Trump, respected their opinions or abilities.<br/><br/>6) HR McMaster appears a lot. By this account, he tried to be dutiful to Trump but felt he was sidelined by Tillerson and Mattis. According to multiple sources, Trump never clicked with McMaster.<br/><br/>7) Rex Tillerson is a surprisingly interesting character. He clashed with Trump immediately and rather than build up the state department with various deputies (he has claimed that the people he wanted were blocked by the administration), he took on much of the duties himself, thereby making State less effective. Tillerson definitely called Trump a "f..... moron" in front of at least  a dozen people. He also had harsh words with staffers like Miller.<br/><br/>8) Conway and Pence don't appear much at all in this. Woodward reports that Pence was ready to step in as the nominee after the access Hollywood video with Condi Rice as his running mate. I'm surprised that this hasn't gotten more traction in the press. Pence avoids the limelight, almost never breaks with Trump and is clearly biding his time for the 25th Amendment, impeachment, death or his own run in 2020 or 2024.<br/><br/>9) Jim Dowd, the President's personal lawyer who worked on the Mueller investigation, spoke in depth with Woodward. He is directly quoted over and over. His statements are damning. And fascinating.<br/><br/>10) Steve Bannon dominates the first half of the book. Because he resigned/was fired in August of 2017, he largely disappears after that. But he is everywhere up to that point. He also spoke a lot with Woodward, and is quoted over and over. He is clearly very smart. His retrograde views on issues like women and immigration are on full display. He is a good strategist and his harsh judgements, unfiltered manner and brains make him the best character in this book.<br/><br/>You get the point. It's a great book. Wonderful political writing. It is unbalanced in that it relies on some perspectives far more than others, with a heavy tilt towards those that have left the White House.
 Buen insight, buena prosa, buenos retratos. No mucha sustancia. La inevitable sensación de incompleto. Excelente investigación. Recomendable para el que sigue las noticias diarias.
 Really enjoyed reading of the behind scenes happing at the White House by an unstable president.
 Excellent writing and vivid depiction of the Chaos Presidency.  The vignette style, jumping  in and out of topics and storylines underscores the feeling of chaos that pervades this book (and all our lives these last few years).
 Good book.
 The title is misleading.  I tried to read the book but it was poorly written.
 This is real journalism not a gossip book. If you are looking for satire or comedy this is not for you. It chronicles real events and shows how our president lacks understanding of and the desire to perform his important duties.
 Help, to validate earlier reporting, so useful in this regard. However, the anonymous attribution of quotes is less-than-optimal (as is always the case with Woodward).
 Have no review...never could get the download.  Need to credit any charges to my account.
 Halfway through and it a great book
 The book was the great. I ordered the audiobook. My only regret was that Bob Woodward didn’t do the audio himself. Otherwise it was a great read.
 Superb and riveting reporting.
 Bob Woodward has done it again, but he has also found a very appropriate title. However I still find him extremely objective and thorough.
 Great book.  Can't put it down
 Great product
 Very disappointing rehash of details on a president we already knew shoots from the hip with little understanding of foreign policy. Bob Woodward has let us down; nothing new here.
 The litanyof documenting the crazy, the irresponsible and the outrageously petty.<br/>Who do these clowns think they are?
 Whoa ! If only a portion of this is true it is FRIGHTENING!<br/>Read it as a recap of current events.
 This is a well written book, one that cannot be put down until finished.  The ending of the book speaks volumes.
 Very well researched and written account of the Trump years thus far. Sources are clearly spelled out and indexed. Author tries to be even-handed.
 Bob Woodward confirmed all the fears and frustrations I have held since that 2016 election. Too bad we as a nation must endure the disfunction in the White House for at least two more years
 Private behind the scenes details of two plus years of public new, fake and otherwise. A national nightmare being defined
 While the book provided important insights into Trump and his White House, it was a hard read because of the choppiness of the writing. It was a hard read because of the disengaged writing.
 Well, we need a new leader.  That’s obvious
 Bob W. Is a great research journalist.
 Great read
 Its Bob Woodward.  It's revealing and matter of fact.
 Great books - everyone should read<br/>If even 1/2 of it is true America needs to wake up !
 Expertly written.  I was definitely fearful after reading this book.
 History will not be kind to this administration. This is a great historical account of the first two years.This is a recommended read for everyone.
 It’s nothing different than cnn
 A thoroughly well documented expose of trump--I expected nothing less from Bob Woodward.
 Good book
 ok. the news it broke has been reported in media now. not something I would reread
 I actually was a little disappointed. Was not expecting a play by play report. I needed a more personal opinion to enjoy it. But having said that, I'm glad I read it.
 Liked the intelligence of most of the attorneys<br/>Disliked the very bad language of a few!<br/>Read it...you need to know what goes on in our house!
 A very insightful and credible account that will be essential to historians evaluating the Trump era.
 Another Great book by Bob Woodward of this scary Trump presidency.
 Woodward does a GREAT JOB!
 A little biased but good.
 Rumors and innuendo.  Alleged mis-truths and apparent lies.  Could he really be this bad, his crazy ,this inappropriate, this dumb?<br/>I feel after reading this low key and intelligent book by one of America's most credible journalists, that indeed, Donald Trump is every bit as bad as I'd feared.
 Very enlightening, So true, not hard to believe.
 I bought this for my husband, he cannot put the kindle down!
 "Fear," the book by Bob Woodward is another one of his great literary accomplishments.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading all the research and honesty that flowed throughout the book.
 For my personal reading.
 Still reading.....
 nicely produced first edition.
 Engaging read, hard to put down.
 A book very well written.  I trust Mr. Woodward for telling the truth of what really is happening.
 Great Book!!! Very detailed....
 Was shipped quickly and was as described.
 I had a feeling that things were chaotic in the White House with Trump in there, and this book confirms it.
 Great author, great read!
 It was just what I expected. Well written.
 I found some of the information interesting, and some frightening.  It certainly documented to chaos that is the Trump administration.
 Detailed, well written facts about the craziness happening in the White House. Gives insight to the corruption and incompetence of Trump. Thought he could just print more money and problems would be solved. Excellent book by 2x Pulitzer winner
 Everyone should definitely ready this book!
 Understanding how we got "here" , what can we do to avoid problems in the future
 Bob Woodward put together a critical document of a White House in disarray and a person in charge who is unfit to lead and a threat to democracy
 Fascinating read. Very troubling. Well documented. Learned a lot about world politics and current events. I hope there will be a sequel!
 great read by an all time great reporter
 This book lives up to its name.
 Woodward clearly explained the nuances behind events I was hearing on TV. It has made following the media much more enjoyable now.
 Typical book on the 45th president.
 good read
 Excellent price and response time.  Very interesting book,
 Fab to listen to in car.  Made sense.
 While startling, and unbelievable, you can tell this was written with care and accuracy. Amazing view of the dysfunction in the nation’s house.
 This was an amazingly well written book. But, that’s what you expect from a Bob Woodward book. I would recommend this to anyone looking for the truth in regard tho the Trump presidency.
 Just what I thought a Trump presidency would be like
 Great in depth reporting. If you want to know what’s going on in the Trump White House Read this book.
 Not even sure why I bought it, other then the urge to read some juicy bits on this LUNATIC!  who somehow squirmed his way into the Oval swamp.  I've only read a few paragraphs randomly.
 I had to get some sleep last night or I would have finised this book in one sitting. I have admired and respected Bob Woodward since Watergate. He is a methodical and ethical seeker of truth and the picture he paints of Trump is both believable and frightening. In fact “fear“ is the emotion I came away with and apparently the emotion Trump is proud to evoke.<br/>Trump gave some advice to a friend who had acknowledged bad behavior toward women: ”Real power is fear. It’s all about strength. Never show weakness. You’ve got to deny anything that’s said about you. Never admit.”  If you don’t read all of it at least jump to the last page and read lawyer John Dowd’s assessment of the president of the United States. Chilling!
 Basically nothing new here. We have an idiot in the Whitehouse.  This however comes from a more credible source.  Bob Woodward is a respected author
 Oddly, my overwhelming emotion after reading Fear is: Profound Pity.  What an amazingly flawed human being President Trump is.  What a disaster of a president.
 None at the moment.<br/><br/>Why am I required to post a feedback?  I am 81 yrs old and don’t want to provide a feedback
 Great unbiased book
 Awesome book!<br/><br/>tick-tock, tick-tock<br/><br/>The lead Moron Villain in this book will probably implode over his Wall of Shame.
 A definite must read for anyone that wants a beginning understanding of where the country is today. Woodward comes through again in the way only he can.
 Very well written about a terrifying reality.
 Only Bob Woodward could and would write a book like this which is true to his incredible values for the truth.
 Fear is interesting to read and at the same time I find myself dishearten by what I'm reading. The only dislike is the book jacket was torn.
 Took me awhile to get through, most was what I had already known.
 So far so good
 Absolutely terrifying that this moron and his band of sycophants are running the US.
 It confirms what I believe is the real Trump
 I would recommend this book too anyone in college majoring in poly sci. Lets be honest and direct and get straight to the point.  I loved it no sugar coating here.
 Wife loved it!
 excellent
 No spoilers.
 Clear and insightful....helps to put all the puzzle pieces together into a picture...albeit a scary picture. Helps us to all realize we should never elect such a man ever again.
 It was a thorough look at all the players and the web they wove. Slow at times, by that’s the price you pay for such a comprehensive book. Overall spectacular piece of journalism
 Good insight into the chaos at 1600.
 Well written. I believe factual and informative.  It's a horror story with a crazy man as president.
 I think Woodward has hit the spot, he unveils Trump for the sham he is.
 I have great respect for Bob Woodward but no new revelations. I would have hoped for $14.99 that there would have been more than 65% of text and new information
 Good read
 The truth
 Great book about an awful President.
 I was pretty disappointed in this book.  Told me nothing I hadn't heard at one time or another in terms of how this guy operates.  Some of the information seemed to be pretty sensitive in terms of its impact to international relations, without really doing more than just proving this guy is as crazy as I feared.  Beyond that, this felt like volume 1, released in a hurry without a good editor to clean it up, in order to get it out the door before elections.  I would hope they fix a lot of the apparently missing sections in a second edition.  About half the book is devoted to footnotes, which I didn't read.  In the Kindle edition, none of those were marked, so it would have been insane trying to figure out which paragraphs they referred to.  I thought I was halfway through the book, when all of a sudden it just ended.<br/><br/>I think if you've spent the last three years with your head in the sand you might learn something, but not if you've been keeping up.
 Hey Bob? As if there was any question...you still got it, sir😉. Loved this book
 Great insights into the inner workings of those trying to maintain some stability.
 The title is appropriate.  This book is truly frightening - a detailed look at our dysfunctional White House.
 still reading it, easy to follow
 I have not finished the book yet but it is excellent - confirms what I<br/>knew and tells me things I didn't know.
 Very informative, well narrated. Affirms my feelings about the current management in the White House.<br/>I will definitely recommend this book to my relatives and friends.
 The book was for information/entertainment.  The validity of the information was special.
 If you want to be frightened about what is going on at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Get this book
 Have now read yet but expect it to be a page turner
 A sign of our times get out and vote blue
 To follow Trump attitudes, always doing what is convenient for himself, does not matter the others.
 The book is based on hundreds of hours of interviews with first-hand sources and provides an in-depth, probing account of Trump's thoughts and decisions
 Great book.
 Fascinating, in-depth writing.  I couldn’t put it down; I read it obsessively in a few days, barely slept.  It was that gripping.
 Fascinating!
 Must read! Be informed and resist!
 Our Captain is mad.
 It was more about the campaign than about the White House. Not Woodward's best by a long shot
 Didn't have much that I didn't already know from TV
 I consider Bob Woodward a very credible journalist and reporter. The topics in this seem to be well researched and put together.
 All of these reporter's that have been documented in the book cannot be wrong!  Every American should read it.  Then vote!!
 Good read
 A must read for those who are living in America
 Overall I was disappointed
 This “man” is every bit as scary as we all think. Great reporting from Mr Woodward . Great read for those who are not adverse to facts.
 I recommend this book to everyone could not put it down loved the amount of research that went into this book.
 Factual,believeable, well sourced. Confirms and more my opinion of what goes on in the White House. Bob Woodward has done great  work on this book, not that I expected otherwise. I hope everyone reads it, particularly,Trumps base, and does so with an open mind.
 Great book
 I can’t put it down. I am simply stunned.
 I thoroughly recommend this book for all voters as evidence of the insanity in the White House. Mr. Woodward, thank you.
 I read this book as I was laying down at a very beautiful beach for my short escape....<br/><br/>It’s quiet interesting though ....😊😊
 Confirms your worst fears.
 This book documents in meticulous detail the chaos and complete lack of a moral or principled compass that lives at the heart of the White House
 I can not write my review other than to say this is a must read book
 We need more of this.  The truth needs to be out in the open.  This is real reporting on an honorable scale.
 even in judgement of all
 Scares the heck out of me
 This was a very interesting read, it got a little slow going over old news but otherwise worth it.
 Well researched and well written. Woodward quality.
 Told the truth about a crooked campaign and even worse president, Donald Trump.
 Thought he was creepy before reading this book, but I'm more convinced now.
 Filled in so many blank spots!... with facts...very good book!
 Bob Woodward puts you inside the middle of everything.  Amazing!
 Bought and read this book.  All old news that's been covered.  Save your money.
 Bought for my husband.  Great reading.
 Story was informative but much of it was leaked earlier in the press
 Keeps to a quick, almost informal pace. Never feels like a dry history lesson, but at the same time, you are getting nothing but the facts of events. Good read.
 A little anti-climatic. The craziness has reached a peak but shows no sign of lessening. This is just added confirmation. Nothing surprising.
 Excellent book!
 Honestly the news reported most of the highlights  before I even got the book was delivered. Subsequently, I never really finished it.
 Interesting book
 A real page turner.  Look inside the fear monger’s world and why he is the way he is.
 If not for the credibility of the author, the chaos depicted in the book about Trump presidency is hard to believe - sometimes truth is stranger than fiction.
 Well written and very insightful view into the Trump White House and Administration.
 Good detail.<br/>After reading it the daily news is like an epilogue but less detailed.
 I could not put the book down Woodward knows how to write was is relevant today and every day I'm going to read<br/>All the Presidents Men again soon
 good read
 This book helps to make sense of how deep Trump is tied to the Russians.
 Excellent investigation from an experienced journalist. Incredulous about the ignorance and dangerous  day to day workings of the white house.
 Very revealing
 Absolutely loved this book! Very well written. A real page turner.<br/>Shocking what goes on behind closed doors!<br/>Can’t believe he is our President!
 Page turner
 Reading this only solidified what I believed to be true about our government.  Everyone should read this book.  Easy to understand.
 Filled with facts but easily and comfortably reads like a novel.  Not surprised, as we well know, the Post hires the best!
 Everyone should read this book and be scared as to where our country is heading with this treasonous traitor at the helm
 Get inside the dysfunction that is the leadership of our nation. Informational, yet scary. You will have a blast indeed.
 Great book!
 Excellent read
 I thought the book was well researched and helped to explain what was behind the headlines.
 Very interesting and informative.
 Book was startling.
 what I expected
 Did not contain much that I had not already learned or observed.
 Informative book which gives you a behind the scenes perspective.  The truth is revealing and frightening.
 Must read. Well written, well researched. No matter what your political leaning, it provides a great insight into the White House
 Excellent book. Could not put it down.
 Good, engaging read
 Hard to read, not a Trump fan, But I will keep plugging along
 As advertised...very compelling story...if only it was fiction!!
 Great book, honest!
 A page turner &amp; it  is eye opening to this administration ,
 Frightening
 Illuminating book regarding this corrupt insane embarrassment of a president and his administratiom.
 With the 24/7 news cycle, it was surprising for much new information Bob Woodward is able to add to the broad picture of our current White House.
 Nothing you haven’t heard on news stations. Just a little more detail.
 Great reporting. Woodward nailed the way people have to work with a largely dysfunctional leader.
 Excellent guide book for November elections and verify s many of our fears with factual interview information.
 Good read
 .... that should be concerned for the republic.
 Excellent read
 This just confirmed what I already knew, my worst fears, We need a new president.
 IT IS AN EYE OPENER
 Every American should read this book
 This was a pirated copy. Spine cracked the first time I opened the book; print and paper quality was poor...awful product
 Gives a little more details, then just the news
 Gradebook
 Well written and enlightening
 Most enjoyable reading from cover to cover
 Very good read.
 It tells the horrible truth about Trump.
 Interesting reading.
 Ok
 Great look inside the White House, and mind of POTUS.
 Great read very informative and interesting can't wait for the next installment should be the last in a series highly charged history
 To read and be informed.
 About half of the book is supporting documentation so it really isn't long enough to go into much depth. The stated length of 400 pages is deceptive. There were punctuation errors and it read more like a draft in places making it feel like it was rushed to publication before polished. Several major items such as feuds with leaders of allied nations were given only cursory attention or omitted entirely, which I found puzzling.  Woodward, as is expected of a journalist, remains aloof and emotionally distant even while reporting on emotionally charged events. That helps it feel neutral more than partisan. Perhaps because it was written a mere 18 months into the first term, it feels like it goes nowhere. Turning the last page, I fully expected it to continue but it just ended. I'm sure he plans on a second volume that may give it some sense of arc leading to resolution. I really liked _All the President's Men_ which was a much more compelling read.
 One of the great reporters of a generation continues bringing his A-game to the all of the president's men!
 As I expected
 It seems just as crazy as we expected.  Engaging read with insights in to current events.
 Reading about a train wreck while it happens is not fun. Woodward is a good writer as always. Worth it.
 A reasonable written book about the deep fall of the reason in our post-9/11 era!
 Top notch journalism
 Very thoroughly documented chain of events of the Trump Presidency
 a
 Impeccable reporting. The writer delivers a series of vignettes rather than creating a compelling storyline.. Very informative. OVERALL, FINE WORK.
 Excellent book.
 This book had nothing new to read.  I have already heard everything in this book on the media.  It was a complete waste of money.
 Great read, really reinforces my feeling about the insanity in the White House and the loose cannon at the top
 Well written
 Fascinating reading whether you love or hate Trump. And sometimes simply terrifying that such chaos is steering this country !
 This is a report from the man who broke the Nixon administration's back. I'd trust this guy over 100% of mainstream media now.
 Great book / must read for all.
 This guy is easy to read and careful with his facts.  I enjoy the book tremendously!
 Good book
 Excellent read. Takes you inside the chaos
 Good inside look at the  early days of the Trump White House.  Wish it wasn't so but it likely is.
 Heavily researched and investigated and richly detailed.
 No analysis of motives just the facts. Who said what and when.  Read it and make up your own mind
 Have heard so much about this book.  Can't wait to read it.
 Having read almost all of Woodward's books, I found this effort weak.  Luckily it only took 5 hours to read.
 One of the best "behind the scenes" looks at the Trump White House. Captures all of the details. Great read.
 Accurate account of a phenomenally poor President.
 To understand the current state of affairs and 5e mind set of the world’s most powerful leader, read the book
 Less a collection of shocking things I never knew than a collection of confirmations of things I already feared.<br/><br/>DJT is a liar.
 Thoroughly researched. Very unsettling - how disconnected it was and still is.
 Love this book
 I have wanted this book since I first heard of it
 Informative read about the worst elective official in US history.
 Very informative
 Excellent!
 Trump is a fraud and a liar. There is not much else to the book but documentary evidence of the obvious.
 “ Fear” not a strong enough word.  I hope country lives thru next 2 years!
 LOOKING FORWARD TO THE SEQUEL WHICH I HOPE WILL BE A SHORT ONE.
 Can’t get enough of Bob Woodward’s books. Really good insights into the WH silliness. Buy the book as soon as you can!
 Couldn’t read this with tears. Horrible person.  Good book
 Factual analyses of operating conditions in the White House
 Very good research and reporting.  I learned a lot about Trump and "his" White House.
 Bob's reporting. His subject.  I don't know why more verbiage is needed here... Not much more is needed to be said
 Disliked the language which was due to language used by people in WH administration
 The President of the United States get to work around 11am. In the days he’s not playing golf. That pretty much says it all.
 Loved this book but I’m even more afraid now
 People should read this tome.
 OMG !
 Well written. Just the facts
 Good and intersting book. Worth reading if you wanna understand American politics
 See this book as an excellent, but scary as hell, insight into the current regime (administration)
 Love
 The story was captured in the first 75 pages...after that, all was, as it is said, commentary.
 Excellent read.
 Very readable. Woodward has done it again.
 will set you free!
 Very interesting.
 Would recommend to many friends and family.  Very hard to believe the no structure in the White House.  Sad times!!!
 This book does not provide any insight of the Trump White House that is different from any other White House.  They have different advisors expressing different viewpoints,  which seems to be his main point.  Read about what went on in Kennedy's White House during the Bay of Pigs.  This book was written not to divulge anything out of the ordinary,  but to scam people like me out of our dollars
 Bob Woodward tells it like it is.  A must read book for thoughtful and caring individuals.
 This book is eerily wonderful, and sadly too many truths about our present POTUS and lies
 It is a very good book.
 The most important books since the start of this "presidency".
 Not much that has not already been reported on in general, so far. There are more details, which lends credibility to unflattering reports that have been disputed by the White House.<br/><br/>Woodward's stance of trying to be the neutral man between the raging fire and the fire truck - I had to look askance at that.<br/><br/>All the same, it was a book I found hard to put down. It sheds light on Trump's decision-making process and by what means our country is now being run. Knowing this will not make it easier for your to sleep at night.
 Enjoyed this book
 I like it very much
 Loved Woodword's thoroughness.
 Nothing I didn't already know.  Save your money and read the papers more often.
 I learned so much from reading the book and the details putting in the book is very resourceful
 Enjoyed story
 Enjoyed this book very much.  Only a couple of chapters where I wasn't as engaged, but overall, I recommend it.
 This book is so good and engaging! Hard to put down. I finished it in a day.
 Details..details.
 Loved the truth
 North Korea is a terrifying place.  But not as terrifying as the situation room.
 Well written
 Historically 60% negative reviews suddenly getting 100% positive ratings? Since January 8th.
 Informative
 Still reading.  But it is powerful and extremely well written
 A decent  review but nothing new if you watch cable news daily.
 Informative and scary!
 Have not finished, but it is a really good read!
 Good book
 This is a gripping account of the loony bin that is the Trump White House.
 I sure wish Bob didn't use Manafort so much as a source.
 A book worth your time and money
 Good read
 Perfect
 I'm a huge Trump supporter I love this book. It was eye-opening
 A good read.. a really smart engaging book about the politics of our time
 Believable insanity
 Everyone should read this book!
 Reading
 A must read
 It was well researched
 Well written great read
 Enjoyed the listen. Very entertaining.
 Great book and arrived quick.
 Bob Woodward never disappoints.
 Very enlightened
 Good book; scary information
 Nothing to dislike. I liked the book.
 A very clear, authoritative and well researched account of the Trump first year.
 X- mas gift for my 91 yr old Dad........He loves it!
 Brought this for my dad
 AMAZING
 Fantastic
 Scary ending but a need to understand the current president.
 Excellent summary of an errant administration.
 Good info
 Good book. Scary!
 Excellent
 Very good read
 Got it
 Informative
 Fear was an appropriate title.
 Quite entertaining. Very well written.
 Enjoyed book very much!
 Great book
 Interesting read
 Just as I thought and feared: Trump is a buffoon who needs to be removed from office before he does any more damage to my country.
 Good reporting.
 Woodford lays out the facts. much to think about
 Reaffirmed and described incidents reported in the news.
 This book is great science fiction
 Awesome book!
 Excellent account and affirmation of the chaotic and erratic behavior at the highest office in our country. Anyone with doubts about this presidency should definitely read this eye-opening and thorough narrative. The section outlining  supporting documentation for each chapter speaks volumes about the book’s credibility. History in the making...a gem for generations to come!
 I though the book was accurate and believable.
 Personal read; good
 Excellent condition.
 My god, we're all going to die.
 Great audio book!
 I thought I bought one book but two arrived
 It was truthful
 like getting books on computer right away
 Excellent account of a man who overcame obstacles and achieved victory. The true lesson in this book is to never give up. I finished the book with greater respect for Trump than when I began. Frankly, Woodward depicts him as a strong, decisive leader. Trump doesn't look bad in this book at all, at least, not from what I could tell. If anything, it makes prior administrations look bad by exposing how wide open they left the barn door on North Korean policy.<br/><br/>Kudos to Bob Woodward for an inspiring account of a business leader applying his craft to the political realm.
 I loved it
 The book was missing two chapters!
 Amazing book!
 Very enlightening
 Excellent.
 Unsettling
 Easy reading
 Great book
 Writing was great!
 gift
 Good book
 This book was a waste of time  and money.  It was mostly old news and practically common knowledge to anyone who reads newspapers.
 Very informative.
 great book
 Excellent
 
 Love it
 Fair and objective.
 Love the book
 I have not read any of his other books, but i did not appreciate Woodward's style. No titles in the chapters, without clear separation either chronologically or by subject. I found myself confused by the mix in narrative styles within a chapter.<br/><br/>I feel we are so exposed to news that the book lost the thrill factor, but nonetheless, it is shocking to see it normalized and get accounts from behind the scene.
 Hope one day again we will be calling it White House again. But now it's just a Adult day care center or Mental hospital is more appropriate. Some of the stuff written we read, but not this detailed. Some others we didn't or just got the hints. This psycho makes me shame to call myself American. For writing style can't say much, but I was more interested in the subject. Looks like about 5 million already have their precious time to read it, wake up America we are being looked down.
 Nothing really new here.  I think Bob just needed the money.  Where's Bernstein when you need him?  Too bad. Maybe his pence book will be better.
 You will know most of story already what you don't know will give you pause. Some parts end abruptly leaving you wanting more detail and information. The sequel is playing for us daily. Anyone that hopes our democracy will survive will want to read<br/>this book. Power is Fear for this President along with a good dose of stupidity, confusion, and a poor understanding of history and economics.
 The links are backwards. The link is in the end note to the text - the links should be in the text to the end notes. Can this be fixed with an update?
 The Book of Trump - I can't wait for the musical
 woodwards Fear is a meticulously documented reference manual for the first couple years of the shit storm that is trumps presidency.  for those of us who stare slack jawed at the news and read the NY Times or Wa Post Fear is jut a recap of the very very bad news that worries and scares us daily.  nothing new here folks.  but handy for future reference as to how the US became villified and lost its position as an economic power.  how it all began anyway.  Fear will need several follow up books to explain to posterity trumps crazy evil avaricious cold hearted presidency.
 You are buying this book because you want the gossip and hate Trump.  At this point, there is no reason to purchase this tome as you will discover nothing new if you watch a 1/2  hour of MSNBC or several weeks of Fox.  What starts out quickly ends in a plodding mess of quotes from "sources" whereas naming the source would be more interesting than reading their overplayed story.  Library rental at best.
 Bob Woodward  gives us a detailed, informative  look at the true nature of Trump.  Woodward tells in his own  intelligent manner the many instances of a trail of lies and denials told by Trump.  The book is concise, and  as much a page turner as the top, best selling criminal mystery thriller.  Woodward's book is factual, and to the point in its entirety. A must have for everyone's library. A story so astounding, I will re-read numerous times.
 I agree with one of the other reviewers that said this book was not all anti-Trump.  The book actually does two things (at least).  One it show the treachery and even criminal activity of White House Staff that think they know more than their boss. More than one actually stole a letter off President Trump's desk which at the very least should result in immediate dismissal.  Every employee know that you are there at the pleasure of the boss.  It is his agenda you implement not yours.  The second shows how committed President Trump is to honoring his campaign promises and to caring about American Taxpayers.  Of course there are parts of the book I didn't care for which is why I gave it a 3 instead of a 5 and parts that I did (the two things I mentioned) which is why I did not give it a 1. Thanks to Amazon for letting us review products and being able to read the reviews of others.
 Bob Woodward knows how Washington works....or is supposed to work.<br/>Unfortunately for 45, he gave Mr. Woodward a whole lot of access..... and Bob told it like it is.
 I really found this book to be a huge disappointment. There was nothing in the book that was new or hadn't been covered the week before in Woodward's publicity tour. Also, it jumps around a lot. More than anything, however, this book relies completely on a group of ex-Trump people witouth offering other view points. For instance, we hear John Dowd's views on on the legal implications of Mueller's investigation as if it was law. John Dowd is not the Supreme Court, his opinion is just that, his opinion. Other lawyers disagree with him, but Woodward presented Dowd's opinions like they are law. For instance, he belittles the Trump Tower meeting, so it is presented in the book as if it is a big nothing-burger. If it is a nothing-burger, why has Trump and Trump Jr. prevaricated so much on the topic. It also should be pointed out that Dowd has very authoritarian instincts when it comes to the Executive branch. Dowd advises Trump to pull press credentials because the press is "rude"! Everything in this book is presented as if it is fact, without disclosing the speaker's identity or bias, or offering opposing view points. Anyway, if you want to hear the Trump story from Gary Cohn, Rob Porter, John Dowd, Lindsey Graham, Reince Preibus, Rex Tillerson (maybe?), Steve Bannon, and a few other ex-Trump people's view point, this book is for you. You will not read anything from a pro-Trump person, a non-Trump Republican, a Democrat, or any neutral parties. Nor is the timeline fleshed out outside these people's view points.
 A Disjointed read. it seems to me to be a disservice to our national security to discuss so many specifics about our adversaries.
 I was disappointed with the book. It seemed a bit disjointed. Nothing new other than I think the Op-ed writer is either Porter or Kelly.  Fire and Fiery was a much, much better read.
 Woodward delivers in this timely and critically important piece.
 Nothing new; I had already heard all of this.  Sloppy use of quotes as distracting. This book was very disappointing. I expected better writing from a noted journalist.
 Well written and #45 exceeds Nixon's antics in trying to destroy American Democracy. Really sad..
 If you follow the news or have read Comey's and/or Omarosa's book, you have already seen 99 percent of the content. I did not find Woodward's style  to be partcularly outstanding.
 The orange fart cloud really looks like the moron he is so, apparently, this reporter was given a great show to watch as the crabs pull each other down. Too funny except knowing that people actually voted for this moronic clown; guess it was time for amerika to go down the sewer - thanks deplorable's.
 Just got up; read the first couple of chapters...intriguing.
 what an amazing writer
 An interesting read because it’s apparent where and who provided the information.nothing really shocking here.<br/>I liked that he ,the author, provided dialogues and did not interject his own beliefs or conclusions.
 Not what expected, but a good read if you want to read about a person with many flaws and a country scrambling to keep up with him and his dangerous decision making.
 I appreciate anything anti-Trump and hate him like poison, but was kind of disappointed in the book.  Not many, if any, additional bad things about Trump other than what CNN already leaked.  If I were Bob, I would have kept it ALL under wraps before release.  It really goes into into why things how they are with the economy and across the world and what advisors were telling him and why, so I guess it IS good if you want to know more about that.  Just don't look for anymore juicy dirt than you already heard.  If you buy the book at all, you likely already hate him and won't be surprised that he is exactly "that person" behind the scenes as well.
 I was disappointed in the book. It did not add much to what I already knew. I had the feeling that much of the information was gleaned from Rob Porter.
 This book is absolutely one of the best I have ever read, it feels almost as if Woodward is sitting across the table from me recounting the events, I almost have to remind myself that this isn't fiction, and the Trump white house is in complete and Utter Chaos.
 Considering the author, Bob Woodward, I expected more. What he delineated is much that has already been reported by news media. Sure, he put it in a timeline, but I kept expecting some AHA! moment just around the corner and never got it.
 Not as revealing as I expected from the likes of Woodward. Wish I would have checked it out from the library vs paying for it!
 As I feared, all of the most outrageous utterances by Trump we’re already published before the book’s release. And although there are many individual scenarios where Trump behaves in a way that a normal, rational, thoughtful person would not, each instance was nearly identical. You start to easily guess what Trump will do - invariably something impulsive, entirely contrary to what his advisors recommend, and in stark-contrast to the facts.<br/><br/>There are many parts of the book that deep-dive into policy debates, and they run on at length. I found these tedious, and I had to resort to skimming through many of the chapters. I was interested only in how Trump viewed these topics, not in all of the inter-office squabbling and bruised ego moaning and groaning. Yes, that deserved to be mentioned, as it goes to the heart of the reported dysfunction in this administration. But it was referenced incessantly.<br/><br/>What the book does portray, in great detail, is Trump in all of his uninformed glory. This book confirms your worst fears about this petty, egocentric, narcissistic, insecure bully. But what it doesn’t do, is tell you something about Trump you don’t already know or strongly suspect.<br/><br/>Lastly, I’m left to wonder how this book was sourced. It reads like Bob Woodward was in the room with a tape recorder. There’s a chapter towards the end of the book where Trump’s attorney Dowd is engaged in a fierce confrontation with Special Counsel Robert Mueller, in regards to Trump possibly consenting to an interview with Mueller. I won’t go into details of that conversation because I would risk spoiling it for people who haven’t read the book yet. But how, I wonder, could that meeting have been reported in such precise detail?<br/><br/>Here’s one soft-spoiler: by the end of the book, Trump’s ex-lawyer Dowd comes to a conclusion regarding the special prosecutor, which I - based on the narrative Dowd provided - probably agree with: Bob Meuller has got nothing on Trump. Without proof of intent from Trump, Mueller can’t hang his obstruction charge. Unless Mueller has a secret card to play -and many people hope he does- this investigation will end in a whimper.
 I had high expectations for this book.  I ordered the Kindle edition.  About halfway through were some pictures and then I realized that that was basically the end of the book!  The remainder was source notes providing support for the actual chapters in the book.  I have a great deal of respect for Bob Woodward and I appreciate how he carefully documents this story.  I'm sure this will be appreciated later in history.  However, apart from the revelation that people are removing documents from Trump's desk so he won't sign them, I did not find much new here that I didn't already hear in "Fire and Fury".  Perhaps this provides some solid corroboration of other things we've heard, but I felt this was a bit slim.
 Good review of this time in history, but nothing new that hasn't already been covered on "The Rachel Maddow Show".
 Don't care to comment on this. Disregard this compelled "review". Kindle reader sticks on this book till a "review" is submitted.
 No matter your political views, this book gives insight into how the government works- and how it doesn't.
 No need to read. Read NY Times (fake news). Li
 Gives some insight into the personalities.  Describes the utter chaos. Explained more about Graham, Tillerson and Porter.  Spotlights the utter dilemma our country faces.
 Maybe I've read too many books on Trump. I found this to be a difficult read.
 After reading DRob's review , I totally agree.  Nothing I have not heard before.  Perhaps I've just heard/read/seen more than I ever wanted to.
 Nothing new.  Couple of new items.  Not worth buying.  We all know what a train wreck is going on in the White House.
 Wow, a must read!
 8645.
 Trump's secret is out:  Fear is power.  What's your biggest fear?  You'd better know how to face it or he will use it to manipulate you.
 very well written
 Can’t wait to get started
 Not a Trump fan by any means--I abhor this president's actions. I felt I had to read this book, mostly because of the reputation of Woodward.  I was pretty stunned at how poorly the book was written and edited. Lots of paragraphs that seemed to be inserted for no real purpose.  They certainly didn't enhance to flow of the narrative.  Instead, it seemed like Woodward had so much material he didn't know where to put some little factoid, so just inserted it where it didn't belong.
 Outstanding read,well done,riveting,gets very emotional as did I.
 Fantastic book
 Flat.
 Woodward is a monotone writer.
 The book was written well and was hilarious to read. Steven Bannon is a damn comedian. Interesting what our country has come to, although Hilary Clinton was a flawed candidate as well.
 Haven't read book yet, but interesting enough the package arrived opened.
 Very informative,
 Did not finish.
 Dry and nothing new
 Journalism at its best.
 This book was hyped as kind of salacious and anti Trump. Actually, the main take homes seem to be that Woodward thinks Trump is a narcissistic liar-- which the whole world already knew without reading this book-- and that Trump is likely innocent of collusion and obstruction. Since Woodward doesn't name sources, I'm guessing his conclusion of no collusion is based on interviews with Trump lawyers and white house celebs who were in negotiations with Mueller's team (he discusses these negotiations at length and I doubt the Mueller team talked)--i.e., he got the picture the White House wanted him to get  So, Woodward has helped Trump enormously.  In all honesty, Woodward comes off as something of an old white guy who is anti women. No big surprise but rather sad.  The hype of the book has boosted sales but I don't suggest buying it-- it's actually pro Trump propaganda more than anything.
 Disturbing and more than a bit scary. Kimd of like the administration itself.
 I enjoyed until I got about 60% thru only to be disappointed that the last 40% was nothing but references of articles &amp; dates of where when etc he got his info. Could have been a little more meaty
 Boy, I finished this baby in a weekend.  That’s record time for me.  It usually takes me a week or two to finish a book like this one.  I’ll give you the good, first.  Simple, easy writing like reading a newspaper.  Author does not try anything fancy in terms of writing and so reading is a breeze.  There are some nice lessons here.  Trump is a tough guy who will never back down.  This is a quality quite lacking in Obama who made the US look weak.  “Never show weakness” is Trump’s mantra.  This is important in life especially in relationships with women.  Once they smell weakness, it’s all over.  And so this read was not an entire waste of time.<br/><br/>Now the bad.  Writing style is too generic and boring.  I did not feel motivated to continue reading nevermind finishing the book though I did.  Organization very sporadic.  We would have one chapter about trade only to have another chapter few chapters down about the same exact topic.  Would it kill Woodward to add a subtitle for each chapter?<br/><br/>As many have said in the two star reviews, nothing new.  If you been following the news, you know everything.  Michael Wolff’s book is more entertaining though probably not as factual and seemingly full of hyperboles.  This book is totally credible because there is nothing new.  I’ll admit there were some detailed conversations and some uncovering of inner workings of government like favors and donations to politicians to get them to do stuff but you already knew this didn’t you?  Even Tillerson calling Trump an “idiot” made it to the evening news.<br/><br/>I do find some of the conversations interesting like why it’s a good idea to have good trade relations with South Korea or why we need to stay in Afghanistan or why tariffs are harmful to the economy.  But all these things are not new either if you have a firm upstanding of politics and economics.  You also get to know the cabinet really well after reading the book.<br/><br/>In all, this book was just a rehash of all the events that happened from Trump candidacy to his current state in office.  It ended cleverly but again not a revelation so I won’t be spoiling it by telling you that the US president is a liar.  However, to his defense, would you rather know a person is lying or not know a person is lying because he (OR SHE) is a borderline psychopath?  I’ll take the former every time over fooling ourselves that everything is dandy until manure hits the fan.
 I have read several of the authors previous books, but I did not see anything described that I did not see in the news.  Yes Trump is an idiot and will probably go down as one of the worst presidents, but I want to know more as to why he acts the way he does and why appoints  people he doesn't trust or listen to their advice.
 Being a huge fan of Mr Woodward's, I was disappointed. There was nothing new in this book that hasn't already been covered in other books about the Trump White House in the last few months. If you are a cable TV viewer you probably have all the information contained in the book. The writing was kinda flat - there wasn't any buildup or suspense that would keep you flipping pages and leading to a climax. It was a sprawling, sometimes confusing diary-type account of the Trump White House with no inside scoop that would make you go- whoa I didn't know that!  This must be Mr. Woodward's most dull and uninformative book to date. I could have written the book just by watching TV every day.  I wish Mr. Woodward well. I hope his next book will be better.
 Most of the author's sources are people from the government itself. That is, mostly dishonest. You can not leave much truth from there
 The book's title is an adequate description of the book itself.  Note that it was released on 9/11/2018.
 I voted for Obama twice. I considered myself a Democrat until Trump.<br/><br/>This book confirms that Trump is being mistreated and undermined by government actors violating their sworn oaths. The corruption is real.  It truly is a swamp with government employees sucking on the taxpayer teat.<br/><br/>Read this book to know why we all need to support our President in his fight for our country.
 While the book confirms the complete inadequacies of Trump to be the commander in chief- or a decent human being, Woodward provided about 2/3 of a book and a 1/3 of already published source back-up. The detailed accounting of conversations with Cohn, Dowd, Porter, Graham, Porter, Kelly, Preibus and others suggest Trump's staff truly feared the President- and Trump probably is not going to survive his first term. Graham comes off as the most manipulative, political snake in senatorial history. Woodward should not have included Dowd's conversation with Bob Mueller while investigation is still on going. Rob Porter would have had a great future if he did not such a terrible lack of respect for women. John Kelly has sold his soul to the corrupt Trump for questionable reasons. His legacy will be tainted by his bully tatics and disparaging comments towards Gold Star families and minorities- another fine serviceman contaminated by Trump. Sad.
 As a Woodward fan and someone expecting much more substance, I was terribly disappointed by this book. Essentially, if you've read the excerpts or heard them on TV, you've gotten as much as you're going to get from this. There are no other bombshells in it other than what I already knew.
 Well researched with identified sources presented in real time.
 This book was just ok in my opinion.  More Woodward trying to relive his Watergate saga where that President was complicit.  Trump is an outsider who pokes you in the eye and insiders hate that he's in power.
 I don't really feel like wasting my precious time reading about trump  and his dark deeds.
 Up to page 110 and Boring...too much information and name dropping of those people who have very little to do with us. Not enough about Trump.
 I went into this book thinking that it would confirm all of my deepest fears about Trump and give me more reasons to dislike him.  At the end of the book,  I had the distinct impression that Trump's presidency is not as bad as it is often portrayed.  Some of Trump's ideas are not so bad -- for example, the book spends a lot of time on Afghanistan.  Trump has for a long time believed the war was a mistake, that there is no way to "win," and that it is a perpetual loss of our country's treasures.  The book spends a lot of time showing how Trump fought the "swamp" to come up with a strategy to get out -- and failed.  Of course, many other stories in the book confirmed my belief that he is a disaster for a president.  The book jumps around in time and topic a lot, making it difficult to follow.  Kind of like Trump himself.
 A Bunch of partisan Crap
 The thing (not a book) ended abruptly. What ended? Questionable gossip twice removed. In great detail Woodward related what someone told him about what he or she heard from whoever had to remain anonymous. And I've never been a Trump supporter. I quit reading the Washington Post because of trashy, slanted attacks like this. Too late for a refund.
 No fact checking or corroboration.  Plainly biased supposition with stilted "writing" at every turn.  Seems S&amp;S needed a book out fast.  Unabashed leftist apologia for Woodward's lukewarm bashing of the Obama club.  Not recommended.
 I really like Woodward’s writing style.  The best thing I can say is his information seemed balanced and fair. I even came away not disliking Trump as much as I did before. He offers some flavor to facts that have already been reported in  the news. It seemed a regurgitation of old news. Was slightly disappointed.  I still believe Mr. Woodward is a remarkable journalist. Just wished this was more of the superior inside look of journalism found in his past books.
 I am finally able to write a review on this book I read when it first came out for some reason writing a review for this book was censored no matter how you felt about it. I found the author's prose as usual inflammatory someone still trying to be revelant,who was not during Nixon and is not now. The timing of the release of the book was not only in poor taste but explotative. I get we need get used to these types of books full of drivel and utter hatred being printed and then waiting to read it and write an honest review only to be censured from doing it until months after the release,  granted I understand there is abuse but if you have read the book it should be allowed to write how you felt the book was written and your opinion.If you are into pure fiction with no facts presented ad-verbatim this book is for you.
 Fear is a wonderful psychological thriller that puts Steven King to shame with its portrait of a tormented man struggling against the defects of his own DNA as well as his own character. "Trump" is a kind of everyman, like Willie Loman in Death of  a Salesman. Unlike Willie, however, Trump struggles not only with large-scale social and economic problems beyond his control, but also with a cast of nefarious characters who only seek their own sovereignty and personal advantage at his expense.<br/><br/>Reminiscent of the greatest literature by Dostoyevsky and Mann, Fear reaches into our hearts and wrings out compassion for this protagonist who appears to be condemned to an Eternal Present, with no memory of anything that happened more than 10 minutes ago. It is indeed anguishing to witness Trump trapped in the "Cage of the Present" as he struggles to grasp what is occurring around him, without being able to remember what anyone has said earlier, including himself. In some ways Bob Woodward has adopted as a subject a protagonist whom Oliver Sachs could describe best.<br/><br/>Trump is like a bull in an arena, while all around him, his own advisors are in truth his picadores, while in the shadows we can't see the figure of the Matador who will ultimately take him down. One of the worst is Steve Bannon (the loose cannon), who constantly appeals to the darker side of Trump's personality, through swearing, ridicule and unrepentant racist remarks.  Trump's odd ambivalence about the military and its top generals lead him to surround himself with four of the least attractive military officers since Dr. Strangelove. A sleazy oilman whom Trump appoints Secretary of State, despises the man who appointed him, going as far as to proclaim him a "moron," and who strives constantly to undermine Trump's half-hearted and quixotic attempts to remake the world in his own image.<br/><br/>Another leader appears halfway through this magnificent thriller, the sinister "Rocket Man" who threatens Trump with annihilation. The conflict between Trump and Rocket Man appears to place everyone on the Earth in jeopardy. None of Trump's advisors agree with Trump's strategy for dealing with this super-villain, who appears to have been plucked out of the late Stan Lee's comics. The appearance of this bumbling villain, a mirror image of the protagonist, provides some relief to the incredible tension Woodward's craft has summoned up for us.<br/><br/>A superb addition to the world's great literature, Fear can most fruitfully be seen as a companion to Mary Shelley's masterpiece, Frankenstein. The only drawback to Fear is its inconclusive ending, which hints at a sequel. This reader can hardly wait!<br/><br/>Five stars well and truly earned! Bravo!
 FEAR, by Bob Woodward, is an excellent rough draft of history, this history being the rise of President Donald Trump and his first year in office. It would be an easy book for Trump’s acolytes and sycophants to dismiss as “fake news,” and call it a smear  job, except that to read but a few pages is to know that Woodward brought all of his reporter’s skill to bear, and got people – especially people close to Trump – to talk about what they saw and heard. Conversations are recounted verbatim, and details are recalled that could only have come from people in the room. And some common threads emerge, threads that knit a portrait of man as ignorant as he is supremely self-confident, as self absorbed as he is devoid of any motivation other than self interest of the moment, lacking any moral center; in its place, a savage cunning, a keen eye for opportunity, and a finely honed ability to spot weakness. This proved to be enough to elect Donald Trump President in 2016, and make possible what came after.<br/><br/>Woodward’s book, which comes in at just over 350 pages in hardback, is presented in a series of anecdotes that touch on the greatest hits of the early Trump era: the Access Hollywood tape, the capitulation of the Republican establishment, the Muslim travel ban, the firing of James Comey, the border wall, Charlottesville, North Korea, illegal immigration, tariffs, Syria, NATO, and tax cuts. And time and again, we see one high ranking member of the administration after another utterly fail to reign in the President, who rules by whim, impulse, and tweet. But hanging over it all, is the shadow of Vladimir Putin’s Russia, and the question of collusion. Toward the end of the book, the spotlight is increasingly on lawyers and the special prosecutor, as serious questions are raised as to the possibility that the President of the United States conspired with a hostile foreign power to gain the office. Of course, Woodward cannot give us any definitive answer, but the one thing he does definitively prove is that Trump is a liar, one who is quite capable of committing any of things he is alleged to have done.<br/><br/>Behind Trump is many a name from the news: Reince Priebus, Kellyanne Conway, John Kelly, Rex Tillerson, Gary Cohn, H.R. McMaster, Michael Flynn, John Dowd, Rob Porter, Hope Hicks, Jeff Seissons; along with Trump’s children and son on law, Jared Kushner. All of them in some way come to grief in their dealings with their President, some much more than others. But I must admit that I gained some grudging admiration for Steve Bannon, for though his politics are abhorrent, he read the political landscape in 2016 better than anyone else, and almost alone except for the candidate, saw the road to victory over Hillary Clinton when everyone else had given the Republican candidate up for dead. Most of these people were sources for Woodward, clearly determined to get their side of events out before the public as fast as possible.<br/><br/>Sadly, FEAR, is already dated, as the events it covers have faded into the past, and most of the participants who are still part of the administration at the end, have left since publication. But have no fear, there will no doubt be sequels, and sequels to the sequels before the Age of Trump ends.
 The overall themes explored in this book will be familiar to the vast majority of those who follow the Donald Trump White House. Descriptions of internal insubordination, general chaos, and outright incompetence are consistent through virtually all of the published accounts of this White House. What differentiates Bob Woodward's work in FEAR from Michael Wolff's "Fire and Fury" or Omarosa Manigault-Newman's "Unhinged", is the precision in material details involved and the credibility of the author developed over more than half a century.<br/><br/>This is not a partisan hit job as Trump would like you to believe based on his tweets. It is incredibly fair and balanced with respect to commentary on the President's leadership style and his actions. Woodward also injects his own views sporadically through the book from criticisms of Obama and Bush to his belief that the Steele Dossier should never have been presented to Trump. This would be clear to Mr. Trump had he read the book instead of tweeting ignorantly about it.<br/><br/>This book explores a little more than a dozen flash points in Trump's administration with extraordinary detail -- placing the reader in room, identifying who was in that room, and quoting the principals involved. Heres a list of people I’d say with 95%+ confidence spoke extensively (dozens of hours of interviews) with Woodward:<br/>- Gary Cohn<br/>- Reince Priebus<br/>- Steve Bannon<br/>- Lindsey Graham<br/>- Rob Porter<br/>- John Dowd<br/>- Thomas Bossert<br/><br/>What you are left with here, is less sensational than sobering. Woodward wields his considerable expertise in investigative reporting and pieces together a remarkable real time accounting of what is actually happening in this White House. In this endeavor, Woodward leans on what must have been hundreds of interviews and the physical documentation he's gathered to offer the best obtainable version of the truth. What he finds, shouldn't just scare every American, it should serve as a clarion call to action.
 Woodward  writes about Trump only from the negative aspect of the bell curve, picking diction that is only unfavorable. It's like listening to a whiney child complaining about a confrontation. Plus Woodward needs to check some facts...like the Trump dossier that was paid for by the DNC etc.
 TERRIBLE BOOK. THIS MAN said NOTHING about all the nefarious doings of, and seemingly PROTECTED OBAMA and Hillsty CLINTON.  Not so much as a WORD about them. IMO He is the poster child for hate and bias against a sitting President. Despicable.<br/>If NIXON had been a democrat, Woody would have been silent I am certain.. HE and HIS deep state beltway buddies are ridiculous trying to destroy a President from day one.<br/><br/>Do not be fooled. ALL this is rubbish is to protect the Obama Clinton cartel. PERIOD.<br/><br/>Don’t like TRUMP?  Fine. Trump’s crime? Beating HILLARY.
 First, I had questions as to the validity of the quotes in the book and if they actually came from the people who supposedly said them. There were too many annonymous sources and for this book to be credible, in my opinion, quotes needed to come from reliable sources...not annonymous ones. It is always suspicious when there is anonymity and I honestly don't think the people mentioned would have told Bob Woodward the things that were quoted.<br/><br/>I have to chuckle to myself because I always doubt a political book that is one-sided. What the writer considers the bad side because that's his agenda. How can he summarize what was said between two people if neither one is his source and only two people were present?<br/><br/>Lastly, there was really very little that we did not know already. Most we had heard on the news or in the papers. So was this book revelational in its content? No it was not! I am trying to understand why Woodward even wrote it becauses he gives us very little new information.<br/><br/>Disappointed and do not recommend!
 I waited months to borrow this book from the library, and it was worth the wait.  I found the book easy to read, yet still well organized.  Woodward writes well, but simply.  He documents the first 18 months or thereabouts of the Trump Administration, focusing on the chaos, the lack of preparation, the lack of curiosity re policy making, the problems with his Cabinet and other staffers, not just those who opposed him.  Every day there is a new scandal, tweet, or some other idiocy that I had forgotten a good many of them.  I had even forgotten how many people he fired in his own administration, or who quit.<br/>I liked that he described how various members of the Establishment GOP tried to help Trump, either by providing him with reports (tried to educate him) or by hindering his worst instincts (such as stealing the letter blowing up the trade agreement with South Korea).  I knew from watching the news just how distracted Trump is, but reading this book really brought the point home.  Trump doesn't focus on anything regarding governing long enough, is totally self-absorbed, but is focused on using the office of the Presidency to make money for himself.  If it means destroying longtime alliances, if it means flouting international law, so be it.<br/>At one time, the voters elected an actor to be the president, but at least he had some experience in government and in governing.  Reagan wasn't afraid to work with Democrats or with the moderates of his own party, and didn't have a "my way or the highway" approach.  He cut taxes, but then raised them for the remainder of his two terms.  He seemed to have learned that there is a difference between campaigning and campaign promises and actually governing.  Thirty plus years later the voters, in their infinite wisdom, decided to elect another actor, of sorts.  This one is a reality tv star (no real acting chops) with less than zero experience with government and governing.  The moderates in the GOP are gone, the surviving GOP members are too scared to stand up for the beliefs they supposedly profess, instead caving to Trump on everything.  Everything they claim they hated about the Clintons, Obama, and the Democrats in general are not only perfectly acceptable when done by Trump, but they praise the same actions (marital infidelity, e.g.), beliefs (no cuts to Social Security and Medicare, e.g.).  Woodward reminds readers that the new normal is not normal at all, and although he doesn't offer any hope for an end to the madness or a way out, the documentation of every shattering of norms is good to have on record for future generations and historians.  Highly recommended.
 A noted journalist who earned his glory by investigating a compelling subject and presenting facts (All the President's Men) relies solely on "anonymous" and otherwise unnamed sources for this tale. I think the book would have had more credibility had it not been "piece mealed" from notes and purported conversations between the author and whomever.<br/><br/>On the positive side, Woodward does make the reader feel that he/she is actually there in the White House, witness to infighting, bitter debates, and frequent personality clashes among President Trump and his top aides. . On the other hand, a major weakness of this book is the reliance on those few inside sources who actually were willing to speak to Woodward.<br/><br/>Too much of the narrative seemed to come straight from Steve Bannon, a narcissistic con man in his own right, who obviously strived to present himself favorably. It seemed a bit self-serving. However, seeing President Trump primarily through a few top aides, especially those critical of him, he does come across as an impulsive, immature egomaniac, unprepared to see the "Swamp" as anything other than a business venture putting profits over all else which honestly is typical "corporate business mind fog." But again, the people who voted him in were sick and tired of "Swamp Politics," in my humble opinion.<br/><br/>There was nothing new or earth-shattering about that. Anybody who has followed Donald Trump over the years has already come to this conclusion. He isn't polished; he isn't a savvy politician, his biggest frustration as a businessman HAS to be with just how slowly things move in the government quagmire called "D.C."<br/><br/>My major problem with the book was its reliance on un-sourced material.  How can the reader ascertain as to how much of it is accurate? The whole quotation mark thing - alleged quotes then immediately followed by unquoted conclusions presented as facts seemed to be by design to co-mingle alleged quotes with unsupported and un-sourced information presented as factual.  (Audio listeners weren't privy to that obviously, but reading it drove me off the wall!) The book offers no insight as to how the country got itself into this mess nor does it ascribe any responsibility to the previous leadership (Republican and Democrat) for failing this country.<br/><br/>  I was far more impressed with Carlson's book, "Ship of Fools," which actually, through documented history, named sources, and first-hand experiences as a political journalist, and articulately explained how we've gotten here, and named the triggers in a non-Partisan way.<br/><br/>Politics are politics. Facts are facts.  Elites are elites . . . and SWAMPS are SWAMPS.
 In the interest of full disclosure, I voted for the current president (as much as voted against the other candidate).  This book is a must read for anyone who voted for Trump and is thinking of putting him back in the White House for another 4 years.  Overall, it reads as though it is a well-balanced account of the past two years.<br/><br/>We read the headlines which explain the outcomes of Trump's actions in the media daily.  Woodward does a comprehensive and clear job of explaining how those decisions get made, and the process is described as disturbing and uncomprehendingly broken.  This is NOT a tell-all book written by a former cabinet member with an axe to grind.  Instead, "Fear" provides an insider's description, through extensive research and interviews, of the events coming out of the Executive Branch for the past two years.  Woodward's book elucidates the behind-the-scenes daily events that have led to constant firings and vitriolic Tweets, poor leadership, and significant disfunction across the board.<br/><br/>Woodward describes, time and again in his book, a chief executive who ignores the expertise of the staff he hires and instead shoots from the hip, provides no strategic vision and relies on his own spontaneous decisions, and tells outright lies to support a narcissistic personality that supports his own ego over what's best for the nation.  All things equal, Woodward does not give Trump the benefit of the doubt when the facts appear neutral, providing a liberal interpretation of some information that automatically goes against the president.  However, the majority of the eye witness accounts to the happenings presented describe a cripplingly dysfunctional White House led by a megalomaniac, and even if only 50% of the information was accurate, the day-to-day operations would still be extremely disturbing.  On a personal note, after a 30+ year military, I find Trump's management style contrary to everything I learned as an officer about leadership.  Trump's firing of Secretary of Defense James Mattis was the final straw that led me to get my hands on this book to figure out what is going on in Trump's Washington.  To legitimize the findings in the book, I listened to a phone conversation between President Trump and Bob Woodward around the time that this book was released.  Despite Trump declining to be interviewed for the book, in the conversation he gave Woodward high praise for his style and veracity in reporting.  The President seemed intent on trying to finally get his response included in a book fresh off the presses, knowing what Woodward had to say and wanting to interject "his side" of the story.  He seemed scared of what "Fear" would say, and with good reason as it would be damaging to the perception of the president's leadership (it was for me).<br/><br/>Whether you voted for Trump or not, "Fear" is a seemingly factual account of the inner workings of the current Executive Branch of our government that does an excellent job describing the behind-the-scenes machinations that result in the incredible headlines that we see every day.  This is a must-read account for any Trump supporter with their head still in the sand, and understand the current debilitation in the Trump White House and the reasons behind it.
 “Sigh”, well that was certainly an interesting read...umm, listen. Yes, I did the audiobook version. Sure, I could have physically read the story but when I learned Robert Petkoff was narrating I simply had to go the audiobook route; he’s only one of my top five favorite narrators!<br/><br/>To be totally up-front I have read other books on Trump such as Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House by Michael Wolff, Unhinged – An Insider’s Account of the Trump White House by Omarosa Manigault-Newman and A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership by James Comey  out of all of these only two were written by people whose job it was to stay impartial and simply report facts and observations. I admit, I read Omarosa’s book and wondered if it was motivated by revenge on her part. James Comey’s book was also an interesting read but, once again...it came out after he had been fired. Bob Woodward on the other hand is a respected Pulitzer Prize winning journalist and has written books on nine of the most recent presidents objectively....often referred to as “the best reporter of our time.”<br/><br/>But, perhaps you may know him best as part of the team (Woodward-Bernstein) who broke Nixon’s Watergate scandal wide-open.<br/><br/>So, when this book was released I was absolutely interested in reading it. You see, Bob Woodward is known for getting people to say things they wouldn’t normally say to journalists, he’s renowned for being able to put a subject at ease during interviews; he wasn’t just a fly on the wall waiting for tidbits as Michael Wolff was...he spoke to people and received direct quotes.<br/><br/>Once again, I went into listening to this book thinking that surely I would hear something more favorable about Trump from someone....anyone.  Sadly, I didn’t. I didn’t come away from this thinking “he’s just been smeared by several disgruntled people”.  Instead I received more information that reinforces what others have said in the books I mentioned earlier and I still feel the White House is in utter chaos with America’s version of Great Britain’s Mad King George at the helm.<br/><br/>When your own attorney advises you NOT to testify to Robert Mueller because you can’t tell the truth to save your life and you will end up with only one citrus colored wardrobe choice for years to come (yes, I’m paraphrasing the part where Dowd calls Trump a liar)....that’s just not a good thing. When your attorney quits because you won’t take his advice and he can see what’s coming down the pike, not a good thing yet again.<br/><br/>As for the book itself, I found it well written and well-paced and as for the narration...I never can find fault with Robert Petkoff reading....anything. He could read the phone book and make it entertaining to listen to.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a reputable accounting of what is going on, I feel I can recommend this book to you...whether you are for or against Trump because Bob Woodward is one of the preeminent journalists of our time and he’s not going to risk his well-earned reputation to peddle pages full of lies.
 Lies, more lies and scare tactics.
 Bob Woodward tackled a 600-lb. suicide bomb when he decided to write “Fear.”  I have to admire his courage while scratching my head over his wisdom.  Sure, the book is going to make millions of dollars for him.  Sure, it’s about a controversial world leader with mush for brains.  Sure, it’s about industry, military, and political giants being thumb-squashed as they try to cater to a despot’s misinformed idea of leadership.<br/><br/>So, sure, he’s going to write it.  Did the author capture and present the information he was shooting for?  There is so much at stake for all of us that, although the book’s contents are frightening,  its merits will be decided by its readers.<br/><br/>So, how did Woodward do?  My opinion is that he did as well as could be expected.  Obviously the information, coming from the Oval Office, the Situation Room, Air Force One, exclusive golf courses, and the White House residence, will not be easy to come by.  Nor will it be totally accurate and uncolored, shielded by secrecy, loyalty, adherence to political party bias, or ego.  I think Woodward, knowing his zeal for impeccable research, assembled as accurate a picture as one might expect.  For sure, he exposed our president for the bully buffoon we have been viewing on the news.<br/><br/>It is particularly hurtful for me to see the titans he drafted be exposed to his ignoble reign, then be dismissed, ridiculed, and rendered ineffective as they try to perform their duties.  People who have risen to the top of their chosen field by exhibiting the qualities that have produced spectacular businesses, hugely profitable financial institutions, trained and efficient military forces, and successful negotiations through the labyrinths of the political scene must surely feel the burn of being reduced to shivering supplicants while being subjected to cruel comments from a man far below their personal levels of competence.  Woodward captures all that in his disturbing book.<br/><br/>Because of the immensity of his character pool and the foggy origins and complexity of the information he conveys, he sometimes gets lost or glosses over details that might clarify his message.  There are times in the book where all I can do is look away and try to figure out what  I just read.  Thoughts are left in limbo.  Events have no conclusion.  I understand the complexity of the job he undertook, but think it all seems a bit hurried as if the author needed to get the book finished before some new controversy arose.<br/><br/>Read it.  Digest it.  Stomp around in anger as I did over certain parts of the story.  Then settle down with your newspaper or your television and continue to watch the unfolding of a fool in the paradise he is attempting to establish.  Hopefully we’ll all survive his efforts.  Tellingly, Woodward ended his book with a kiss to Trump using the words of one of the President’s lawyers:  “You are a f***ing liar.”<br/><br/>Schuyler T Wallace<br/>Author of TIN LIZARD TALES
 I've read the first 3 chapters in this book.  Bob Woodward is not the writer I expected him to be.  There are too many subjects that he just jumps around on.  Not enjoyable.  Not informative.
 The title of this absorbing work comes from a statement made by candidate Donald Trump during an interview with Woodward in March 2016: “Real power is — I don’t even want to use the word — fear.” This epigram is a key theme of Pulitzer Prize-winner Bob Woodward’s book on the first year and a half of the Trump presidency. Woodward is first and foremost a journalist, and he puts these skills to excellent use in this book.<br/><br/>Woodward bases his work “primarily from multiple deep background interviews with first-hand sources,” although some material is garnered from other published sources appearing in newspapers and online resources such as Politico and The Hill as well as the memoirs of former FBI Director James Comey titled A Higher Loyalty, and of former Director of National Inelligence James Clapper titled Facts and Fears. Rounding out the breadth of Woodward’s sources are broadcasts such as NPR, and documents publicly available from online sources.<br/><br/>Woodward deftly weaves this abundance of resources into a frightening tale of a dysfunctional presidency and a chaotic White House. He shows clearly how Trump is unsuitable for the job as POTUS. On numerous occasions Trump ordered his staff to prepare documents for his signature, such as his intent to withdraw from the defense treaty with South Korea, only for those documents to be purloined at a later time by members of the President’s staff sneaking into the Oval Office and removing them from Trump’s desk. In doing so, they answered to “a higher loyalty” — the best interests of the country — rather than Trump’s ill-informed and off the cuff demands. This tactic was in large part successful due to the President’s short attention span.<br/><br/>It’s really appalling just how unsuitable Trump is for holding the office of the President. As President, he’s clearly in over his head — clear to everyone but himself. Trump is the embodiment of the Dunning-Kruger Effect. Time and time again he shows ignorance of basic economics, international relations, and, most critically, the task of governing. He demonstrates the folly of electing a businessman to the highest office of the land because he treats governing like a business, with a particularly monomaniacal interest in the costs of any policy measure. He insisted on the same business-like approach from his subordinates.<br/><br/>Like any good journalist, Woodward has done an excellent job of making his points without stating them directly; he leaves it to the readers to adopt their own interpretations and conclusions. His job is simply to recount the unvarnished facts. The book is by no means comprehensive. The action begins in 2010 when Trump begins to seriously consider running for the presidency, and concludes with the resignation of John Dowd in March 2018. Rather than attempting a comprehensive work, Woodward achieves his objectives with a more impressionistic approach.<br/><br/>The writing is clear although at times pedestrian. One sign of the book’s clarity is the speed at which the book can be read, and this book is an especially quick read. This is not a complaint, but, rather, a compliment to the author for writing such an accessible book. It’s unfortunate that this work most likely is to be read only by those who already are critical of the 45th President, when the book *should* be read by his supporters. This latter group, however, is likely to dismiss the book as “fake news.” Sigh.
 Award-winning investigative reporter, Bob Woodward sticks strictly to the viewpoints of others who dealt and deal with Donald Trump in the White House. How Trump got there is the result of a quest for a politically naive but famous millionaire who could be easily led.<br/><br/>Once Trump got into the White House, he gradually grew from malleable to rigid, cleaving to his outdated or ignorant opinions and desires, despite efforts to educate him. He ignores the reasoning of experts, claiming his instincts are superior to any plans they may lay. Those surrounding him live in fear of what world catastrophe he might cause. And they spend their time trying to get him to listen to logic and delaying or preventing the worst of his demands. One considered him a fourteen-year-old boy who never matured. He plays golf. He watches hours of TV every day. He vents through tweets. He eats junk food. He has little or no patience for presidential duties. Forcing reason and logic upon him doesn't change his opinions. And he lies.<br/><br/>While not surprised by much of what Woodward reports, we get an even clearer picture of  Trump and the circumstances surrounding him. I'm left wondering why Trump was chosen for the White House. Why, why, why? And I'm also awed by the heroics of those who keep our government functioning, even while faced with a president who never created his own fortune, who faced bankruptcy six times, who seems interested only in raking in money without paying, and who believes in blaming everyone but himself.
 Woodward doesn't offer much commentary here -- the book is mainly just accounts of conversations and incidents.  There's not much that really seemed new to me here, either; we've already gotten the general sense of what's going on from other books, and the news cycle.  And I guess I'm at the point of losing my sense of humor about the whole ridiculous business; reading FEAR has just left me feeling disgusted and depressed.  There was the anonymous NYT piece trying to tell us "don't worry, there are adults in the room" -- but this book makes even plainer than ever that the so-called adults in the room are not acting like adults and are not in charge; rather they're bowing and scraping, tippytoeing around a malevolent, undisciplined, overgrown-toddler Trump, trying to snatch breakables out of his reach and to mop up a little of the mess when they fail.  The book's viewpoint is from the center of craziness of Trumpland, but Woodward has some peculiar slants and omissions in what he chooses to present even from that position.  He seems to be denigrating the Mueller investigation to a surprising degree -- there's just the barest mention of the various indictments and convictions that have resulted from that -- and at the end of the book Woodward switches to the viewpoint of John Dowd, for a time Trump's lawyer, quoting him at much greater length than anyone else in the book.  As to be expected, Dowd puts a lawyerese, one-sided, nothing-to-see-here spin on the whole business, which seems especially perversely disingenuous in the light of Dowd's, and Woodward's, final conclusion, that Trump is an "effing liar".
 Newspaper reporting has been characterized – accurately, it seems to me – as the first draft of a formal written history.  That history, written later with more sources than the original newspaper account, is essentially always more accurate and complete, even given the writer’s bias, his point of view.  But there is another aspect of a newspaper account that renders it inferior to that of a later historian: the fact that it is written by a newspaperman, a person untrained in the craft of history, a man working under a very rapid deadline, a specialist concerned with the direct content of his story rather than its attachment to a larger – and, likely, much more important – picture, one that entails the broader canvas of culture and politics that may be completely unknown to the reporter, but is almost certainly seen by him as irrelevant to his urgent task, the narrow story at hand, the vital necessity to put the recorded verbiage into an indelible record.<br/>The work at hand, “Fear”, illustrates this dichotomy quite clearly.  While Bob Woodward is a reporter’s reporter, a newspaperman of impeccable credentials, and while this work only confirms that reputation, as a work defining an age, characterizing a period, it falls regrettably short.<br/>Woodward’s urgency, he tells us repeatedly both in this work and in interviews about this work, is related almost exclusively to the President’s temperament, and especially to his mercurial temper.  To have someone like this with his finger on the nuclear button is indeed seriously unsettling, to say the very least.  The author is no doubt doing a great public service in making this abundantly clear, warning us in no uncertain terms – through many different stories, from widely differing sources and over the entire period of this presidency – what an unstable, massively ignorant, fundamentally unfit being is occupying the White House.<br/>Comparisons are inevitable with Michael Wolff’s “Fire and Fury”.  While Woodward has the advantage of more than 6 months additional material, the result is – somewhat surprisingly – not in Woodward’s favor.  Wolff’s writing is far better, and his capacity to summarize and characterize with a turn of phrase or a barbed epithet is incomparably superior.  In fact, what we are witnessing here is the difference between a skilled writer and a journalist.<br/>The dryness and simplicity of Woodward’s style is dictated by his profession – he is a recorder of fact.  As such, it is inevitable that he be appalled by the “f..ing liar” (pp 209, 353, 357 and passim) in the White House.  Sadly, he does not recognize his own – and, more precisely, his profession’s – complicity in that reality, the compulsion to sell newspapers over the moral and political imperative to relegate the lies (while additionally naming them as such) to the back page.  More recently, in an interview with the right-wing zealot Hugh Hewitt, he plays into the interviewee’s hands by stating he, Hewitt, could not find evidence of collusion despite looking closely – as though he had any significant capacity to succeed in such a search (which requires sleuths of a very high caliber), and as though such a conclusion had any significant worth.  Further, it took an anonymous insider recently in the NYT to call DJT what he is, amoral, a summation that was somehow not possible for this author.  Finally, he never mentions a chief animating principle (if that is the right word) of Trump’s policy: to be ever and forever, anti-Obama.  You will not find the following in “Fear”: “It’s his only real position,” one European diplomat said. “He will ask: ‘Did Obama approve this?’ And if the answer is affirmative, he will say: ‘We don’t.’ He won’t even want to listen to the arguments or have a debate. He is obsessed with Obama.”  Woodward certainly explores Charlottesville and addresses racism, but only sotto voce.  Yet though there is nothing more central to understanding DJT and what animates his administration, from the man himself to Stephen Miller, it occupies only a relatively secondary role with Woodward.  In short, there is a level of simplicity and naivete here, in this book and in this man, that is striking.<br/>By organizing the work chronologically, the author had virtually guaranteed a yawn-inducing tale were it not for the unprecedentedly monstrous ignorance, flagrant vulgarity and profanation of this President and this Presidency.  Instead, the author has a huge audience guaranteed for this – inelegant, but detailed – chronicle..  He could have done so much better in addressing topics separately and examining them under the lens of comparative history, but his métier was determinative, and would permit nothing else.<br/>In sum, it is worth the cost and effort for its gathering of the evidence, but don’t expect more than a reporter – not a master word-merchant, not an historian, not an analyst – can deliver.
 this book is filled with lies, distortions, and typical woodward nonsense....don't waste your money on it
 Nothing new.
 Fear is the first Bob Woodward book I have read so I'm not sure if its his writing style or all of the "news" that comes out of the WH on a daily basis that often left me dazed and confused. It took me a month to read this book because I honestly could not read more than a few pages at a time.<br/><br/>Each chapter jumps from one issue to another and there were chapters that were cut up that discussed multiple issues which further led to confusion. It was hard to follow the thread. I think a discussion about one topic over a span of several chapters would have been much more efficient than trying to jump from one issue to another in a chronological order.<br/><br/>I will refrain from political talk but this book left me feeling what the title implies... we live in scary times and it greatly troubles me to know who is the current POTUS. God help us.
 Haven't you sometimes wanted to be a fly on the wall? Bob Woodward's new book FEAR: TRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE gives you that opportunity.<br/> We're all familiar, too familiar perhaps, with all the events that have taken place since the election of November 8, 2016. In this book we learn what went on behind the scenes. .Each of the forty two short chapters highlights a particular time or subject: domestic, international, economic, etc.  The main foci are the personalities, the people that were hired to staff the administration and cabinet, the people who left the administration, and the interactions among them, especially as they related to Donald Trump.  The f-bomb shows up in almost all the conversations.<br/> Six years before the election Steve Bannon, a producer of right-wing political films, and David Bossie, longtime House Republican investigator and conservative activist, learned something about the kind of man Donald Trump was:  a chameleon. They tried to tell him some of the problems he would have running as a Republican. For one, he had donated money to pro-choice candidates and spoke out in favor of movement.. Bossie told him he had to be pro-life and against abortion.  Trump said that he was against abortion and pro-life.  When told he had a pro-choice record. He said "That can be fixed.  You just tell me how to fix that.  I’m–what do  you call it? Pro-life. I'm pro-life, I'm telling you."<br/> He also had not voted Republican primaries. Trump insisted he " voted every time since he was 18, 20 years old." Not true.  Eighteen-year-olds did not get the right to vote in United States until 1971 when Trump was in his late 20s. Trump was shocked to find out that there are records of who votes every election. Also 80% of the donations he had given had been to Democrats. At first he denied that, then said he had to do that as bribes to run his business.<br/> One commonality is the effort some of the people around him made trying to get Trump to understand the reasons specific treaties and policies were in place and what would happen if he dismantled them. They were often unsuccessful. He didn't understand how our government works or his role in it. Worse yet, he didn't want to learn.  As Army Lieutenant General HR McMaster was told by Steve Bannon when the General was to meet with him the first time, "Don't lecture him he does like professors. He does like intellectuals. Trump was a guy who ‘never went to class. Never got the syllabus. Never took a note. Never went to a lecture. The night before the final, he comes in at midnight from the fraternity house, puts on a pot of coffee, takes your notes, memorizes as much as he can, walks and eight in the morning and gets a C.  And that's good enough.  He’s going to be a billionaire. Show up in your uniform.”<br/> After the election, when Trump was trying to close the borders to immigrants, Gary Cohn, president of Goldman Sachs, spoke in favor of open borders. "The employment picture was so favorable that the United States would run out of workers soon. So immigration had to continue.' We have many jobs in this country that Americans will do.'" Trump did not understand that if the government borrowed a lot of money through issuing bonds, the US deficit is increased. Trump's solution: print more money.<br/> In January 2017, Trump ordered a raid in Yemen. It was a disaster. He went to the ceremony when the first combat casualty’s body in his administration was brought home.  He was rattled and said he would never make any more trips to Dover. Later on, when he spoke with Goldstar families, he spent a lot of time speaking to them, talking about information he read in their personnel file. The problem was he was making it all up, saying what he thought they want to hear.<br/> Early on there was disagreement among the aides and staff about how to accomplish their goals. “We need to select the winning issues,” Stephen Miller, a policy advisor and speech writer, said.  They should run on the issues that were bad for the Democrats.  Son-in-law Jared Kushner strongly disagreed and favored bipartisanship, negotiation and compromise with the Democrats.  Chief of Staff Reince Priebus thought they knew how to work Congress to get the votes.  “A real estate developer from New York City like Jared didn't know much about politics.”  Kushner responded that most of the legislative discussions in the White House involved Priebus acolytes from the combative Republican national committee, or from former Senator Sessions office or from conservatives. None of them had experience negotiating bipartisan agreements are getting deals done. Extremists and people try to score political points were running the legislative intent agenda.<br/> Gary Cohn, National Economic Council Director tried to explain that the US absolutely needed to trade with China. If you Chinese and you want to really destroy us, to stop sending us antibiotics. “You know we don't really produce antibiotics United States? Some major antibiotics are not produced in the United States, including penicillin China sold 96.6% of all the antibiotics used here. We don't produce penicillin.”<br/> After he resigned (for reasons spelled out in FEAR), Trump’s lawyer John Dowd told him “They not going to impeach you….They’re a bunch of cowards, the whole town. The media, the Congress. They're gutless.”<br/> When Trump complained about the media. Dowd replied, “You're the one that didn't give up your tax returns.  You've already run one round one.”  He did not tell him what he really thought, “You’re a f...ing liar.”<br/> On the last page, there is a telling statement that has happened at the same time the book came out.  Things “happened that could change the ball game dramatically. Former top aide comes clean, admits to lying, turns on the president. Dowd didn’t think so but he had to worry and consider the possibility.”
 When I had heard that living legend Bob Woodward had written a book about Trump, I knew I had to read it. What was really going on in there? What was it like? Aside from the media, most of whom I do believe and respect, there was so much I didn't know.<br/><br/>Bob Woodward lets you in. You're sitting at the cabinet meetings and you hear him tear apart the country's best military leaders, enjoying the strife between certain people. We learn what makes Trump tick.<br/><br/>In a way, I started to feel sorry for Trump. Sometime, people are so convinced that they can do something that they'll sacrifice themselves completely in order to do it. Donald Trump really does believe he has what it takes to be the president. He doesn't understand most of what goes into it, but figures that anything can be fixed later. When his lawyer resigns because Trump won't agree not to testify, it's painfully obvious that he can't answer the 49 questions that Mueller has planned for him. It's just beyond him, but Trump cannot tolerate weakness in anyone, including himself.<br/><br/>There are some unexpected moments of kindness from Trump. I was struck by the time he took to call family members of the fallen, even adding complimentary things that weren't in the records to make the families feel better. It's not something that I saw coming.<br/><br/>On the other hand, you can really feel the toll that this has taken on all of the people who have (or had) worked with Trump. It's 1/3 trying to do their actual job, 1/3 trying to prevent Trump from doing something catastrophic, and 1/3 trying to keep from being fired.<br/><br/>In most cases, the sense is that Trump just doesn't feel emotions like the rest of us. After firing Priebus, and saying that they would make an announcement over the weekend, he had hired his replacement via Tweet as Priebus was being driven away. Hurt feelings and keeping your word just don't factor in that much for him.<br/><br/>The lack of knowledge that we are a part of a global world is alarming. Trump would be happy isolating the entire country and bring it back to the old days. With the exception of Peter Navarro, his entire staff warns him of the ramifications of doing things that lead to this, such as the steel tariffs, but Trump ignores data. He ignores graphs. He ignores facts because those facts are simply not enough.<br/><br/>This is a book that every American should have to read. The truth is that he's not always this true monster that we might imagine, though he certainly does have that side. He simply doesn't have any idea of what's going on and doesn't know that either.
 Bob Woodward is no stranger to the secrets within the Washington maelstrom of politics.  Co-Author of the Washington Post’s coverage of the Watergate scandal with Carl Bernstein and currently associate editor at the Washington Post, Woodward zeroes in on the political turmoil generated by Donald Trump during his campaign for president and his current embattled administration.  The book contains many source notes at the end along with a comprehensive index and current photographs of key individuals.<br/>  Exposed in all its shame we see how incompetent and undisciplined our politicians in the White House go about their duties.  Woodward cites examples of Ivanka or Jared dipping in and out of meetings, Kellyanne Conway weighing in on TV without coordinating with the press secretary, and Bannon acting as a strategist in an operation that has no strategy.  We see many examples of President Trump never bothering to read analyses written by his staff, his eight hours each day spent watching TV, and his impulsive behavior when making decisions on extremely important issues.  I’ve read many unfavorable reports about Trump’s abilities as president and his lack of leadership qualities but I found the content of this book much worse than I had ever imagined.  One of my own fears is that Trump will wake up in the middle of some night, send out a few Tweets, and the next morning find that we are now at war with North Korea, Russia, or some country in the Middle East.<br/> As I write this our Federal government has been shut down for twenty-eight days.  It seems to me that President Trump has “painted himself into a corner” with his obstinacy.  Why doesn’t he use his “awesome” deal-making skills to show some leadership and get the government opened again?
 This is even worse than I thought.  Trump is so STUPID.  When I tell people that, they respond, "Well, duh . . ."  However, while we know he appears dumb, we also know that he has low street cunning and is a master at appealing to his base, which means acting like the most obnoxious uncle at the barbecue, so I think we underestimate how stupid he really is.<br/><br/>For example, there's an early warning system, THAAD, to detect an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) launch out of North Korea.  Trump, for some reason, doesn't like the president of South Korea (unlike the dictator of North Korea) and broods that the South Koreans are taking advantage of us in trade, because we have a trade deficit with them, meaning only that we buy more stuff (televisions, refrigerators, autos) from South Korea than they buy from us, which is not a sinister plot - it just means people in the U.S. buy a lot of South Korean appliances.  South Korea is providing the land and infrastructure for THAAD, but we're providing the system.  Trump went ballistic when he heard this, and demanded that South Korea pay for the system, or that we put THAAD in Alaska or Portland instead, because jobs, I guess.  Jim Mattis, the defense secretary, replied that a stable relationship with South Korea (of which trade is a part) is key to preventing WWIII.  The South Koreans, by the way, aren't thrilled with THAAD because they're afraid that it might provoke the North, so President Moon spent political capital to get the system based in South Korea.  General Mattis also pointed out that it would take 17 seconds to detect a North Korean missile launch if THAAD is in South Korea.  If THAAD were in Alaska, it would take 15 minutes to detect a missile launch.<br/><br/>Okay, pretty obvious, right?  Not to Trump.  He keeps bringing up the subject and has to have this explained to him (by Mattis or Tillerson or Porter or Cohn or whoever).  He is absolutely fixated on the trade imbalance and South Korea's financial contribution to THAAD, not nuclear missiles headed to the U.S.  Trump staff people described having to repeat this argument so much it was like the moving Groundhog Day.  He would demand an Executive Order rescinding our trade agreement with South Korea and cancelling THAAD unless South Korea paid for it.  These draft orders would get written, and some Trump staffer would pull it off his desk.  By then, he'd forgotten all about it, so he didn't ask for the Executive Order until the next time he remembered to be outraged about the trade deficit.<br/><br/>The book is basically a collection of scary vignettes like this.  Trump won't read anything and he has the attention span of a King Cavalier Spaniel, so he can't be educated.  He also has an unnerving, unwavering faith in his gut feelings, despite the fact that so many of his prejudices and convictions are demonstrably wrong.  It's hard to believe he got a degree from Wharton and didn't get the message that tariffs are stupid, for example.<br/><br/>Bannon comes off as entertaining and Rob Porter comes off as surprisingly likeable, which means they must have been major sources.  Lindsey Graham comes across as Dr. Strangelove.
 First off, you can believe that “Fear" is the truth.  You don’t get to be Bob Woodward unless you are authoritative, trustworthy, check your facts (and protect your sources!).  He has done this since Nixon, and this book is no exception, although, as many have noted, you don’t need to go too far to see Bannon’s fingerprints on some stories.<br/><br/>Secondly, the book confirms what we already know - that the Trump White House is a disorganized mess and that the man at the top is a liar.  That much is not really news but Woodward unearths some juicy nuggets that make for interesting reading.<br/><br/>However, beyond the gossipy tidbits, the underlying narrative of the book caused me to ask the question “What will be the legacy of the Trump presidency?”  I suspect that two of the themes addressed in “Fear" will be the dominant issues, both driven by his failure to understand the economic benefit of trade deficits with trading partners:<br/>* Foreign policy - Trump has trouble grasping the nuances of policies that are not binary in nature (and he sees everything through a winning or losing prism).  Relationships with allies such as South Korea are multi-dimensional (economic and strategic) and impact the U.S. relationship with North Korea (and, by extension, with China) which is likely to be the major foreign policy issue of the next decade.  Trump believes that acting in an unpredictable, and at time confrontational, manner is the best way of dealing with an unpredictable, and at times confrontational, adversary.  He may be right - but he’ll likely give a few Generals some conniptions along the way.<br/>* Domestic policy - Trump clearly missed Economics 101 at Wharton, but Gary Cohn (and some others) tried to educate him - repeatedly.  As I write this review, the markets are in the sort of turmoil that Cohn warned him of.  The jury is still out on the impact of the tax cuts of 2017 (I suspect that the cost will outweigh the benefit), but the effects of tariff impositions against China, and their retaliation will be felt more quickly, and they are likely to hurt Trump’s base disproportionately.  This, rather than Mueller, may be his real undoing.  It is sad to note that the adults in the room were trying to promote an international response to China’s IP theft actions that would likely be far more effective in isolating China and forcing a change in its behavior when Trump pulled the trigger on tariffs.<br/><br/>I suspect that we’ll see another book from Woodward in the next few years chronicling the next chapter of the Trump era; whether that be a Mueller inspired implosion, a charismatic new Democratic leader taking over after the public wearies of four years of chaos, fear and lies — or an extension of the cult of politics as reality TV.<br/><br/>What happens then?  My theory of the case is that Trump clearly did not expect to win in 2016 but was using his candidacy as a launching pad to start a new conservative media platform.  Winning the election upset those plans and Fox was quick to fill the void by giving its talking heads free rein ( Rupert’s disdain for DJ was outweighed by his love of profit!).  As such, a symbiotic relationship developed - but at some point in the not-too-distant future Trump will not be president and Fox will be run by the more liberal children of Rupert.  What happens then?  Watch out for Trump TV run by Bill Shine and starring some of the Fox faces you have come to love/hate and starring - The Celebrity President!
 From the guy who brought you those coffee-table favorites of years yon, such as Bob Does Bill Clinton(The Agenda), Bob Does Emperor George(Bush at War et al), and Bob Does Barry(Obama at War), Bob Woodward brings you, Fear: Trump in the White House.  Yeah, Bob does the Donald.  Who woulda thunk it, huh?<br/><br/>So, what does Bob “do”?  Basically Bob interviews.  Whomever he can.  From these interviews, collected together, Bob develops a narrative.  Bob ain’t much for scissors and pasting from other sources—his endnotes in this book run under 30 pages.  This is something which used to be known as investigative journalism, way back in the day.  This means—in theory anyway—that the content is derived from sources offering truthful renderings of personal thoughts as well as situations and dialogues he or she happened to be present for, with very little content by the author devoted to analysis.  Or so it would seem.  I believe Bob does hide some stuff for his discerning readers.  Structuring a narrative in itself can serve a particular interpretation, too.  But this is what Bob does and if you’ve read any earlier volume from his “presidential” series, this offering will feel very familiar to you.<br/><br/>Fear is a fun title for a Bob Woodward book.  Usually his books are entitled with a distinct lack of poetry, if not bereft of any imagination.  Woodward gets his title this time from an interview he had with Trump in 2016, the candidate lecturing Woodward and others on what power means to him(Trump): “Real power is—I don’t even want to use the word—fear.”  Maybe this isn’t quite the reveal Bob thinks it to be.  Perhaps Steve Bannon had been reading Machiavelli to him before bedtime and that’s just what stuck.  You know, the paleo-conservative version of audiobooks...  What is also distinctive about this book from others past is that Trump and his administration refused officially to cooperate with Woodward.  Because of this, much of Woodward’s material obviously comes from folk who have left the administration after its first year.  Needless to say, this can distort the narrative.  I’m not sure it can be avoided given the circumstances, but it’s important to acknowledge it.<br/><br/>So what does the narrative of Fear provide for the reader?  For this reader, I can say that Donald Trump comes across as more empathetic than he had in the past for me.  I’m inclined to think this wasn’t Woodward’s intention, though.  Trump comes across in these pages as a very average, all too average American.  His ego is limitless; his limitations rival his ego in grandeur.  He’s insecure.  He’s provincial.  Yeah, apparently you can live in Manhattan much of your life and still be provincial.  His education is haphazard in its appearances, but more often than not completely a void.  He doesn’t understand even the most rudimentary rules of economics.  Why can’t you just print more money?, he asks Gary Cohn.  Yikes!  His solutions are simplistic.  Why can’t we just leave Afghanistan?, he queries Mattis &amp; McMaster.  Why can’t we just leave South Korea?, he goads and goads Tillerson.  He lashes out at his Staff Secretary to “Bring me my tariffs!”  Again, his ignorance in economic affairs is blistering.  He watches too much TV.  He spends too much time on social media posting inappropriate items, both personal and professional.  He doesn’t listen if he doesn’t feel like it.  He has opinions on everything, offers them with cocksure authority, but has little more to back them up other than personal preference.  He refuses to learn.  Yeah.  He is truly the average American.  Sometimes you can’t help but sympathize with him a little, though.  As his advisors attempt to persuade him to stay the course in Afghanistan for fear that the abandoned country might serve as a training center for terrorists, a reader might agree with ol’ 45 that other countries can suit that purpose almost as easily.  Where does this logic end?  And what’s its price tag in dollars and lives?  Woodward slips into a little analysis on this point.  He mentions via an unnamed State official that the illicit economy in drugs and illegal mining rivals in size its legal economy.  From this the reader can jump to the conclusion that much of Afghanistan’s “legitimate” economy is funded primarily by American dollars.  A Brannon comment, that a trillions dollars was spent there to turn the greatest fighters in the world into the worst army in the world, gives the reader an understanding of what one faction around Trump felt about the return of value for the buck.  My interpretation of Steve Bannon changed after reading Fear, too.  Prior to it, I had thought Steve a straight hack.  After reading it, I know Steve’s a crank.  The difference between is large.  Bannon has some great lines in this book.  Some are funny: When told early on that Trump was thinking of running for a President, Bannon quipped “of what country?”  Some sound smart.  Bannon parried talk of getting tough with North Korea by stating that until six figure casualties in the first half hour on the Southern side could possibly be avoided in the course of any North Korean military engagement then maybe we should leave well enough alone.  It’s in the context of Russia, though, that Bannon seems to serve as a vehicle for Woodward’s analysis.  Bannon shrugs off the Russian threat by comparing its GDP to that of New York State.  This is factually accurate, albeit enemies can’t be competently assessed based solely by their economic might.  Where this tidbit gets interesting is Woodward’s purposeful comparison of Russia’s economy with South Korea’s a couple of pages later, which is declared to be the 11th largest in the world.  This, too, is accurate.  Far from the backwater Bannon would have us image Russia to be, in terms of GDP it ranks as an important state, although one standing in the deep shadow of China and its robust economy—which was really Bannon’s point.  What I believe to be Woodward’s point is that even large, activist nations rather pale by comparison with the United States’ massive GDP, perhaps serving to prompt the alert reader to question if America ain’t truly great already, which country is?  In the end, this sober scrutiny of America’s true economic position in the world might cast off much of the dark shadows surrounding Trump’s nationalist ideology.<br/><br/>The last chapter is devoted to the Mueller investigation and the book ends with the resignation of Trump’s personal attorney, John Dowd.  There’s a quite a bit of conversation recorded by Woodward between Trump and his counsel.  So much for client privilege, I guess.  One does wonder how this material made it into Fear.  Dowd has outright denied some of Woodward’s quoted material attributed to him; in particular, he denies ever calling or referring to Trump, his client, as a liar.  Whereas Woodward ends precisely on this downbeat tone, there are moderate stakes for both the author and attributee.  Dowd however, to my knowledge, has not called Woodward a liar.  In this era of post-truth, maybe that’s the best one can hope for now.
 Note that I'm reviewing this book without any prior knowledge about Woodward other than the fact that he's a journalist who is instrumental in the downfall of Nixon.<br/><br/>First, I must commend Woodward on the thorough research that he and his team poured into this book.  The details show in the way the stories unfold in the book, and it really felt that you're a fly on the wall in the borderline-insane conversations happening in the WH and around Trump.<br/><br/>If you've been following the news and reading this president's tweets, you'll come to realize that there's no new information here about the major stories about Trump: Comey's firing, Mueller investigation, North Korea/China, the Middle East, immigration, and trade/tariffs.  In fact it's missing some of the more recent ones like the NFL players kneeling down on the national anthem, Kavanaugh and the Saudi's so-called involvement in murder of a prominent journalist who has been vocal against Trump.  What this book added, which I think is equally important, is the major players around how Trump arrived at the decisions/actions with the situation at hand...particularly Bannon, Tiller, Cohn, Porter, and Dowd towards the end of the book.  I must admit that I found it a bit odd that people Omarosa nor Giuliani was not  in the book...and Spicer and Conway are barely mentioned.<br/><br/>However, I have a few but glaring issues on the way this book is written.  Primarily on how the supporting players are almost depicted as protagonists in the book, albeit probably not intentionally.  The reader needs to remind himself that these people that surrounded Trump are enablers and are also responsible in the state that this country is in today: Cohn is one of the architects of the disastrous tax cuts that benefitted corporations; Tillerson is an ex-CEO of Exxon and this has so much conflict of interest with him being the SoS...among others.<br/><br/>Second is that there is not much information about Trump's connection with the Kremlin.  The Kremlin is barely a focus on this book at all.  Perhaps that's intentional so as not to cripple the ongoing investigation, because the ties between Trump and the Kremlin and its contribution to conspiracy and obstruction of justice is yet to be proven.<br/><br/>Other major players in the WH, particularly Trump brothers, Ivanka and Jared Kushner, and their dealings with businesspeople that affects how this government operates is sparsely mentioned.  Again, maybe it's by design since Trump children and Kushner may be implicated in this whole conspiracy.<br/><br/>Another is how the Republican Party and its ineffectiveness to stand for its founding principles and complicity (particularly McConnell and Graham) that helps Trump propel towards Authoritarianism.<br/><br/>I mean I have other issues with this book that I'd rather not mention here because this review is too long already. :)<br/><br/>Now with the final criticism.  It never really made sense to give the title "FEAR" when there's not much in there about why Trump embodies and/or project the use of fear.  It's more apparent that he's so self-absorbed and has the propensity to lie to make himself look good.  And ultimately, his fragile ego is what's contributing to our path towards Fascism.
 Among his keenest supporters and among his strongest detractors, attitudes about Donald Trump are largely set at this point.<br/><br/>What, then, of those who may have voted for Trump but who are not members of his hard core base? Or those who, whether or not they voted for Trump, believe we should be concerned about regions of our country being left behind in the 21st Century economy, who may embrace tougher negotiations on trade, who want a fresh look at our immigration policies, who think our NATO allies should commit more of their national budgets for our common defense, etc.? These are all legitimate policy issues and by studying and effectively addressing these Donald Trump could have been the catalyst for a fresh look at American policy and an examination of rational solutions.<br/><br/>Alas, as Woodward outlines in specific and overwhelming detail, Trump’s dysfunctional presidency seems incapable of addressing issues that ought to be part of thoughtful discussion and carefully crafted solutions.<br/><br/>For example, can our trade negotiations more effectively address legitimate concerns about Chinese theft of American intellectual property? If we impose new tariffs, what is the net impact on American on the price of goods and the place of American manufacturing in a global supply chain? Is it possible to achieve a net increase in jobs among our declining industries without jeopardizing overall job creation and American competitiveness? If a region is making buggy whips, is the solution federal disincentives for those who want to buy an internal combustion engine?<br/><br/>With regard to foreign policy, how do we work to adjust multilateral agreements to the demands of the 21st Century? How do we avoid carelessly undermining the institutions that the World War II generation fought to establish and that have contributed not only to US prosperity but that of our allies, and that have secured decades of peace?<br/><br/>On immigration, what are our priorities and what policies strengthen our nation and attract the kind of immigrants who will create jobs overall and secure American competitiveness in world markets?<br/><br/>As Woodward’s book demonstrates, none of these issues (or many others such as the problems of Iran or North Korea) are being addressed thoughtfully by this administration. Trump is a leader who is erratic, unpredictable, lacks integrity, and has neither the patience nor inclination to study a situation in depth. He has no interest in seeking comprehensive, diverse advice to inform a coherent and sustained decision.<br/><br/>In Woodward’s account, many in the cabinet and the West Wing are trying hard to help the president understand his options and the consequences of his decisions. Sadly Trump has misinformed but deeply held prejudices in areas such as trade and immigration. On issues in which Trump has long held opinions, his mind is made up and he refuses to be confused by facts.<br/><br/>These are concerns that go beyond Trump’s egregious rhetoric and his verbal attacks on a free press, the judiciary, minorities, and legislators on both sides of the aisle. This is a man who could provoke World War III, who is isolating the U.S. by alienating our long-standing allies, and who is strengthening the hand of our adversaries such as Russia.<br/><br/>Woodward portrays a situation where, best case scenario, we muddle through largely because a dysfunctional White House is incapable of achieving much. As an alternative, we are presented with the possibility in which a Trump White House causes great damage to the United States and to the world at large.<br/><br/>Hard core Trump supporters are unlikely to read this book or have their opinion changed if they do. Although author Bob Woodward is factual and avoids polemics about Trump’s rhetoric and personal behavior, this group will be convinced of bias and skeptical that the Woodward’s sources are “real”.<br/><br/>Those already appalled by Trump will have their concerns confirmed and, indeed, finish the book thinking, “This is far worse than I could possibly have imagined.”<br/><br/>At the end of the day, we must look to the third group of voters (neither Trump true believers nor those who in 2016 voted against Trump and will do so again) to restore sanity in the White House. If this group,  concerned about legitimate issues and the true basis of American strength and leadership, comes to appreciate that the emperor has no clothes, they will sway the presidential election in 2020. Bob Woodward’s book underscores the importance of mobilizing this group of voters.
 By now the tumultuous presidency of Donald Trump has become something of a legend. Derided and despised by his critics, though still adored by his base, Trump's White House has already been through multiple shakeups and crises. Collected here is Bob Woodward's reporting on Trump's campaign (a bit) and his first year in office from the perspective of those who served under him. Although Woodward's sources are anonymous (to be expected when leaking sensitive material to a journalist) it seems the key players in his book are Steve Bannon, Reince Preibus, Rob Porter, and Gary Cohn (certainly Bannon has a history of talking to the press a la Michael Wolff's book Fire and Fury). Woodward paints a picture of a White House unable to keep the president focused and on point with many of the cabinet members butting heads with Trump when he would make rash decisions or sudden reversals on policy. Perhaps the most notable and terrifying moment Woodward relays is Trump's continued efforts to pull the US out of the KORUS trade deal with South Korea which most of his advisers cautioned against due to the threats from North Korea. Despite the fact that Woodward's sources indicate it was explained to Trump over and over that a stable relationship with the South is vital to keeping Kim Jong Un's regime in check, Trump simply refused to understand why the trade deal was paramount to that (or way it was ideal for the US' THAAD missile detection system to be positioned on the Korean peninsula). Woodward writes that Cohn and Porter would literally steal documents off of the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office to prevent Trump from officially cancelling the KORUS agreement. Fear is a must read for anyone interested in or concerned by the current political climate in the days of Trump. The insights into Trump's hectic White House are plentiful, though the book does end rather abruptly (perhaps due to the fact that the players who were potentially Woodward's main sources had all either been fired or left on their own after the first year was up). Woodward also doesn't include much of any personal judgement or editorializing in the book; these are just the events as he was told them.
 Everyone’s worst fears about the maniac running amok in the White House among aides too cowardly or ineffectual to stop him are confirmed by 300+ pages of mostly quoted observations by the people who were there and witnessed or participated in the chaos. Nothing really new here, however, to anyone who has followed the lurching course of trump’s attempted dictatorship masquerading as a presidency.<br/><br/>There are a couple of things, though, that Woodward—perhaps blinded by his own intense dislike for Trump— doesn’t notice about his subject. One: although the man has a million horrible qualities, he is NOT stupid, not, as Rex Tillerson called him, “a f---ing moron.” He’s no intellectual, he’s poorly educated, pig-headed and willfully ignorant, but he has a native shrewdness, and he sometimes asks excellent questions, especially about established policies. Furthermore, he knows how to defend himself and above all, he knows how to sow fear, neither of which stupid people are capable of doing.<br/><br/>Two: not everything he favors is ignorant or disastrous. He wonders repeatedly why our NATO allies aren’t contributing their fair monetary share to that alliance. In the immediate aftermath of WWII those countries were prostrate and needed our help, but now many are the most prosperous countries in Europe. He’s right— they should be contributing more. And he repeatedly asks, along with a lot of ordinary Americans: WTF are we doing in Afghanistan?<br/><br/>Who thought nerdy Reince Priebus would be capable of this vivid description of the Trump WH? “If you have natural predators at the table, things don’t move. Why? Because when you put a snake and a rat and a falcon and a rabbit and a shark and a seal in a zoo without walls, things start getting nasty and bloody. That’s what happens.”<br/><br/>Another thing Woodward ignores: If Trump is a loose cannon careening around on the deck of the Ship of State and ignoring the Constitution, Pence is a tightly secured cannon aimed directly at the Constitution— he’s openly declared that he puts his belief in the bible before his obligation to defend the Constitution. That's every bit as frightening as any of Trump's beliefs and behaviors.
 Much has been written about the 2016 presidential election. Scholars and political commentators have devoted many pages to their take on how Donald Trump was elected to the highest political office in the country. It seems like each week brings a new insight into the dysfunctional goings on in the White House. As members of Trump's administration either step down or are fired, they each are ready to publish their "tell-all" book with firsthand accounts of just how defective the American political system has become. With each new revelation that would be considered shocking in any other administration, the President simply brushes them off as "fake news."<br/><br/>Enter two time Pulitzer winning journalist Bob Woodward. Woodward is like the antithesis of fake news. He was one of the key journalists involved in exposing the Watergate scandal during Nixon's presidency and has provided authoritative reporting about every president since. In his newest book Fear: Trump in the White House, Woodward presents a startling portrait of the way Trump leads the country.<br/><br/>I'll start by saying that Fear presents little in the way of new revelations. Rather, Woodward provides a meticulously documented portrait that confirms the things we already know and fear about our President. Woodward confirms that Trump has a short attention span, is prone to knee-jerk/uninformed decisions, and simply denies any claims of facts that are counter to what he is trying to do. "You've got to be strong. You've got to be aggressive. You've got to push back hard. You've got to deny anything that's said about you. Never admit it."<br/><br/>The true marvel of Woodward's Fear is not in the contents of its pages (although much of what is reported is pretty terrifying for anyone who believes in the order of the US government) but in the way in which it is documented. Michael Wolff's book Fire and Fury presented many of the same topics and retellings that Woodward's book does. Wolff's fatal flaw was that he did not document his sources. That simply doesn't work in Trump's era of fake news. Woodward remedies this by providing comprehensive footnotes and sources. Each quote or claim is backed by documented interviews, recordings, or press footage. Simply put, there is no denying that what Woodward has written is true. Fear, like the countless other books about Trump's White House, will likely do little to change the opinions of the President's supporters or detractors. It will, however, serve as verifiable historical documentation of the bizarre and downright insane reign of our current President.
 Quote: "I am the president," Trump said. "I can fire anybody that I want. They can't be investigating me for firing Comey. And Comey deserved to be fired! Everybody hated him. He was awful."<br/><br/>Quote: Trump liked to do things spur of the moment, Porter concluded. He liked to fly by the seat of his pants. He acted like doing too much advance preparation would diminish his skills in improvising. He did not want to be derailed with forethought. As if a plan would take away his power, his sixth sense. What the president would bring up in the morning was most often what he had seen on television, especially Fox News.<br/><br/>Quote: Tweets were often triggered by the president's obsessive television watching. Television was Trump's default activity.<br/><br/>Quote: Trump gave some private advice to a friend about women, saying real power is fear. It's all about strength. Never show weakness. You've always got to be strong. Don't be bullied. There is no choice. "You've got to deny, deny, deny and push back on these women," he said. "If you admit to anything and any culpability, then you're dead. You've got to come out with guns blazing and just challenge them. You've got to be aggressive. You've got to push back hard. You've got to deny anything that's said about you. Never admit."<br/><br/>Quote: The president has zero psychological ability to recognize empathy or pity in any way.<br/><br/>Quote: All presidents are audience driven, but Trump's central audience was often himself. He kept giving himself reviews. Most were passionately positive. Much of his brain was in the press box.<br/><br/>Quote: (Gary Cohn speaking to Porter) Things are just crazy here. They're so chaotic. He's never going to change. It's pointless to prepare a meaningful, substantive briefing for the president that's organized, where you have a bunch of slides, because you know he's never going to listen. We're never going to get through it. He's going to get through the first ten minutes and then he's going to want to start talking about some other topic."<br/><br/>Quote: (Priebus gave an assessment after leaving the White House) He believed he had been surrounded in the West Wing by high ranking natural born killers with no requirements to work. They were roving like interlopers, a band of chaos creators. There was Ivanka, a charming huntress dipping in and out of meetings or the latest presidential business. Jared had the same rights. Their's was a portfolio without experience. Kellyanne Conway had license to weight in on television interviews at will. Then there was Bannon, a strategist in an operation that had none. He came forward to enter discussions seemingly at random or when he needed something to do.
 President Donald Trump has been nothing but a disaster for the country ever since his election in 2016. The horrors of that election in 2016 are still being felt today. Trump's presidency has Americans yearning for the days of George W. Bush. We could have better handled Jeb Bush as president. If it had been Jeb vs Hilary, it would have been a more fair fight. If Jeb had won, I could sleep better at night.<br/><br/>Unlike his predecessors, Trump has divided this country and brought out ugliness, hatred and anger. Bob Woodward has written a terrifying account about Trump as ill-equipped and ignorant about the constitution and foreign policies.<br/><br/>This book only confirmed my worst fears about Trump. I hope America can survive this presidency. I dread a second term for him. May God help us all.
 What comes through loud and clear in Bob Woodward’s Oz-like curtain reveal is that Donald Trump is out of his depth; that he cannot grasp how government functions, let alone how international relations work; that he cannot seem to budge from his own preconceived notions on authority, trade, and any number of other subjects; that he’s not capable of learning; that he can’t take advice and dislikes anybody tagged as an expert; that he enjoys winning, only winning by his definition, at any cost; that something is good when it benefits him; that he yearns for total control, like he exercised in his business; that he seems to have no long or short term memory; and that he lies about everything to everybody. His incompetency shines through on nearly every page.<br/><br/>Woodward writes simply. He threads through the major topics well known to anybody who follows the news by whatever method they choose. These are trade, international relations, the DPRK challenge, being personally liked, reliance on personal relations with authoritarian leaders, lambasting of the free press, and, of course, Robert Mueller and the Russia investigation. We see how Trump manages, or more correctly, mismanages. Much of this has to do with insistence on his immutable ideas, his method of end running pretty much everybody who works for him, his knack for taking advice from exactly the wrong people (e.g., the likes of Peter Navarro and Wilbur Ross), his penchant for undermining his staff (from Kelley to Porter to Priebus to McMaster, most history now), and perhaps what will be most fatal to him, not listening to his competent lawyers, particularly John Dowd.<br/><br/>As for his demagoguery, what’s more distressing than what he spouts on his ongoing, ceaseless campaign rallies is how calculated and cynical these pronouncements are. Does Trump believe in anything, that is other than his brand, his sable genius, and profit? Apparently not.<br/><br/>Part of the enjoyment of reading Fear is seeing that what his better advisors warned about are coming to pass. At the very moment of this writing, the economy is top of mind. Trump inherited a strengthening economy and seems intent on reversing all that’s good about it. This passage, then, is very telling, not only about how Trump operates, but how he defers to his worst advisors and how he introduces his reckless business practices (recall he declared bankruptcy six times) into national affairs:<br/><br/>“ Gary] Cohn knew the real battle was going to be over tariffs, where Trump had the most rigid views and where he could do the most damage to the U.S. and world economies. He shoveled all the data he could to the president about how tariffs on imported steel would be a disaster and hurt the economy.<br/><br/>“A 17-page document that Cohn sent contained a chart showing the minuscule revenue earned in 2002-03 when President Bush had imposed steel tariffs for similar reasons. It showed that the revenue that came in was $650 million. That was .04 percent of the total federal revenue of $1.78 trillion ….<br/><br/>“Tens of thousands of U.S. jobs had been lost in industries that consumed steel, Cohn said, and produced a chart to prove it.<br/><br/>“Trump had three allies who agreed with him that trade deficits mattered: Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, Peter Navarro and Bob Lighthizer, the U.S. trade representative.<br/><br/>“Navarro said that the data did not include the jobs created in the steel mills under the Bush tariffs of 2002-03.<br/><br/>“‘You’re right,’ Cohn said. ‘We created 6,000 jobs in steel mills.’”<br/><br/>“‘Your data is just wrong,’ Navarro said.<br/><br/>“Trump was determined to impose steel tariffs. ‘Look,’ Trumps aid, ‘we’ll try it. If it doesn’t work, we’ll undo it.’<br/><br/>“‘Mr. President,’ Cohn said. ‘that’s not what you do with the U.S. economy.’ Because the stakes were so high, it was crucial to be conservative. ‘You do something when you’re 100 percent certain it will work, and then you pray like hell that you’re right. You don’t do 50/50 with the U.S. economy.’<br/><br/>“‘If we’re not right,’ Trump repeated, ‘we roll them back.’”<br/><br/>And there you have it, the Trump presidency in a nutshell. So, if you’re worried, you have good cause to be. If you’re not, perhaps you should read Fear as soon as you can.
 Bob Woodward had to be a fly on the wall if you believe he was privy to all the conversations, meetings and events he writes about in “Fear”. It’s as if he was present during the daily operations of the Trump administration.  Obviously he wasn’t but he had to have access to all the personnel he quotes and they had to be willing to divulge all of the details of their struggles with the president.  This becomes hard to believe when you realize some of the characters he quotes pledged their loyalty to and even fondness for Mr. Trump.  It is clear that Trump did not approve of this publication given that he refused to be interviewed by the author. Yet Woodward writes with such detail even the fly on the wall would have difficulty acquiring this information with such thoroughness. At the beginning of the book Woodward does try to explain how he gathered all the intelligence for this book.  He does, however, sound like he was aware of more of the goings on of the Trump administration than even the players themselves.<br/><br/>Briefly I will say that the author lays out in detail that many of those who worked with the president thought he was a moron, not fit for the office and a danger to the well being of the country. He doesn’t listen to advisers, read important position papers prepared for him, understand any of the intricacies of our relationships with other nations and he instead reacts to situations with the rashness of a child and will prevaricate when ever it suits his purposes. The title of the book is appropriate.  I finished the book feeling trepidation for the future of our country.
 Really, did anyone not imagine something like this could happen in the executive branch?  It may not be as bad you imagined but no doubt Mr. Woodward’s book will affirm some elements of the worst-case scenario when someone as polarizing and with only the most cursory knowledge of our internal politics comes to lead the most powerful country in the world.  Politically, I have very little against our president but perhaps that is only because I know so little about him yet what little I know grew into something out of a fish out of water drama comedy.<br/><br/>“Fear” is Bob Woodward’s memoir into election and first half of Trump’s presidency in which he elaborates specific events that highlight’s president Trump’s ignorance and political inefficacy regarding economics, war, and the range of politics from his interaction with the other branches of government to the broader influence of the citizenry he represents.  The picture Mr. Woodward creates is scathing – starting with then candidate Trump’s interaction with Steve Bannon, President Trump is depicted as a somewhat removed yet influential man whose only prospects to win the election was his brash personality.  By contrasting himself against both Hillary Clinton and politicians in general, Trump wins the Republican nomination and ultimately the presidency on some incredible claims only to have them confront the realpolitik – the realm of politics based on practical rather than ideological consideration.  What elapses for the rest of the book are series of literal arguments between President Trump’s election staff now turned all series of presidential assistants, advisors, and deputies as they come in conflict with generals, economists, attorneys, and other politicians as the parties balance their influence like so much plate spinning.  The methods used are almost comical. Starting with a story with how staff purposely hide any documents they do not read or signed, president Trump comes off as manic as he struggles to lead and fulfill his promises while staff do everything in their power to prevent him from executing his most provocative acts.  From completely pulling out of Korea and Afghanistan or undoing international negotiations, President Trump has both been pushed and pulled into doing so by the most daring members who are willing to provoke his ire or stroke his ego.<br/><br/>For all the confrontational anecdotes, the writing was somewhat dry.  Basing my review on the audiobook version, the tone is more matter of fact as both author and narrator recount events like an uncensored local news broadcast that eventually wears on all the but the most ardent Trump critic.  As history tells us, Trump’s presidency has bounced from conflict to criticism that has become a norm and coincidentally, you probably have already about if you are a critic of president Trump or follow political news and rumor.  I am a person who is not very political, finishing this book was more of a chore than pleasurable and the only thing I really got out of is how far President Trump is out his element as his personality and politics begin to clash with everyone around him.  Nevertheless, I am glad I listened to it though – I probably would have never finished trying to read the book.
 Bob Woodward has done an amazing job of filling in the blanks of the news stories we have all heard in the past 18 months. As a book of new revelations, it falls short of its hype and all the reactions that have come out regarding it being a pack of revealing truths or just a bunch of lies. Well researched, the book is a monument to further understanding the characteristics of a President who apparently bathes himself in the aura of yes-men and stomps on those who dare to cross him or seem to want to control his erratic impulses with concrete researched arguments for numerous causes. The characteristics of President Trump that stand out and seem to govern both what he can accomplish and why his major accomplishment list is so low, despite having complete political party control of Congress. These traits include hyper-attention to worthless minutia, high distractibility, a flash-point temper when confronted with opposition, and a penchant for micromanagement, all of which contribute to his inability to focus and make major grand scale decisions that can then be worked on by his more specialized and experienced cadre of secretaries and generals. Time and again as the books cycles through the topics of nuclear disarmament of Korea and Iran, our troop involvement in Afganistan, solving key points on immigration, building a sustainable economy, or dealing with international diplomacy through current treaties and accords, the reader will see how the discussions go off topic, spark Presidential outbursts of anger and acrimony against experts in military, economic, legal and diplomatic fields, leading to humiliation and the resignations of key persons dedicated to “making it work” for America. Any reader who has raised teenagers will empathize with the men and women who stick it out and try to bring order out of the constant chaos created by a President who would rather shout diatribes against the latest commentator blips coming out of FOX or CNN News. Those readers who are upholders of ‘Due Process’ will be aghast at the trivial manner in which our President tweets messages to cast off and take on high level appointed employees of our government. Here is the profile a man who will use his kowtowing aides for his own purposes until he deems them worthless and then capriciously cast them off with no more than a shrug of his shoulders, the way a snake slides out of an old skin and slithers on its one-track mind way. Does the book engender its title, “FEAR”? Yes. If you are a loyal American citizen you will wonder at the men and women in high places, including the hundreds of Congressional leaders who make up a third of our governmental process, who have smiled and kowtowed while viewing the Presidency’s new clothes, but remain sitting on their thumbs for eighteen months while nothing gets done and our country lives in an era of trying to erase the past and never focusing on a clear mission for our future. I didn’t enjoy the book, but I am extremely glad I read it.
 “PETA, HEARING THE WISDOM IN THAT WHICH THESE OLD ONES SPOKE, HAD PONDERED AN OLD TRIBAL CUSTOM THAT DEMANDED THE KILLING OF ANY MAN WHO SPOKE AN UNTRUTH OR WHO WITHHELD TRUTH. THE OLD, OLD DAKOTAH HAD RECOGNIZED THAT WHOEVER DELIBERATELY MISREPRESENTS FACT ALSO WILL BREAK CUSTOMS, BREAK RULES. WHY LET LIVE A DESTROYER OF MUTUAL CONFIDENCE, THEY HAD SAID; KILL HIM BEFORE HE TWICE DESTROYS, BEFORE HIS MISCHIEF CORRUPTS THE TRIBE.”<br/><br/>HANTA YO BY RUTH BEEBE HILL<br/><br/>Bob Woodward’s Fear, will be the go too text for future historians when (if there are future historians) our children children’s children look back trying to figure out what caused this age of fear and craziness that is our current Trump presidency.<br/>It feels like ancient history, the 2016 campaign, now and then the first year there must be at least a hundred major scandals involving Trump his family and his appointees. I’m exhausted and numb following this and that is just the first year which is what this book covers I guess I miss the part about him and the energy he creates, I don’t get it but he does reach a certain segment of white society, he got elected, with some help from Russia, and spent the first year breaking customs, attacking our allies, changing our environmental, economic, and political relationships, no preparation, just all how he feels at the moment, fly by the seat of his pants, and tear everything apart.<br/>How bad is it worse than you know, and that is kind of the message I’ve gotten from all the books I’ve have read about this white house especially this one which is even more effective in it’s quite just laying out very clearly and deliberately all the players and their relationships to each other and how they either had their own agenda’s and were using Trump to achieve their goals or were encouraging Trump’s own worse attitudes or they genuinely were shocked by his stubbornness and ignorance, either way this is a long long not going to end well crash of a Presidency. (My opinion)<br/>So I’m sitting with my teachers friends at lunch and one Special Ed teacher speaks out against efforts to place ED (emotional disturbed) students with the Autistic students. Reason being the ED’s are chaos driven and they are modeling disruptive negative behavior for Autistic students. (light bulb moment) Ahhh I said, that sounds like congress. The Republicans (ED party) is modeling this behavior for the Democrats nerdy emotionally detached people. This has been happening in a systematic way for a number of years now I’m afraid our body politic has devolved to being a empty suit of bare bones, all emotion and fear creating a political sort of zombie apocalypse with red and blue teams this book adds substantiation to this fear that that what I just described is actually the case
 I did learn a couple of new things by reading this book. One was that only one of Trump's advisors, Peter Navarro, favored Trump's trade wars. Everyone else was a free-trader, and argued against imposing tariffs. The other was that an Afghan official told Trump the Chinese were extracting minerals from Afghanistan, and Trump immediately went to his people and demanded that the U.S. get involved in that. What were we there for? We should be in  there getting the minerals! His advisors tried to explain to him that there was no American policy that justified such a rapacious approach, and that it would look bad in the world's eyes, etc. In other words, they tried to give Trump a legal and strategic view, and, as we know, Trump doesn't understand law and is incapable of strategic thinking, because he is "transactional," meaning he can only keep one thing in his mind at a time. Going in and robbing Afghanistan of its minerals is, I guess, what his followers meant when they said Trump would "run the government like a business."<br/><br/>Beyond those two scenes, there wasn't a great deal that we haven't seen covered in the news, although there was a bit more detail, toward the end of the book, about some of the negotiations between Special Counsel Mueller and Trump's former lawyer, John Dowd. Dowd apparently quit because he feared Trump would not take his advice to refuse to talk to Mueller. Dowd didn't think Trump would have much liability so long as he didn't testify, but that if he testified, he'd be toast, because he'd be a sucker for a perjury trap. Woodward ends the book on this note, that Dowd knew Trump was "a f---ing liar."  That's not exactly news, though.<br/><br/>The big question going forward (and the book can't answer it) is whether Mueller has something more than what Dowd was able to conclude that he had. Dowd was worried about it, but didn't think what he'd seen amounted to much. So we're still waiting on that one.<br/><br/>As others have pointed out, Woodward's writing is nothing to brag about. I remember the scene in the movie, "All the President's Men" where Bernstein (played by Dustin Hoffman) has appropriated Woodward's notes and is re-writing them, to polish them up a bit. Woodward knows he's no stylist. He's a newspaperman. What you get here is what he knows.<br/><br/>Last point. You can tell from some of the scenes who the source is, or you can make a good guess. If only two people are in the room and one of them is Trump, you know the source is the other guy, because Woodward did not talk to Trump.  Or if there are several people in the scene, and there are repeated references to what somebody was thinking, the source is probably the guy doing the thinking.
 I'm so disappointed. I bought the hardcover edition, expecting this would be something like "Fire and Fury" but far more professional and measured, with everything more carefully checked. I had guiltily enjoyed "Fire and Fury" -- while the insights into the state of the Trump White House were appalling and there was some question as to how scrupulously Wolf had double-checked everything (though what he reported has held up pretty well to scrutiny since publication), it was outrageously funny and I felt reassured that such a dysfunctional organization couldn't survive past one term to wreak Trump's dreadful policies on the U.S. I thought "Fear" would be all that, at a higher level and with perhaps some hopeful advice and insights into how the U.S. can survive this with democracy intact .<br/><br/>Alas, I'll never know because I can't read this book. It is choppy and disjointed. The paragraphs do not form a sequence logically or in time. It is too jarring to my brain; the intellectual effect is similar to the visual effect of reading a book while someone moves it a foot up, down, or sideways every 15 seconds. I read a LOT of political and policy writing in the national newspapers including Woodward's own Washington Post and I also read history; I'm tough with regard to these subjects and can take this stuff in quantity. So it's not the subject matter that's at fault -- it's just really bad writing.<br/><br/>Woodward has of course done great work in the past. I can only conclude that his ability to create a narrative arc, whether of a story or an argument, has declined, as has that of his editor, with whom he's been working for over 40 years, and that of his wife, who has helped edit his writing for decades. Either they've all declined together and hence are all equally blind to the problem, or one or two of them have lost their abilities but is prevailing over the others as final editorial opinion. In any case, clearly no one else at the publisher's dared stage an intervention, out of reverence for Woodward's truly monumental and historic past achievements. Truly, they would have done him a favor to insist on a tough edit by someone else for clarity and continuity.<br/><br/>This is in no way to denigrate the importance of the subject matter this book addresses. According to the reviews I've read, this book presents extremely important and alarming information about serious problems in the behavior of the Commander in Chief and the creative efforts of staff to keep these problems from metastasizing into national or even global crises. Woodward seems to have retained his skills at interviewing, eliciting information, and selecting the most important anecdotes to report. in that regard this book is highly valuable. But again -- the information is only useful if it's actually read -- and ideally not just by reviewers and other political journalists but by citizens. It's less useful as an impressive-looking bookshelf ornament. I'm passing my copy along to the local library; it's not even staying on my shelves as one of the books I "might" read. I know I just can't.<br/><br/>I hope Woodward writes another book; as noted above his reportorial instincts for a good story still make him a national treasure. But he needs a new editor -- respectful but lacking in awe, with a dedication to clarity that outweighs any temptation toward deference.
 Decades from now--perhaps a century from now--this book will still be among the "go-to" sources for those seeking to understand the chaos one of the most tumultuous terms of any U.S. President in history.<br/><br/>What makes it so is the author Bob Woodward's peerless credentials as an investigative reporter, and his methodology:<br/>1. "Multiple deep background interviews with firsthand sources" (which provide many jaw-dropping direct quotes)<br/>2. "Author's review of contemporaneous notes by a participant"<br/>3. exhaustive research of available media and many official documents (mostly, available on-line.)<br/><br/>Easy-to-read organization: with few brief exceptions, it's simply a week by week, often day-by-day, sometimes hour-by-hour chronology, extending from Trump's Presidential campaign through to April, 2018, just five months before the book was published--which makes it extremely timely.<br/><br/>If you think you know Trump and how life must be for those in White House administration, but haven't yet read this: be prepared to be surprised, shocked and--at the very least--entertained. Highly entertained. Wife and I haven't laughed over a book--especially a non-fiction, "serious" work--likely in our lives.<br/><br/>Learn why so many people are fired, quit or "resign." Learn why, regardless of how you feel about Trump personally, you may find yourself agreeing with his feelings more often than you thought you would...<br/><br/>What happens inside the West Wing today defies imagination. I suspect strongly that--as this administration is far from over--Woodward is filing away tapes, notes (his and others'), following the threads of issues through to the end of Trump's (first!) term in preparation for another book likely to be published during the Presidential Campaign. Not that it may make the slightest bit of difference to the outcome.<br/><br/>Likely the most important work of non-fiction I'll read this year. What's that mean?  I've read a dozen or so, including Michael Ellsberg's revelatory, frightening memoir, The Doomsday Machine, Confessions of a Nuclear War Planner.
 For all the controversy and press coverage surrounding Fear Bob Woodward’s book on the first year of the Trump administration actually sounds a lot better than Trump and his supporters make it out to be, while I’m not sure that much of anything contained in these pages would shock or surprise the president’s detractors.<br/><br/>Fear depicts a presidential administration in chaos and that is fueled by chaos. Administration officials removing papers from the president’s desk and various alternative lines of communication and decision-making are not normal, but not unprecedented. Presidential advisors have to explain various economic and foreign policy concepts to a new president quite often. That someone was made in chaos needs chaos to thrive should surprise no one.<br/><br/>If you want chaos, this book will fit both the pro and anti-Trump forces, as Reince Prebius tries to bring order to the chaos, Rex Tillerson tries to conduct something of a meaningful and coherent foreign policy and white nationalists are alternatively welcomed and criticized among other notable events. There’s plenty of red meat for both sides as those who disdain the president will see him as an unqualified joke with no belief system who says whatever the moment dictates, while his fans will see him as bringing a shock to a system that needs and deserves it.<br/><br/>It really comes out better than the partisan spin would indicate.
 Fear? Hardly. Unless you've been living alone in a cave since 2016, you'll find nothing new, revealing, sensational or shocking about this book. So Donald Trump is a liar. Really? So "he's not going to admit he's wrong. Ever." Wow! Who knew? He won't listen to his advisors. He fires those who disagree with him. He can't stay focused in meetings, jumping aimlessly from topic to topic. He knows little--and cares less--about the business of running the country.<br/><br/>Trump refuses to read important papers, memos and reports. He doesn't show up for work until 11:00 a.m. He watches television six to eight hours a day to find out what reporters are saying about him. He impulsively tweets, talks and makes decisions with no regard for the consequences. Such "revelations" are disturbing but not the least bit surprising, so why all the hoopla about this book? What was all the fuss about, anyway?<br/><br/>Each untitled chapter is a hodgepodge of information about the main foreign and domestic issues of Trump's first year: China, Russia, North Korea, Afghanistan, Iran, NATO, trade and tariffs, immigration, and tax "reform" (Trump's sole accomplishment). The narrative skips back and forth from topic to topic, leaving the reader somewhat confused as to when, where and who. Underlying everything else is Trump's main obsession: Robert Mueller and the Russia investigation.<br/><br/>We lived through Trump's first year and have almost survived the second. New faces populate his administration, but nothing really changes, because Donald Trump will never change. He is what he is. We didn't need a book to figure that out, but hey! Bob Woodward made a ton of money--something Trump admires above all else. Too bad millions of readers wasted theirs.
 These very short, 42 carefully sourced, but quickly written chapters, add up to a tutorial in “Trump Policymaking.” It is a catalog of how free-wheeling, seat-of-the-pants, gut instinct policy formulations are made —including how the current president reacts to whatever assaults his fragile ego and challenges his rather thin knowledge base.<br/><br/>That said, this is an easy to read “middle-of-the road” but not quite courageous or cogent essay. It is mostly a loosely organized “reporter’s dump” of what this author saw on the way to the Trump Revolution. A lot of it seems “cribbed” from other sources. Although, except for getting DJT to sit for an interview, it is factually accurate, yet curiously devoid of even a hint of analysis and interpretations.<br/><br/>The book thus begs the question: If DJT is just the sum of his personal foot-faults, colossal ignorance, mean-spiritedness and buffoonery, then why is he our president? And what is the use of retreading what we already know about him from the 24/7 news cycle? All this does is feed into the DJT reality telethon writ large.<br/><br/>Why not give us an independent analysis of known facts rather than just lay out the quotes of  anonymous sources generating a difficult to validate artificial narrative? Better to just tell us what it all means. Truth these days, after all is in the eyes of the beholder.<br/><br/>If the author is really concerned that the republic is in mortal danger, as the book implies, then why punt, by giving us an account of the nervous breakdown of an unfit Commander in Chief via manufactured dialogue? Why not go for the “Full Monty,” and throw in a robust analysis of how we got to the Trump phenomenon in the first place? Three stars.
 If you believe that every word from Trump's mouth is a pearl of wisdom and truth, you will hate this book.<br/><br/>That said, I felt like Woodward gave props to Trump when they were due, and allowed us a good look at many of his players who have not fared well in the general media. Woodward's thoroughness paints a very vivid picture of the good, the bad, the confused, and the corrupt without every picking sides.<br/><br/>What I enjoyed most about the book was seeing how interconnected so many policies are. I found myself (a moderate voter and politics junkie) swayed both to the right and the left on different issues as I learned more about how they actually interrelate. The economy (trade in particular) and national security are crazy connected, and that really makes our relationships with both allies and adversaries important. I will be watching these things as they play out for the rest of my life now that I know more.<br/><br/>It's not told as a story, and there is no "ending", especially since many things have happened since it was completed, but we get to see the character arcs of many people who are not always in the news. It helps to understand why so many staff changes are going on.<br/><br/>THE AUDIO VERSION is well-paced with multiple voices to keep the principals straight. The only thing I missed was a "Trump" voice that sounded more like him. We've had so many imitations lately, that I wanted that foggy lilt.<br/><br/>Content warning: F-bombs all over the place. Trump, Bannon, etc. are not G-rated.
 Although the information was painful and discouraging I was not as emotionally reactive as with prior reads in 2018.  It may be do to writing ability or could it be that I am partially numbed through all the other books read this year? It is a quick read and even in presenting everyone as fallible, not without faults. It is surprising that each author is not repetitious as related to the other authors. It strengthens opinions but not solutions. The book evolves through events and patterns. The last pages helped in understanding how a brilliant attorney was placed in an impossible environment. It is a unusual nd brilliant ending to a book. The most disturbing aspect of all the books is respect for many people being greatly reduced.
 I appreciate and trust Bob Woodward's reporting, but I was disappointed that the book is essentially a long list of anecdotes. Rarely, Woodward adds some analysis. What he does report, however, is of value, if much of it is already familiar. It's clear that he conducted extensive interviews with Gary Cohn, Rob Porter, Reince Priebus, and John Dowd. So what you learn from this book is their perspective on things, and so it's limited.<br/><br/>The title -- Fear -- is ill chosen. The better title should be Disabled because that's what the book shows: a  presidency hobbled by a man too disabled -- morally, intellectually, emotionally, temperamentally -- to occupy the office. The presidency has been disabled.
 This is a good book, and far better the Michael Wolff's "Fire and Fury."  Woodward is very careful with his facts, and this is a legitimate piece of journalism.  Wolff is more novelistic, less reliable, and too much intent upon making Trump look as stupid as possible.<br/><br/>As with Wolff's book, it is clear to me that Bannon is a major source.  I think that Trump's attorney is another major source, and this may explain the surprisingly harsh treatment of Mueller's investigation and the Russian scandal.<br/><br/>I would recommend dispensing with Wolff's book and just reading Woodward.  This is the definitive account of the Administration for now.  Woodward's portrayal is not all that surprising.  Trump comes across a lot smarter and insightful that his critics would like to admit.  But his fatally serious flaws are all there to see.  He is guilty of magical thinking and is simply not persuaded by contrary facts.  He does not read.  He spends too much time watching cable news and pandering to his base.  He has no coherent policy vision.  He is all about power.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Halberstam is not around to write a book about Trump, and Caro never will.  Woodward is not is their league, and lacks the ability to give a deep portrayal of the characters around Trump or of Trump himself.
 'Fear' by Bob Woodward is a well researched account of the goings on in the West Wing from early 2017 to early 2018.  It expertly chronicles infighting among the presidential staff members, the highly usual behavior of Donald Trump (the Tweets, the lying, poor attention span, etc), and how decisions, some truly awful ones, are made or circumvented (especially by Rob Porter and Gary Cohn).  If the reader is a Democrat the book will be judged as frightening.  Yet even Trump loyalists will find it very depressing.  No one comes off looking good here.<br/><br/>My only complaint with 'Fear' is how it is organized.  It seems every page produces a new disaster but I don't see any continuity.  That is, some drama that may have happened in March 2017 is simply pushed aside in the next chapter and I don't know the ultimate resolution.  It seems the book has hundreds of messes chronicled but very few it seems are discussed to its conclusion.  Oh, and most of the messes involve foreign affairs and little with domestic policies.  Not sure if this reflects the author's bias or perhaps indeed POTUS and his staff are more focused on what happens abroad than at home.<br/><br/>Bottom line: a barrage of West Wing horror stories that are both educational and frightening.  Recommended for those regardless of political party loyalty.
 Contains  many faults and lies  .  What a waste money and time .  Not recommended
 This book was on a waiting list at the local library. Knowing of it I asked to have  a place in line and managed to read it all. It confirms the common view of an irresponsible and unstable leader. There is, however, a comment by Bannon on page 15 that made me reflect and was not locateable through the index, largely useless. It concerns the description of H. Clinton as the "tribune of a corrupt and incompetent  status quo of elites who are comfortable managing the decline." This was hard to dismiss, given the dubious quality of "free trade" and its impact on so many people in the US.  I had no illusions about the Democrats although I voted for them as a repudiation of the Republicans, but those words made me wonder who??????????? has the well-being of the nation at heart. There is also the matter of pressuring Russia when such action will only increase Russian paranoia, understandable given the country's past experiences, such as World War II.
 Wow. We hear so much about this train wreck of a presidency that it is hard to be surprised. What I hadn’t realized is just how incapable this president is to learn. He doesn’t read the information given to him to read each night, he doesn’t know his schedule, he flies by the seat of his pants (which are always on fire...liar, liar), and he spends only a few hours a day acting a president. The majority of his day is spent watching television.  He doesn’t know rules of law or the constitution and acts as a sixth grader being a dictator.  I was surprised at how much good wife-beater Rob Porter did during his time in the White House.  I was surprised at how insipid so many of his advisors are or were. I was surprised that all these people in high places who regularly called this president a moron, an idiot, and worse were still willing to follow that man.<br/>People on both sides of the great divide need to read this book. We know Woodward has a consistent record of fact-checking and truth-telling. People need to read this and learn what all Americans need to know.
 I hovered between 3 and 4 stars out of 5.  Considering the fact that this was rushed to print since the mind-boggling and dramatic events in the Trump administration are occurring at an unstable speed, this is pretty good.  It feels mostly patchy and anecdotal of the information he gathered.  It has weight mostly because of the author’s fame from the exposure of the Nixon administration.  Magazines and journals are written with more sophistication, depth and insight than this book.<br/><br/>The punchline for me was that there probably is no collusion with Russia but that Mueller was going for Trump’s chronic fib telling by getting him for perjury.  Basically, it’s a retelling of what we all sense from the news.  Our country is run by a privileged narcissistic, racially biased, misogynist cut throat businessman who is ignorant and uncaring about politics and the balance it takes to get along with the rest of the world; and barely kept in line with his team of conniving people.
 I finished reading "Fear" by Bob Woodward last night.  It wasn't an easy read.  For anyone hoping to find salacious details and/or nasty revelations, look elsewhere, it's not in this book.  It's actually quite a dense read, filled with a great deal of policy-making details.  It's in the telling of those moments that Woodward reveals the deep ruts of trouble that the people trying to keep Trump from getting us all killed encounter on a daily basis.  This book confirms and adds further evidence to the notion that Trump is 1000% clueless about policy or procedure.  He rules by decisions on issues he made up his mind about 30 years ago.  And no report, chart, graph or expert opinion will sway him.  The number one place this is showing up right now and that will hurt every single one of in the long run is his dangerous and misguided position on tariffs.  He REALLY doesn't understand the cause and effect of his immovable stance.  The book illuminates his bullheadedness and inability to even consider alternative points of view.  One part of the book that was widely reported about was about various people with access to the Oval Office literally taking memos to be signed off Trump's desk so he wouldn't start a nuclear war.....or a trade war.....or pull out of an accord.....or withdraw from a treaty.....the list goes on and on.  Utterly frightening.  He's portrayed as a hot-headed nincompoop.  And as far as we've seen, that's accurate. Unfortunately some of the people 'protecting us' have left or been fired.  God save us all.
 I have seen Bob Woodward several times on TV discussing his book.  Given his reputation and credibility, I thought, if I only buy 1 more book in my life, this is the book.<br/>No, it is not.  The book is very detailed and well documented and referenced.  I read non-fiction with a yellow marker in my hand for pertinent parts.  All the parts I marked were statements or quotes I originally heard from Woodward on TV.  I did not learn anything I did not already know.  Trump comes across as ignorant, rude, backstabbing.  Perhaps the most telling statement is "Trump does not read".  I hoped the book would give me insights, but it is just more of the same that everybody has been saying about him.  The book does not get to the more recent action of kidnapping babies from their mothers and Kavanaugh. But I already know about that.  I'd give 5 stars for all the work Woodward and his associates put into the book.  And subtract 2 stars because I've heard it all before.
 2 and a half out of 5. There are some passages that are absolute page-turners, yet on the whole, "Fear" drones on with an abundance of stuff that would usually interest me, but instead, reads like endnotes for the back of the book. Politically, here's what "Fear" says: the current POTUS has a temper, is impulsive, obsessive, frighteningly sporadic and the cabinet members are frequently frustrated. With regards to the Mueller investigation, Woodward lends lots of verbiage to it's uselessness. However, the biggest problem with "Fear" is that because the book is premature by nature, the criticisms lack resolution. Unlike "Fire and Fury" (a much better book in my opinion), which allows Steve Bannon do the talking and articulates the concepts - Woodward's narrative displays nonstop hysteria. Since the narrative in “Fear” is so factual, it’s like Woodward is sitting there with a stone cold poker face, making his bias is that much more obvious.
 I think that a Bob Woodward book featuring an American President falls into the required reading category for those who are engaged in public policy. By now, every political junkie has heard about the “revelations” in Woodward’s book titled, Fear: Trump in the White House. One that comes to mind is Gary Cohn taking a paper off Trump’s desk so that the President wouldn’t sign it. But this is not an exciting book about revelations: it’s a detailed look at the Trump White House and it documents much of what we already know. The slow and pondering text can distract readers from the importance of the book: the description of a recklessness in dealing with important matters. Woodward has lots of sources for what he describes, and some of them are obvious to every informed reader. Trump creates fear, stokes fear where it appears, and mines fear to do what he wants to do. If Woodward’s objective in writing this book was to make some readers afraid, he achieves that in spades.<br/><br/>Rating: Four-star (I like it)
 I'm actually not a fan of this book despite the fact that I couldn't put it down. I thought Woodward did an injustice to the true storyline by putting so many assumed conversations in quotation marks. To me,quotation marks in a non-fiction are to be reserved for facts,and there's no way anyone could have provided verbatim commentary on all of the conversations quoted. That said, I do believe Woodward researched this meticulously and provided these scenarios based on fact.<br/>I gave the book four stars for: 1) Meticulous research. 2) Consistency with known facts. 3). Linear storyline 4). Honesty 5) Objectivity 6). The fact that I read it in late December of 2018,just as Trump pulled out of Syria and Mattis subsequently resigned - both instances very predictable based on what was presented in this book. "Fear" is not only relevant to describe how Trump interprets power,but pretty much sums up how we all should feel after reading this book and thinking about what's in store for the next two years.
 Fear is lucid in portraying what goes on in Trump's White House. The author exposes many details which are fascinating. That said, the book contains nearly nothing that would convert almost any of the President's admirers into haters, or vice versa.<br/><br/>Given the information available in popular media, almost anyone can imagine the way the West Wing works under the erratic and firebrand President. The book confirms - through interactions, conversations and confrontations, many of them are likely created by the author based on some facts - almost all these scenarios. There are some details that could be novel to some, but overall the book disappoints by not providing anything earthshattering. The coterie around has some sensible folks who are trying to rein in the President, and that's a comfortable thing to learn. It also has a handful with dangerous agendas, which is not new but still distressing. Donald Trump's own quirks on display are the same as what one has been used to in myriads of ways.
 This book was a disappointing slog. It felt  like it covered already familIar ground without much in the way of insight or new developments. If this book contained groundbreaking new information, it was so subtle as to be nonexistent. I wanted to like this book more but do not waste your money or time on it.
 Or the rest of the staff Trump has working with him. Any good aims or instincts are stopped and all the bad ones are encouraged save nuclear war on N Korea. Last man in his ear wins. This President is going to be there in that office long enough to grind us all down till Pence will get his apocalyptic riot, the reason behind his loving gaze. Long the secret desire has been vaporization and a shadow on concrete.  Some painless death. Slime balls us Trump who is just useable. Putin likely got everything he could have ever dreamed of in those 3hours. Navarro is another Harvard ignoramus with as much Economics ability as goat. He and Pelosi ought shack up.  If Trump has goals they are to use the US like a game of Monopoly which is played using economics or 1890.  We're at econ war and its being fought by antiques.  If there is more it is mean, vulgar and stupid.  It is all a bad faith Presidency.
 This is a hair-raising description of our president, and yet the author’s mint reputation supports its authenticity.  If this was not politics but medicine, you’d be tempted to call Trump a quack doctor, with the retraction that he certainly got into that position legitimately and he is also ignorant of his own disability.  Still, whether deliberate or not, as a healer he would be unacceptable.  While the whole world shakes its head, you wonder how our marvelous democracy and praised constitution got us here.  Once the next inept candidate plays fast and loose with the gullibility of voters, don’t you wonder about some sort of safety mechanism?  Should such candidates perhaps be professionally licensed or “board-certified”, just as other practitioners of learned professions are, before they are let loose in the real world?
 The most important thing to note about this book is that it is overrated. Not just “meat and potatoes” overrated, but over cooked and over done to the point of being tasteless. Most of the pages seem to be hashed from bits and pieces of this conversation with that guy. Not much depth and without analysis, the book lacks meaning.
 Much of Bob Woodward’s latest book draws compelling comparisons between the rise of fascism in the 1930’s and its frightening reemergence now. For those of us reared in the shadow of World War II, fascism was thought to be well-killed and permanently relegated to the scrapheap of history. Now with fascism’s apparent resurgence in the governments of Russia, Poland, Hungary, and the US, we see that it is potentially more dangerous than it was in the last century.<br/><br/>Mr. Woodward reputation is such that he need not resort to unwarranted alarmist pronouncements, and he does not. He plainly states the facts as they have revealed themselves in his extensive research. His plain and easy-to-understand reporting draws no conclusions. He leaves those and the discussions of what is to be done to his readers.
 This story is simply devastating on all counts. Woodward is unsurpassed as a journalist who is able to get the whole searing account “on the record,” and he has done so here. He unfolds the first year-and-a-half of the Trump White House with endless quotes, conversations inside the Oval Office, the desperate machinations of good people who don’t know how to rescue the nation from what is clearly spiraling out of control.<br/> No matter what your political or spiritual views, it’s impossible to feel anything but grief and anxiety over the reality that the government has some amoral forces at the helm. It’s honestly frightening when the most admirable guy in the tale is Rob Porter, who bravely tried to keep a lid on the mess . . . and then had to resign because there was incontrovertible evidence he was involved in domestic abuse. Yikes.
 Finished reading Fear, Bob Woodward’s new book on the Trump House, in about a day and a half. The book is somewhat loosely structured, but chronologically captures some of the most vivid moments in the Trump White House over the last 21 months (and a few months before the election).  There are quite a few good snippets with certainly lively language, which bring the conversations and personalities involved (and there were a lot of them) alive.<br/><br/>The order and chaos (more the latter than the former) in the White House, the power struggles between the various constituencies with a moody, stubborn and unpredictable president at the helm, all bring the titular word “Fear” front and center in the mind of the reader.<br/><br/>The book ends with John Dowd, Trump’s personal lawyer’s resignation in March 2018, and this alarmingly accurate summarizing paragraph: “But in the man and his presidency Dowd had seen the tragic flaw. In the political back and forth, the evasions, the denials, the tweeting, the obscuring, crying “Fake News,” the indignation, Trump had one overriding problem that Dowd knew but could not bring himself to say to the president: “You’re a f****** liar.”<br/><br/>★★★★★ for Woodward’s offering the public an alarming and in-depth look into the Trump administration.
 What a horror show. If it wasn’t apparent already, Woodward’s reporting makes it painfully clear and in agonizing detail after agonizing detail.<br/><br/>If only the man was merely a moron (as he’s called by cabinet officials and others on numerous occasions in the book) then this abominable historical moment we suffer through might be bearable and pass without great consequence. While the entire episode might still end without catastrophe, the stains will certainly endure. The fabric of this country has been stretched beyond anything we’ve experienced in a long, long time. It will not instantly return to form.<br/>Yes, if only he was just a moron. Unfortunately this book makes clear that the situation and the man are far worse. He’s deranged, petulant, vindictive, incapable of learning...possesses a complete and utter lack of curiosity...and is entirely indifferent to the world outside of himself.<br/><br/>I was reluctant at first to read this book, but the idea prevailed on me that while Trump is hopeless and perhaps sub-human, there are others around him who don’t necessarily share the same qualities. How do they stand by and effectively encourage us being taken hostage by Trump? What do they believe they are achieving? I am not interested in their self-serving reflections post-service but I am interested in a ‘fly-on-the-wall’ view of the inner workings of this mess. In that respect the book doesn’t disappoint. I feel like I better understand (I think) some of the motivations and actions of a cast of characters central to how this has all played out. Bannon, Rheince, Rob Porter, John Kelly, Lindsey Graham, Rex Tillerson, James Mattis, HR McMaster and others. My interpretation is no longer that they’re just crazy imbecile invertebrates but that there is some nuance to some of their actions. Certainly nothing close to justification. Nothing in this book absolves any of them from the roles they’ve played in fueling this mess. There are some that have pulled us back from the brink at times. The question it doesn’t answer is why would anyone let it get that far in the first place?
 If you’re interested in reading a book that rehashes much of what has continously been made public about Trump and various current and former members of his administration (particularly by the liberal media), and that provides very skimpy documentation to support what Woodward writes about, than Fear is a book you’ll likely enjoy. If, on the other hand, you want to read a book that provides the actual sources/source materials to give credence to the “juicy” information included, than I fear you will be, like I was, disappointed in Fear. For me, personally, I got fed up with Woodward thinking he could get away with citing “The information in this chapter comes primarily from multiple deep background interviews.”<br/><br/>Bottom line: Fear is not one of Woodward’s better books and I think your time and money would be better spent on another book
 I did not like the book because author makes Trump look almost human, deserving respect because of the office, and almost capable of thinking, learning and hearing other people’s opinions. He is none of these, he is lying, uneducated, corrupt, treasonous, criminal, ignorant low life; know nothing low IQ, power grabbing, narcissistic, misogynistic racist, who has done nothing good in his life, has lied his way to the top, used people, lost every deal he put his little hand on, toxic to every person who ever dealt with him, indebted to every dictator and corrupt power on the planet, criminally supported by NY mafia and Russian mafia – the lowest of the low who does not deserve any respect,  who is using the highest office in the land to grab money and sell out the country and destroy democracy.
 Fear is a wonderful book because it’s factual and clear. It paints a picture of many powerful people with different agendas without any real leadership to organize them. It explains so much and in all honesty, I didn’t know the why of a lot of things that were happening at least not to the extent that was revealed in this book. I do not think this is a book only for people who do not support Trump, I think Trump supporters would find the different agendas of these different players in the white house and how it affected or changed some of his goals interesting as well. Anyone with any interest in the workings of the US government will love this book. It’s also expertly written. I highly recommend Fear.: Trump in the White House
 As per his usual, Woodward has provided top-notch journalism and fact-finding in his book about the beginning of Trump's presidency. It reads almost like a thriller, which is frightening given that the author's observations and research are on actual events that are still unfolding in the U.S. before the world's eyes. The book is full of detail of the internal battles among the closest of Trump's advisors and staffers--and also full of surprises.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that, since this book's release, so much information has come out about the corruption in the Trump administration--enough that the book has already become quite dated. Woodward's book is testament to the modern reality that so much damage can happen in such a short amount of time...and only time will tell whether the damage that has taken place thus far will be irreparable.
 There is nothing new in this book, nothing eloquently written or masterfully presented. Peppered with swearing and tired cliches throughout, such as "straight out of central casting," this book represents the "old guard" of journalistic voices, the voices we seek to no longer allow to dominate our worlds anymore.<br/><br/>Read "Fire and Fury" for a good read with more information. It tells you everything this book, "Fear," reveals, only in a more modern, less patriarchal fashion.
 This book is a farce. At least in the audio format, no sources were mentioned, and whoever Woodward did interview (obviated by the length time he spent on each segment) are Trump supporter. Mr. Trump's. hands and money are all over this. The book is obviously marketed brilliantly as a smear book where every scene portrays him as an Angel, hell-bent on keeping his campaign promises to his base. The book even talks about how he orchastrates everything that comes out of the Whitehouse. I have it 2 stars because there was nothing in it. That said, I recommend you read it for clarity on the lengths to which j he goes to set a scene. BTW, Lindsey Graham, I  almost started liking you until you threw yourself at The Don's feet.
 If you resist you're unAmerican.  This book is crap to make a buck.
 I would title this book "Chaos" since that seems to be the main theme. A secondary theme is how our pretender-in-chief only thinks about government and international relations as a profit-loss matter-a good argument for why a businessman, especially a less than honest one, should never be allowed to run our country.
 This is a good book written in a style that flowed and was easy to read. Some of the behind the scenes are disturbing like taking documents off the President's desk so he could not read and sign. Mostly the book points to a chaotic, dysfunctional and less than professional oval office. The book doesn't suggest any smoking guns that will lead to impeachment. The book like the circumstances of watergate are different. Watergate and the book All the Presidents Men  presented information about thousands of hours of tapes that eventually lead to the impeachment of Richard Nixon. If you keep up with the latest news nothing in this book will shock you. Without that shocking revelation it's a 4 star book, not a 5 star review.
 It not written well at all. Almost like reading from note cards with a twist of liberal hate of anyone that is not a democrat. It wasn't intuitive and had zero to learn from it. Don't was your time with everything you have already heard with a brain washing tone for the sheep to follow.
 Ever more terrifying is the Clintons in the White House.  We have surely learned our lesson about those two.
 Bob Woodward's track record on keeping presidents accountable is nothing short of astonishing. That he was able to put together such a disturbing narrative about the incompetencies of the Trump White House is telling. The book is short, and the notes and indexes are quite long. Some of what Mr. Woodward reveals puts into question what Democrats claim to have against Trump (the Russia probe, the relationship with Mueller) all the while exposing a trend far more troubling: Mr. Trump doesn't have a clue what he's doing, and he thinks he does. His powers of self-deception, if this book is accurate, are the best in the world. At least the president is good at something.
 There is so much taken out of context and intentionally misleading is this "book".<br/>Woodward sold his reputation by fabricating large swaths of this "book".<br/>Total garbage.
 Fear: Trump in the White House may have been entirely factual and eye opening for many people, but for me, I could barely keep my eyes open. Maybe I've been reading too many hysterical rants on social media, or maybe I have heard too much overall. But reading a patient and non-volatile description of what's been going on in the White House isn't enough to rile me up anymore. There, I said it.<br/><br/>That is such a sad thing to admit, that all these awful decisions and horrible intentions are no big whoop. It's so awful, I can't even anymore. I. Can't. Even.<br/><br/>And maybe that's exactly what they want.
 I am not, nor was I ever, a Trump supporter.<br/><br/>Crisp, clear, and readable, this is a picture of our current administration that chills.<br/><br/>This book made me at times sad, angry, astonished, and unsurprised.  It reinforced my view of the catastrophe of Trump in the White House, while also confirming that the picture of chaos, hubris, ignorance, and incompetence that anyone mildly following the news would have.  The saddest part is that it is true.  Descriptions of the staff working around the president give me hope that maybe we won’t wind up in a war over whose nuclear button is bigger, but anger me because these same people are enabling him instead of removing him.  The assertions in the book are documented, so these are real facts, not alternative facts.  This is not fake news.<br/><br/>Read it.  Vote.
 Bob Woodward's Fear: Trump in the White House is a mixed bag with behind-the-scenes stories and anecdotes thrown together in seeming random fashion.  The overall impression of the book for me was that of a dysfunctional workplace with all the employees spilling their guts to Woodward about the frustration of working for such a pigheaded, prevaricating, narcissistic, lazy, unappreciative and rigid, employer.<br/><br/>Woodward doesn't editorialize or intrude much; instead he lets scene after scene play out displaying the chaos and venality that is the Trump White House.  It truly is as bad as I suspected.  Let's hope this nightmare ends soon.
 I expected more from an author of this stature. This book basically does fact-checking of Fire &amp; Fury. If you read that book, this book is pretty much a rerun except it puts a slightly positive spin on the events as if told by Steve Bannon. This book is not nearly as entertaining as Fire &amp; Fury was. It lacks the conspiratorial tone that made you feel like you were there. This book has a much more distant perspective.<br/><br/>I listened to them both on Audible.<br/><br/>The important thing to note is that all of the information that was shocking in Fire &amp; Fury has now been fact-checked to the nth degree "and for that, we thank you" (Tosh).
 Well written and well researched. I'm glad I read it because I now know more about the President's Cabinet members, and can put names to the various jobs. I totally trust Mr. Woodard's reporting, but have to admit that most of the scary information in the book had been reported and rehashed on many News and Talk shows before I read it. All I am left with is real fear for our Country; we appear to have a chaotic and mismanaged Whitehouse, with a Leader at the helm who appears to be unwilling or unable to grasp the seriousness and repercussions of every decision, threat, and tweets he makes. God help the USA.....
 It took a while to slog through this book.  The first reviewer (3 stars) did an excellent job of synopsizing the main points of contention about this book.  I will not rehash other than to say disjointed really sums up much of the anecdotal writing.  I was determined to finish the book, and was surprised when it ended (abruptly, as noted) with the resignation of John Dowd (p. 357).  My e-reader indicated I still had ~40% left to read!!  40%  - Photos, acknowledgements, source notes, index, "About the Author" and "Also by ...".  Whew.  No surprises, no mind-changing revelations.  No ultimate conclusions.  Maybe in the next gossip book?
 You've already been bombarded on TV and other media with all the exciting stories -- the cabinet officers taking things off Trump's desk, the name-calling, and so on.  The rest of the book is uncharacteristic of Woodward's other works -- it's random and disorganized.  I've read other reviewers who justify this on the basis that it mimic's Trump's style, but that doesn't make it easier or better to read.  It's better -- much better -- written than Michael Wolff's book, but that doesn't really say much, and with the exception of the things I already heard about, it doesn't tell me anything I didn't know or suspect well before I read this.
 I appreciate the research Bob Woodward did to write this book. The amount of quotes he used was impressive. Learning how terribly inept this president is didn’t surprise me but I was hoping it wasn’t as bad as I believed. Finding out he doesn’t read and doesn’t want to learn about the areas pertinent to doing his job appalled me. And the fact that he appointed advisors and cabinet members that he ultimately didn’t take advice from is terrifying. He wants to be a dictator. He wants to stay up late, treat, ignore written briefings, get up late, golf and woo world dictators scares me to death. I hope his supporters are starting to understand he’s out for himself, not them. The next two years cannot be over soon enough.
 I started reading this book for a night time read like I usually do. But as the layers of the inner workings of Trump's White house are peeled away by the award winning writer I had to start reading it in day time. One of the scariest books I've ever read because it's TRUE. If Trump and the Republicans get another 2 years of power it may be to late to return to the America that used to exist. Right now the only thing holding Trump back is the free press. That's why he hates it so much. Fox is just Trump propaganda so that one doesn't count and is NOT part of the real "free press." Not a book to read before you go to sleep.
 Sorry to read Trump is more of an idiot than I thought he was. I had hoped he would finally get it together and figure out how to govern. I see now he's just not capable of learning, and that's the scariest part of his presidency.
 I just finished reading it and I can't believe this was written by the esteemed Bob Woodward.  It read like a cheap, tawdry novel. I haven't read any of his other books, I hope they're more intellectual than this one.  I know the whole trump admin is stranger than fiction and is a bit too weird to be believable. I was really hoping for the dirt here but some parts were just irrelevant or off-track, others -especially the one-on-one conversations ...I don't know. Would Lindsay Graham really take the chance of damaging his relationship with his idol Donny to relate these conversations with him???  If you never watched the news I don't think you could follow the pace of the book and the semi-descriptive characters &amp; story lines.  Sorry Mr. Woodward but it was a let down reading this.  Of course trump is a YUGE letdown but that was to be expected.
 I did not enjoy reading this book, but I plowed through in morbid fascination and a sense of civic duty. As a work of journalism, Woodward deserves five stars for his meticulous sourcing and careful attention to detail. He is basically creating a history of the first 18 months of the Trump presidency, as well as its transition and part of its campaign. He gives most attention to the daily grind of foreign and domestic policy, a grind that flattened many members of the administration. He spends some time on the Mueller investigation, but mostly examining how it impacted (negatively) the functions of the White House. It's not pleasant reading, and if you already struggle to sleep at night, this will not help. Finally, Woodward actually made me feel sorry for Donald Trump a few times, and I'm not sure I can forgive him for that.
 You know this book gives you some really great insight into the Trump administration but there isn't much more than what was said already in the news. The book takes overly long stories to come back to its central point.  Take for example the story of John Dowd the presidents lawyer who finds himself engaged with a Trump that seems sympathetic and then boom we're hit with a final boom.  The last sentence of the book pretty much sums up what the book is about but there are times when  Trump ALMOST comes across as tragic.<br/><br/>Nothing much new here so keep watching on TV.
 I have been a longtime fan of Bob Woodward and have read most of his books.  I’ve always found them to be detailed, factual and written in a neutral light, presenting the facts and enabling the reader to make his/her own assessment on the information presented.  However, I was disappointed with his new book Fear.  I found this book to be a collection of negative innuendo, hearsay and roomers purposely interspersed with negative comments intended to display Donald Trump in a negative light.  I also found that the book randomly jumped from one topic to another (within chapters), affording the author the opportunity to add additional negative comments about the Trump Presidency.  This book is based primarily on “palace intrigue” and does not, I believe, provide an accurate and truthful account of the inner workings of the Trump White House and its staff.  It appears that Bob Woodward had a premeditated agenda in writing this book which is not consistent with his previous efforts.
 The above subject line  is a favorite catch phrase Trump uses to describe ANYTHING he perceives as not being thought of or enacted by himself -- ironic that it is a perfect description of Trump as an individual and as an ilegitimate President!  This book captures Trump's inadequacy, inability, instability, and complete unsuitablility for the presidency of this great country. As I said on 11/09/2016: The only bright spot in an otherwise catastrophic day was the fact that all of Trump's lies,  and all his crimes and misdeeds over the last forty years would at last be exposed to the light of day!  And can I hear a Hallelujah!!!
 This is the first Bob Woodard book Ive read.<br/><br/>Woodard seems to heavily imply through his narrative that Trump is short sighted, emotional, out of control fool.<br/>YET, every conversation, meeting, and press conference shows us a man with a manager / CEO mindset taking in information as fast as possible, making a split second decision (because time seems to always be limited in this story), then delegating the task out.  Basically how I was trained to be a leader in the military.<br/><br/>It seems everyone around Trump were more interested in manipulating his decisions through emotion than just give him information and provide advice and damage control.<br/>Most of the major messups that we saw flashing around the media were in fact the result of his staff constantly lying and sneaking off behind public eye.  By time I reached chapter 12, Trump was blindsided by surprise information that made his presidency look bad about 4 times.  All the result of his incompetent aids.<br/><br/>It's obvious Steve Bannon provided 90% of the interview material, because the guy seems infallable like Superman.  The story seems to be from his point of view most of the time while still keeping him in the 3rd person.  He seems to be Trump's unofficial handler.  He knows everything about Trump.  Appearently he knows everything about being a president, being an expert business man,a perfect economist, and s God at foreign affairs.
 Most of the book is a very negative viewpoint of what here say was gathered by the author.  There are references in the last pages of book, but author chose not to directly link them to the quotes.  It's amazing that the people quoting the characters could remember so many quoted remarks.  Unbelievable story.  Not that many brilliant minds can remember that many quotes and time/where they were said.  Sad book.
 Events in this book have been published through various venues - details surrounding these events - not so much. The lack of intellect &amp; basic language skills, short attention span and inability to grasp the concept; every action has an equal and opposite reaction is overwhelming.<br/><br/>More chilling is the knowledge the thin wall of people surrounding the occupier of the oval, standing between us and Armageddon has evaporated through resignations and firings.<br/><br/>2020 cannot come soon enough for America.
 Woodward's reoprting on the inside operations of the Trump White House is incredible.
 I suspect Bob Woodward worked to release this book ahead of the 2018 midterm elections as a desperate reminder of the disorder currently infecting the executive branch. The book was released on September 11, echoing the tired analogy of Trump's win being equivalent to the WTC attack. Fortunately, Woodward has crafted a history where it is difficult to not have some empathy for the 45th in spite of the maudlin symbolism.<br/><br/>Don't be mistaken. In Fear, Trump is presented as a reckless, temperamental and twisted real estate magnate of atrophied cognitive ability most likely due to age. However, within this tale of a tycoon yelling at his generals and duplicitous (but experienced) sycophants, one can see the outward expression of so much collective anger that had been bottled up for years. Trump is the fury that the deplorables wanted - the consequence of 30 years of politicians not being held to account for the exportation of the manufacturing sector, the destabilisation of the Middle East and the global financial crisis. To the deplorable, the dysfunction was worth it.<br/><br/>Woodward comprehensively highlights the incredulous claims that the Don was directly involved in some plan with the Russians to manipulate the outcome of the 2016 election. Trump's attorney, John Dowd, outlines a convincing case why the Mueller investigation is an unprecedented misuse of power. However, too many times Trump receives some amazing piece advice like the demand from Dowd to never testify but ego gets in the way. Ego encourages Trump to suggest that both parties at a protest are just as bad when one side is proclaiming "Jews will not replace us". Trump is thin skin, dishonest and his absolute worst enemy - incapable of respecting protocol; uninterested in policy;  defiant towards alternate opinion.<br/><br/>I was surprised with how much of Trump's cabinet would be more suited in a Romney presidency although almost all of the featured establishment sympathisers in Fear have resigned by now. Fear outlines the many challenges facing the chief of staff to maintain order where political backstabbing runs rife among key players with major ideological differences. There are some absolutely amazing nuggets of gossip like Steve Bannon dressing down Ivanka as a " expletive deleted] staffer" and the unlikely friendship between Trump and Lindsey Graham. Woodward leans heavily on dialogue collected from interviews which makes for very easy-to-digest reading.<br/><br/>My only scepticism is how Woodward's sources are sometimes lionised. It is clear that former staff secretary Rob Porter contributed much of the material here and it should come as no shock that Porter is portrayed as a force of needed order sometimes breaking protocol to protect the country from Trump's reckless demands. However, it's revealed later that Porter resigned due to allegations of beating multiple former wives. This information is buried towards the end of Fear and makes me question Porter's temperance throughout the rest of the record as a result.<br/><br/>Likewise, John Dowd is portrayed as a brilliant attorney but I don't even recall if the book mentioned an incident where he was found to have forwarded a pro-Robert Lee/Confederacy email. Gary Cohn is an absolute hero in this book and delivers a speech about the "service economy" that is on par with Howard Beale's final plea in Network that maybe dehumanisation isn't a bad word. However, it says a lot when the hero of the story was a former president of Goldman Sachs.<br/><br/>The main contention in Fear is that Trump's guiding principle as leader is to exert power through fear. This fear is delivered via threats, intimidation and standover tactics  - certainly not alien concepts to the gangster in chief. No one is safe from Trump's anger and abuse be it his enemies, his allies and even his own staff. Trump understood his win as a mandate to be the strong man; yelling his frustrations at the world for the rest of us. Instead of fearing a strong man - the world has unanimously responded by ignoring the ranting and raving of a silly old crank.
 Bob's writing is clear and engaging. He writes about the major news we see on TV about this presidency. And he actually illuminates his readers on why the president does what he does. He includes the perspectives of the people around the president and work for him to give you a sense of what is really going on in the White House. A wonderful interesting insider guide to this presidency. And I think this book actually shows the human side of this president. We may not all agree with him, but enough people elected him to make him the president and he is carrying out the presidency according to the way he is.
 This is once again just more political propaganda.  Reviewing his other titles and their content, it's clear what side of the political fence he's on.  Another marketing piece for his party to influence the vacuous!
 I got this recently from the public library. Due to the time I had to wait for it, most of the titillating details had already been leaked, so it was not as riveting as it might be to somebody who has not been following the news. I do give Woodward credit for his impressive interviewing skills: he seemed to have unlimited access to several of the principals of the administration, and thus his dialogue read like a novel. Worth reading, for sure, especially if you happen to get it from the library.
 You can't follow the hottest political story ever without investing in the Bob Woodward book.  But unlike with Obama, Trump of course will contradict and call the author a liar.  It gets so boring.  In fact all of these books are becoming the same:  Trump is weird to work for, his White House is dysfunctional.  He lies constantly.  Our allies are disturbed and our relationships will never be the same.  Read this from the Master but the story won't be much different from all others.
 Maybe this book reads easier in print when you can see paragraphs, new pages, etc.  But the audio version leaves you shaking your head with some very abrupt transitions.  That, along with the general meandering style and lack of any real new info made me stop listening to this about a third of the way through.  Very disappointing!
 A must read no matter which side you’re on. Woodward tells a balanced and enlightening story based on first hand knowledge form the people involved.
 Received this garbage for Christmas, unfortunately, Woodward has an aggressive relationship with the TRUTH. Then he constantly uses “unnamed sources” which basically means the neighbor’s friend of a friend who worked on Hillary’s campaign.<br/><br/>Any book written by Woodward amounts to the same recycled smear from the previous administration. Woodward thinks he is a trusted source by keeping up his unbiased smear campaign,  backed by a propaganda WA Compost Fake News Communist embracing derelicts who already admitted Russian Collusion is nothing more than demonrat delusion, but propaganda collusion is the same as “democracy dies in daylight” because their skeletons are stacked so high that exposing a corrupt FBI would risk daylight to those skeletons.<br/><br/>I would recommend this book to people who can’t think for themselves and people addicted to the National Enquirer.
 Five-plus stars for the info and reporting, plus revealing some things less known (Lindsey Graham and John Dowd's comments, for example).  However, barely three stars for the quality of writing:  sketchy or no context provided in most of the episodes, frantic and often maniacally fragmentary sentences (sounding like a heavily caffeinated Steve Bannon ghost-wrote the book), and a random assembly, as if the bits and pieces were post-it's thrown on the wall and then published.  So - good to have this confirmation of what we've suspected already, but  an exhausting read, both for the appalling events described and the clumsy writing.
 Well written, in a reportorial manner, this is an intriguing look into the first 15 or so months of the Trump White House. Woodward voices no opinions and simply reports the facts as he found them. A refreshing break in this highly politicized time. Each chapter represents a different situation. This means that some chapters are easily read while others are more dense due to the situation being related. A worthwhile read that certainly provides insight into Trump’s presidency.
 This book is an engaging, informational account of some of the inside workings of the Trump administration's highest levels. Like other great Woodward writing, it is clear and well-annotated with alignment to the other information surrounding the President in the media.<br/><br/>In this age, however, it is hard to know what is actually true reporting and what is "fake news." I'm not in a position to render an opinion on that question, though. Hopefully, time will tell, as more accounts come out from firsthand participants.<br/><br/>Still, the portrait presented of President Trump as impulsive, passionate, and willing to bend the truth is both controversial and consistent with what I've heard elsewhere.<br/><br/>I would recommend this book, but take it with a grain of salt.
 It seemed to jump from topic to topic and back again. Not written from a Pulitzer author. I was hoping to hear an unbiased observation. Pieces were missing leaving the reader to draw conclusions from partial facts.<br/>Regardless on where you stand, I would not recommended this book.
 I listened to the book thinking I would gain insight and hear information to substantiate why President Trump was not an effective leader.<br/><br/>I listened and on many of the issues he raised I cannot help but think, "What's wrong with President Trump do that?" I'm not saying I agree with everything but many topics have swayed me to being impressed.<br/>This book reassured me that Hilary was NOT the right choice for President.
 The book takes a more realistic, in my opinion, look at the workings of the White House than did "Fire and Fury."  Mr.<br/> Woodward's reputation for honest reporting and investigation lend great creedance  to the book, but the book itself has more than enough things and situations that have been written about in other sources (some of which Mr. Woodward references) to let you know that he is speaking to truth,<br/><br/>A view of the Trump WH that is truly concerning and at times down right scary.  We the People have put a person in the WH that really, really does things differently than any of his predecessors and will go down in history for that alone, if for nothing else.<br/><br/>The end conclusion of the book, is really apparent, and unfortunately tremendously sad.
 Excellent read but what would you expect from a Bob Woodward book. A very disturbing look into the Trump White House and its tremendous dysfunction. As you read through the various instances of a White House in turmoil you really begin to wonder about the mental status of President Trump. He is a combination of really dumb and really vicious. How can someone so out of touch with reality ever been elected to the Presidency.
 I just finished reading "Fear: Trump In the White House" by Bob Woodward. I was always that kid who liked doing extra credit in school, so of course I sought out interviews, etc. to round out my experience. One of those was an interview with Terry Gross on Fresh Air. Toward the end of the interview, Gross asks Woodward if anyone he interviewed, and quoted in his book, then denied what they had said (James Mattis and John Kelly have.) Woodward's answer is telling, both about the book, but also about the Trump presidency as a whole: "In the first days after the book came out, one key person, in office now, called me up and said everyone knows what you've written is true. Quote: 'It's one-thousand percent correct.'"
 Woodward was spoon-fed his information concerning Nixon and had little to do with anything except being the monkey behind the keys.  This "writing" is an example of what happens when all he has is speculation and reactionary drivel without a "real" editor and publisher holding him accountable to his "facts" while he rushes to cash in on a fading swan song.  No more spoons for Bob, stick a fork in him.
 This book is names properly "Fear"........All of the USA should be in "Fear" of this individual. He is not in the least "Presidential" he is a bully, arrogant and if things don't go his way he throws a "temper tantrum" . The "Wall" between Mexico and the USA is a prime example of this. He will shut down 25% of the government just to get his way......Lousy individual and one of the poorest Presidents we have ever had and I go all the way back to Eisenhower.  Bad, bad, bad president for the USA. He will cost the USA so much credibility it won't even be funny........Wes Weston
 Really well written saga of the Trump White House, that ties in well with Wolff's and Comey's books. Surprisingly balanced views of political figures including Lindsay Graham, Steve Bannon, General Kelly, and Jared Kushner. Woodward makes even mundane topics seem so interesting. Chapters divided well. The book deals more with friction among Trump's staff in determining his agenda. A good companion book to Fire and Fury.
 I'm only on page 48 and already having a problem believing some of what's been written.  I'm very disappointed.  Unless Woodward is into mind reading or working directly with Steve Bannon, I don't see how he can know what Bannon is thinking.  I don't see Bannon cooperating with anyone other than himself to get the truth out.  The man doesn't know what truth is any more than Trump!
 It gave me somewhat of a clue about how Trump thinks  it's a very interesting read  and now we know  that a Saudi Arabian was killed by the Saudis in the Turkish consulate i.e.. MSB and what will happen to that $110 billion arms agreement ? I fear for our country and where it's headed with a Trump in charge  I've voted Democrat via absentee ballot here in Michigan  I pray, we win the House
 Though many vignettes have been told in the press, I found the contexts fascinating. Descriptions of the President 's<br/> Inability to understand complex issues as well as his narcissism are truly frightening and so dangerous for our country.  Disorganization in his administration reflect that in his mind. Mr. Woodward is to be congratulated for his obviously meticulous research and ability to make sense of nonsense.
 Mr. Woodward<br/>Did a magnificent job weighting this book it's a interesting read,I HOWEVER felt that he withheld a lot more good read. Nevertheless you can not take his knowledge away from the way he made up for his with holding of information on trump. Once again I wish someone would stand up to that human being ,reason being<br/>At the end of the day that's all he is. And I know that book would get 5 star's from me Thank You Amazon.
 Fast-moving, spicy dialogue, with all the F-bombs one would expect in the age of Trump. Woodward made his point that Trump doesn’t let the truth get in the way of an argument.<br/><br/>What I find more problematic and deserving of deeper explanation is what Trump believes to be true and the policy consequences.  Because of Trump's warped beliefs, he has taken actions that are making America weaker: Tax cuts for the rich are increasing inequality and driving up the federal deficit, at a time when the deficit should be decreasing. Trump’s tariffs have increased costs for American manufacturers and consumers, and tariffs combined with his temper have created an environment of uncertainty that is driving industry out of America. Trump’s war on immigrants will send the best and brightest foreigners elsewhere. Our allies are already questioning whether America can be counted on. Rolling back environmental safeguards will take a toll on health.<br/><br/>Perhaps Woodward’s next Trump book could be titled, “Strong and Wrong.”
 I can't help but comment at the hypocrisy spewed in these book reviews.  People who have radical liberal views<br/> or worse yet - socialist views - cannot accept a conservative President.  Typical left viewpoint which when they don't get what they want, they cry and whine, stomp their feet like toddlers.  Actors actually make bold yet worthless statements about their own PERSONAL views as if anyone would look to an actor for advice on politics?<br/>Some "stars" threaten to leave the country with such self-absorbed egocentric attitudes they think it would matter to America if they left!<br/>For the left who read this book ..... remember that nobody told you what book to read or not read.  Nobody condemns your views on the book.  Nobody tells the author that he cannot write the book.  The author makes money for his work.  As radical left pushes a socialist agenda, those basic rights of freedom and success in capitalism could be dissolved.  Trump is about protecting this from happening so TRUMP2020!
 Did you ever see a movie trailer that looked great bit when you went to the movie the only great scenes were the ones in the trailer?<br/>This book is EXACTLY like that.  All the "leaked" highlight were the ONLY highlights.<br/>This was not a good book and if you were expecting Trump to look bad, you will be in for a bit of a shock. The negatives that were leaked, displayed in the context from where they came, didn't seem like big deals.  My impression of Trump already so low, actually didn't move, when Iw as expecting to because of the august author.<br/>The writing was boring. The book was boring and Woodward, who jumped the shark a long time ago, just needs to go.
 Bob Woodward is an excellent author. While some parts are hard to follow, it’s not due to his writing, but more the nonsensical quotes of Trump that are almost like ravings. My only disappointment is that cable news told all the “juicy” bits so nothing was much of a surprise. However seeing everything laid out on a timeline like this was very eye opening, and showed how scary things are, and how I binged this president really is.
 This short book is in keeping with Woodward's long history of in depth reporting.  He has captured the essence of what most people suspected about the Trump Whitehouse.  The images depicted pair up nicely which Trump's persona on the "Apprentice".  I have long suspected Trump was a loose cannon!
 Wow! Even if moderate exaggeration exists within Woodward’s book, he paints a clear picture of the transmutation that has occurred within the Oval Office. A once respected office, treated with deference has devolved into one of constant disorder, contempt, and fear. Woodward’s investigative reporting is spectacular. His ability to uncover the fine details keeps the reader capitivated and wondering how when ever got to this point. This is a great read for anyone remotely interested in politics.
 The font in the book is so small, it is difficult to read.
 I've never seen Bob Woodward write any book with three words constantly repeated focusing on 1. people's anatomies, 2. the "f" word  3. the word "moron" but this is how FEAR reads.  Were it not "real," it might serve as a literary Saturday Night Live of this Presidency, but unfortunately, it is about the Chief Executive Officer of our beloved country and the people who surround him, kowtow to him, inform him, are insulted by him, are fired by him and are ultimately ignored by him.<br/><br/>I loved reading this book, but it made me "fearful" for the continued slide of the country in every direction.  I think it is a good wake up call for anyone who can read from "a to z", use a dictionary, and has the power to vote.
 My wife looked at what I was reading and she went to the book's ending and said,  "No surprise! Just like you have always known."  Well, I didn't want to know the ending, (a horrible way to read a book), and so I sat done and read it straight through.  And I glad I did.  Even as so many have said, nothing surprisingly new here, but it was a great review of these past several years.  And it is a gift to receive for many of us do need to have it reiterated clearly and boldly, as Bob Woodward does it so well, so personally.<br/><br/>When I got to the end, it confirmed,  that what we have here is a notorious liar in our Presidency.  And secondly he shames us, this country, that he demeans any one who is not with him.  I will be so thankful to read the sequel of this book, which I believe, even in the short run,  will be a step in the right step for the soul of this, our, country, and the world.
 Fairly easy reading, but dubious reporting.  Author seems to arrive at his facts, narratives, and conclusions using information from people known to practice partisan bias.
 This book is great at giving a sense of the struggles White House staff had to deal with daily.  Woodward is obviously very precise, and you can see what he talks about playing out today.  One criticism I would give is that the chronology is sometimes precise, while other times hard to follow.  It focuses on the people, not the historical context in which these events are taking place.  There is also no central theme or message, just describing conversations and meetings.  This is fine reporting, but less storytelling than previous books.  Great read, overall, though. Easy to get through.
 This book is an IQ test. If you believe it is all true- you failed the test.
 This book is riveting. It is also objective, opening my eyes to both Obama’s shortcomings and Trump’s contributions. I appreciate that Woodward’s only agenda is to report what is real. The insight into Trump’s early presidency and the people that shaped dynamics and policy is fascinating. This book is a “must read” for anyone with interest in current events and America.
 Woodward gives us a fly-on-the-wall view of a president with zero qualifications for the office. Written in an informal, easily read way, the book fills in some of the background on many of the stories that have been covered in the news. The author doesn't trash Trump. He just presents what he observed and learned in ways that make the man's incompetence and moral midgetry glaringly obvious.
 I was hoping for more insight and information about Trump. 98% of the information in this book was already known by anyone paying attention to the print and broadcast news. I expected more from Bob Woodward. The way the timeline jumps around makes the book seem disjointed. I imagine one event in the White House influences Trump's reaction to other events but that does not come through in the book.
 Ok, now that we, and everyone around the world, know. And it hasn't changed for the better. And that it's actually gotten worse.<br/><br/>What's there to do about it? Which has been my question for every political outrage of the last 2 administrations.<br/><br/>Look what voting got us.<br/><br/>Thanks Mr. Woodward, but this ain't the Nixon years anymore.
 Unfortunately a journalist who earned his chops investigating a compelling subject and presenting facts relies solely on "anonymous" and otherwise unnamed sources for this tale, leaving it little more than fiction.  He would have more credibility if he were still relevant but the is not, of his own doing, and this book does nothing to restore him to his former glory.
 Bob Woodward can tell a story like no other.  Much of the content of the book has been reported elsewhere, if not the exact episodes, the mean spirit at the current White House is unmistakable. Unfortunately, this book will change few minds.  Those who support Trump will dismiss the book as fake news, and the restdon't really need the book to convince us of the sad state of affairs.
 Bob Woodward writes a blow by blow book about the Trump administration.  While other books have discussed the Trump administration from far away, Woodward has interviewed people in the administration anonymously.  The result is a more intimate look at what is going on there.  It makes the stories more personal and insightful.  Very interesting on a lot of topics.
 Have read Fire &amp; Fury, The Fifth Risk, &amp; now Fear.  Cannot complain about the top notch writing, but..... "I don't care about any of this stuff."  "I don't give a s--t about that." Etc., etc., etc.  I feel as if I need to wash out my brain after overdosing on these books, perhaps a long shower.  One feels dirty.  This is the President of the United States?  Sad!
 Bob Woodward is a great writer. He interviews his subjects well. Too bad he couldn’t talk to Trump, but then, Trump would not be truthful. I realized while reading this book that the situation in the White House is much worse than I imagined. This book was way more than I expected.  I really liked how all his references were listed by chapter at the last several pages.
 I listened to the audible version. The narration was fantastic. The narrator had a clear voice and portrayed emotions really well. Sometimes it felt like I was listening to the actual person speak and not Robert Petkoff. Anyway, as for the book itself? Really well written. It flows nicely and you can tell Woodward did his research beforehand. Highly recommend.
 I have followed the news quite a lot ever since the current President was running for office.  With that in mind, although the book is well written, and has great detail, I found it boring.  I only read a third of it and might try some more, just in case I missed an interesting part.<br/><br/>I listed to this version on a CD.
 I like the book very much. I'm fearful for  America. I'm sure there were things that went on in the White House  under other Presidents, they had experience in the running of the Country, by laws. It's a very hard job. This President doesn't  help the world. You have to read the book to get the essence of what I'm  talking about.
 This book gives the reader a great insight into the current White House. It highlights the personalities of many of the presidents inter circle. A must read for any student of The presidency.
 Most rational people are not shocked any more that there is a liar and total nutcase in the White House. The magnitude of his crimes and treason is off the charts. This is why a book with so much indisputable detail is so important. If the fake prez gets someone to read it to him, he is going to feel very exposed.
 Well researched and written by a Pulitzer Prize award winner, it tells the sad tale of the chaos in the white house under donald trump.  He's every bit a nightmare as we think. Some of the writing was historical and a bit overwhelming. Certainly a good book, and worth reading. File under Horror, as that what this White House is.
 And I got it from the library.<br/><br/>If you suspect or even know that Trump is a nincompoop surrounded by his equals and deserted by those who had some talent and knowledge, you will not be disappointed. It's really a boring book, poorly constructed. I'd pass on this one if I were you.
 There isn't much to say that hasn't already been said about this book. My observation isn't so much for today but for a generation down the line when someone who was my age when I read "All The President's Men" reads it. Will it be seen as shocking or as the norm? That's probably when the book will be most effective.
 Absolutely nothing we didn’t already know.  Trump is a child who throws temper tantrums.  Woodward actually make Bannon and Kelly Anne seem like smart, strategic players, and in some areas makes it seem like Trump is a truly great negotiator who was able to succeed in areas where Obama, Bush and Clinton were weak, like N. Korea.  I was a waste of time to read.
 This man hasn’t had an original thought in decades, but if you’re a snowflake and melt easily, go ahead and relish total fabrication. MAGA!
 Bob Woodward has been wrong in the past and is wrong now. He make comparisons that hold no water. This book is a furtherance of the liberal message from an author associated with a blatantly liberal publication. I was honestly hoping for an objective, reasonable review of the Trump White House and Administration. Look elsewhere for unbiased journalism.
 Great book. Trump has got to be THE dumbest president in the history of America. I don't think he could find his butt with both hands and a flashlight, much less NOT lie every time he opens his mouth. If his lips are moving, he's lying! Over 8000 lies to date and still going strong!
 Rubbish. Misinformation. Hearsay.
 This book is a real eye opener. I think I trust Bob Woodard as an an investigative reporter. It's pretty scary to think we can have a president with such a short attention span and little understanding of economics, foreign policy, law,.... And he refuses to listen to his staff when they disagree with him. It is impressive how some on his staff have worked to keep him from digging holes we cannot get out of. I hope they can hold out.<br/>I almost gave this 4 stars because I was waiting for the happy ending. Then I realized that the author has no control over that :)
 (Pulitzer Prize Winner) Bob Woodward is CLEARLY NOT the sort of writer who would make stuff up about people just to SOUND big!  Nope.  The research AND personal experience presented here give us a good, heartfelt look into who/what the former Reality-TV-star TRULY IS!  Thanks so much!
 I had great expectations of this book to be a great read about the complete dysfunction of what has transpired in the swamp for the last two years.  Was Woodward paid off to write a puff piece??  Once again the Teflon potus is just laughing at all of us for being so stupid and gullible  We need someone out there to save us from ourselves.  Hopefully after the mid terms a majority of the spineless GOP will finally find a pair and stop this insanity.  Don't purchase  this book save yourself $15 dollars.
 Not Woodward’s best but still a very thought-provoking account of the circus surrounding the megalomanic, narcissistic, overweening, supercilious prig who’s successfully bamboozled almost half of America. As H. L. Mencken once opined, “Nobody ever lost money underestimating the American public.”
 Every voter should read this book.  Unfortunately, the people who most need to read this book, won't, and if they did they would not believe it.  The games the White House staff have to play to deal with Donald Trump are crazy.<br/><br/>Borrowed from Amazon, via Overdrive.
 He needs to realize all President Trump has had to fight, and still he accomplishes more than Obama dreamed of. Trump is the best president since Ronald Reagan.
 I have now finished 25% of this book. And that's all it's going to be. This is one of the most boring books i've ever attempted to read.
 I appreciated that this COULD have easily devolved into a badly done partisan joke.<br/>The voices were well done.<br/>Although this was not exactly objective, why shoukd it have been?<br/>The "fairness doctrine" has been dead for decades.<br/>I have read a number of books by Bob Woodward and will likely check out any other audible books he has that are current or relevant.  Highly recommended
 The Reader is boring with no voice inflections. Put me to sleep twice I gave up and returned. Useless and canceled service.
 Gotta love reading a book full of claims verified only by anonymous sources which will not be named. Take it like college, a source without a name is a source that can't be trusted.
 This only encourages people with mental problems to not see the truth. There has never been such a country in the history of the world like the US is today under President Trump. Open your eyes.
 I voted for this man and will again, 2020. FEAR?  There is nothing unpleasant, dangerous or threatening about Trump. Obama and Hillary take the cake on that one.
 Anyone can write a review on this book. Notice that all of the 1 star ratings are not verified purchases? Trump lovers.
 This is horribly written.  At times it. Is difficult to follow the narrative.  Who is speaking?  When did it happen?  Perfunctory introductions/ of new characters.  I find it annoying to read.  Maybe because he is a "journalist" and not a writer.  Different styles.
 I kept falling asleep. I thought I could get into an audiobook, but I guess they're not for me.
 Few people have a reputation like Bob Woodward for Pulitzer Prize winning, fact-based reporting for many years, about several presidents of the United States.  Surprisingly, “FEAR, Trump in the White House” does not reveal many facts that we were not already aware of, but does provide the backroom bantering, churn and chaos with quotes from key WH players, past and present.  In summary it leads one to believe this presidency is one of comedy mixed with sheer terror, resulting in fear for the United States and our democracy.  AND this book only covers about 18 months into the term.  Prayers.
 Wow! What a book! . . . Everyone needs to read this!<br/>.<br/>It details an accurate glimpse of the Trump Administration through the eyes of the participants. Little known facts, details, and anecdotes provide a fascinating story of a dysfunctional presidency.
 A very poorly written book based on a liberal belief system that is defective to its core . This book is a bad attempt st attacking an administration and poison the minds of those willing to pay for this trash rag .
 😂😂😂 hilarious, couldn’t get past the “sample”.  I seriously doubt anyone would openly admit to treason and then sign his name on the confession . ( Cohn ).  Mr. Woodward is a fantastic fiction writer. Maybe his next book should be about how Obama saved healthcare.
 A must read for every American. Well cited and thoroughly researched. Even though he didn’t name whom his sources were, it was clear when you saw which personalities thought something as compared to you said something. I have a feeling they’re all willing to step forth and testify.
 While there is nothing earthshakingly new in Woodward's microscopic inspection of the behind the scenes portrait of the Trump campaign and early Presidency, the cumulative effect of his investigative journalism is staggering. The reader is in the room during one-on-one conversations w Steve Bannon, KellyAnne Conway, Reince Priebus, HR McMaster, Gary Cohn and many more. Whether you are a fan or a hater, you will want to read this book.
 My Julian was really thrilled to receive "Fear," a much anticipated, revealing book, by celebrated, renowned journalist, Bob Woodward.  A fast read, it really was an "eye-opener," into this "Trump White House disaster!"
 a great look into the background of all the POTUS events of the last two years.  Not a gossipy Trump story book but a look at how things transpired behind the doors, and how things  actually  work in our government.  Kind of scary, kind of reassuring.....definitely a page turner
 Another how horrible Trump is book. Getting a lot of information directly from Trump I don't buy it. If even half of it is true it would be quite fearful. Almost everything in this book has already been reported in the news.
 I thought the title referred to the way the people working for Trump felt, but I was wrong.  Most of this book was written from deep background interviews with those people and shows the conditions under which they work.
 Nothing new here.  Not even that interesting.  Probably could have been written about most presidencies.
 Not much editorializing. Just factual quotation and “deep background” paraphrasing of actual conversations and statements reported by seasoned reporter. Suddenly ends, without stating any opinion or conclusion. Draw your own conclusions. i think it is scary.
 So you know Trump is an idiot by now...this book add more fuel to this fire.  A bit tired of trump at this. Great book- but mostly just telling stories you have already hear in press about the book.  All the same glad I read it.
 Terrific research, as credibly done as a work such as this can be. Well worth your time if you have questions about the motives and ethics of the folks running the country. The downside is that so much of this has subsequently come to light in other ways.
 A unique look into the the wonderland of a narcissistic inept man child president created by the lack of responsibility of our duly elected representatives to get off their asses and govern as the founding fathers intended.
 Nothing earth shaking in Woodward's book if you follow this daily tragedy but interesting insights into how much of it unfolds. Strongly suggest Abramson's book "Proof of Collusion" as a better read.
 Incredible detail on the inner workings of the White House, Trump and his whipping boys.  Woodward leaves the reader to draw his own conclusions avoiding condemnation of Trump.
 Everyone should read this book. It just proves what intelligent Americans have thought. What does he do when he's not tweeting or golfing? Certainly not read American history books. Is he senile as his attention span is limited? He really needs classes on how our government should work. We have three branches for a reason. When is part two coming out?
 I have the utmost respect for Bob Woodward as a reporter.  But his editor did him a disservice by not tightening up the narrative and doing more to engage the reader.  Listing events as they happened does not make a good book.  For those of us who are not waist-deep in politics, the book was often confusing and I had difficulty relating one fact to the next.  It seemed to jump around quite a bit and would provide the facts without the insight.  Disappointing overall.
 Bob Woodward doesn't tell us anything we didn't already know about Trump.  It is a well told report of Trump's presidency so far. But it is still the same train wreck we know it is.
 Woodward’s writing is dry. If you are expecting a page turner, this isn’t it. There were few revelations in his long drawn out accounts. If you are a political nerd like I am, you didn’t learn much :(
 We are in crisis in the US and this book documents the foolishness that a minority has used Gerrymandering to inflict upon the majority.  Guess you can see I'm unbiased?
 Received as a gift (hardcover), but several text pages marred by ink smudges or blots of ink (see photo).  The latter completely obscured parts of the text on p. 54.  Don't know whether I'm the only one?  Simon and Schuster?
 This book describes the hideous Trump administration in horrendous full flower: the lies, the willful ignorance, the chaos. A deeply disturbing book. Written by an real American hero, Bob Woodward.
 We had heard bits and pieces along the way. But we needed Bob Woodward to give us the definitive, well-researched story of this disaster of a president. I believe every word in this book is true.
 Woodward has written an excellent book on leadership and Trump.Its astounding that Trump is the president given the many tragic flaws  he possesses . Haunting book in many ways, and very, very sad.
 Well written, fascinating but somewhat anticlimactic, as in the month or so since it was written the White House drama keeps topping itself.  I didn't finish it because, sorry to say, it's become kind of "old news".
 This is a national enquirer article in book form...no actual sources, just "inside" knowledge.  The only credit I'll give is that this guy knows he has a captive audience who will shell out coin to someone who will validate their irrational hatred.
 Obviously Woodward is biased and does not like Trump, and its impossible to verify if Woodward is telling the truth in most cases, but the book is very entertaining so it served its purpose for me.
 No proof. Just a money making pile of recycled paper particles.
 Trump doesn’t like trade, has minimal understanding of government and of consequences, and has a tendency to say “I don’t want to hear this” we he gets evidence he doesn’t like.<br/><br/>I’m a bit disappointed this end before the Kim summit though.
 You just can't believe this crap.  This is partisan politics at its worst. Don't waste your money!!!
 in this hyper partisan climate it is difficult to write a book when most of the comments are on 'deep background' nothxjeff. But overall it is your typical Woodward book.
 I kept waiting for something that I hadn't already heard of in the news, but it was predictable and dull.  Probably better for people who are less informed in general.
 I waited too long to read this book. I was aware of nearly everything. Had I read it when it was first published It would have been educational.
 nobody's ever gonna trust this author to get close to them again, and that is as it should be.  A career mind manipulator. Take it all with a grain of salt, folks.
 I’ve been reading this for about a week, it’s TERRIFYING!!! Trumps using fear to stoke his racist, misogynistic ego who only cares what he can get for himself!!
 Excellent as usual by Woodward!
 Was not impressed with this read, in fact, I simply couldn't get through it.  Most of the info has already made the news.  Was expecting more.
 Book reviews prior to the publication of Woodward's book (e.g.,  in the York Times, Washington Post)  informed that it would be a good idea to read that book.  So, I bought the book the day when Woodward's book was released (Sept. 11, 2019). I spent lots of hours reading that book and concluded that this book is generally a book of fiction mixed with real events.
 fear mongering
 This is indeed a book of horror.  At times it was so frightening I was scared out of my wits.  At other times I was yelling at the book (or anyone who would listen).  It should scare everyone in our nation silly!
 I have been a Woodward fan since I read "All the President's Men" back in the 70s.  This book makes you feel as if you are in the room.  An excellent read.
 I think Bon Woodward is great but this book BITES!! Its boring and difficult to follow.  Repeated chapters until I was DONE! I couldn't finish it.
 While this book was interesting, I also felt like there were no surprises. Because sources for the information were listed, I felt like it added credibility to what we have heard in the “fake news”.
 FEAR takes the reader on a rollercoaster ride that is The Whitehouse.  Woodward’s version of the truth is nothing short of terrifying.
 Woodward’s book supports much of my own feelings about the 45th President. His documentation leaves no doubt as to the accuracy of the individuals quoted in his book.
 I already suspected much of what was in the book, always good to get confirmation. The book was well written and full of relevant quotes from those on the inside
 "Lord of the Flies" at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Would that this one were fiction as well. (Wonder why Amazon wouldn't let me post this review for over 2 weeks?)
 Disappointing. One hour in I was bored with the minutiae of the conversation. Too many expletives, and just not enough content to be interesting.
 I got it on audible because my husband goes to bed early. I am so glad they are both here to bear witness to this critical time in history.
 I would have liked the personnel pictures in the front so I could relate to the things happening.<br/>Scary to think of how our Nation is being controlled  by such an incompetent President.
 Holy hell!!! Major eye opener.  I figured this administration had issues but didn't know to what extent.<br/>History will ultimately reveal how foolish America had been when they voted this professional liar into office.
 Anything written by Bob Woodward is a great book.  I haven’t started to read it yet but from his other books, I know I’ll love this too!
 While I found some interesting things from the book, I also found it to be a bit disjointed.  Also, when I got to about 65%, the book was finished.  The rest of the book was pictures, but mainly footnotes.
 This book should be another wake up call for the USA to read. The Trump toxin is going to destroy the USA. FAR TO MANY CITIZEN HAVE DIED FOR OUR USA FREEDOMS. To have one person such as Trump destroy our freedom and values must be stopped.
 looking back this book is prophetic. how many people quit how many people disregard trump, how clueless trump is
 It's getting closer and closer.  So faciniting.  It's all about a family of traitors who sold the country to enemy.
 Well written but very disturbing. How could this president be in office? He is so not qualified. Good book though.
 My Mom loved this book!  I haven't read it myself but feel in the coming months it will align to what we are seeing in the Trump Whitehouse.
 Bob Woodward is an associate editor of The Washington Post. Enough said.
 Substituted by other books and insider accounts the incompetence and ignorance currently at the top of our always great country
 I find myself backing up to re-read sections of this wonderful book. What happened? He didn't? HE DID.
 It's ok, and I learned about the confusion in the oval office, but overall it wasn't much that I did not know!
 Highly credible, well-researched look inside the Trump White House. Having followed Mr. Trump's career in the New York newspapers, there was little in this book that truly surprised me.
 I have not started reading this book, but I know Bob Woodward's work.  I look forward to reading it soon.
 I found "The House of Putin, The house of Trump" more informative and interesting than "FEAR". Both books are very good.
 An excellent, insightful read providing terrifying insights into how dysfunctional the Trump administration is and how unfit he is to be the leader of our country.
 This was a long boring book. Not really any facts. The author needs to not be so into his views and be factual. What a waste of money.
 Great insite into the Trump world of shady caricatures and criminal mind set That Trump surrounds Himself with his entire professional life .
 Well, after listening to about a third of this book, I not only lost any residual respect for the sleaziness of back room politics and this particular administration, but I had to start listening to some good apocalyptic novels about end of life as we know it from asteroid impacts, ecological death, and technological corruption just to cheer myself up.
 We really have something to fear. I had no idea. This book explained it very well. Difficult read but most worthwhile.
 If you care at all bout what is happening to our country you need to read this.
 Interesting read.  Mostly known info, but more depth and detail. Worth reading
 Good look in side the Trump White House.  I just keep shaking my head about this guy and how he became President.
 Very factual, but together with new unreported facts, very impactful. Would recommend highly
 Like reading a pile of newspapers scattered on the ground... Loosely presented and not organized.  Expected better.  Not up to expectations.
 I listened to this book knowing that Bob Woodward is a solid journalist...one thing to see the sensational books on trump but this is the real deal. From All the Presidents Men to now, he has always done thorough research.
 Disappointing.  This book really does not cast any new light on what we already know from various news sources.
 What a mess we have in our Nations White House! Another Bob Woodward classic.
 The book did not provide any meaningful insight into this unstable and erratic president.
 This book give you an inside look at how dysfunctional this WH really is.  It is scary but just shows how elections have consequences.  Too bad we have to suffer for electing this idiot.
 I thought I would find something interesting about him but he's still the biggest ass.... in the world!  Couldn't stand reading another word about him
 A real eye opening read. No matter your political affiliation this book is for you.
 Very good book and the audio is great. No real news here, we already knew that the DOTUS WH is a clusterf0ck dumpster fire.
 Interesting read.  It’s like a novela but the love affair is between the author and subject.  I am liberal and still struggle with our president.  This book is entertaining if you enjoy gossip and hearsay.  Not factual as the above reviews state.
 Not only is this a snoozfest but it is alsocomplete fiction.
 I agree with Dowd on his opinion of Trump.<br/>In a lot of ways this book is frightening and makes me worry about where our country is going to end up in the next two years.
 Nice to know about this book really I like this book a lot thnx for the author for his effect of fear
 Fake!! Falsehood !! Waste of money, time and braincells!!
 I think it is a good book, just sick of hearing about him.
 NO real surprises, but surprised he was elected and how messed up the White House is
 Author does a great job of putting the chaos in order.
 He did not talk with Trump. As usual this is trial by media.
 Mr Woodward wrote a very fact driven book. So fact driven that it is a desperately sad depiction of this President and his inadequacy to fulfill his responsibilities. I'm still unsure where those around him fall; Complicit or helpful in trying to contain an impetuous, chronic liar.
 Bob Woodard does not disappoint. His clear, precise, honest story of the Trump debacle in the Whitehouse is terrifying.  A must read for anyone who wants the truth about what’s happening and why we should be afraid...very afraid!
 The audible chapters played out of order - the way I experienced the book was interesting. It was a brilliant way to portray the way society expierences political media.
 Fantastic and detailed look at President Trump before becoming President and now as President.<br/>This is a great read for anyone wanting to understand the psychology behind the decisions and statements made by the 45th President.<br/>An important read for news junkies who want to understand real time issues impacting the United States.
 please when will this childish garbage really stop ...its all gossip and not based on solid work really bad...
 This is the tip of the ice burg, trump is a narcissist and cruel inhuman and so are his white supremacist followers
 Makes even a conservative understand how horrible the situation is.  Hopefully we will all be more politically aware in the future.
 He is your president! Trump 2020
 Repetitive and boring after a while. Missing the wow factory.
 Following a tradition of providing a rich insight into every recent administration, Woodward again takes us inside the white house for an objective assessment of the key decision by the president. As expected, the book corroborates the various accounts of the 'mad house' mess and the colossal leadership failure. Must read.
 Good, America be crazy, and America be a Democracy.  Please stop voting.
 is unfamiliar with waiving any of its rights to lie, cheat and steal.
 This was a depressing  book. I think I have learned most of this by reading The Washington  Post and New York Times
 This is God's-honest truth for our time that conservatards are trying to squelch.  The repugnancy of Repugnican's support for the Clown-in-Chief called tRump shows how hollow, vacuous and self-serving they are.  The fear this brilliant author showcases belies the corrupt and transactional nature of this so-called "presidency"
 You can know the history of corruption in Russia including Putin.
 Quick<br/>Read.  Didn’t want to put it down.
 90% fabricate stories and 10% half tru
 Bob Woodward is a great journalist.
 Gag gift material only
 The more you read, the more you want Trump's handlers to be strong.
 Woodward does an amazing job as usual.
 the books explains how Trump's administration is a scalar...
 In the spirit of brevity: Pure Rubbish!
 A lot of frightful inside information
 Woodward is CIA and was part of their successful removal of President Nixon.  With this book like 'All the President's Men" he claims to have secret contacts within the White House feeding him a constant stream of damaging information about the President, however no factual proof is provided.  No evidence make thereno way to confirm anything he claims as truthful and not just fiction.
 Good read of our current disaster
 TRUMP IS OUR GREATEST PRESIDENT SINCE REAGAN.
 The truth, I liked the truth was told
 Very good  book, left me hanging  wanting more
 Not bad.  I enjoyed the book and the author’s style.  Will there be a sequel?
 One thing the book made clear - our national leaders could not communicate with each other if they had to remove expletives from their vocabularies.
 loved the last line in the book
 It is a great easy read...but most important..it's the most important read I've ever read.
 Trump by Woodward. How bad could it be?
 Informative, thorough and fascinating.
 Confirmed what we ready knew, but more insights into how bad it really is in there
 Read this book and you will know why its so important to VOTE!
 Love the moderator
 A++++++
 Good read
 Great book. Still reading it. It took so long to get it. The delivery kept getting delayed but it was worth it.
 This book is extremely well researched with credible sources.
 demoralizing old news
 Very well written book. Enlighting account of one of the most polemic administration in the White House. Extremely sarcastic hilarious yet revealing books about the Trump administration.
 Fear D Trump
 Great topic. Scary topic. But it’s not his best writing.
 Well written but no new news.
 honestly for those who follow politics this book offer very little new revelations. i am so entirely sure who this book for
 Wish an honest review of our President would be possible but by the liberal tropes it seems to be impossible.
 Didn't really care for it.  Good writing but content not to my liking.
 This book is riveting and overwhelming with numerous facts. I can’t believe how privileged, self-centered, odd, out-of-touch and manipulative Mr. Trump is.
 Well worth it. A must read/listen!
 Outstanding journalism
 True to its name, his book consolidated all that is frightening about the man that thinks he is always right in his fact free world
 Not any where near what I expected. Very slanted and seemed mostly rehash of CNN AND CBS bashing.
 Once you realize the implications of truth told here....you should be concerned, very concerned.<br/><br/>Woodward strikes yet again.  Terrific!!!!<br/>Thank You
 Great read
 Terrible book.  Would not recommend this
 A MUST READ!!!!
 What a mess.
 Fake and false information but im glad the paper was soft found use for it
 A thorough and eminently believable portrait of Trump in the White House. Makes me afraid of what had yet to come...
 Gripping
 The book has all the dates, times, places and quotations so I’m sure it’s accurate, but Woodward is kind of a boring writer.
 Pathetically scary.
 Mind boggling
 There is no editorializing in this book, just a great reporter presenting the facts as they were.  The sad thing is it doesn't make a dent in the Trump cult who would have called Watergate fake news.
 Interesting
 Would make good toilet paper if you ran out.
 Really appreciated the documentation and background.
 This book provides a very insightful look into a dysfunctional White House. I appreciate the very factual style of the book that doesn't try to embellish anything
 Love it
 Great
 Meets the hype!!
 This book didn't provide anything differently from other books I've read about the Trump administration.
 … and to think that you Americans made this man your president.<br/><br/>Carl Moore<br/>Barbados
 There is nothing surprising or even revealing in this. Another nothing burger.
 Seems inaccurate.
 Well researched quality book as you would expect from the author and after reading the last page all I could think was nothing is ever totally black and white. Enjoyed the book.
 If you want to stay in an eco-chamber, read this book !
 Expectations met.
 It wasn’t really what I expected. Essentially, it was just a compilation of stories from a bunch of ex administration officials. Bannon, preibus, and Cohn mostly.
 Yipes! Who voted for this man?
 This book is obviously sourced from those who do not like our President. How is that objective when supporters are not interviewed. And this is old news basically.
 My Kindle book loaded at 12:30 Tuesday morning , and I stayed up until 6:30 a.m. reading this fascinating and alarming story. The scariest part of this massive tome is the sheer hubris of everyone in President Trump’s orbit including the author, famed Watergate reporter, Bob Woodward. They all think they are more presidential than the actual president, and that sense of entitlement and arrogance drives this tell-all narrative.<br/><br/>Even though I agree that Trump is mentally unfit to be Commander-in-Chief – and Woodward cites many troubling incidents that point to a memory-impaired leader – it feels as if Woodward operated under the theory of selection bias, finding sources who would confirm his thesis. I don’t know what’s scarier, a president who is off the rails, or a staff that helps keep him there while they are busy running the country the way they see fit (except when the crazy uncle escapes his handlers and spouts off on Twitter.)<br/><br/>Woodward, a veteran reporter, and the man (with Carl Bernstein) who broke the Nixon-era Watergate crime with a source the known only as “Deep Throat” falls for and magnifies their conceit.  The real story isn’t Trump, it’s his unelected and unconstitutional enablers (senior staff, family, media, lobbyists, rogue governments) who act like they are running a shadow government (surreptitiously taking papers off his desk, screening his briefing materials.)  Woodward’s story will feed Trump’s main argument that there’s a Deep State at work in this country.<br/><br/>I fell in love with Woodward’s writing with “All the President's Men.” It inspired me to work in journalism. But Woodward has lost his touch. His “reporting” feels second-hand and arm’s length.  Each Chapter in his Source Notes leads with this disclaimer: “The information in the chapter comes primarily from multiple deep background interviews and firsthand sources.” We have no way of knowing what firsthand sources even means – an article he read in the New York Times whose author he’s friends with?<br/><br/>This book is beneath Woodward’s skill and reputation. You can basically retrieve the same message in “Unhinged” a much briefer and far more readable format - though no less disturbing account - of working in the Trump White House.
 Stupid stupid audio.  Has potential to be great given the research and topic, but delivery is REPETITIVE, BORING, and SLOW.
 Hard to put down. A great big giant WTF have we done.
 Easy read...
 This as an average read. This skin deep portrait of a man unfit to be president is unsurprising, which is pathetic. Trump’s ignorance is on daily display but to see his disdain for facts and briefings does sharpen the focus on how important the next election really is.
 Great read
 Best book ever
 Democrats have clearly lost their minds and ability to use logic.
 Terrible book. #TRUMPMAGA
 This book goes into great depth and behind the scenes to describe the chaos and ineptitude of the Trump presidency. Scary.
 No surprises here, Trump has the brain and emotional stability of a 5 year old... but we’ll-researches, written, and fair
 I was not impressed by this book.  Much of it is a rehash of events that were already public knowledge.  Not recommended reading by me.
 The book was informative and well written.  Even though the book takes on an immense subject, it moves along at a very readable rate.
 It is a chaotic time and read. Fear reminds us what crazy polarized political world that Trump has brought us into.
 Seems well sourced and actually somewhat balanced. It paints the administration as chaotic and undeserving, but not necessarily crooked. 5-star book
 Important and relevant.
 Enlightening. But most of the people written about are either fired, quit, or are serving prison sentences.
 Truly.
 Good book. Crappy president.
 I was disappointed at how short the book was, and surprised at how sympathetic Trump comes across via Woodward's factual reporting.
 Insightful and honest<br/>An amazing expose into the "working" of the  white house during Trumps first year.  Highly reccomended  reading
 If you don’t like this country just get out if you’re gonna complain that trump is our president.
 I didn't realize how bad it had gotten in the White House.  Sounds like a zoo.
 Let this man help our country.  If he had the same grace BHO had this country would be healing alot of wounds
 Tired of hit pieces and the anti rhetoric.  Couldn't get through it.
 Excellent
 I think everyone who does not vote should read this book!
 None
 Fearmongering is the new favorite passtime for America's elite. It's undeniable with titles like this circulating. Sensationalism sells
 Vivid in details. Gave me an insight over his unpredictable behaviors.
 Boring
 Interesting read. Not hard to figure out who some of the disenchanted ex-employees are. Bob 's trying to keep his bosses at the Post happy.
 A must read!
 I do not like the way Mr. Woodward portrayed PRESIDENT TRUMP!! He demonized him and made him out to be a real bad person who doesn't know what he's doing!! All of that is totally false!! More fake news!! Other than Abraham Lincoln, President Trump is the best President we ever had!! Thank the LORD GOD ALMIGHTY FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP!!
 Fake News!
 Great book. A must read for anyone concerned about our Republic.  This boom should be required reading for all college students.
 Very little new information as I<br/>was well aware of the president's penchant for immature tantrums ...saving grace is Woodward's writing.
 I wiped my butt this book 🤣
 I dislike seeing this same book. In red and with his face in my face. Could this be changed to any other bookk? Please.
 How many lies can you fit in one book? Read and find out.
 If you are looking for a comfort book because you have yet to deal with the fact that Hillary lost, this might be the book for you. If you are looking for a carefully investigated book with hard facts, you won't find them here. Woodward goes into hibernation and only comes out every 8 years. His hibernation coincides, oddly enough, with a Democrat in the White House. He pines for his glory days of taking down another Republican President all the while trying to present himself as an "unbiased investigative reporter". So why doesn't he lend his talents to look into a Democrat? Any Democrat? He was completely missing during the scandals of both Clintons and of Obama. Now he comes out with a book that has about as much corroborated evidence as Dr. Ford's testimony.
 If you don’t live in the swap, this is an extremely boring tale.
 like always! lies!!!
 Honestly, boring and nothing new.  I stopped reading around page 100. I read the Wash Post and NYT, and watch CNN, daily, and this book provides very little info I didn’t know before. The few good nuggets were released in the press before the book was.<br/><br/>And for those who think you need to finish reading a book before leaving a rating - hogwash. Like a new tv series, if the first episode or two can’t keep my interest, I move on... life is short.
 Have you ever known someone who talks and talks and won’t quit. Totally obsessed with his pinions and will not let anyone voice their own. That’s Woodward on Trump. It’s his view right or wrong and he’s sticking to it. No proof or documentation of anything. Many prominent and respectful people denying what he says they said. Could be true, could be fiction, could be lies. One thing it is not and that’s a book of verifiable facts backed up by first hand accounts willing to go on the record. You can watch CNN and read the New York Times and get the same stories without spending your money on this book.
 Great reading!  I’m independent and enjoyed it.
 After I purchased the Audible add-on, and it read through the book, Kindle DELETED the audio, now asking me to buy it again!  I have no way to get a refund, no option for it.  So no longer synced with the text, and no one to complain to.<br/><br/>The narrator and the book reading were sterling, but if I can't HEAR the book but once, what's the point?
 It has not been downloaded.  I’m confused.
 I can not see the individual chapter titles in the table of content.  This means it is impossible to skip ahead to parts of the book that I want to read. My only choice is to read every page in the book, without skipping.  That's ridiculous.
 Read the first 3 chapters but did not read further because I do not watch R rated movies and do not read books with the kind of language Bob used in this book. I believe that these men talk like that but Bob Woodward could have been just as affective at presenting the truth of this administration without the foul language so anybody could comfortably read it. Will not finish reading it and would not recommend it to anyone.
 Cancel order of E-book
 I did not mean to order digital books I want the actual books
 I accidentally ordered this digitally - there is not way to cancel the order so I just  got robbed as I have no way of getting this digitally nor do I ever want digtial/kindle books -
 “Real Power Is-I Don’t Want To Use The Word-Fear.” Candidate Donald J Trump<br/><br/>Trump declined to be interviewed for this book, Woodward tells us, but almost everyone else involved in the presidency was interviewed.  Most anyone who is concerned about this presidency, and those who wonder just what is going on, have heard the most surprising, worrisome and shocking parts of the book. However, the last chapter was the chapter that gave me the most pause.<br/><br/>Woodward went about investigating this presidency, and to find out what really went on in the White House. He disclosed the most disorganized, chaotic presidency he has ever seen. In the chapters he describes many incidents of presidential inconsistencies, lapses in memory and dangerous actions. He follows the footsteps of each story in detail. We can see the people involved from his vivid descriptions of them. This is unlike any other presidencies, and it is shocking and indeed dangerous.<br/><br/>Bob Woodward has built his credibility in the past 50 years with his intrepid and honest reporting.  Many may try to bring him down, but I have lived through his reporting, and I know it has been truthful, time has shown us. He has most of his interviews on tape, and if he feels the need he can disclose them. However, at the same time, Woodward has built his credibility on his honesty and his ability to listen. People start to talk, they find it difficult to keep ‘things’ in. Read the book at your leisure if you can, but I found it so well written, I had to read it all. I am a Resistor, and this book has given me more impetus to continue with my Resistance.<br/><br/>Recommended. prisrob 09-11-18
 People who criticize the book for failing to reveal anything that has not already been repeatedly explored by Rachel Maddow are not being fair to Woodward, whose journalistic ethics are the highest.  The intention of the book seems to be to give an accurate narrative of events that began when Trump was first persuaded to run for office.  Nearly every "fact" is already out there.  What is unique is Woodward's insight into the dynamics that were put in play when traditional government processes collided with Donald Trump's combined ignorance and tender ego.  An example, but not a spoiler:  Clapper and Comey agonized over how to reveal the well-founded intelligence reports that russia hacked the elections, because they knew Trump would treat it as de-legitimizing his victory.  But then, in a tactical blunder, Comey told Trump about the Russian hacking AND the Steele dossier simultaneously.  This was the beginning of the war on the intelligence community.  Trump felt like Comey was using a tactic employed by J. Edgar Hoover to implicitly threaten him.  It would have been a better strategy, in retrospect, to present the Russian hacking briefing on one occasion and the Steele dossier's salacious and uncorroborated details on another, perhaps with a different messenger.  Read this book carefully to understand how difficult it must be for patriotic career military and intelligence officials to deliver information to someone predisposed to kill the messenger.  If you want proof of collusion, wait for it . . . .
 I'm still reading it, but I want to say Woodward NEVER disappoints. The ultimate story hasn't been told YET, but this is the penultimate story -- the wheels are turning, and it's not over until it's over - as true in baseball as it is in politics. The ultimate story is still going on, and I'm hoping Woodward will write that one, too. I remember the original Woodward and Bernstein days, and the original book and movie.
 I read a lot of newspapers everyday so I'm pretty much aware of what this Fool in the Oval is up to, but this book really did a fine job of illustrating how totally whacked he is.  This is a Gary Cohn story, in my opinion, as so much is focused on trade.  Donald Trump is the most dangerous president this country has ever had and I can't wait for him to get tossed out.  In the meantime, I hold my breath that he doesn't do irreparable harm to our country or our planet.  If you're a Trump supporter and still think he's the cat pajamas after reading this, there is no hope for you.  Woodward is, without a doubt, the most reliable reporter out there and all of Trump's blathering and whimpering will never change that.
 Bob Woodward deserves a medal for his important and valuable book, "Fear".  It isn't left wing propaganda, and it isn't a collection of assumptions or hearsay.  It is the truth about the worst and most disgusting person to ever occupy the office of the president of this country that I've seen in my lifetime.  Someone on CNN recently said that a lot of Americans have been in a fetal position since the 2016 election.  It sure feels like a more comfortable place to be in rather than watching, listening and reading on a daily basis what is happening to the country I grew up in.  What Bob Woodward has written is the truth about a man who is unqualified and unfit to be president of the United States of America.  As Woodward tells us, Trump doesn't read, has little understanding of history and of how the government works.  He doesn't read briefings or anything that his advisors prepare for him to help him understand and clarify what he obviously doesn't understand or doesn't want to understand because only Trump's way is the right way in his little and limited mind.  Woodward used so many interviews and personal conversations to get the facts for this excellent and easy-to-read book.  They can't all be wrong in concluding that Trump is an insatiable liar. Read this book no matter which side you're on to get a perspective other than what's on Fox News.<br/><br/>In conclusion I only have to say that if Rod Rosenstein wanted to wire up when talking to Trump or if he tried to use the Twenty-fifth Amendment to get Trump out of there, then I say more power to him.  Vote.
 First, let me say I voted for Trump as a "Disrupter" and to that end he has exceeded expectations.<br/> The book starts out great through the first 5 or 6 chapters, but then becomes a bit convoluted. The bottom line of the book and reality is that Trump is surrounded by apprentice scoundrels, and that he is the boss scoundrel.<br/>He demands loyalty but gives none. As a Former Marine I would not follow him into battle; I would never have the opportunity because he and his sons would never go into harm’s way.<br/>The best of the book was the hinted forthcoming bombshells, that never exploded. Woodward dropped the ball on this one, and as an author myself, it’s nice to see even the big boys, Simon &amp; Schuster, have editing issues.<br/>Jay Fitzpatrick author of “The Patsy”.
 I think I have read enough about Trump and Putin to last me a lifetime. If I never hear or read anything about them again - that will be fine with me<br/>I knew Trump getting elected would be a horrible thing for America - BEFORE he was elected., He is far worse than I expected. And now with the Putin connection on top of my normal Trump distrust - it is a bit much.<br/>Originally I distrusted Trump just for who he is - the kind of person he is. Now I know so much more and I distrust him even more. And Putin is pure evil - so that connection raises the level of distrust and dislike
 Backed up by facts and reporting skills developed over many years, Fear has information that helps sort out all the chaos surrounding the current administration.  If you follow politics regularly as I do, there will be surprises, and if you don't usually follow politics at all but think it's time you need to wake up, this book will help you get up to speed.  Regardless of your political affiliation, I'm pretty sure there is information here that you have not heard, and it's backed up by facts.
 We are in the midst of the biggest American political crisis of the 21st century and Woodward lays it out with clarity.  The critical thinking that is absent in the White House under Trump is something that is strange and odd and yet here we are trying to decode the reasons why we are trying to navigate Trump's daily lies and turmoil.  Read this book for insight as we live through this in real time.  Woodward can't give us the satisfaction of a ending where we all live happily ever after and the bad guy(s) go to prison, but we will have to wait for an second tome to get to the ending of this turmoil.  Fear, it's the code for everything Trump does. Logic is gone, and fear rules Trump.
 This was one of the most well written books I have read. So many sources , interviews, and tapes to keep this book true. Thank you Bob Woodward.
 Anyone who paid modest attention during the aftermath of the Watergate scandal already knew Bob Woodward would do an excellent investigative report, but I was surprised by the information he elicited from those who would be expected to refuse any comment.  People voluntarily talked with him, agreed he could tape the conversation and then revealed astounding details.<br/><br/>I have followed the Trump administration reports far more rigorously than the Nixon era and didn't anticipate new information, just a cohesive report on what we know to date. I highlighted more in this book than any other book, and I use the note and highlight feature routinely on fiction and non-fiction books.
 I think this book was rushed into publication.  As a result, it was not edited as thoroughly as it could have been, in my opinion.  I found that it was hard to follow many conversations contained in the text - difficult to figure out who was talking and how the stories were sourced.  That said, I think the book is very balanced, and at times, reported on actions of Trump actually seemed to make sense, even if he cuts traditional bureaucratic corners.  There is so much negative stuff that Trump has done, and this book merely skims the surface.  A lot of familiar episodes of idiocy in the first year and half of Trump's presidency don't even make the book.  The book was an easy quick read.
 ... because we already know most of what's in the book. As others have commented, this book is sort of a "dry" read, in that the writing make it like a very long newspaper article. But the reporting seems to be very solid, and there are numerous little insights which were new to me - and I am a compulisve consumer of political news. There are some nice profiles of people surrounding Trump, with some new insights into their influence on him and his presidency so far (Nov 2018).  It's not the easiest book to read, but the fact that Woodword keeps the chapters very short helps a lot.
 I realize that, only very rarely, will anyone who holds a belief strongly ever have their mind changed by argument or by the presentation of documentation, evidence or opinion that differs from that belief. So, I don't expect that most Trump supporters will spend the money to buy this book and that most of those that do, will discount it as just more "Fake News."<br/><br/>I read this book in two days - spellbound by the incredible detail and Woodward's renowned capacity to organize and present complex material in an understandable way. However, I will not try to change anyone's mind.<br/><br/>I will simply pose a question that this book brings to the surface of my mind:<br/>Who has the better record of simply telling the truth ... Donald Trump or Bob Woodward?<br/>I hope that everyone pondering the trustworthiness of the information in this book will consider the question before falling back on what they believed before they picked it up.
 Bob Woodward has written a very disturbing book about Donald Trump.  It's not overly written and is nothing but the facts for people to read and make their own decisions.  I found it very disturbing and hope that everyone votes in the upcoming midterms - we have to make changes in Washington and REALLY drain the swamp!
 Woodward presents what has occured with the Trump Presidency up through the middle of 2018.  He does so in a seeming unbiased fashion, although what is painted is an extremely disturbing picture of someone who seems very close to bringing the U.S. to war.  I have never seen as many people resign in as short a time as has occured with Trump as he seems to go through staff like they are meaningless.  And to him they apparently are.<br/><br/>This is well written, no surprise there, and is fascinating as well.  I will say that before Trump I did not spend nearly as much time and effort trying to keep up with what is going on with our government.  I don't believe I am the only one either.  If your reading this to determine whether or not you should buy and read this book, the answer is yes.
 Guess I wanted more of a put down of the worst President we've ever had and this book doesn't do it.  Dwells on the financial issues too much for my tastes and spends too much time on the idiots surrounding the idiot.
 Al though I have read most of Woodward's books, I can not say for sure (book not fully read) how this one turns out to be since it regards only the Trump Administration's first two years.  Personally, it may be a premature look at the Trump Administration rather than looking at it from three or more years.  However, in spite  of that, it appears it will be an interesting book when finalized.
 Just got this book on my Kindle and I’m reading away. Nothing that new but from an investigative journalist of this integrity it is a very believeable picture of a man not suited to the job. Fear is right!
 A portrait of a White House in disarray! It stitches together the patchwork crazy quilt that portrays what goes on inside the walls of our present government! It is what I imagined &amp; worse, but Bob Woodward describes it in a straight forward prose sans his own opinions! It is honest and true. You can draw your own conclusions!
 I cannot say enough about this audio book.  First, the book is very well written &amp; interesting; packed with facts.  Secondly, an audio book may be made or broken by the reader; this book is well read.  A great audio for a long ride, not for high-traffic metro-driving, as there is so much information being given.  Well done.
 I have seen Bob Woodward on his book tour and he let the cat out of the bag for anyone who followed it as I did.  I would really have liked to hear from his conversations with Carl Bernstein as he lamented also.  Carl is really in the mix.<br/>Still a very nice read by one of our venerable reporters keeping the right to a free press alive.  Bless you Bob!
 Whoa! Everyone in America should read this book. This is not gossip, like some of the other books about 45. This is true journalism. The text is only 60% of the book. The rest is footnotes and source material.
 I love this kindle version, many names used could have been confusing, but a quick highlight gives complete bio for each name, each institute, acronyms,etc... Compelling read, I'm not a Trump fan, but this book gave me a better insight into his ideals. Fairly written, left me very surprisingly (almost) sympathetic to Trump! Believe it or not!
 I was disappointed, actually. The writing style was more like "People" magazine than what I remembered of Bob Woodward. It created the impression that much of what was written was gossipy, no matter how well-researched the book may have been. I don't believe this book will stand the test of time.
 I enjoyed reading this book by Bob Woodward about what really was going on in the white house with Donald Trump as president, a job he never should have gotten.  Every voter should have read Trump's book, The Art Of The Deal, before the election and maybe they would have realized what a con man he really was.
 Anyone who reads the newspaper or news magazines already knows everything that's is this book that's important to know. Turned out to be kind of pointless to buy it. But, if by chance you missed all the shocking revelations that were "spoilered" by the media, these things are shocking and important to know.
 SCARY
 Great book
 Not a read for the faint of heart, but essential reading if only to understand the train wreck that is the Trump Administration.
 What can I say - an honest portrayal by of well respected journalist of a dishonest and least respected politician of all time.
 All comments are from credible interviews, the views of our current (supposed) leader are frightening, but I don't doubt them as they are from credible persons. We all have our own views, but the majority would agree that Trump could be the AntiChrist.
 A credible and candid view into an administration unprepared for holding office , sophomoric in its approach, and too arrogant to  effectively lead beyond its own real estate based experience.  Fascinating read, and unsettling as well.
 This book clarified a great many things and am thrilled to have learned so much about what is happening in the white house.
 Bob Woodward does it again.  There isn't anyone that can dispute his research!!
 Haven’t finished the book (halfway through), but it’s FASCINATING !!!!
 Interesting book.  A little scary (and disappointing) when one finds out what really goes on in the highest offices controlling our country.  But it's information the public needs to know.
 Well documented and we'll written, Woodward takes us behind the scenes to observe a White House in disarray headed by a most improbable individual who listens only to his own beliefs.
 Woodward's book is riveting.  A startling look into the dysfunction of this White House.  Heroes abound...too bad the biggest villain in this epic story is 'the boss'!
 excellent book. Authentic
 GREAT READ &amp; OPPORTUNITY TO BE INFORMED‼️
 perfect
 With every day in D.C. bringing more controversy, clashes and quicksand, this calm, careful, studied view of what's going on is a de-jangler.
 Actually I only read about half of this book because as a viewer of Fox News I already knew most of what the author disclosed in the book.
 I am learning  about the all the conflicts that the US has been dealing with our  allies and enemies alike, that our current President has so little knowledge, with the rest of the world politics and the people that tried to lead him away from dangerously close attacks at such a critical time in our history.. amazing read! I could not put the book down!
 An author you can trust. A perfect title for reality in our country at this point in history. Everyone should read it.
 Very factual, makes me even more sad at the state of the whitehouse.<br/>This clown and the whole repub circus has to go.
 Great job of presenting just how the Chump in charge does business in the White House.  Loved the ending.
 I had already heard some or most  of these antics of Trump's already play out in the white house. Good Read
 It took me several days to read. It is so intense. Red seems to be the correct color for the front of this book. Russia owns Trump
 Bought as gift, the reader requested the book &amp; said it was good, since Bob Woodward was Author.
 This was a great book.  It pulled no punches.  It revealed Donald Trump with all of his foibles and many shortcomings.
 This regime is corrupt, incompetent and dangerous. This book confirmed everything I thought and more.
 Very well written and fact filled but written in such a way that, for me, was a page turner.
 Good read--although I'm not finished with book, so far I'm impressed--very interesting and quite informative--good purchase
 Could not put this book down! Highly recommend!
 Liked direct quotes from members of White House Staff.  Well written, holds your attention.
 Great book. Great read! So much information. Thank you for writing this book.
 Very informative and, being that it is from actual facts, I fear for America's safety.
 Took a minute to come in but I’m really enjoying this book! It’s terrifying but great!
 I really enjoyed this book! Bob Woodward is a very talented author. I highly recommend this book!
 Great book!  Bob Woodward has done an incredible job describing the Trump White House.
 It was a good read. It was similar to reading “People”, comments by unidentified sources.

 A real eye-opener about the most foreboding White House of our time, as only Bob Woodward can report.
 good deal.
 It took a little long to arrive, but other than that, everithing is very good. Thanks!!!
 Gift
 I usually like reading Woodward, but I found this recent book to be too plodding.
 Well written and appears to be credible, however, that is subjective.
 it is what it is, a man comes along and challenges the senate and house because for years all they have done is nothing but take care of themselves and forgotten who they should be taking care off and he is  endlessly criticized. Obama bow down to Cuba with no benefit to the U.S and he is praised by the media, Trump gets north Korea to start talking about denuclearization and he is bad mouth from all quarters. WE are a good nation in bad trouble.
 Thanks Bob!!

 Well researched, detailed, and easy to follow. This author is a master of investigative reporting with such skill. The truth behind the face of our president is truly frightening.
 I have long been an admirer of Bob Woodward, ever since he rose to prominence during the Watergate era. I was very young during that era, and Woodward inculcated me with a deep appreciation of investigative journalism. In my opinion, he is the finest print journalist in the Western world. While this book doesn't reveal anything most of us don't already know about the current president and his chaotic administration, it validates and confirms one's suspicions with exhaustively detailed and researched information conveyed in Woodword's inimitable no-nonsense style. There are innumerable books about Trump currently on the market. Some of them, such as "Fire and Fury" and "Russian Roulette," are also well-written by distinguished journalists. But Woodward is the gold standard. This book is a must-read for aficionados of true journalistic skill, a dying art form.
 This is Bob Woodwards book about the Trump White House.  Got this v ok from overdrive because I have read some of his other books and enjoyed them.  Did not really learn anything new.  Clearly, Trump has issues and even though his staff has tried to keep him in check they haven't always been able to do so.  Really enjoyed the book though.  Great writing, as per usual for a Bob Woodward book.
 Bob Woodward is on target with this book. A must read!! The president’s men don’t seem to be trembling with FEAR. What they mostly feel is contempt for Trump or pity for his ignorance and the “teenage logic” of his obsessively vented grievances. His jealousy is overbearing as well as his narcissistic personality. He clearly is portraited as a bully and is not fit to be president. I agree with the author.
 Woodward provides what the previous tell-all White House books lack, serious reporting and documentation. The story hasn’t changed, it shows the US president as a person lacking the skills necessary to be president.
 Although I object to Woodward's neoliberal position and fealty to the cult of Beltway groupthink, this book will stand the test of time as testimony to the lunacy of the Trump administration
 Outstanding book.  Gives good insight into the current administration and its operation.
 Well-researched. After all, written by Bob Woodward. Very interesting read.
 I will have to actually read the book, because the audio version is just painfully hard to follow. It may be the narrator, but I think that the subject matter necessitates that you be completely dedicated to the task at hand while you're reading this one and with an audio book, it is just too easy to get distracted.
 Told the behind the scenes story of Trump. Very enlightening &amp; scary.
 This is scary horror!
 Ok. Nothing new in my opinion but well done.
 I enjoyed these items very well.
 Good book
 Great read. Couldnt put it down
 I got caught up in all of the media's hype, when this first came out.  Weeks after finishing it, there's not much that I can specifically recall.  The author does a good job of telling the story; I'm just not sure what is fact and what is not (although, I suspect most of what he says is true, at least to some degree).  It's a disturbing read, if you believe even half of what the author says.
 Very informative
 Excellent
 I've never seen the amazing word, "F---" used in a book or article more often unless it was in Playboy.<br/>It was I can't put this down book.
 Interesting read.
 I was a bit disappointed in it--nothing that terribly new in the book, but some behind the scenes info on the current White House and its residents
 Great book!! Not a trump fan!
 Great job writing this book......I have just over-dosed on Trump
 Awesome book by famous journalist Bob Woodward “Fear” is amazing for its depth of research and logic. A must read!
 Some of the highlights of the book were on the news but the book still was enlightening
 Bob Woodward does it again. Reading this book was like being a fly on the wall in the White House.
 Excellent book by this highly regarded and notable journalist!  May give you nightmares though!
 Trump is following Hitler's playbook to the letter. I hope people really take this book in and heed Woodward's warnings.
 Gift...
 Read it to get to know the man.
 What a book! The author has done a complete and thorough research.  It's amazing how many talked to him. I love it that he got it on tape with their permission. Amazing.
 This is an interesting book. Kind of jumps all over the place, repetitive and sometimes blah. To be honest, I've had trouble getting through it since so many of the stories have already been on the news and it's kind of redundant to read about them after the fact (for me). I expected more from Bob Woodward but it is what it is.
 Well written...
 Not one of Woodward's best efforts
 Bob Woodward again shows us the product of honest and unrelenting journalism in "Fear.". The book is exhaustively researched and sourced almost to the point of making it a hard read.<br/> The picture it paints is honestly frightening.  An out of control President incapable of resisting his worst impulses careening around the White House ignoring virtually everyone in sight.
 How insulting.... In journalism its called "the slant? and darn if this book ain't slanted. The Washington Post is a joke to those who aren't brainwashed with bias and agenda all rolled into one disgusting package. Its more leftist propaganda brought to you by the richest man in the world: Senior Jeff Bezos. If you love this book, the New World Order has already won you over. Read it and weep.
 A fascinating read, about the most divisive political figure of our time and the patriots, rascals and sociopaths he surrounds himself with.
 Husband ordered it and loves it
 I have no doubt that Bob Woodward is a great reporter, but I did not learn anything from this book that I had not heard in the everyday news. I hate to say this, but I think Woodward took us readers for suckers. I’ll forgive him though. He did such a good job exposing Nixon that I allow him to fool me once. I shall not read any of his books again however. Remember, fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, etc. etc.
 The organization of the book was interesting, kind of just a bunch of stories thrown together. Give a little insight into Washington politics, the give and take needed to accomplish anything. Overall, it is a tale of a dysfunctional government headed by a highly dysfunctional person.
 Same info that's been in the news.
 So Trump has been like that ever since... what he does now is nothing new...
 Its  another Trump book.<br/>If you believe in the tooth fairy and Trump don't read this book
 After reading this book, the title should tell everyone what to feel with this man in the White House.  I'm scared.
 Objective reporting
 This is a great read.
 If you’re not worried for our country, you should be.
 👌
 This was one of these books that I knew I needed to read.  I didn't enjoy reading it but it definitely was important to read.  The amount of detail and information was impressive.  But not surprising considering the author.  Maybe ignorance is bliss.  Reading this book will definitely kick you out of any blissful state!  But yes, we can handle the truth so here is the next piece to bite off and chew!
 I don't doubt the solid reporting behind Woodward's latest.  The book seems to be well sourced.  If this were a series of individual reports on a handful of subjects, each would probably hold up pretty well.<br/><br/>The trouble is, Woodward seems to rely too heavily on a handful of sources who are quite obviously agenda-driven (Steve Bannon, Reince Priebus, Gary Cohn, and Rob Porter, most obviously).  It doesn't mean their inside scoop is a set of lies, but without competing POVs, each of the vignettes in this book are screaming out for context, or at least skepticism.  Additionally, huge issues and incidents that occur in the span covered by Fear and which flesh out context of what is covered go completely unmentioned.  As such, the reader has to rely on their own outside knowledge of the plethora of events in the daily Trump scandal machine in order to fully evaluate what is reported.<br/><br/>Last, the selection of what is covered in Fear and what is not amounts to a big part of what makes it successful – or not – as storytelling.  There are repeated themes, yes, and some of them managed well, but there also seems to be an arbitrariness to what is included and what is not.  Again, I'm guessing an over reliance on some key sources determined what is covered and what is not.  In particular, the closing of the book is a head-scratcher. The writing suddenly becomes vague and disjointed and the point of conclusion actually doesn't form a conclusion of any sort.  If it had raised a set of questions, fine.  But the questions should not be "What exactly just happened in this last chapter?"<br/><br/>All in all, this book feels incomplete and rushed.  I don't doubt Woodward's integrity but I do wonder if he's been an insider for so long that he's become enamored of his access to key players.  And as a writer, this is not the first Woodward book that came across as shapeless and meandering.
 Gift
 A detailed and disturbing look at the degradation of the Presidency in particular and the executive branch in general of the government of the United States by President Trump.  The book is very well documented from multiple sources.  One can only hope that Mr. Trump is either removed from office soon through impeachment or defeat at the polls before any more damage is done to the government.
 Woodward proving once again that he is an incredible force of reporting.
 Incredible detail, presented logically and easily understood. Fascinating a truly engrossing read.<br/>As an Australian, the intricate detail gave me much needed background information
 Scary stuff. Bought this when it first came out, didn't read it until now, holed up in the house in the dead of winter. I have read several of Woodward's books as he is a noted impartial critical reporter of whoever is in office at the time, left, right or center. Many revelations in this book have been proven accurate, and that's not a good thing. Unlike many anti Trump books out there, Woodward has no axe to grind, and that is what makes this so eye opening. Recommended for "both sides."
 A must read for the times
 Great book about the chaos in the white house  also alarming about what is going on
 not to my liking. don't like to downgrade a person especially a sitting president
 I like that real people were quoted by name, not just vague sources. Good writing as usual.
 Great book Just as I suspected Trump is not qualified to be the president.I can’t understand why people voted for him. So far 2 years as president he has done nothing for the people or for our country to make it great as he promised.
 Totally believable and frightening inside view of the Trump administration. I’m looking forward to “Fear II” for sure. Hopefully we can survive this moron.
 Every day I love more that spidery scorpion...
 Repeat of cable news
 Gave as gift
 Loved this book. Highly recommend.
 Told them I didn't want this book. Nothing was done about it.
 Reading, information.
 Excellent book but too depressing to read in bed. Well sourced repotting.
 A lot of hype good info but not a page turner
 Great read
 Read it cover to cover.  It provided good insight.  Loved the quotes near the end!
 Well researched and annotated.  He told the story within the context of current/past eve ts.  I found it fascinating g
 Bob Woorward is a very reputable journalist. He presents his case in a brilliant way...or scary should I say?
 She feels it's a must read!
 Disturbing overview of what goes on daily in Washington these days. FEAR is an excellent title for what most of the country feels every day since the 2016 election!
 Great read, but complicated.  Very well annotated, I wish there was a way to get through the appendices better than page by page.
 Love it!
 great book - I think it shd be required reading for Trump supporters
 Seems unfinished, like it was rushed to publication. But thoroughly researched, as expected. Good read documenting President Trump’s first year.
 I really enjoyed this book. A very interesting take on what goes on behind closed doors of one of the most powerful seats in the world.
 This book offers comprehensive details about the Trump Whitehouse that has cleared up any misunderstandings about this administration. It bridges the limited news coverage and stops the reader from taking leaps over questionable or missing information. I appreciate the facts that are precise and well documented. This book is well worth the read. I give it 5 stars.
 Interesting, very well written. Amazing that Bob Woodward is still writing  after all these years!
 Well written and current by one of the great duo who broke open Watergate
 It’s Woodward. ‘Nuf said. Truth won’t die in darkness as long as journalists like this keep defying the fashionable new gravity of falsehoods. Read it and weep...or don’t.
 He is a skilled author, spins a yarn, is persuasive and says he is factual. I felt it was a credible account. Recommended.
 Okay, but like all other Trump books about every other quote comes from Steve Bannon. Nepotism and cronyism be cursed.<br/>To much supposition , questionable facts.
 👍
 This is admittedly a difficult to track topic, but done skillfully.  Def leaves you concerned, w some of the most detailed mueller color I’ve seen anywhere
 Help me to understand the behavior of a demented president . Impeach him
 An excellent review of the history of the first two years of the Trumpian Odyssey
 This book was an amazing read from a truly thoughtful and knowledgeable author..
 Liked the details and research behind the information. Shocking and scary as to who is President.
 Worth the read.  I would encourage everyone to draw their own conclusions.
 The information was spot on enjoyed every page.
 The person on the audio is really good to listen to. The audio book is very good as well.
 Waited for my copy, worth it.
 Scary to think that Donald J. Trump is actually the president of the United States. The damages he has caused in foreign relations and world trade will not be soon corrected.  Bob Woodward has done an incredible job in documenting the weaknesses of the Trump administration.
 A lot of good inside information.  Reinforces my decision to vote for Hillary.  Slows down a bit toward the end.
