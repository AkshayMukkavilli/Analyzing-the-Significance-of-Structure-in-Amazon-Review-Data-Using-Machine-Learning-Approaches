 Within a month taking these I lost 20lbs... and that's not even the best part. I suffer from severe depression, waking up in the morning is sometimes impossible. But on these pills I feel .... hope. Since I was 12 I have struggled, but these suppliments have me energetic and excited for the day and future. Thank you so much. Because of these, I'm looking at going back to school.<br/><br/>3 months in. This sounds so fake, but this stuff literally changed my whole life! I thought I'd be depressed and lazy forever. This stuff has me more outgoing, kayaking, swimming, going to school.... I've even lost 42 lbs so far with the help of diet and exercise. Thank you for this product, I'll be taking this for the rest of my life.
 Makes me jittery.  The first two days I took it I thought it was the greatest thing out, I felt fantastic, I was going to take over the world.  Then day 3, I couldn't sit down if you had glued me to the chair, I had heart palpitations, and a general feeling of well, this sucks.  My house was extremely clean, but the whole feeling like my heart was going to blow up thing just didn't really do it for me. I wish it would have kept helping.  I really wanted to love this product. I did give it time and tried it again, same with the same end result.<br/><br/>UPDATE-  Since I made this review, I got an immediate response from the company.  I have been working directly with a representative, she has issued a refund on the product that didn't fit my needs, has given me an idea for a different product to try, and I will! I really did feel amazing the first few days of using this.  I definitely reacted to something in these, but I'm more than willing to give something else a try.  I  am truly amazed by the customer service.  I didn't even think to contact the company!  They reached out to me!!  I'm very impressed by Zhou standing behind their products!!!
 Omg..!! I love this..!! I read the reviews and saw how it did not work for some and for others it did, so I decided to give it a try anyway. I was diagnosed with hypothyroid back in 2003, the prescribed medication never did anything for me, I was on 150mcg of Levothyroxine, and I always felt horrible, even though I never missed a dose. I was always fatigued no matter what. I received this on 8/07/2017 in the morning and started taking it that very first day. I had my doubts, but...a week after, my husband noticed that I did not have any problems getting up in the mornings, I was also sleeping better, without taking my sleeping pills, my brain fog went away and I had more energy throughout the day. I feel good enough to join Zumba and all the other classes at my gym, which I did..!! I missed feeling like this, I missed wanting to do things, I missed the energy, my kids are happy too.!! I will definitely order again..!!
 I have a borderline hypothyroidism condition. What is that? Well its when your doctor and endocrinologist think you have hypothyroidism and you have all the symptoms, including a swollen thyroid, but labs are borderline. So while I was told to retest in a year, I wanted relief from the fatigue,  mood swings, and everything you'd not want as someone with that condition. So about 4 months ago I decided to try this as a last ditch effort to find some relief. To my surprise 2 days in I had noticed a huge difference. I wasn't moody or impatient, sluggish, tired, exhausted, having anxiety or anything. It felt like my body was working how it should. So recently I had run out thinking my newest delivery would be here in time, well that wasn't the case and I had gone about 4 days without it and boy was it bad. Not withdrawal, but you get used to not feeling the way you did prior to this supplement, and everything I'd not wanted to go through was full fledged ruini g my day. So when I did finally take get it and take it, it was such a relief the next day. Zhou Nutrition is by far the best company for all natural sourced ingredients in their most potent forms. I've tried several of their products. As long as they are around I will ALWAYS buy from them. I'd recommend this product, their pro Clenz,  Calm now, and Methyl B-12. Great customer service. They stand by their guarantee. (My mom didn't get the same effect to the extent that I did, so for the price she wasn't happy and she got her money back). Not only do they honor their 60 day money back claim, Amazon backs you up, so you have nothing to lose.
 I was hesitant in buying this product but I'm so freaking glad I took a chance. It has helped so much and my doctor wanted to know what I was doing........I replied, "I didn't do anything but take a chance"..... and I didn't have to pay another $200.00 to visit my doctor. I will keep ordering.....again and again.....
 I started taking this in order to overcome fatigue, and weight gain. It really helped my fatigue. I took it around 6:00 a.m. I still felt good by 6-7 in the evening. I have felt good enough to start walking again, which has helped with my weight.  I did buy another bottle, as I plan to use every morning.
 Great stuff! I am not aware of a thyroid issue, but I have noticed increased energy &amp; weight loss. I always say my metabolism is out of whack. This is obviously the jump start I needed. It actually took me a few weeks to notice results. I'm very satisfied &amp; I will continue to use.
 I cant say enough about these. I bought them after reading reviews, an I feel so much better after taking them. I was constantly tired, sluggish. Not anymore. Lost ten lbs in 2 weeks too! Thanks!!
 Noticed a big difference in energy, weightloss and appetite within a few days of starting these vitamins. Now my mom and sisters have started taking it as well. Highly recommend!
 This product changed my life!!!<br/><br/>After nearly 2 years of suffering with Brain Fog, Chronic Fatigue, and chronic mild depression. I lost track of the various doctors I've visited, all the results came out "normal", though my TSH was around 4.37, and TPO was 1000+. symptoms included "vertigo", brain fog, extreme fatigue, etc. I was 29 when all these symptoms appeared, where I was leading a highly stressful life (job, family etc)<br/><br/>The cure for all my issues started when I visited local functional medicine doctor, where I was exposed to eating quality food, avoiding processed sugars/junk food, leading balanced life, and importantly supplementation. I was 70% healed with change in lifestyle, but this product made me 100% again. I haven't felt this good in a decade or more. I also take the "Neuro Peak" because some of the ingredients in the product help with stress management, ex phosphatidylserine.
 I had a total thyroidectomy 15 years ago &amp; have felt pretty much like crap ever since. I was always full of energy &amp; ready to go at the drop of a hat until I had that surgery. I gained 50 lbs &amp; have been just feeling like a slug for all the years since. I take 120 mg of Armour Thyriod daily. I got these Tuesday, took 2 Tuesday night &amp; man what a difference.Wednesday I was a whirlwind nonstop, Cleaning out closets was just a start! Thursday  was more of the same getting things done that takes me days were done in hours. I am amazed! I don't know exactly what all is in them (I know...read the label) all I know is I felt almost like myself again. My energy was up about 70%, brain fog had lifted &amp; I just feel good....finally! no upset stomach or any other after effects that energy drinks give me. I read the reviews &amp; honestly didn't believe most of them but am so glad I took the chance on these. They are so worth the $22. I was not paid by anyone to write this or in any way compensated for it. Just wanted to leave a review for anyone who has had issues since thyroid surgery because for me this is the light at the end of a tunnel I never thought I would see. If something changes I'll update but until then I hope these work for you the way they they have worked for me.
 This is the first thyroid support, including years of prescriptions, that has not only helped me feel better but also eliminated my faint mustache &amp; a few unruly nasal hairs. After only 1 bottle!
 I have been on a bioidentical thyroid prescription Naturthroid for some years. Even still I often found I could hardly stay away past dinner and frequently fell asleep on the couch.  I am 58, female, in menopause and live a healthy lifestyle with both clean eating and exercise.  I knew I was aging but I felt older than I thought I should be.  After reading all the reviews about this product, I decided to give it a one month try.  All I can say is WOW! Instead of falling asleep at dinner I now stay up until a more normal bedtime like 9-10. I feel energetic throughout the day too.  My hair and skin feel moister and less dry and my eye brows are growing hair where they were thin.  As a bonus, my weight which has been at the same level despite my best effort to lose five or so pounds, dropped a couple of pounds in the 4th week of use.  I have not really done anything different other than take this complex. Needless to say I have reordered.
 Oh my goodness, this product. For the last month I’ve had the most insane headaches/migraines that occurred only in the afternoon, came back every single day only in the afternoon. I thought I was going crazy. I put up with them for weeks, tried every sinus/congestion/pain medicine and nothing touched these headaches...finally saw my doctor and went on antibiotics to see if it was a sinus infection because I did have a feeling of congestion and crazy pressure in my head. The antibiotics did nothing. Still had the pressure and the headaches every day until I got the worst migraine I ever had. I decided that was it. I stopped taking everything I was taking on a daily basis and that pressure in my head and my crazy afternoon headaches just disappeared. I did some research on the things I was taking and this product when I searched headaches in questions, showed that many people got afternoon headaches. I’m so frustrated that this product could cause so much pain and chaos in my life. I paid so much money in medicine and doctor visits trying to figure out and fix the headaches that this supplement caused. I was in excruciating pain for weeks. I’m so disappointed and upset with this. It’s a lesson learned, I guess, that I need to do a lot more research before taking something. There are good reviews on this product, so I’m sure reactions vary by person, but with how many people had the same issue as me, and with how bad the issue is, I’m truly shocked that it wouldn’t be part of the warning on the label to stop taking this immediately if you start getting these headaches. I hope this review helps anyone who is having the same issue as me and is trying to figure out what is going on with them on.
 First off I’ve been try to lose some weight but cant quite seem to. Eating healthier and I always exercise (lifting weights and running 3x or more a week).  My weight never seem to go down like how I wanted so I started researching.  Stumbled upon Dr. Axe’s website and was reading about hypothyroidism.  When finished reading the article he lists certain ingredients you should supplement with and the Zhou Thyroid Support Complex basically had them all and that’s what convinced me to buy this one.<br/><br/>So I’ve been taking this for about 3 weeks now and here’s what I notice:<br/>1. How calm my body has become (just glancing at my heart rate from my Fitbit, my bpm is 5-10 less when sitting or standing generally speaking)<br/>2. My sleep thoroughly the first time with really no need for a nap<br/>3.Im not starving all the time like I used to be.  More like just once a day around dinner time after I’ve fasted for a while.<br/>4.  My mental focus and energy Are definitely way better than before.<br/>5. I’ve lost about 5-6 pounds in the time I’ve been taking this supplement<br/><br/>Definitely ordering a second bottle of this and I’m excited to see extended results in the next coming month!
 This review had been updated below.<br/><br/>I am hypothyroid and prescribed Amour for the past year. I was excited to add an additional supplement to my routine, hoping for a bit of energy throughout the day. Based on my personal experience, I cannot recommend this product.<br/><br/>Shipping/price is fast and fair. The recommended dosage is 2 pills once a day with a meal. They are green gel caps and large-ish (a normal size for a vitamin). I took the recommended dosage for two days and began to suffer from horrible headaches late in the afternoon. I made sure to monitor my water intake and dropped the dosage to one pill a day. After 3 more days of horrible headaches I discontinued taking this product. Therefore, I cannot comment on the effectiveness of this supplement.<br/><br/>Amazon also does not offer a return of this product, so please be wary of ordering this product if you are sensitive to supplements.<br/><br/>Update: One day after I posted this review, I received an email notifying me I had been refunded the cost for this supplement, no questions asked. I did not even contact Amazon. I changed my review from 1 star to 5 stars accordingly because I did get a refund and I was able to try out the product myself to see if I liked it. Let this give you assurance that if you are questioning if this product is for you, at least you will get a prompt refund.
 The past year has been pretty blah. I have gained weight, become more tired, less ambitious and just in general i can get really down. Despite my general healthy eating I was developing some old eating habits relating to my depression bouts in my 20s, late night snacking, carb cravings.... comfort eating. This happens especially around the week before my period starts. I am pretty stubborn about Dr visits but finally I bit the bullet and made an appointment as I suspected my thyroid had become inactive, which was not completely true. As it turns out it had just become under active. The Dr offered a script but I wanted to try some diet changes first. He was skeptical but we agreed to test again in three months. I tried a Kelp supplement from my local health food store and noticed an immediate change- increased energy and more ambitious for sure! It was a little pricey to me, but the benefits where amazing so I started looking into other product specific to thyroid. I use sea salt without iodine, and do a lot of natural cooking, however I was certain I was missing some key items that could help my now 40 year old body keep feeling young and healthy. And I love the convenience of Amazon shopping as i am a work from home single mom to two teenagers, my oldest is severely Autistic so quality and purity have become extremely important to me for him since he is so sensitive to things, and for myself as I have discovered thru him how sensitive I am also!!<br/>  Earlier in the year I had decided to grow my hair out and tried ZHOU Hairfluence, I seen immediate results with this product and when i found ZHOU Thyroid Support I decided to give it a try. For my second and third month before my second round of blood work I took Thyroid Support pretty faithfully, missing maybe a total of 8-10 days?? Blood work results came back normal thyroid! Yay!! I will continue using this product, the Hairfluence and most recently I am trying the Spirulina. ZHOU makes products that are affordable, high quallity and they absolutely work! I have medical proof! I am a believer LOL And my Dr is too now!<br/>Thank you ZHOU!! Thank you Amazon!!
 This stuff is amazing! I was super hesitant to even try this. Every woman in my family is low thyroid, so when my weight wasn't coming off and I was as lethargic as could be I was positive it would be my thyroid. Doctor test says nope, so I cautiously tried this supplement. It took a bit of time, and some diet tweaking, but as a 48 almost menopausal woman I have lost 13 lbs in 8 weeks. This is saying something, since I did the Whole30 in January and didn't drop a pound!<br/><br/>My skin is clearer, my energy is good, and between this and my anti-depression meds I feel great. I know that everyone will have their own response to this supplement, but for me it's been a great addition to my day to day routine.
 I have been taking Thyroid Support for a few months and noticed a difference after the first bottle. I have more energy and hypothyroidism symptoms are diminishing. I learned recently that one sign of thyroid problems are the hair at the ends of your brows stop growing and become bare. I have always thought that my brows were just bare naturally but since I've been taking Thyroid Support my eyebrows have completely grown in and have become fuller than ever!
 I have purchased 2 bottles of Zhou Nutrition's Thyroid Support complex. I took it for two months, admittedly not truly seeing any type of immediate change or a long-term impact I could pinpoint and attribute to this supplement. After the first bottle, in an attempt to be more open to something other than instant gratification, I figured I'd give a second bottle a shot to see further progress in my health. My fatigue diminished significantly somewhere in that second month, but having added a few other changes in my life (exercise, diet, supplements), I wasn't quite sure this was contributing significantly. When I didn't purchase another bottle that third month, I immediately noticed a return of chronic sluggishness and the inability to stay energetic a mere 4 hours after waking up every morning. I truly believe that abruptly removing the thyroid support in my daily regimen was the reason I started leaning on coffee to stay awake through the afternoon and was forced to push through immense fatigue in each of my workouts. I am excited for that third bottle to arrive in the mail and I plan on making this supplement a permanent part of my daily regimen. Give it a shot.
 This has helped me so much!!! I always felt I had a thyroid problem even though the tests I've taken has said I didn't! I have been taking this supplement for 3 weeks now and I have seen such a change in my body!! I wake up rested and can focus better and the most important I have lost 6 pounds in 3 weeks! I will continue to take this for awhile!
 This product is a life saver .<br/>It has given me so much energy.  I have fibromyalgia .with alot of fatigue &amp; I never felt like doing anything ! Since starting this product<br/>I have went rock climbing &amp; hiking tons of house work ! I'm like the energizer Bunny :) it's awesome ..... my family is shocked !
 I have Hashimoto's and took this to supplement my thyroid meds.  I started taking the Thyroid Support Complex With Iodine... on March 20 and quit on April 19.  I really wanted my experience to be like the many others who left wonderful reviews, but instead I bloated, had diarrhea, and still put on weight!  It was awful for me. After I quit taking them the diarrhea stopped right away, but it's taken about 5 days for my stomach to quit bloating.  I'm hoping weight loss will follow.
 Nor for someone with Thyroid disease using 1 bottle  I developed a spare tire around my waist that I've never had.  I'm 5' 8' 1/2 160lbs so you can see immediately the weight gain.
 I ordered these a little over two weeks ago and since taking them, I have noticed an increase in energy. I have also been able to lose 6 pounds since starting them. I will continue to take them because they truly are working for me.
 Unfortunately, all this supplement did was make me exhausted beyond measure. I couldn’t even get out of bed while taking it. I’ll likely just throw the remaining pills away. Wanted to like this product.
 My hair is regrowing after 1 month. My menstrual cycles are normalizing. I just feel over all better. I have low thyroid but not low enough that the Doctors want to treat with Meds for the rest of my life. In the mean time I was feeling horrible and gaining weight, loosing my hair, feeling tired and depressed along with missed periods. These supplements have TURNED MY SHIP AROUND!!! Thank you. Just ordered my second bottle.
 I've been feeling fatigued for months, and just not having the energy I used to during the day (or especially at night, after work). After some concerns that my thyroid might be the cause, I started researching supplements and ended up looking at this one. I was pretty skeptical at first - unsure of whether the supplement would have an effect or whether my thyroid was even the issue. But after a few days I started to notice a huge difference. I was feeling much more effective at work, and then I found myself cleaning and reorganizing the whole kitchen, and then other rooms...I was finally getting caught up on projects that I'd left hanging for quite a long time. This supplement was the only change to my routine. I then stopped taking it for a few days just to test how I felt, and I started to slump back into old patterns. At this point I was convinced - something about this supplement was working for me and I was feeling a difference. I'm now taking it regularly again and loving the way I feel.
 Thyroid Support Complex is a great supplement to my daily dose of synthroid that I take for hypothyroidism.  I have definitely noticed an increase in my energy and focus, which is exactly what I was looking for in a Thyroid supplement.  I take two capsules per day of the Thyroid Support Complex right after breakfast.  No side effects at all. I highly recommend this product.  I received a free bottle for my honest review, however I had already purchased this supplement several times before accepting it. Zhou sent me the free bottle before I even wrote this review.  Like any supplement you purchase, you don't know how it will affect you until you try it.  This supplement works great for me and I will continue to buy it.  I purchase several other energy and focus supplements from Zhou. They are an excellent reseller and I recommend them highly as well.
 Was extremely reluctant to pay money for a product that sounded too good to be true. I needed help losing weight as well as an energy boost. Within a week, I lost 4 lbs, and had increased energy. Without any side effects of feeling wired, shakey, nauseous, edgy- nothing but happiness. Thank you, for the first honest and reliable supplement I have ever taken for weight, and energy! Well done. I am a forever customer.
 I wanted to come back and re-review this product.  I had originally given it two stars, and want to at least bump it up to three, solely based on the customer service.  I had purchased this after reading a lot of great reviews.  I purchased this product and unfortunately for me, I didn't get the desired results.  If you've done any research on thyroid issues, it can be a multitude of different issues and every person reacts to treatments, supplements, etc. differently.<br/><br/>Shortly after my initial review, I received an email from the CEO of Zhou Nutrition and was given a full refund and an offer to try a different product.  The money-back guarantee provided by Zhou Nutrition was an example of customer service other companies should strive for.  This product has a lot of great reviews and with any supplements, they are going to work differently for some.  But you can purchase this knowing that if you aren't satisfied, the money-back guarantee will protect you and you won't be out the money.
 I was dragging myself thru life. I had no energy, I had RAI on my thyroid 4 years ago. I am on Armour Thyroid, previously took Levothyroxine. I just was always tired! I started taking this along with other vitamins (just started researching them) &amp; I feel so much better. I didn't notice until after a month of taking them. I just noticed one day that I was naturally waking up earlier &amp; feeling better! I also like Thyroid support one, something for adrenal health, vitamin D, magnesium. You just have to figure out what works best for you &amp; stick with it for a good 4-8 weeks. What works for me may not work for everyone, but don't give up. I was feeling awful. It was making me depressed. I was so tired. I feel so much better. Also, make your dr test your vitamin, hormone levels etc. demand it! You know your body &amp; know if you don't feel right. Also, if they say your "levels are in range", make sure they are in optimal range. Good luck! I hope this helps someone.
  TL;DR]<br/>The product definitely works as advertised, maybe even better than advertised. You'll probably have a childlike level of happiness and optimism. So much so, that other people will be intrigued or envious.<br/><br/>A brief intro:<br/>I'm a 25-year-old "male" suffering from clinical bipolar depression, anxiety, and PTSD. I have been battling these for at least the past 12 years. At this point, the major source of my mental illness is due to the chemical imbalances in my brain, which physicians often try to remedy with prescription meds that have vile side effects. I didn't want to go that route, so I researched natural supplements and remedies that are similarly effective, yet healthier, eventually finding Zhou Nutrition's line of products. When I considered the benefits listed and the user reviews for their Thyroid Support, it was overwhelmingly obvious that I should give it a chance.<br/><br/>Method &amp; Result:<br/>I went with their recommended amount of taking two (2) pills per day with an AM meal and noticed a positive shift in my mood after only an hour. I felt a mental clarity and sense of peace that I haven't in years, and my often-antisocial self would become vibrantly chatty, with many people commenting that I seemed happier as of late. Their effects lasted almost all day, each time I took them, and worked so well that I'm still feeling bubbly, optimistic, and can manage stress and negative situations with much healthier responses even though my bottle ran out a week ago, although I plan to order more.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/>Let me be clear. You should still discuss this product with a physician before using it, and thyroid support is no replacement for getting professional help. Mental illness should be taken seriously. Yet, nowadays all people are pressed to do more, faster, more efficiently, without succumbing to the enormous stress placed upon us. We're all stretched too thin. Thus, anything that helps me find and maintain my peace, happiness, and sanity, while doing so in a healthy, non-addictive manner is an invaluable resource to me. If you miss feeling that old spark and enthusiasm for life, no matter your age, try Thyroid Support.
 After about a few days I noticed a slight difference in my energy level but after a couple weeks I actually feel normal and energetic again.  No more 2 p.m. crash...only concerning side effect is I have difficulty falling asleep...I used to be so bummed I’d be in bed by 7pm. When I do fall asleep, I sleep well and wake feeling rested.  One day, I forgot to take it and it was a quick reminder that I need to be consistent because I struggled with energy the entire day.  I don’t have anymore crazy sugar/carb cravings and I noticed a boost in my mood.  I’m reordering today.
 I have hypothyroidism and after reading the benefits of this product I thought that maybe this could be a good natural way to help my thyroid out. The package came on time and I started the next day. I noticed that I seemed more fatigue than normal, which I thought was just switching vitamins and such. Therefore, I kept taking the recommended dosage, but the fatigue had yet to go away after awhile. However, the most startlingly thing that occurred while taking this product were the intense headaches that occurred. I haven't had a headache in a long while until they just appeared while taking this product. The headaches would get so bad that I could not even go to class, being a college student all, some days. Thus, I stopped taking the product and the headaches and fatigue went away. I'm sad that this product didn't work because the reviews were great and all.
 I experienced symptom relief from the first day I began taking this supplement. I have lupus with latent hypothyroidism. I tried dessicated bovine thyroid, but it jacked up my heart rate (also have autoimmune tachycardia - lupus stinks). If you have symptoms that correspond with hypothyroidism, even if your TSH levels are normal, I recommend trying this. Pay attention to how your symptoms respond and to any side effects: especially headaches, shakiness, or rapid heart rate. For me, this is excellent. For you, it might not be.
 I added this to my supplement regime almost 2 months ago.  As with many other people, my TSH was within a normal range; however, I was experiencing symptoms of hypothyroidism.  I researched, read reviews, and then decided to give this product a try.  My energy level has definitely increased , and I think my focus is sharper.  I will continue taking this, ordering from this manufacturer (price cannot be beat!), and will anticipate continuing benefits.
 I purchased this for my daughter who is has hypothyroidism; had trouble losing weight and maintaining her energy even though she was on levo.  I previously had her on all of the supplements contained in this one pill so she was taking like 8 pills a day whereas now it's just 1 pill with everything she needs. This is her second month taking this and she has lost 15 lbs and feels better than ever!  I'm going to order a bottle for myself since I am menopausal and am having trouble losing weight due to a slowed metabolism.  Good stuff!
 Wow the same day that I reviewed this  I was issued a refund without even asking for one.  Great company, great customer service. I will continue to buy their drift off and their DHEA which have both helped me.<br/><br/>I took it for almost a week. But it gave me a terrible headache (like migraine level headaches) and made me dizzy. It also sapped my energy during the day but somehow at the same time kept me up at night. It really is such a shame because I read all of the positive reviews and was hoping for some better  results...
 Along with loosing weight, 🤗 this supplement has helped immensely with my anxiety.  Calm and collected are normal emotions for me now.  I am so happy my mom told me about thyroid support and look forward to trying other products from Zhou Nutrition.
 For transparency purposes, I did buy my first bottle and was sent a second for free based upon leaving a review.<br/><br/>I wouldn’t bother with getting a second bottle, free or not, if I didn’t like it. It works. Adds a bit of sustained energy throughout the day. I’ve found one capsule is enough for me. Two gives a bit too much energy bordering on edginess. I likely don’t have significant thyroid issues but most 40+ year olds could use a little help.
 Thryoid issues run in my family so my doctor checks my thryroid on a pretty regular basis as it's a when not an if for me. Lately I have noticed symptoms of a sluggish thyroid even though tests indicate it's within normal range. So off I went in search of a supplement that would perhaps helps boost this little gland and help eradicate my symptoms. I was very pleased to find this supplement and was anxious to get my bottle to get started. I am very pleased thus far with it. I have only been taking it for a little over 2 weeks now and have noticed a difference in my energy levels. I was never really sluggish to begin with and I work out regularly and eat pretty decently but have been putting on weight that despite everything I cannot take off amongst other symptoms of thyroid issues. I can honestly say that I have taken off 4 lbs and feel more energetic. I have already placed a reorder for another bottle.
 After taking THYROID SUPPORT for 3 days, I have seen improvement in several areas. My energy level has definitely improved. Puffiness around my eyes has almost entirely diminished. Joint ache has diminished. I can go through the list of health issues which are stated to improve through use of this supplement, and I have seen improvement in each area.  I do not know if my improvements are coincidental, I only know the improvements have occurred. I am in no way associated with the company which manufactures or sells, or is in any way associated with this product.
 Life changer!!  I had been to the doctor to get my thyroid levels checked and blood work because I was always so exhausted and grumpy.  Dr. said I was in the normal range - but I would wake up feeling not rested and my body sooo tired - and by lunch time I would be so sleepy I'd have to go take a nap.  My energy levels were just low and I was just really irritable.  I thought I'd give this formula a try - I take 2 pills every morning right when I wake up and I'm a completely different person.  No need for naps, I can work a full day and am much more alert and focused.  I started back to the gym and felt so good that I forgot to order more and after about 1 week I was back to sluggish and cranky/unable to focus and needing an afternoon nap.  I  have been taking this formula faithfully for a few months now and I plan to forever.  I feel great!!
 I have been taking thyroid medication for most of my life.  I have tried various prescriptions and dosages but this is the first time I could actually feel a difference.  I don't like taking prescription drugs because you don't really know what is in them so finding a natural non GMO organic product was something I was happy to try.
 I don't know where I was in this planet because certainly this product is the "meaning of life." It is quite sad for me to think that it's been years of depression and fatigue that could have been prevented if I only had known more. I guess it's all about deficiency of nutrients. I'm the happiest person alive after taking these capsules. But don't just stare at my review, buy it! Thanks, Amazon and thanks to whoever created this amazing formula! :)
 I was having good results for the first 3 weeks!! Happy mood.. It stopped my cravings for carbs.. Skin was no longer dry.. Nails and hair were growing but after 3rd week started getting boils.. Had about 4 very painful ones come out within a week.. So stop taking the supplement and they all went away within a 2 week period of not taking the supplement.. So I decided to try them again since I was having good results and within 3 days of starting them again 3 new boils in different places started to come out...  So very dissapointed that something in there is giving me these very painful boils because I was definitely loving the results!
 I tried this supplement and it wasn't for me. It exasperated my tinnitus so I stopped immediately. When I tried to return it, it wax refused by seller, saying returns were not allowed.
 I finally am getting my life back. It's like I feel like doing stuff again. Usually, all I can do is come home and lay down. My house is a mess. No get up and go. Gaining weight like crazy. You name it.<br/><br/>Today is Saturday. I started taking them this past Tuesday. What a difference these have made!! Very happy and pleased with the product. This will be on the buy every month cycle
 I have Hypothyroidism as well as Fibromyalgia &amp; CFS - so trying to figure out where my fatigue and complete lack of energy are coming from can be tricky.  In late June, I was having issues staying asleep despite being exhausted. I was a zombie and making mistakes at work. So my doctor put me on Trazadone - which helped for sure but I still wasn't very ambitious and took a lot of weekend naps.  Then on Prime Day - I came across a lightening deal for Thyroid Support, read some reviews and went ahead and purchased. I was anxious to try it because I had read that perhaps I needed more iodine and truth be told - I'm extremely vitamin deficient anyway.  I'm on prescription VD2, Magnesium, Potassium &amp; Iron.  So I thought, hey - it can't hurt to try.  Well, I'm on my 2nd bottle and WOW!  I don't want to jinx myself but lately, I've felt amazing. I don't sleep all day on weekends, I'm up before 10am (this is huge for me) - I painted my kitchen!  I'm fostering/potty training a breeder released dog.  I think THIS combined with my sleeping pill is making me a new person.  If you are exhausted - try this!  Just wait it out and see if your habits start to change.  :)
 I ordered this product because I have so many symptoms of underactive thyroid. After being tested by my doctor for the most basic thyroid function and it coming back normal I was frustrated. I started taking this and after the initial upset stomach and sick to my head feeling I have noticed an increase in energy. I am hoping that if I continue taking it I will start to notice more and feel better.
 I've been taking this product for 9 months. I have also been dieting and exercising. I've lost 50lbs. During the 9 months, I have questioned if this product is doing anything. 2 times I stopped taking it for almost a month and my weight loss almost stopped, so I have come to the conclusion it is doing something. I also think I feel calmer with less anxiety. I'm going to continue to take this product. Don't take this thinking your going to feel completely different the change is not that noticeable, but I do think it works. Also, I'm not saying you're going to lose 50lbs by taking this product, I completely changed my lifestyle to lose the weight.
 Ever since I was diagnosed with a hypothyroid in 2008 I have struggled day to day. I have finally found a solution to my problems with Zhou Nutrition Thyriod Support. Thanks Zhou Nutrition for a new me!
 I feel so much better on this product. I have not been diagnosed with hypothyroid issues, but I felt fatigued, over hungry, and overall just blah. I took the product for a month and was disappointed that I did not loose weight like other reviewers since my weight has climbed as I get older. Soon after stopping Thyroid Support, I fell back into daily naps, feeling fatigued, blah, and over hungry again. Common sense quided my re-purchase and 5 days later I feel more energized, my appetite normalized, and I have a greater sense of well-being. Remeber that there is a difference between sluggish throid activity and over thyroid activity- mine gears more towards sluggish as seen with my symptoms. I read that one must be careful with iodine and hemp derivatives, so I cut back to one pill quickly to return to the recommended dose for optimal effects. Zhou seems to have it figured out.
 Yup, it increased my energy for sure. I took one - just one! - pill every morning for about three weeks. Liked the energy boost. Didn't like the racing, pitter-patter thing it did to my heart.  Was getting really freaked out thinking I was getting Afib or something. Then I remembered the new pills. Went off them and within a couple days the strange heart beat stuff stopped.  Perhaps just seeing the doc because of low energy would be a good idea. :)
 I was taking the generic sythyroud  (levothyroxine 100mcg) for 10 yrs. Having lab work every yr. It has leveled off to mormal. But , I no longer want the side effects of levothyroxine.  Leg cramps, hot flashes, heat sensitivity, impossible to loose weight and irregular sleep patterns. Since taking thyroid support 1 month ago , my negative symptoms are minimal. I'm glad to know there is help out there.
 Been on this for 3 wks., and feeling better. :)  I've been having thyroid issues for a couple of yrs., I take medication but still feel "sluggish" during the later part of the day, my Dr. doesn't want to increase my dosage, thinks it will be too much.  He has stated the "fatigue" that comes with hypothyroidism is something that will never completely go away 100%.... I thought I would try a supplement, THIS helps a lot!!  I researched many thyroid support supplements, and found this one to be the most honest reviews (without the paid for "hype").  I take this a couple hrs. before OR after lunch, just be sure to take it on an empty stomach, and DON'T take it after 3 p.m. - disrupts my sleep.<br/>This is NOT a miracle worker, but helps a lot for those that have a thyroid issue, at least it did for me.
 My mom and sister both have issue with their thyroid. I’ve been to my doctor complaining of chronic fatigue, weight gain, irritability and he says my thyroid is fine. I decided to try this supplement and I’m glad I did. Since then I’ve  notived an increase in energy, mood and slight appetite suppression. I’m on my second bottle.
 Like so many others, I had high hopes for these supplements. In my late thirties, with four children, I was hoping these would give me the extra energy and metabolism I enjoyed ten years ago, before kids. I certainly didn’t expect miracles, but after three weeks of consistent, correct usage, I have noticed no change. No increased energy, no decreased appetite, no weight loss, none of the other advertised benefits. I am sorry to say I can not recommend this product.
 I have Hashimoto's disorder and was hopeful this product would produce as described.  It did not.  I took the supplements for two weeks and did not notice ANY positive change in lethargy, clarity, energy or any of the other claims this produce made.  I tried to return it but Zhou Nutrition declined to accept the return.  Beware of supplements that make promises they cannot produce.<br/><br/>A few days after posting this review I received a personal email from Zhou Nutrition telling me that they were sorry I had experienced no benefit from the Thyroid Support and telling me they had given me a full refund for the product.  While I didn't experience any benefit from the supplement, I would give this company 5 stars for their customer support.  Well done!
 I bought this due to me being absolutely exhausted and unable to wake up when my alarm goes off without hitting snooze. Other personal medical issues would also point at thyroid slowdown.  I noticed a difference within 2 days!  I'm about 3 weeks into the bottle now and I've already lost 2 pounds, after trying for months and unable to get weight off with exercise and watching what I was eating.  *discretion, I am not a doctor, nor play one on TV, so do not use my results as a medical diagnosis
 I have every symptom from hypothyroidism but all the test have come back "normal", a bit higher but not enough to make a diagnosis. I decided to try this and see if it would help me lose the awful weight that i have put on lately (about 5-10lbs each month non-stop since November) . I started on 4/23/18 and so far it's been really good. I decided to incorporate 30min of mild-moderate exercise and to not eat past 7PM. It gives me enough energy to notice a change in my mood and to get chores done and also suppresses my appetite which helps me with portion control. I have three children (9, 3, 11months) so that energy is quite needed! Haha<br/><br/>I will update once a hit a week and then periodically until i finish the bottle.<br/><br/>UPDATE 1: 1week since starting taking thyroid support<br/><br/>Today (4/30/18) hits one week mark and I have to say that I definitely see an increase in my energy levels. Last night, while hubby was at work I put my three girls to bed and after they were all asleep I cleaned living and dining room as well as kitchen in less than 3 hrs. I have carpet on living room and it was a mess! And everything was chaos, you could barely get through the living room without stepping on something !  But now is so clean! Which for me is a HUGE accomplishment lol. Now regarding the weight. I worked out twice last week and then I had to stopped because I have a bad ankle. My nutrition stayed pretty much the same, I just didn't eat anything past 7pm, and if I got hungry around 10ish I would drink water. I kept my water intake to 1 gallon. I lost 4.6lbs in week 1 without much change.
 I’m hesitant to write a review because I’ve only been taking it for three days, but when I woke up this morning I felt refreshed for the first time in months. So much so that I was able to do my morning workout which I’ve not done much since October 2017.  I struggle with depression so it’s a constant battle to keep moving some days  even on meds. I take multi-vits, iron, D, B-stress and I am still constantly exhausted and in a fog. Today is different. I’m so hopeful. I’ll update on progress.
 I bought two bottles based on the reviews, but this stuff makes me so tired. I feel like I need to sleep all day on this stuff. When I first take it I get a slight rush that last maybe an hour; then I’m wiped out. Someone posted on here that this company is giving away products for positive reviews? I hope this is not true, but I will not be using this any longer.<br/><br/>Additionally: I just looked up all the ingredients inside each pill. I was shocked at some of the dangerous elements here. For example, on WebMD it explicitly states Bladderwrack is NOT safe to take by mouth. This is because of the high amount of iodine and heavy metals. Moreover, the selenium is another dangerous mineral that is not needed in supplement form. According to WebMD selenium has been linked to melanoma and prostate cancer. This stuff seems to have a high amount of iodine which can actually create problems with your thyroid and even contribute to goiter (google it).  There were other ingredients that were cause for concern and I've already thrown two bottles (full) in the trash.<br/><br/>To be honest the owner did give me a full refund without having to ask.
 I've been hyper and now I am hypo after having my thyroid removed.  The Dr.'s like to keep you on the hypo side because of all the other health reasons but the hypo symptons have really been a challenge for me.  After taking this for 3 weeks I've noticed I have more energy...I usually crash around 1 or 2.  Also I take this at night and I take my thyroid rx in the morning so that there is no interactions. I do notice that I sleep a lot better and I dont drag the next day.  So hopefully this will help out my regular medication...will update in the event anything changes.
 Unfortunately this is not helping me at all. Day 1 was okay but after that just seems down hill. I have been taking them for about 5 days or so and I am bloated, my face has broke out, I’m more tired than usual and above all I have gained weight, not lost it. Not to mention the taste the pill leaves in your mouth is awful! Oh and worst of all, 3 days after starting them I started bleeding abnormally off schedule, which never happens. Not saying these couldn’t work for someone else but they haven’t for me.
 I read about this product on Facebook so after having hypothyroidism for 5 years and having zero energy I thought I would try it.  I love it!!!! I feel SO much better!!!  I can finally make it through the day without falling asleep!!!
 One of my doctors recommended I took a thyroid support vitamin because even though all my test were coming back fine everything was pointing to thyroid issues. I started taking these and had decreased unwanted hair growth and started to finally lose weight. I also had more energy that I had had in forever. I got pregnant and my doctor didn't approve of me taking them while pregnant so I had to wait till after baby but I can't wait to get back to them.
 I wanted to give this product at least a year before submitting a review. I started taking 2 capsules a day starting in April of 2017, so it's now been almost a year and a half.<br/>Some experts say TSH levels should be between 0.4 and 2.5 mIU/L. I am a 66-year-old female and my TSH level was at 1.58 when I had it tested last week. I also have seen an improvement in my energy level. And as a bonus, it contains 200 mg of ashwagandha root powder, which is known to help alleviate anxiety.<br/>I highly recommend this product for thyroid support. It does deliver on its claims.
 After reading the reviews I had to give it a try. I start taking it 17 days ago and I saw increase in my energy level, but most of all it cleared my brain clarity. I feel like I am my old self. What a difference. In a way it built my confidence.  I was hoping to lose weight however it didn't happen to me. I still give it 5 star for the new energy and eliminating the fog that was keeping me blind.
 I have Hashimoto's Disease &amp; take levothyroxine for it. I have been really lacking energy lately &amp; felt encouraged by the rave reviews of this product.... but after taking it faithfully for a month, I can't say that I've noticed any positive effects. (No negative effects either, to be fair.) I'm disappointed &amp; won't buy it again. (I'm sure it has a different effect on different individuals. It just didn't work for me.)<br/><br/>UPDATE: I just received a very nice email from the company expressing empathy that the product did not produce results for me. They gave me a full refund! What was lacking in the vitamin formula was DEFINITELY made up for in customer service. Very impressed.
 My thyroid was showing normal TSH, but when I dug deeper I found despite that and a normal FT4, my FT3 was low!  I was feeling sluggish, puffy, dry skin, and my hair was sooo weirdly dry and brittle.<br/>I thought I would try this supplement as a starting point, to check all the nutritional boxes, to make sure I have the essential building blocks on board so my body can synthesize thyroid hormones adequately, before I took thyroid replacement hormones.<br/>I was surprised to find I was feeling so much better on this supplement! I didn't have a big expectation.  I have more energy and I know it's a cliche but I didn't even realize how much I wasn't feeling "like myself" - but I really do feel so much better.  The thing I notice most is I am in a better mood.  I have found more energy to exercise and get things done without feeling like I'm forcing myself to get moving.<br/>I have yet to retest my thyroid function as it's only been a few weeks.<br/>I will edit/update my review when I do.
 42 yr old female, 3 kids, onset of low libido, irregular mentrual cycle, weight gain and fatigue. I suspected adrenal fatigue or hypothyroidism but my test results were normal. I tried half a dose of this and half of the thyroid supplement. I noticed more energy right away. I initially had a mild headache and rapid heart rate. It leveled off in about a week. I’m halfway through my second bottle of each. I’ve lost a few pounds but my body is changing. It’s like I was missing vital nutrients. My musicale tone is better. I’m more fit and less flabby. My skin is tighter and have fewer wrinkles. My hair is long but now it looks so healthy. I’m getting compliments on my hair and skin now. I feel so much better. I am still experiencing other symptoms but I’m going to give this to work fully. I will continue to use both products.
 UPDATE 10/16:<br/>The customer service response to my review was extremely fast, and unexpected to be honest. They sent an e-mail very fast saying they were going to refund me since the thyroid supplement didn't agree well with my body.<br/>As I mentioned in my original review, everyone's body is different. And since I'm on prescription medications as well as a moderate dose of synthroid, this may have been less effective because of those things. Luckily you can count on their customer service to be very quick and helpful. So I upgraded my rating to 3 stars on account of their customer service being so helpful. I do think this can work well for others who may have thyroid problem symptoms. Especially those who have blood results saying they're in the "low side of normal" thyroid function, leading to the doctor not prescribing Synthroid to help symptoms. I think those will be the best candidates to benefit from this vitamin.<br/><br/>Original review:<br/>I did try these, took as directed. I have hypothyroidism, and it has a long history in my family, so fatigue is a problem of course. However, I didn't feel any difference in energy with these. These actually made me frequently feel sick to my stomach or have heartburn, regardless of if I did or didn't eat when taking them. I did notice my nails looked healthier. But as someone on synthroid, in my late 20s, these felt like I was only taking biotin that caused heartburn.<br/>I completely understand that everyone's body is different so, of course, this may not be the same for everyone.
 Serious weight gain with this product.  The first couple days I thought it was helping with my cold sensitivity and general malaise.  For the first time ever I wasn't cold at 74 degrees...but that benefit is totally not worth the 10 pounds in two weeks I gained and the severe constipation.  Will not buy again.<br/><br/>Update 6/9/2017<br/>Just received a refund on this product.  When I wrote the review I didn't request a refund;  Increasing star rating to two stars for customer service.  This product may not work for everyone but when there is a problem it appears the company responds very quickly to make it right.
 Only have 1/2 thyroid and this has helped with energy and aches and pains.  Doctor approved it so I tried it and am very pleased. I have more energy and just feel better.  I will continue to purchase it.
 When I ordered my bottle of Thyroid Support Complex, I had run out of my thyroid medication due to a national shortage. I was hoping this would help get me by until I received my medication refill. The Thyroid Support Complex may have helped somewhat, but as the description states, it is not a replacement for a prescription thyroid medicine. Because I ran out of it just as I got my medication dilemma worked out, it’s difficult to give a fair review. I’m giving it 5 stars because I didn’t experience any negative effects, and am going to try another bottle now that I am back on my medication. I will come back and add to this review in a month or so.
 Really did not notice a difference with energy and I took it for a full month. With that being Said, Alex ZHOU Nutrition Founder gave me a full refund and offered to send me a bottle of another product for free. Thank you Alex! Your company is not the "Standard" and that is something to be very proud of. I would like to try your "Keto Drive" product. I'm looking for some good Energy. Thank you so much for truly caring for your customers!
 This is only my second month taking this, but I reordered because I want to make sure I give it a real go in order to give the chemistry to make it's impact in my body. I also ordered the Neuro-Peak and Energy+Focus and really do feel much better. My mood is so much better, and I feel the brain fog lifting more each day. I have used other products, but this one so far is the only one to make it to the re-ordering process... price point helps in that as well. *will be back to update in another month or so*
 The overwhelming majority of reviews are very positive, but I am confused. I ordered a second bottle to give this fair chance, but I have not noticed any positive results after my first month. I have been exercising regularly, and eating better, but I am still gaining weight. Some of this may be water retention for unrelated reasons. I am just confused as to why I am not receiving positive results.<br/><br/>The company has refunded my money, but I am not sure that that was absolutely necessary. There may well be unique factors why this product did not work for me initially, and I am using it for a second month now as I have not lost hope in it. The very fact that this company is willing to stand behind their product so generously is a strong testimony to how effective it is. I would not like my experience to cause people to shy away from this product, as the overwhelming majority provide strong testimony in its favor. For that reason alone, I am re-scoring this with 5 stars.
 It took around 3 weeks for me to notice I was feeling better, but be patient and keep taking it, because I really did notice a difference after giving it some time. I’ve definitely noticed an increase in my energy (I’m not exactly bursting with energy, but I’m not dragging my feet trying to get through the day anymore either so I’m pretty pleased with that) and my mood is a lot more stable/less iritable. As for weight loss, my weight has been pretty steady (although before I started taking this I couldn’t seem to stop gaining weight, so stable weight is an improvement). However I did notice I lost a couple pounds when I started working out again, and normally I lose little to no weight when I work out, so I think when paired with exercise this product can be useful to weight loss too - especially since I have more energy for workouts now! :)
 I took this product for 30 days (2 pills in the morning). After a few days of using it, I noticed that my daytime fatigue had disappeared. My weight did not change, but I believe my energy was at its normal level. I recommend!
 I'm sorry that I did not see any effects or results from this supplement. What was it really supposed to do?? I watched for energy, more hair, and weight loss. Alas, nothing happened that I could attribute to these pills, so I won't be re-ordering. Sorry.<br/>PS - to be fair, I did receive a refund, so this company does stand behind their products.
 For the last 3 years I have not felt like myself. All my life I've been a thin, very active woman and about 3 years ago I found myself gaining weight and having zero energy. If I slept 5 hours or 15 hours I was exhausted. Learning that my mom's whole family had thyroid problems I started researching about it. I literally have every symptom. I am 48 and take no prescription medications which I'm very thankful for. I decided that after 3 rounds of blood tests coming back with good levels that I would try a natural approach. I received my bottle of thyroid support in the mail and I feel like a new person. Energy is almost back to normal and I've lost 10 pounds already. Also suffered from headaches daily and have not had one since I started this product. I hope this review is helpful. Thank you Zhou nutrition!!!
 I don't usually leave a review generally, but in this case I must!  I have had Fibromyalgia for 26 years.  I have been told by my doctor consistently that my thyroid was a LOW average.  Medication was never prescribed.  But, as I researched on my own I found this product.  I have to say, after only taking it for 5 days I really notice a difference!  After 26 years of suffering pain, poor sleep, fatigue and more, I now have more energy, I feel more like my old self before the Fibro diagnosis---and have had several other positive effects.  I have had a better nights sleep, with less hot flashes; and my pain in my body and joints has lessened to a point that I feel like doing so much more!  The only side effect on the negative is a slight stomach upset----but not enough to quit taking this!  Maybe that will gradually subside as I get used to taking these pills.  I will follow up later with any more comments, but I highly recommend trying this if you have a diagnosis such as mine!  This is the first thing that has made any kind of significant difference in my overall health in over 20 years!!  I am very happy to have found this thyroid support complex, and am looking forward to seeing how I will do in the long run.
 I have not been diagnosed as having any thyroid issues. I do know that Thryoid problems run strong in my family.<br/><br/>I do suffer from extreme fatigue, the last month I noticed an increase in hair loss, and some foggy brain/lack of concentration.<br/><br/>Because of these symptoms and know how prevalent the problem is in my family I decided to try Thyroid vitamins.<br/><br/>Within 2 days I noticed a difference right away. (I had also just started taking a multivitamin as well). My energy had increased, I was able to focus better at work and the hair loss was nearly cut in half. Now going on nearly 2 weeks of taking this every evening before bed I have noticed a massive improvement in such a short amount of time. My hairloss is back to a normal amount. I will continue to use this and update with and results/side effects as I notice them.<br/><br/>I am currently taking this along with: Irwin Naturals Biotin, UltaLife Her Harmon, and Garden of Life Women's Multi Vitamin.
 I was so tired all the time.  I took one thing after another.  I had a kidney removed when I was in my thirties, and they also took my adrenal gland.  I would ask my doctor what was wrong.  Naturally, they found nothing.  I have been taking thyroid medicine.  Anyway, after years of trial and error, I found this product  "Zhou thyroid support" along with "1 Body Adrenal Support" for almost a year now.  I'm 74 years old and now I have my youthful vigor back.  I'm still working and have energy all day and look forward to my day.  It is a far cry from dragging myself around all day, forcing myself t do what I had to do.  When I started these two supplements, the effect was almost immediate.  And the longer I take them, the better I feel.  God willing, I will be taking these two items the rest of my life.
 I have been taking Zhou's Vit D3 w/ K2 for a few months and was beginning to feel a little more energized.  But since beginning Zhou's Thyroid Support Complex on 7/7/17  I feel like it has given me my life back!  I actually feel like doing things because I "want" to, not because I "have" to.  It has been almost 3 yrs of feeling absolutely drained, would rather sleep than eat, no drive or desire for anything.  Doctors visits were futile, as I was told my thyroid panels &amp; adrenal function was always "normal"  &amp; diagnosed with " anxiety &amp; depression".  I ordered the Thyroid support on a whim when I was ordering my vitamin D3/K2 b/c I knew that the thyroid helps regulate vitamin d and other hormones in the body.  This is really the most amazing vitamin supplement I've ever taken other than my B12 Injections, lol.  Thank you Zhous'
 I absolutely love this stuff! I subscribed to a monthly delivery so I don't have to go a day without it. They are average sized tablets and not hard to swallow; never had an adverse reaction or bad side effects. Since I've started taking them, my "brain fog," or whatever we're calling it, has completely diminished as I now experience a sense of clarity that I never thought was possible for me. I'm so thankful to have stumbled accross such a helpful product.
 I have been taking this supplement for a few months now, and I've never taken a better thyroid supplement.<br/>I was diagnosed with hypothyroid over 20 years ago, so in all honesty I have tried quite a few.<br/>My energy level has increased, my skin is clearer, my hair is no longer falling out and thinning.<br/>I also take Zhou DHEA, which is also FANTASTIC.<br/>I'm sleeping better, hot flashes are almost non existent.
 After years of feeling like I was constantly jetlagged, this supplement has made me feel so much better! I couldn't remember the last time I didn't feel tired. No amount of coffee ever helped, if anything the crash afterwards was the worst. Since taking Thyroid Support, I wake up feeling well rested and have more energy during the day. I don't feel exhausted in the evenings either. It has brought me so much relief, highly recommend.
 I had hit a plateau with my diet and started reading about the importance of iodine in the diet. I was unaware that it was a global health problem which lead to idoized salt.<br/><br/>It seems that a lot of people are suffering from borderline iodine deficiency and thyroid problems, especially women.<br/><br/>I had used kelp powder in the past but it's not standardized and can have too much iodine for someone not used to it, also causing problems.<br/><br/>The Zhou product has the right amount plus other minerals that are synergistic with iodine. I've had not negative side effects from this product and I don't know if it's a coincidence but I broke through my plateau.<br/><br/>I'm a middle aged women hoping to avoid some of the problems that some of my friends and aquaintences have and Zhou thyroid supplement seems to be helping.
 Most of the ingredients are beneficial for the thyroid with the exception of the "other ingredients" identified on the label.  However, I did not notice any increase in energy, metabolism or focus as advertised on the label.  If  you need thyroid supplements this isn't bad but you might be better off taking individual supplements in higher dosages.  It is important to consult with your doctor and understand what supplements you need as determined by blood testing.  Taking a generic thyroid support like this without being informed can be ineffective.
 I was a little worried that these reviews weren't real but I still decided to try these anyway Well they came right on time and are exactly as described I've only been taking them for a few days now but I do think I feel a difference From my symptoms I had been having I felt like my thyroid was underactive and that my hormones were imbalanced These pills are making me feel better On the 2nd day I took them I didn't feel the need to take a nap halfway thru the day like I normally do I feel like I'm getting more energy and just feel overall happier I'm going to keep taking these and hope that it keeps getting better and better If u think you have a thyroid problem I would definitely try these It's worth a shot for this price
 I have no doubt that this is a good thing for some people. Not for me I am on thyroid medication have been for several years. Hoped this may help with the side effects of thyroid disease. Made me moody and very cranky. Actually make my throyid symptoms worse. Not saying it's a bad product just use caution if you have a thyroid condition.<br/><br/>Update:I want to include that the company read my original review and contacted me on my experience. I'm very happy with this company. Just because the product this specific product didn't work for me I can't discredit this company.
 I despise writing reviews, but for this  product I feel compelled to write a review because these vitamins saved my life. Since summer 2017 I have been suffering from exhaustion, chronic fatigue, lethargy and pain in my legs. I didn't know what was going on with me, I take good care of myself, I work in fitness, I teach kids gymnastics, I try to eat right, but I work standing on my feet a lot. I thought resting would help but when I would rest it would never be enough and when I would come home from work in pain and exhaustion I would pass out on the couch, fall asleep and wake up as if there was never enough sleep for me still feeling exhausted. I tried everything to fix it, saw doctors, tried other products, nothing worked. I was frustrated, on the end of my roap, till I did some research and found this vitamin product. Within 3 days I got the old me back, my energy went back up, no more feeling exhausted and fatigued and the pain in my legs went away. I am extremely happy to have my health back. Thank you to the company that makes this amazing product.
 Since the beginning of the year I have tried everything to lose the 20 pounds I gained in 2016. It's been a month since I started taking this product and I have lost 10 pounds. I already ordered my second bottle. Please give it a chance, you won't regret it!!!
 My experience with thyroid support Complex is wonderful! I just reordered 2 more bottles . Before taking these, I always napped, felt tired, lots of fatigue, &amp; it seemed like I was always in a bad mood. I did buy a few other thyroid supplements, they were ok. However, didn't come close to treating all the symptoms I had.<br/>Your supplements are a miracle in a bottle. I actually ran out of them and now waiting for my order to come in tomorrow.<br/>I can feel the " blah's" coming on. I can't wait to get them!!!!!<br/>That's why I ordered 2! I don't want to ever run out ;)<br/>Thank you
 I have been taking this product for a little over a week now and so far I LOVE IT! I’m always suspicious of a natural product that promises so much. But I’m glad I gave it a try. My energy levels have increased, I did lose a couple of pounds, I notice that my appetite has decreased slightly and I feel like my ankles aren’t as swollen. I do not have an actual thyroid disease diagnosis, however when I was tested I was on the Lower scale of the numbers just not low enough to be placed on medication. I’m praying this works for me. I’m also hoping it helps with my hair loss I been experiencing which is a side effect of thyroid issues. I also just hope I can afford to keep buying this monthly as a single parent every dollar counts for me. I wish everyone the best with this product. I truly like it. I have even told 2 of my friends about it so far 🙂
 Does what it claims, I had more energy, but I don’t recommend taking this if you’re a female unless you have a thyroid issue of some kind. After a couple weeks if use I started to have two periods a month! They returned to normal when I stopped using this product.
 Tried this out for a few weeks and had terrible headaches the whole time. I stuck it through thinking it might've not been them but as soon as I removed them from my daily routine the headaches disappeared.
 I suffer from multiple symptoms of low thyroid and so I decided to give this product a try.  I've also been suffering from trichotillomania (hair pulling) for around 30 years.  I started taking this product hoping that it would help with some of the low thyroid symptoms, which it did.  What is truly amazing to me is that after taking this product for about 2 weeks, my compulsion to pull out my hair began to ease.  With time the urge completely disappeared.  Coincidence?  I ran out of thyroid support and decided not to repurchase.  Slowly started pulling my hair again.  My husband noticed the hair pulling return and suggested I start with the thyroid support again.  I started taking it again and guess what?  The urge has gone away again.  Just sayin'....
 I was skeptical when I first purchased the Zhou thyroid support, but after a little over a month of taking this complex so many things have improved that I can't deny the effectiveness of this product.<br/>Before I was tired -not just need more sleep tired- and irritable, with horrible monthly cycles, my hormones were crazy and my hair was falling out! Now I wake up energized, my hair is growing back, my irritability is gone and my hormones aren't driving me crazy. To put it simply, I'm amazed.<br/>It usually takes 3+ months for me to see complete results when I start taking a new supplement and I look forward to more improvement as I continue to take Zhou.
 I love these pills. Can't do with out them. Nothing was helping me feel better tell I found these. I have more energy and so much more happier.l told my daughter about them and now she calls them her happy pills. And then my daughter in law started taking them and has lost a whole dress size. I can't say enough about these pills.
 I am 66 years old, and suffer from all of the symptoms of an Underactive Thyroid: weight gain , dry skin, fatigued,joint pain and aches. I started taking one pill a day, and noticed an immediate decline of my dry skin, and reduction in joint pain. I am hoping that this will improve my metabolism, so that I can be more successful with my diet, being severly overweight. I think my thyroid has been a big factor in my health problems. This supplement seems to provide many nutrients necessary for an improvement in my metabolism.
 I’ve been taking this product for just over one month and I’m blown away.  I’ve had Hashimoto’s didease (hypothyroidism) since I was a child. I’ve recently turned 50 and so I imagine my hormones and metabolism and such are changing and slowing down. I started gaining weight for no good reason and my diet is already pretty healthy. I’ve already lost one pant size and I’m still shrinking. My endocrinologist doesn’t believe this should be working but it is and for that I’m extremely grateful. I work in a very hot kitchen so it’s difficult to determine what’s a hot flash or a perceived side effects of this supplement. That aside, I am more than pleased with the results I am seeing. Also my mood and clarity have improved as well.
 I really wanted to like this product. I did my research, and it had such good reviews, that I just had to try it. I've been on this medication for a week, and I have to stop taking it. I have had horrible heartburn since starting this supplement, and this isn't something I struggle with normally. This is the only change I have made to my diet.
 I've been taking this for one month now and I've had positive changes starting to occur. First and foremost, my energy level is almost back to normal, as it was just a couple years ago. I've always been very active, hiking, walking, biking and outdoors working in the yard and on my home. I started to tire easily and slowly, couldn't get motivated to even start a project or chore. It was frustrating to say the least!  Then came the weight gain...UGH! It was more and more difficult to lose weight as time went on. After researching my symptoms, I found this product, Thyroid Support by Zhou. So I bought my first bottle. And within a couple weeks of taking it, my energy level is back, the extra weight is coming off, I feel balanced and I'm not irritable anymore. I'm sticking with this and look forward to feeling better and better with time!
 Feeling very “even” after taking these veggie pills for just one week! Totally worth it &amp; will definitely continue to buy more. I think it’s the selenium. Either way, I’m feeling much better and not fatigued at all. Sleeping really well. No side affects or headaches as someone else had commented.
 I had my levels tested and although they came back in the "normal" range, I had heard that this isn't always an accurate measure of thyroid. I started taking these and I'm feeling less fatigue Nd the weight is starting to come off bit by bit. I will continue to take these.
 I've had thyroid issues my whole life, and the doctor can never seem to get the dosage right.  I've been fighting fatigue and weight issues that are seemingly never ending.  I've started taking thyroid support along with my regular meds in hopes that this will help alleviate my problems.  So far so good!  It's only been a short time, but I'm feeling good, and looking forward to seeing my progress
 The first week I thought this product was working wonders, I was feeling energized and not so sluggish. Now, a couple weeks in, doesn't feel like it's having the same affect. Will see what happens in the next few weeks.
 This product does work! Been using for 2 months and I have an increase in energy, I haven't gained any further weight.  I was gaining about 2 lbs a month before taking the product.  I've been taking this for 2 months now, and I have not gained any weight.  I did lose 2 lbs.  I have not been exercising and my eating habits have not been the best.  But I still lost 2 lbs.  In the past, I would exercise almost every day and watch what I was eating, and I was still gaining weight every month.  I believe this product has helped me and I will continue using it.
 This is such s great product! I'm almost finished with my first bottle and will reorder! I have noticed increased energy which is very much needed as I just had a baby a month ago. Also this works for me as an appetite suppressant, I stopped taking for a few days and wanted to eat all day, back on it today and I've been getting things done around the house and haven't been thinking of food all day. I mot only love this product, I really love this company!
 I have been feeling fatigued and general malaise for a while now. My thyroid tests have fluctuated, so thought I'd give these a go due to the Sterling reviews. Unfortunately, I just didn't feel any different after a month of taking them.
 This supplement did not help with symptoms of hypothyroidism like I’d hoped. I was so optimistic because it seems to work well for some people. I took it faithfully for 4 weeks with no improvement of my fatigue, foggy brain, irritability, and I actually gained some weight instead of losing. If you’re curious about it, I suggest trying it for yourself as it does help some people’s symptoms. It just didn’t work for me, so I’ll be trying another product for sure.
 I like a couple others on here experience weight gain when taking these.  I did have increased energy and focus.  Which is why I am giving it the three stars. But the weight gain was the exact opposite of what I wanted to accomplish.  I am therefore returning these as they are doing what I was hoping they would
 I have been diagnosed with Hypothyroid 6 years ago and since then i was taking levothyroxine T3 and T4 but nothing was working for me. So recently i searched online and found this supplement. Let me tell little bit about my health condition more I have hashimoto's hypothyroidism which made my immunity really low. In just one year i caught flu 5 times therefore i decided to take supplements and make my health better. My energy level got significantly better then before. Eventhough i was taking Vitamin D it was not helping me much. My Vitamin D level is really low hopefully it will get better too. Its almost a month since i am taking these tablets with food every morning. i am feeling little better. I really hope that i will get back to my healthy life again. My major concern is weight and i have not noticed much difference in my weight after taking these supplements. All you have to do is watch for excessive salt in take because it will give you headache and it will increase your blood pressure. The major improvement is my in heart rate. When i was taking T4 and T3 my heart was racing all the time. I was having tachycardia and then i had to stop taking my medicines for a while. It was stressful i was unable to take caffeine because my resting heart rate was really high 112bpm. And now i am tracking my heart rate everyday it got lowered to 57-65bmp. I am hopeful that my other issues such as stomach (gluten intolerance and other hormonal issues get resolved with this supplement. I want to try this supplement for 2-3 months to give my full feedback about these. Whatever i have noticed so far i have explained it.
 I had been taking Levothyroxine , according to my doctors instructions. I wasn't feeling any better. I decided to try a natural remedy and chose Zhou! I'm happy to report that this worked for me! My joint pain was significantly reduced and my energy level was increased! This really works for me and I will continue this instead of my doctors recommendation as it works better!
 Very happy with this formula! I bought this for my husband and we could see a HUGE difference in his energy and mood. I truly believe this saved our marriage lol! He no longer sits like a couch potato and doesn't procrastinate as much. Also noticed his hair is coming in thicker and he has such a youthful appearance. My mom is also taking this and she's a senior...people comment all the time about her energy. A MUST have in your pantry! Do yourself a favor and don't wait, buy this NOW. We wish we only knew about this sooner!!
 I feel this product is actually making me gain weight, feel puffier and feet are swelling so won’t use it again. So sorry it didn’t work for me :(  Been taking it for 3 weeks and I’m up 3 lbs.
 This is my first Amazon review but wanted others to know that I experienced the complete opposite effect of what this supplement is advertising. I became extremely tired, to the point I couldn't concentrate or function. I haven't ever been a person to nap but could have gone to sleep for hours after taking this supplement.  I kept hoping this would wear off so I continued to try this, as directed, for over 2 weeks. I finally decided it wasn't worth it and quit taking it. The next day I felt so much better and energy has continued to come back.  I know everyone is different and perhaps my body just didn't need this but wanted others to know in case they experienced the same.<br/>On a positive note, it arrived quickly and as advertised.
 Increased energy...yea for like the first 2-3 days. Received my order November 3rd, 2018 I had energy to clean my whole attic, clean boys bed room, and spare bedroom, and get 3 loads of laundry washed, dryed, and folded. And then...nothing. Same fatigued issue I was having prior but worse. I dont eat fast food, so my foods are fresh ingredients, no processed foods. I drinks herbal teas, using Stevia as my sweetener. Prior to using this product I went on a 5 day detox with AppleCider, and Kumchua and water . By the time I started taking this product I was done with my detox, keeping up on water and my daily workout,30 minutes, 50 situps, 50 squats. The huge difference with this is how I used to be up before my 10am (pill time alarm) I cant even get out of bed to take the pills, and I fall back to sleep because I'm super exhausted, I have no energy to workout, to cook, to clean. This feels like a crazy caffine crash. I have put on 7 lbs since using this product (Which is not cool. Im trying to lose weight not add more). I have a order that is due to arrive Dec 4 and I dont want it. I already cancelled my subscription. I know I needed more iodine in my diet to help improve my thyroid health however that wasnt the case with this product. Thank you but no thank you.
 Great combination of ingredients. There is no such thing as a miracle supplement out there, so anyone looking for noticeable results without putting in hard work, forget it. However, I am an active male; I train pretty much everyday, sometimes multiple times a day, and had recently gotten some stubborn fat that I had difficulty getting rid of. It may be this product, or it may not be, but after taking it for a couple of weeks I noticed a shift in body fat composition and I feel leaner. I will continue using this product.
 Well, like others I was skeptical. My annual bloodwork has always been normal. I started getting really frustrated about how tired I was and how badly I felt like I needed a nap every single day.<br/><br/>I’ve been taking this about a month. I’ve been sleeping better and getting up with less difficulty. Even my son looked at me today (a Sunday) and said “are you feeling normal? You haven’t been sleeping in lately and that’s weird.” I have taken occasional naps, but it has been less frequent. One other unexpected result - my voice/throat always felt tight and coarse. Like I needed to clear my throat constantly but it never worked. I couldn’t sing much because it strained me so much. That has been better! After I started taking it, I read that that is a also a symptom of a thyroid imbalance.<br/><br/>My favorite thing? It’s affordable. I’m so tired of seeing products that might help me, but not being able to even try it because it costs $100/month or even more. Thank you for that!
 Oh my gosh!!! I finally got the scales to shift downward! I'm 62 yr old 5' tall and dieting for four months ...  have dropped 25 lbs with 45 more to my goal(joined TOPS, such fun!); tracking 1,000 cal/day on My Fitness Pal; gave up my wine 😪; have been on thyroid meds for 10 yrs. Scales have been hovering at 186-187 for three weeks, nothing makes them move. Saw this product on Amazon and thought maybe it would help, if not sounds like they honor their guarantee. Took my first dose yesterday and scales skipped a number, I'm at 184.6 this morning!!! Thank you thyroid support!!! You restored my confidence and I'll let you know if it continues to help. My goal is to drop 6 lbs a month but I had stalled. This helped !!!! Didnt make me jittery. Didnt keep me awake. No symptoms at all really. I have had a lot of energy anyway, since losing 25 lb, so I'm probably not a good judge for that part of it. My friend calls me the Energizer Bunny as it is. 😊😊😊😊😊
 I was already taking a few of the supplements in this product, just separately. I thought how great would it be to have complete thyroid support in one. So I put those other bottles of what’s in this away and just started the Thyroid Support. I’m not sure what’s in this that’s causing my particular issues but it has not given me energy, weight loss, or anything from the stellar reviews. I’ve been drained physically and can barely wake up in the morning. My appetite has increased and that is not good for me. It’s really hard to maintain my weight even while eating right, much less that I felt nauseated and craved burgers and fries all of a sudden. It must just not be for every “body”. Really disappointed. I wish I could pinpoint the ingredient(s) that made things worse for me but I guess I’ll go back to my old routine. I really wanted that extra energy most of all. But I could fall asleep at any point on these. Just TIRED. A little sad about it.<br/>***<br/>I’m very happy to report that my review was read by the company and a full refund has been issued. Very encouraging letter from CEO regarding my situation and an offer to replace with any of their other products free of charge if I see something else I’d like to try. Extremely impressed! Thank you, Zhou!
 Update 4/14-------------------<br/>Yesterday I posted my 3 star review and got the attention from the seller. They refunded me because I'm not completed happy about my purchase and would like me to keep trying. I'm surprised by their speedy customer service and can feel they do care about their customers as a small brand so I'm adding another star for that dimension. But as to the fifth star, as I stated in previous review, I'll keep trying and see I can feel any improvement.<br/>------------------------------------<br/>I'm not sure what have I gotten from this so far, only taken it for 3 weeks. I saw other users have felt a great difference right away but unfortunately not my case. I take them twice a day with meal as suggested and eat healthy at my best. Although haven't felt any changes yet I will keep taking it and see if there's any difference.
 I began to have issues with my thyroid. Was an out of body experience. I can honestly say as soon as I started taking these pills. I have not had a flare up. I'm not sure how long this condition will last but I'm so grateful to have found these pills. I'm definitely going to purchase more. So far it's helping my sleep and my hands are not shaking. I can't wait top see what other benefits I gain from these pills.
 I'm a 55 year old male, previous military, and have always tried to stay in shape.....and have done so with weights and running, and generally staying active. At this age, my body needs things I didn't need 20 or even 10 years ago. This particular supplement is helping me with my metabolism and hence, my well being. I feel better and more energetic. Not like coffee or a buzzed feeling, but like my body is more efficient and my mind is more alert. On second order and feeling great. Would recommend this to anyone wanting to improve overall well-being and health.
 I received my Zhou Thyroid Support complex a little less than a week ago. I have also been training my body to burn fat for fuel, using a ketogenic diet. So I'm not sure if it's the thyroid support or the diet or both but here's my review.<br/><br/>I am 46 &amp; starting to go through my changes.  I have always been slightly on the heavy side and I have to work out a lot to be in the normal weight range, regardless of what I eat. I have always suspected that I have a slightly under active thyroid and have never gotten that tested. I have been on Dr. Macola's "Fat for Fuel" diet for a couple months but fell off the wagon and got back on it when I started using the thyroid support a little less than a week ago.<br/><br/>The first day I actually felt a little more lethargic than usual but starting with day 2, I have noticed that I feel more light and alert. I have lost about 4 pounds in five days (without exercise.) I also feel much more awake throughout the day and my appetite seems very curbed. Again, I'm not sure if it's the diet or if it's the thyroid support but the combination seems to be keeping me very alert, satiated and losing weight. My mood is generally pretty high (I'm a spiritual geek so I do lots of meditation and spiritual practices to keep my outlook elevated) however, I am feeling a new level of love and appreciation for my life in the last week.
 Took this for two months. Left me swollen... i retained a lot of water taking this supplement. It did give me energy though. Too bad it did not work for me.
 I was using this product for weight loss. I ordered one bottle and had some relatively great results. Lost approximately 3-4lbs a week alongside diet and exercise. I ordered a second bottle and half way through I noticed a sudden blast of zits near my chin and neck. I was using jojoba oil, so i only had 4-5 total and about 5 blackheads develop. I finished off the bottle and had a steady loss. I stopped the pills about 3 weeks ago and now I'm losing 1-2lbs a week. Definitely a big help from this product in order to get me down in weight quicker than normal.
 I absolutely love this!... In the past, I've struggled with weight loss, hair loss, depression,, all symptoms related to an under active thyroid, but with this, I have lost 30 lbs, effortlessly, so far, since I started using it about 3 months ago. My energy level has risen 200% and my hair is starting to grow and thicken.
 My doctor told me I had subclinical hypothyroidism in Feb or March. I ordered this beginning April and took them every day for the past 2 months. I redid my labs last week and doctor said today that the hypothyroidism has been resolved. I didn't diet or exercise. This worked for me. I also feel like I have more energy now.
 This stuff is amazing. I've been taking for a few months now and have seen a drastic improvement in mood, mental clarity and my skin has cleared up. I've never been diagnosed with a thyroid issue but knew something was off and once I started taking these pills I knew I hit the jackpot. The weight loss side of things I haven't really noticed because I'm on KETO but I don't care because I finally feel like myself
 I really like this brand, my body liked it too. My skin started looking better, my appetite regulated and I even started losing weight.<br/>I decided to try a different brand when this one ran out, just to see, it was also less expensive than this one. That was a mistake, you get what you pay for in many cases..this is one where that is true. I will definitely be getting this one again when the other one runs out.
 I love these. They're a go-to for me. I call them my brain pills. I should use them regularly but tend to use them every other day at different times depending on what I have going on that day. I wouldn't recommend taking after 5pm. They're amazing if you pop one 2 hours before the gym. Great pick-me-up! Also, when work is hectic and the most demanding, it's a perfect performance pill!
 Everyone is different, and I guess I'm the person that saw no change whatsoever. Having said that, the shipping was fine, product was not damaged in anyway. I finished the entire bottle, but unfortunately didn't see any difference.<br/>I wouldn't discourage anyone from at least trying the product. No bad side effects, just no positive results for me.
 I've been taking this for two months. I haven't noticed too much of a difference except more energy and possibly some weight loss. It's hard to say when I've been living an extra busy life if the weight loss is due to the thyroid support.<br/>When I first started taking I think I even had trouble sleeping. It may have also threw off my period cycle by five days. Which I've read thyroid supplements can do. The supplements also have a slight dust on them and have caused me to cough when I put them in my mouth to them follow with water. I will continue to take for another month and review again.
 I will say I was skeptical when purchasing this product , but with weight gain and fatigue having the best of me over the past 6 months, I knew I wanted to take a chance. I first took it in the morning right after eating breakfast then again before going to sleep. The next morning I woke up refreshed which never happens. Consistently over the past few days the same thing waking up happy ready to start the day! Hopefully this will continue and I feel this product is helping.
 After years of trying different supplements this stuff has worked for me so far. For a long time i thought i had adrenal fatigue and hormone imbalance but it was a recent doctor visit that shed light on my thyriod. I didn't want to take medication so i decided to give this a try. I have been using it for 2 days and i already can feel a difference. My energy is back, i don't feel fatigued. I only take 2 in the mornings instead of the recommended 4 because it wakes me up. Hopefully i can start working out so i can loose weight. If this continues, i will definitely be purchasing more.
 I wish I could state that I felt more energetic/overall better after taking this but it's been a whole month and the entire package is done, yet I feel no different. Every body is different and the way we respond to medicine is different.
 I've always tested just the outside of the range for low thyroid but I've always experienced most of the symptoms. Cold feet and hands has always been the worst; everyone could be nice n toasty, I could be wearing thick socks and gloves and my fingers n toes would be like ice cubes.  Since starting Thyroid Support I no longer have this issue! I'm no longer tired all the time either.  I will continue to use these supplements. The reasons I don't give it 5 stars are the size of the capsules and the high cost.
 I haven't been taking this for long but I purchased another bottle because I don't want to run out. I am feeling better. Will update
 I was feeling fatigued and thought id give Zhou Thyroid support a try to see if maybe i had thyroid issues. I must  because this product has helped a lot with overall energy and focus.  I haven't awakened tired or felt run down during the day since i started taking these. Great mix of Iodine, herbs, vitamins/minerals and amino's .  I noticed results in about 2 or 3 days at recommended dosage.
 Finished my first bottle. My sleep is more regular &amp; wake up rested. I no longer loose the big chunks of hair which is a great surprise.  I take Synthroid for my Hypothyroidism and my blood work shows my numbers are better too. Will continue with this supplement!
 Been taking for almost a month and I don't really notice a difference. I've been diagnosed with hypothyroidism since I was 15 and I take Synthroid for it. I had hope that taking this in addition might help me with some of the day to day symptoms my doc said I had to deal with :(
 I tried this for hypothyroid aid and on the second time I took it, first thing of the day on an empty  stomach, immediately went into racing heart beat and was too weak to barely stand up.  Finally got it under control with a heavy dose of magnesium. Scary, I wouldn't recommend trying this if you have a problem with Afib.  Too risky, to me, to try it again. Everyone's system is different, so just be aware.  I liked the ingredients listed in the product, so you never know how it will react in "your" system.
 Personally, this product has seemed to be quite beneficial. I've noticed an overall boost in energy - mental and physical - especially when paired with nootropic supplements. The effects were noticeable after a couple of days, and there was a complimentary noticeable effect after stopping the supplement for a couple days. I've now taken the recommended dose for a few months and am satisfied. although wish the cost was not so high. Five stars if the price drops - it's good, but not essential enough for $20/mo for a college student.
 I am thrilled to say I have lost 15lbs in a month and I feel really good! More focuse and I sleep soundly. Only side effect is I have noticed I sweat a bit more. Anyone else get this? I will buy again!
 I do not have a diagnosed thyroid condition (although have experienced many symptoms of hypothyroidism for years); however, I purchased this product mainly for the ingredients. It is tough to find components like methylcobalamin, l-tyrosine, ashwagandha, and schizandra all together in the same supplement. After taking the first bottle, I waited about a week before ordering another, and I noticed a definite dip in my energy level and focus. It's difficult for me to find products I want to purchase consistently since there are so many out there to try, but this will be one of them.
 I love this product, however due to the Cayenne pepper, it caused severe heartburn. I've had surgery several years ago for acid reflux. I Wii be researching this company to see if I can find something similar without the pepper. Don't let this discourage you, it might be great for you. Update...I tried again and this time no heartburn. Ive stuck with it for over a week now.
 Before I bought Zhou Nutrition Thyroid Support I was just weary. I was so, so tired. It was a totally unreasonable exhaustion. I knew something wasn't right. I take synthroid, but I just thought, Intuitively, that it was my thyroid. So I started searching on Amazon for a thyroid supplement, because I think thyroid issues are really hard for doctors to get diagnose correctly and I didn't really want to go through "Does this work? Is this right?". Anyway, I chose Zhou Nutrition Thyroid Support and within two days had energy back. It was really like a miracle to me. I told my two daughters about it because they were so exhausted too and I bought some for them. They are now ordering their second bottle because it made such a difference for them. I haven't lost weight, but eating what I have been eating, I should have gained weight, and have not (so it's really kind of losing weight). I really cannot recommend this thyroid support enough. I am very, very happy I found it. It has literally changed my life.
 I’ve had wonderful results with this supplement in the 2 weeks I’ve been taking it. Before I barely had the energy or desire to get chores done or do anything socially. Now I can work at a steady pace all day &amp; want to do fun social things again. Additionally, I’ve been sleeping like a rock &amp; wake up well rested without using an alarm.
 I was taking synthroid 50mcg for years and still suffered with fatigue. I had just enough energy to make it through the work day, at times felt lifeless, trying so hard to focus and my brain feeling clouded.  I researched and found this, after 8 weeks, 2 bottles of this supplement. I cannot begin to explain how good I feel in comparison to a few moths ago. I feel like myself again. I've lost only 6lbs in 8 weeks but my main reason taking it was just to function.  I had my labs done and for the first time in 9 years I was told my dosage needed to be lowered. I'm now actually considering if I need to conitue taking Synthroid.
 I don’t feel any different. I’ve been taking the supplements for a few days now. (So, maybe I just need to give it more tome?) After reading the stellar reviews, I was cautiously optimistic. Sadly, I’m just feeling like regular me still. 🤷🏼‍♀️
 The ingredient that is not listed here is silica.  This is a filler put in supplements and is a known lung irritant.  I began coughing within 3 days of taking this supplement.  It is not good if you have any allergy or lung issues.<br/><br/>Edited to Add:  Unsolicited by me, I was contacted by Zhou Nutrition and offered a complete refund for the product.  Again, I did not ask for this.  So while the product did not work for me (it may for you), I am blown away by the customer service of the company.  I really appreciate the effort!
 While I have only had and used Zhou Thyroid Support With Iodine for about two weeks, I have noticed in that time much better focus, clear-headedness, and the ability to motivate myself to "get things done."  Many years ago, a world-renown endocrinologist told me that I had the "metabolism of a bear in hibernation."  I took several prescription meds for a couple of years and, frankly, did not feel significantly different, so I stopped the expensive office visits and meds.  Since then, I've drastically improved my diet off and on; been an avid exerciser off and on; and improved my "life-style" off and on.  I am not over-weight.  However, lately, I've been feeling unmotivated, lethargic, and, at times, quite fuzzy-headed.  I believe this product is currently lifting the brain fog and will continue to use it with the hopes this improvement is sustainable.
 Update - The seller reached out to me and provided me a full refund. He also offered to send me a free bottle of another product free of charge. I am impressed with the seller and his responsiveness to the issue.<br/><br/>This is my 3rd product that I have tried from Zhou and I am just not impressed with this supplement. Maybe my expectations were too high but I don't feel anything significant in the way of energy as the other reviews and I did take it daily for a week to give it a fair review. Everyone's body and chemistry is different so perhaps it is just not as effective for me but it would be for someone else. At this point I am not able to recommend as<br/>it seems to serve no purpose for me.
 I have not been taking this long enough to have new lab work drawn to see if it helps but I can tell you that I feel a whole lot better taking it.  My prescription medication keeps me nauseated all the time.  So therefore, I don’t feel very well in general.  This does not make me nauseated and makes me have an all over better feeling of well being.  I will continue taking it to see how my next set of labs are. I am very happy with the product so far for sure.
 I have suffered with Hashimoto's hypothyroidism for 6 years.  I am currently taking a natural thyroid supplement and was interested in the vitamins that could help me out with my energy levels.  After searching high and low, I found that there were many vitamins I should be taking, some including vitamin D, L-tyrosine, magnesium, and B vitamins.  I am thrilled that I found a vitamin that I can take that includes ALL of these necessary components in ONE pill!!!<br/><br/>I am definitely rating this product with 5 stars, as I immediately noticed that when I woke up in the morning for work, I actually had pep in my step.  The first thought I had was NOT what time I could go back to bed, as it had always been.  Highly recommend this product, it is affordable, high quality, and just plain helps with the thyroid fog and lack of energy.
 Didn't notice any difference. Did nothing. Not worth it. Don't waste your money. I wish I hadn't.<br/><br/>Update:  Since posting my review the company contacted me to issue a complete refund.  It's rare in this day and age to have a company stand behind their product with 100% satisfaction guarantee and it is much appreciated.  Thank you!
 I was definitely skeptical of this product. Ironically, even tho I am a nurse... I definitely prefer natural products. I felt like the thyroid supplements and pills doctors recommended did very little or even worsened things. After trying this, I didn’t immediately notice a difference. It was after I stopped that I realized... how tired I suddenly was again. I realized after that I had lost 10lbs in two months. This product is actually wonderful. I don’t recommend taking this if you aren’t aware of your thyroid function and levels. Don’t take this just because you’re tired. However, if you are in need due to your thyroid... 100% recommend trying this!
 this is some great stuff!! After a few weeks the hair loss has slowed down significantly, my skin is much better as well much smoother.  Best part of all is I no longer have that frustrating inability to lose weight. With a decent diet and exercise the pounds are dropping and i'm loving it! Will definitely be buying again.
 This is the second time I've ordered this product. It helps me out a lot. I don't get all hyped up with it but it helps me not feel sleepy or tired. I feel alert and task that would require me to use some of non existence energy don't seem bad to do at all. I get more things done when I take these pills. I usually take them in the afternoon since after work I'm usually drained and I need some energy to spend time with my kids. I have no issues in falling asleep even if I take it late, it actually helps me rest better. I don't wake up feeling like I only had 2 seconds of sleep. I would recommend them. At least to try them since I know not everyone is the same. Oh yeah and weight loss I don't know about that since to me that's the only thing I don't see change.
 This really helped me I was low on my test of thyroid but not enough for medications, so used this to balance and it gave me energy and helped sprout hair too.  I will buy again. I used this because I researched about stress and hair loss. This was a great for hair strength,used biotin and horsetail  and sleeping much better at night.
 I know everyone is different but this one did not work for me. I suffer from ADD and depression. I don’t take any pills, but I thought this might have been my magic pill. I didn’t really knowdiced anything. I was still in bed with a racing mind and to only shut it off was to take naps &amp; go for a walk. I just ordered something else. Hopefully the other one works. I’m a student and a mother so I am almost giving up bc my cabinet is full of vitamins to help me but so far Adderrall on my first week helped me the most. I eventually stopped bc it was giving me an opposite effect where I just wanted to sleep ! Anyone who finds something that works let me know!
 must say I made a good decision in ordering the Thyroid Support from ZHOU. After years of taking (still taking) Synthroid for Hypothyrodism for over 20years I<br/>1. finally have energy<br/>2. feel happy for a change<br/>3. feel like life is and will be better<br/>ZHOU Thyroid Support an excellent product and I intend to stay on it!! It has been a life saver.<br/>e.simpson
 Zhou has some of the best products around. They're independently tested and verified. Their customer service is also incredible. I've only had to email them once (nothing was wrong, just a question) and they responded promptly and very kindly.<br/><br/>This thyroid support complex has all the essentials your thyroid needs to function properly. It seems to be helping a lot! I didn't feel an amazing difference like others did but I just feel better. I've lost a few pounds with no other changes. Give this a try! Nothing to lose and everything to gain :)
 I have been taking this supplement for a few weeks now, and I absolutely love the positive effects that I'm experiencing. I only take one capsule a day, which is half of the recommended dosage, and I wake up every morning feeling well-rested and energized. I also stay full throughout the day, and have managed to lose eight pounds in two weeks! As someone with PCOS, these have proven to be a must-have! Will definitely continue to order!
 I have been taking this for about 11 days which I know isn’t a long time but I haven’t felt a difference in energy, I have had a headache for about 5 days now, and I’ve gained 5lbs. I want this to work for me so bad but I don’t want to keep putting something in my body that isn’t working either. Wondering if anyone else had similar symptoms and they went away and it started working?
 I hardly ever write reviews but I had to make an exception for this one! I've been feeling sluggish and lethargic and having a really hard time getting up in the morning even after getting a full 8 hours of sleep. I decided to give this a try and holy s***!! In only a couple days I've noticed a HUGE difference. I jump right out of bed in the morning and don't even need naps anymore! I take 2 capsules in the morning and the difference is night and day.
 I received my pills and they are awesome.. I have so much more energy now and they are just that boost I need to keep me going! Love them!!!
 I take it every day in the morning.  I tried to take 1 pill at night, and I could not fall asleep for hours.  There are a lot of good ingredients in this product.  I buy several other products from Zhou; check out its Amazon page.  Zhou apparently gives a refund if you don't like a product.  I paid full price for my first bottle and am currently on my third.  I also take Neuro Peak.  I recently ordered the sleeping aid product.
 This has added a quality to my life that I’ve been missing due to Hashimoto’s. I’ve been on a natural thyroid medication and all it’s done for me is get my levels in the “normal” range, but I felt anything but normal. This supplement has helped with brain fog, increased my once nonexistent appetite, among other things. I haven’t lost any weight yet and my body temp still runs pretty low, but overall this has helped tremendously. I will keep taking it and recommend it to anyone I know with a thyroid disorder.
 I have hypothyroid hashimotos but I decided to take a more natural route to deal with it instead of synthroid. I found this thyroid support and have taken it for about six mo this now and love it! I finally signed up to get it shipped to me automatically so i don’t run out, because I notice a huge difference when I don’t take it! I feel like my biggest daily symptom is fatigue, and this helps tremendously! I’ve been able to lose weight while on this and I do notice mood improvement, as well. I really love this product and I am so grateful that I found it!
 This supplement has helped me lose 11 pounds in a month. I used to feel uncontrollable hunger pangs, which this supplement seems to have diminished greatly. I am excited to see if this keeps up!
 I was very hopeful based on reviews  and have battled with thyroid issues most of my life. Unfortunately this product had an opposite effect on me causing irritability, weight gain, swelling of my feet, overall not a good time.
 I have been taking these for a little while now and I love the natural energy and alertness they give me, without jitters. I take one every morning and I have a lesser need for coffee now! I have thyroid health issues and these have really helped me!<br/><br/>My one thing is that they changed the capsules, I guess to a green one with chlorophyll, and it makes your bowel movements very light green. After reading other reviews and doing some research, it's not a big deal.
 I have chronic fatigue, brain fog issues, etc. and was really hoping for an experience similar to the majority of the reviews on here.  Unfortunately, when I took these, I felt really tired - more so than usual, and it was so hard to wake up even after eight hours of sleep. On the third day, I got a splitting headache, and the combination of worsened fatigue and headaches made it pretty hard to focus during the day.
 Couldn’t really tell much of a difference when taking this supplement. However, it Is like that for me with  products...sometimes I have to try different ones to see what works. The ingredients are what is recommended for those with thyroid issues and the company seems to be one of integrity, so it’s certainly worth a try. I’m giving it four stars because my dealings with this company have been highly professional and customer service oriented and I will definitely try some if their other products.
 Had high hopes this might help but, even taking only half the dosage with food, made me nauseous... Disappointed... but doesn't mean, as evidenced by positive reviews, that it won't work for you...
 I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  Seriously, I was stuck at a weight no matter what I did didn't work until I started on this supplement and I have miraculously started losing weight.  Not only that I was having to take shots of 5-hour energy drink to just stay away throughout the day and I don't need them anymore as I have naturally just started feeling more awake and alert.  I highly, highly recommend this supplement!
 I have been taking this for about a week now.  I can honestly say I feel so much better and I have more energy than I have had in a long time.  There was one day I forgot to take it and I could tell the difference. There has also be a noticeable difference in my appetite i have been feeling full without over eating.  I do not plan to weigh in for at least another week so I do not know if I am losing weight at this point.  Even if I do not I feel so much better that I will continue to take this.
 I don't have thyroid problems that I'm aware of, but after recently gaining some weight and starting hormone replacement therapy, I figured it couldn't be a bad idea to try to optimize my thyroid as well, so I picked up a bottle of these. I initially considering a far more expensive option, but the profile between that product and this is nearly identical. I'm now on my second bottle, and have lost 12 pounds over the last few months. I can't directly attribute that to this particular supplement, but I do notice that I have better energy levels which is a huge deal for someone who works with people and has kids at home. That's a big benefit all by itself. Will definitely continue using this product in the future.
 Got this for my mom who had her thyroid removed.  she is currently on medication but it made her lethargic and forgetful.  Within 1 week of taking the thyroid support complex- she felt 100x better and everyone around her could tell that she had more energy and was less forgetful.  All of her friends with thyroid issues asked what she was doing and they are now using it too.<br/><br/>It's a great product and I wish we had found it years ago!
 Omg !!!! This is a heaven sent !<br/>I’ve seen dealing with Hypothyroidism since I was 11 years old and NOTHING has made me feel as good as these pills !<br/>I have my energy back, the foggyness in my brain has disappeared, no more body aches and my hair fas finally stopped to fall out!<br/>Amazing product
 I have tried many thyroid supplements but this one is helping me.  I do feel a difference in my fatigue levels. I have been using it for a month now. I ordered another bottle and Im hoping things keep getting better. I believe you need to take this for a month before feeling better.
 Best supplement ever!! I have tones of energy every day, my anxiety is gone and I lost 18 pounds in a month Yeyeye so excited I am going to order more.
 Some time ago I didn't have my period for two months, so I went to my gyno doctor and she did a blood test.... Apparently my thyroid level were very low. So I went to Endocrinologist (thyroid/hormonal specialist). Doctors physician was pushing me towards medication that I'll have to take for the rest of my life, which really freaked me out!!!!!!! But I was SO LUCKY that my doctor said No we will give it couple months and retake the thyroid test. I came home really upset because I don't want &amp; wont take medication that can cause bigger issues if I skip one day of not taking the pill. I went online did my research and bought "Thyroid Support Complex with Iodine", drank the whole bottle then scheduled blood test per doctored orders..... Well the test results came out NORMAL. Ever since then my period is regular. I really believe in this product and it worked for me!!!!!!!!!!! And yes I will buy it again and advise to for my sister who has thyroid issues as well because it runs in the family.<br/>I know people who are taking chemo because of thyroid issued and its said because it can be an easier fix you just have to find what works for your body.
 This stopped my cycle after the depo shot. I was bleeding for 7 months all while on the shot then after i stopped the shot. My cycle still didn't stop everyday I was so frustrated I took dandelion root and milk thestle to flush out my liver I tried yarrow and raspberry leaf and the cycle was slower but still came daily on time so I read this book woman code and it implied maybe my thyroid was off.<br/><br/>You may be asking yourselves why I didn't see a doctor? Well I'm glad you asked I was seeing the gynaecologist for 5 years and they kept giving me birth control or Lupron to mask the problem not once did they explain why I had so many fibroids<br/><br/> I'm 34 so there's no way I'm having surgery everrrrr. So after they failed me for the last time I was told about herbs and I started my research.<br/><br/>The day I took this thyroid support my cycle stopped on the 4 th day. it stopped dead in it's tracks I'm sooo grateful I could cryyy. It's amazing to feel myself again I will never take another birth control. It kills your libedo and thins your hair among other things.<br/><br/> I researched and researched and it all said it would take 6 months for the depo side effects to stop. So this pill fixed it in 4 days crazy.<br/><br/>Ladies please eat a healthy diet organic only that will solve all your problems. Medications are foreign to the body and is not natural. Your body will heal itself if you give it the correct food and herbs. Hormones in the food is bad for us. I became a vegetarian for 3 months and felt amazing so now I only eat fish and wild caught fish. I'm truly liberated<br/>Good luck to you
 I have taken this for 30 days now and after about 5 days I started noticing I wasn't needing a nap at 3pm anymore.  I never felt anything other then just noticing I'm feeling a ton better each day. No heart racing, no nasty after taste nothing. This is the only change I have introduced to my vitamins and supplements so I know it's this Thyroid Support. I totally believe it was the minerals in this supplement that have helped tremendously. I would totally recommend this to anyone who is feeling sluggish and blah.
 I honestly thought they were just vitamins. Vitamins don’t do much (in my opinion anyway). But THIS is life changing stuff in a bottle. Oh my god how I hated even being awake! These supplements are the ‘true-true’ lol. I’m even in better moods now. For something as wholesome and as vegan as possible it’s pretty amazing..<br/>I am a believer and very grateful to come across this product. *No exaggeration.<br/>No jitters or crashes. Feels so smooth and natural.<br/>I fall asleep so much faster every night and wake up A LOT smoother every morning.<br/>ANYWAY! Recommended! 👍🏼
 This gave me the worst explosive diarrhea and explosive gas I have ever had in my life. I thought it was from food I ate because it started 4 days after starting it on 1 pill a day. I took 2 days off and took it again for 2 days and it came right back. My stomach was so distended I looked 6 months pregnant and even though I haven’t taken it for 3 days my abs hurt right under my rib cage like I’ve been working out but I haven’t been. It was so awful! After I stopped taking it the 2nd time I was getting chills and I could still feel it in my body making me jittery for 2 days. And I can’t even button my pants anymore. I read up in the herbs after all this and you’re not supposed to injest them. Do not take this!!
 I was very skeptical about using this but, after reading all the reviews I decided to take a chance. I have now ordered this twice because since being on this I have had a boost of energy that I have been trying to get for awhile. I am already on medication for hypothyroidism and sometimes you just need a little more help then what you are already getting. I take this every day when I get up as part of my daily routine. I highly recommend this product for anyone who is looking for some extra help with their every day routine. Sometimes you just need that extra boost to help you throughout the day and this will more than likely give it to you.
 I was very optimistic about these because of all the positive feedback and testimonials. I have an under-active thyroid and am constantly tired. Caffeine and copious amounts of sleep does not help. I almost feel slightly more tired after I take the daily recommended dosage of 2 pills. I am sad to say it was a waste of money and did not work for me. I am not going to even finish the bottle.
 This seemed to fix my mood swings, tiredness and overall well being. I took it for 30 days. I didn’t see any weight loss but I felt so much better I didn’t really care. The only kicker is (reason for 3 instead of 5 stars) it gave me severe acne on my face and body. I took it for the full month in hopes it would level out but it continually got worse. In the end I decided not to reorder and go on the hunt for something comparable minus the acne.
 I noticed a change within the first few days of taking this supplement. For me it REALLY improved my 'brain fog', I am so much more productive at work and I credit these pills. They are a little large so if you're not a big pill person (like me) it kinda sucks. Word to the wise do not think you're gonna be smart and mix this in work applesauce. It tastes TERRIBLE. But, you can't taste anything if you just take the pill.
 I'm on my second bottle of this and have really enjoyed the benefits. I'm feeling much more balanced. Before taking, it was always a roller coaster ride, but now the roller coaster is much shorter. I will continue to take it. Don't expect results over night, give it atleast 90 days to really judge the benefits.
 I honestly feel like this helped me.  I have been on Synthroid 150mg for 10 years.  And I feel like ass most days.  I have ordered 2 bottles so far.  I never order 2 bottles.  It took a few weeks for me to feel the effects, but I can honestly say I feel clear headed for the 1st time in a long time.  I am glad I found this and I am greatful for all the reviews fellow amazon shoppers left.
 I bought this a few months ago but for some reason it doesn’t do much? I’ve had Hashimoto’s for 5 years &amp; I’m 23. From other reviews it seems that other Hashimoto’s sufferers don’t benefit from the product only people who have minor thyroid related issues. I don’t know if I’ll get a refund since it’s been a couple of months since purchasing the product.
 I was super suspicious about this working reading the mixed reviews. i weighed myself at the start of my first week (monday) and was 182.6 pounds, at the end of the week (sunday) i was down to 176.2. now I'm on my third week and I'm at 172.8 this product is actually amazing and definitely worth the money. just remember that you need to eat right and exercise as well if you want to see results, its not a magic pill but it is a huge help.
 I have taken this product for a month and I can't say it has helped my low thyroid condition at all.  I don't feel any different.  The ingredient list looks good, but I don't notice any benefits.<br/><br/>As a follow up, without asking, I was contacted by Zhou Nutrition and given a full refund.  That's excellent customer service!  Even though this particular product didn't produce the results I was looking for, I would highly recommend doing business with this company since they stand behind their products without question.
 I waited at least 2 weeks and a half to rate this product.  I must say,  it's very effective for me.  I work at least 10 to 11 hours every night and ever since I took this it just goes by like nothing  with all the energy I get.  I also noticed that my metabolism had improved dramatically.  I sweat a lot more than I used to at the gym.  I recommend this product to those who work graveyard shifts like I do.  thank u!
 I have been taking this product for approximately a month and followed directions to a T and I can honestly say it has not helped me. I am fully aware that not all people will have the same outcome as others. I did feel my anxiety level go up with these pills. <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Thyroid-Support-Complex-With-Iodine-Energy-Metabolism-Focus-Formula-Vegetarian-Soy-Gluten-Free-Feel-Like-Your-Old-Self-Again/dp/B00S8PW6P6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Thyroid Support Complex With Iodine - Energy, Metabolism &amp; Focus Formula - Vegetarian, Soy &amp; Gluten Free - 'Feel Like Your Old Self Again'</a><br/>Update 4/5/2018 - I was contacted by the the founder of Zhou (Alex) and I am very happy and surprised at the level of customer service that was extended towards me.  Alex was very responsive and considerate, I was given a full refund so I may find another product.  I was really surprised by this, as we all know not many companies go that extra mile for their consumers.  Companies like this are far, few and in between.  I would recommend this company and its products largely because of their commitment to their customers, as well as advocating healthy alternatives vs. big pharma solutions.
 15 pounds and a handful of other things later, my frustration was undeniable. I have sworn for quite a while that something is off but the numbers dance on the normal side. I’ve only taken this supplement for a week, but I am very happy with the results. I tried Thrive several months ago, and although it “resulted” in weight loss, I had multiple adverse issue with the system. I’ve been afraid, and my stomach has been too acidic to seriously commit to anything since, until this. It’s fantastic to finally have energy, not want food day and night, and see results. And the price is great!
 Using my first bottle I lost 5lbs im on a very strict diet, not a jym/exercise person so just taking these with less calorie intake it works not extremely well but its going good i guess. I order my second bottle today will update my review after i finish. For now i will recommend it.
 I just started this today (a few hours ago) and only took 1 capsule. So far my  resting heart rate is elevated to about 96 bpm which isn't normal for me. It does seem to curb my appetite which is noticeable because I always like to eat. Not sure how long the effects will last but not thrilled about the elevated heart rate so far. I'll update later if something changes.
 I am so impressed with this product. I have noticed my sugar cravings have gone down. My energy is A-mazing! And i feel thinner. No scale reading yet, but having a hypo-thyroid issues, i only dream of being skinny. Hopefully this will assist my body working with me and not against me. Thank you for providing this great supplement!
 I really like this stuff. I have Hashimoto's and love how it made me feel. However, a group I'm in on facebook  said, "There are so many reasons why we don't recommend that product" which no one ever told me WHAT those reasons were. SO - I'm still taking it and I feel terrific!
 I am really sensitive to supplements and they always leave me feeling nauseas and with headaches. I bought these based on the reviews and decided to start with 1 pill a day for a week. I bumped it up to 2 a day and so far I have not noticed any crazy changes but they don’t make me sick! Which makes me pretty happy! I don’t have a scale but I have noticed my once super tight wedding rings are now spinning around my finger, and I do feel smaller. I have been having less cravings for snacking but idk if it’s from the pills. It’s only been a few weeks but I want to keep it up to see how I feel after a month or so. All in all I decided to buy another bottle, if I am still feeling positive about this product, I will do the subscription to save.
 My wife got this for me because I do not eat much, I’m fairly active, but was always very overweight!  It’s been just 3 weeks and I am shocked at the energy and weight loss that I’ve seen!  24lbs so far!  Granted, that was like throwing a deck chair off of the Titanic, as I was over 300lbs!  But I’m also eating more than I ever have as well. I’m about to begin working out as well, which I was way too out of shape to dream of doing before!
 My daughter (19) and I (47) both notice a positive difference when taking 2 a day. We both have more energy, wake up happier, and feel generally healthier. When we ran out and missed a couple of weeks, we both noticed a difference in our energy and mood. Weight control is a bonus. We are both active and swim daily, so the added energy level is a great contributor.
 After taking Thyroid Support for 2 months I had my blood work done.  My numbers are perfect!  I've always been borderline at best and often into the hypothyroid range.  I've resisted Doctors who have tried to prescribe meds and now it's no longer an issue.  My energy level has improved and I'm hoping it will continue to do so.  I'm also hoping my dry skin and hair loss will improve as I continue to take this supplement.
 Felt energized without being hyper and nervous.  My mind feels much clearer!
 I have hypothyroid and so I was hoping these would help to boost my energy, I tend to run out of steam by midday. However I was really disappointed in these as I took them for two weeks straight every morning and was still tired during the day. I also take a levothyroxine daily so maybe they don't mix well. I didn't experience any side effects, I just didn't notice any difference at all.<br/><br/>Just a quick update here. After posting this the company reached out in order to compensate for not seeing any results. It has been less than 24hrs which is impressive to me. I appreciate them taking the time to do this and so I have improved my rating of the product. This is a very customer focused company and that's great to see.
 This supplement is fantastic!! I feel so much better on it. For years I kept asking to have my thyroid checked. I always felt off, sluggish and kept gaining weight (the list goes on) every time the test came back low, but not low enough to do anything about. I have been taking this for a little over a month now, and the difference is night and day. I have energy, and my weight is dropping. I will never be without this supplement!
 Love this supplement!  I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism last year and was taking Levothyroxine but didn’t notice a difference, so I started taking this supplement to help while I weaned myself off the Levo.  No negativite side effects, and I have more energy.  I recently got my blood tested and my thyroid now reads as normal.  I’m sure this supplement helped tremendously with this; my double chin isn’t as prominent either.
 I've been on a low dose of Synthroid for almost a decade. Every year it seems like my dosage needs to go up a bit, but my doctor NEVER agrees with me. He suggested taking antidepressants instead of just testing me again, which was totally ridiculous!! I know my body and I know when I just feel off and run down. Thanks to this supplement I can have that nice boost I need just to feel like a normal human being again!!! I'm hoping to one day soon be able to just take this instead of synthetic hormones.
 Have been suffering with Hashimotos since the age of 12 currently 25 have been on levothyroxine since I can remember. I constantly struggle with feeling sluggish and have problems with losing weight. Within the first week  of using thyroid support I lost 5lbs without changing my diet add a little exercise and better food choices by the end of the month I lost a little over 20lbs!!! I had no negative side-effects. I was worried because I saw that many people complained about headaches and migraines.
 I saw this product as a daily deal, and based on the reviews decided to purchase it. I have been exhausted and just dragging through the day. So I started this thyroid support on a Monday, and by Tuesday I had so much energy! I don't even need an afternoon nap now! I take this in addition to my T3 and T4 medicine, but I highly recommend it! Especially if you are starting to feel more run down. I actually feel like my old self!
 My iodine level still checked low. No weight loss.
 It didn't do anything, even after taking almost the whole bottle. Plus, if you have difficulty swallowing pills and have to break open capsules, be warned that the cayenne pepper in these is so strong that it made my tongue sting for an hour. I had to mix them in apple juice. Very disappointed that they didn't do anything, after all of that.
 I personally did not notice any difference from using this product unfortunately, but I had read the reviews before purchasing and it has seemed to make a difference for many people.  I'm sure it can vary for each person, and I felt it was definitely worth to try it.<br/>I did not notice any side effects either, so that's always good also.
 I am on my second bottle of the Thyroid Support.  I have been able to drop almost 10lbs, I have better focus and I sleep at night.  I feel almost "normal".  I have Hoshimoto's and I tend to swing in and out of hyper/ hypo thyroidism.  since I have been using these pills I feel calm and more balanced.  This is by no means a cure but it has helped greatly with the symptoms and issues that I have experienced over the last 8 years or better. If you get a chance to try this product, I recommend it.  As with most things results may vary but I think if you read most of the reviews you will find that most people have had great success with this product.  I take 2 pills every night with my dinner. I have no stomach issues at all.
 I have taken this for a month now and although I can’t claim my life is changed, it has definitely helped. I take it in the morning and it helps me wake up better. I don’t stay as groggy as when without it. So there is definitely some more energy in me. It doesn’t hurt to try and see how you react to it.
 I have always had suspicions of an under active thyroid for years now. So naturally I take to Amazon to take a swing at a best selling product. I can honestly say that the results were almost immediate, as I could feel more energy, more hunger, better overall sense of well being, and even what I would call a boost in sex-hormones. I tried another thyroid product to stay unbiased, but nothing makes me feel as great as this one. I simply took two capsules with my first meal in the morning, and that was enough to even start dropping weight (with an admittedly sub-par diet). I would love to experiment with a second dose later in the day and a well balanced diet to see just how great this product can be. A must have!
 This vitamin really makes a difference. I hate to be without it!  I have been hypothyroid for several years now and despite medication and accurate lab values I haven't felt myself ... Tired, sluggish, restless sleep etc.  within days of taking this supplement I felt a difference.  More energy, I was actually hungry and I slept like a rock!  I mean I really slept hard.  If I run out and several days have gone by since I last took it, I feel a real difference.... Back to restless sleep, slow metabolism and morning and afternoon fatigue. So I try not to be without!
 These did the complete opposite of what they should do. I can barely wake up in the morning using these. I slept harder than I ever have in my life, they just knocked me out.  Made me groggy and tired. Definitely do not recommend. Do not know how this product has gotten so many amazing reviews.
 I hadn't been feeling well for awhile and I knew it was because of my thyroid. I have hypothyroidism and some days I just feel depressed and horrible. I started taking these and after about 2 weeks of taking them consistently I started to feel better. It's been a Month now and I really do feel better, while not 100%, I do feel better.
 Didn't work for me. I actually felt an increase in sluggishness and anxiety after just a week. And I definitely had worse headaches. I stopped because I was worried about the reactions ashwagandha has with some other medications and because I really was not feeling myself while taking it. Super bummed.
 Took it for a month I didn't really notice any change.  A few times it seems a bit appetite suppressing but I cant honestly say I felt any difference.  Dissapointed
 I haven't had access to prescription medication for my thyroid for a while now so I started taking supplements for it. This supplement help with my under-active thyroid, not as much as the prescription medication, but it is far better than taking nothing at all. When I do not take anything I get muscle fatigue, swelling, and brain fog. This supplement helps alleviate those symptoms. Even though the prescription medication for hypothyroidism might be a little more effective I still prefer the supplements.
 I bought this for my aunt who had been struggling with thyroid issues lately. And she absolutely raves about it. She's been taking it now for 1 month along with her regular thyroid meds and she feels great! Ever her doctor saw the changes and is even considering taking my aunt off the thyroid meds completely in 3 months! If all goes well.
 Very grateful to have discovered Thyroid Support with Iodine.  I suspected my lack of energy was thyroid related similar to my mother who had lifelong thyroid issues. My results have been excellent and my order was delivered in perfect condition earlier than expected. My choice to try the Zhou brand was based on all the positive reviews. My sincere thanks to all those people and special thank you to Zhou Nutrition. I wanted to pay forward with a review for others which led me to a brief communication with Zhou.  They are truly one of the nicest companies ever!!!
 I, like several other people who have written reviews on this, have always suspected I had a low thyroid, but was told repeatedly by naturopaths that my thyroid levels were within the "normal range." I decided just to go ahead and try a supplement anyway, and I'm so glad I did. I'm very careful with what I eat and I work out hard 4-5 times a week, but I always felt like I was constantly battling weight gain, constipation, and fog-brain. I checked my weight about 3 weeks into my first bottle of this, and I had lost 6 pounds! That's a ton when you're 5'2"! I definitely feel like it's helping to keep me more regular and alert as well. I'm very pleased with this product.
 I started taking this supplement 18-20 months ago. I have hashimoto thyroiditis and preciously struggled with levelizing my thyroid.  Same does - one blood draw I was high; next was low. Since I started this I have been level every single time the doc drew blood. Have not had to change my medication level once in 18 months. I’ll never go without it!
 Since I can remember I had very little energy, always taking day naps and being lethargic. After a week of taking this supplement I see a difference! I'm not saying the sleepiness is completely gone but my energy level increased. I find it a little bit easier to focus and study without getting tired and laying down. I am actually really surprised that I see a difference. Before ordering I tried couple different brands and I was convinced that the reviews were fake (as they usually are) but that can't be the case
 I bought this on recommendation of someone who'd had good luck with it, but the very first day I took this I wound up feeling tired and overly emotional all day.  I also had an unpleasant metallic taste in my mouth for about 12 hours, which some reading indicated might be a result of too much iodine.  The ingredients list iodine plus kelp and bladderwrack, both of which are sources of iodine (meaning it's impossible to tell exactly how much iodine you're getting with each pill.)  Definitely won't be taking any more.
 I am still awaiting test results from on bloodwork but I can say that I feel better when I'm taking this product. I had low thyroid on my previous 2 test results so I decided to try this. When I ran out I went off it for a couple of weeks and could really tell the difference after a week or so. So far so good.
 I did notice any kind of difference when I used these and noticed over the month I broke out way more on my neck and back. I had blood work done shortly after I finished and had the exact same results which was a major let down.
 Began using product a little over 2 weeks. So far so good. I have to say that I am feeling much better, my energy levels have improved a lot.<br/>The instructions say that you need to use consistently which is true, and I can honestly say that I felt improvements in maybe a week or so.<br/>I am not a fan of these kind of products so I ordered the first bottle with hesitation, and I'm glad I did. As far as weight lost I have dropped a couple of pounds and my appetite seems to be in check, but this was not my primary objective with this product.<br/>Already ordered my second bottle......to be continued
 We get these for my mom, this is what she has to say about them: "I have been taking thyroid support &amp; this brand since October 2015.  I used to take only one a day, but my doctor wanted me to start taking 2, so now I have been taking 2 a day for almost 6 months now.  I have heard many talking about loosing weight when they use thyroid pills, I haven't seen this benefit yet.  My doctor likes the ingredients in these pills and for that I have been buying this brand for almost a year.  I am not even sure if one can stop taking thyroid support once they have started, I will have to ask my doctor, or at least ask if it is safe to try a different brand to see if these are in fact the better brand.  Because my doctor likes the ingredients and feels they are making a difference for me, I will give them a 5 star."<br/><br/>I forgot to add, these pills need to be taken with food, several times I have had a burning go all the way up my esophagus into my nose and throat.  This does not happen when I take them with food.<br/><br/>I have included pictures comparing to a nickle.
 I just finished my first bottle of Thyroid Support Complex, and I am super happy with it! I've tried a couple other (more expensive) thyroid supplements since being diagnosed with hypothyroidism recently. Zhou Nutrition has been the best... more energy, better sleep, dependable  appetite suppression... I love it. My quality of life is literally leaps and bounds better simply by taking this supplement. 😀
 I was a little “iffy” at first but after using it for a couple weeks I noticed I really did have more energy and I felt more happy which is always a plus!
 As a 50-year old personal trainer leading 6 to 10 high intensity group workouts per week, fatigue can hinder my job performance. But since i started taking Xhou thyroid support a couple of months ago, i feel more energetic throughout the day feel like i am sleeping better at night. I also feel less hungry throughout the day, which helps me stay lean. In fact, i've lost about five pounds since i started taking this supplement on a daily basis.
 I am in my 50`s and wax struggling with no energy, very slow metabolism and just overall loss of a "feel good" feeling. I had every test at the doctors to try to find a reason. Of course there was nothing physically wrong. Found this miracle formula and have never felt better. I now do not feel the need to nap all day, can focus and just feel great. Don't wait...order yours today.
 I have chosen to use this in place of my thyroid medication. Levrothyroxine was making me feel horrible in different ways. I've chosen to go all natural. No prescription drugs. That's my choice though. Do for you what you think is best or your Dr thinks is best for you. I've been feeling great since taking these. I have way more energy than I used to, I just overall feel a lot better! It took some time before it started to work but it does!
 I was really hoping I’d feel a boost in energy but I didn’t. On the plus side I did lose over 15 lbs which is great! I am going to try a different supplement but if that one doesn’t improve my energy level then I’ll be buying this again for sure.
 I tried this product out of desperation. I was previously taking Kelp and found Thyroid Support when I went to reorder my bottle of Kelp. I read the other reviews and thought I'd give it a go.  My energy level had totally bottomed out, my head was foggy constantly, I was desperate.<br/>I am almost finished with my first bottle and already have another. I cannot express my satisfaction with this product enough.  It took almost two week to notice a difference but I feel back to my normal self.<br/><a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Thyroid-Support-Complex-With-Iodine-Energy-Metabolism-Focus-Formula-Vegetarian-Soy-Gluten-Free-Feel-Like-Your-Old-Self-Again/dp/B00S8PW6P6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Thyroid Support Complex With Iodine - Energy, Metabolism &amp; Focus Formula - Vegetarian, Soy &amp; Gluten Free - 'Feel Like Your Old Self Again'</a>
 I have been battling hashis for 20+years. Every year my symtoms have gotten worse. I promised myself that 2018 was the year for change. So I removed gluten from my diet and started taking these. Gluten removal was 2 months prior to starting these which in itself was a huge improvement, but these vitamins have me feeling energy that I haven’t felt in 10 years. I didn’t have to convince myself to clean out the closet..to prep meals for the week..or even to post this review. Everything was an EFFORT before these vitamins. So happy I gave them a try.
 Started taking this prodect after I had a thyroid test. I was out of range but not enough to be declared an issue. I noticed that I have more energy. I use to drink a lot more caffeine and some times the smallest things seemed a lot bigger.
 This is my first review . I can honestly say Thyroid Support Complex is great.  I just recently found out I have thyroid problem. Also I have been very tired and run down and also have anxiety. I started taking as directed.  Once in the morning and once at night.  Within 3 days I started to feel better.  I had more energy and anxiety level had decreased.  I would recommend and I just ordered another bottle.
 Currently on a weight loss journey. I lost 40 pounds on my own naturally. and couldn't lose any more weight on my own no matter what i did. I tried different exercises, fasting, calorie tracking. I tried it all, for some reason i just stopped being able to lose weight.. And I have about 20 ibs to go to get to my goal.<br/><br/>The scale stopped moving about 2 months ago, I started this supplement three weeks ago. Currently down 10 pounds. I'm back on track to continuing my weight loss.<br/><br/>Just bought my second bottle
 I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer and had a total thyroidectomy.  The prescription thyroid meds left me exhausted and I was having difficulty sleeping.  After one week of taking this supplement, I was sleeping 6-7.5 hours a night and had so much more energy.  I am still not a 100% but I am feeling about 50-60% better which is worth a lot.
 Tried for a month, couldn’t see feel any noticeable positive results. Might require continuous intake to reap benefits.<br/><br/>Updated review: Although the product did not work for me, I was given a full-refund even without requesting for it. The customer service at Zhou is top-notch and I will use the refund to try other products that they carry.
 I haven't finished a full bottle yet, but already 8 really like this product! Its one of 4 products I've tried from this company.  Great quality, consistency and customer service and engagement.
 I have always thought I'm low thyroid, my fingernails are rough as a washboard, I run the heat when most people run air conditioning, have no appetite, no energy, depressed, yeah I sound bad don't I-- they weren't a silver bullet for me - I took a Thyroid support many years ago that helped but just didn't notice anything here but I can't say they are bad either just didn't make me feel young again.
 My TSH level was up to a 10.43 with NO symptoms except a little bloating in the middle and I weigh 111 lbs .and work out with free weights and do cardio 6 days a week.  All other blood test were in the normal range.  My endocrinologist prescribed synthyroid to me and I lasted about 3 weeks on it.  Synthyroid spun me out of control with weight gain, sluggishness, constipation, mental fog &amp; I needed to sleep 10 hours a day.  I came off it and months later decided to try this product.  My TSH level is now a 7.64 and I just ordered another bottle
 Recently diagnosed with Hashimoto's thyroiditis disease, I was put on medicine but needed something to give support along with it. I only gave this 4 stars due to only using it for a week now, but so far so good. I have more energy and don't seem to crash during the day near as often. The pills are a little on the large side but still I have no problem swallowing them as its in capsule form. It does not upset my stomach if I take without food. Im so anxious to have been on them a little longer but for now I am pleased and will buy again.
 I was a little skeptical at first with this, but after taking it consistently for a week now I'm finding my energy levels way up!  In fact, I can't take it close to bedtime because it will keep me awake. I have been so sluggish lately that I had to try something and this is doing the trick.
 I love this supplement! I realized in the fall of 2015 that my thyroid function was impaired but, like many others, my doctor insisted it was within the normal range set by the lab. In fact the TSH has been above 3.5 for the last three years it has been tested. Years ago I stopped using iodized salt and never thought anything about it. Now I realize my thyroid function has been declining for years, probably related to the lack of iodine in my diet. I started using Thyroid Support with Iodine the day before Christmas and a month later my bloodwork showed a reduction of TSH from 3.66 to 3.43. The most amazing part what how I felt within days of starting the supplement. My brain fog cleared and I hadn't even realized I was suffering from it until the haze lifted. My periodic chills also stopped immediately and my energy level began to rise again. In addition to the improved TSH function, my cholesterol which had gone up went down about 50 points to my previous low level. In fact, all my bloodwork numbers improved significantly. My thinning hair doesn't seem to be improving but that may be a permanent change. Either way, I plan to continue taking Thyroid Support with Iodine as long as I need it, which will probably be the rest of my life. Thank you Zhou Nutrition for this excellent product!
 Great stuff! Great product! Must have this. I have noticed increased energy &amp; weight loss. I always say my metabolism is out of whack. This is my 2nd bottle and see the difference in just few days. It helps me to keep going all day. Busy work and busy life. I'm very satisfied &amp; I will continue to use. Thank you.
 So far so good, I’ve started taking this supplement after struggling for the past 5 years with Hashimotos. I’ve been on Synthroid, Levothyroxin and Armour never really getting my energy back. I’ve been taking this for 6 days and feel energetic and happy again. I’ve also lost 2lbs so far, not sure if that is a coincidence or not! I’m hoping to see continued results from this supplement😊
 Omg! I didn’t think this Suppliment would do anything.. boy was I wrong!!! In less than 30 days I have lost 6 lbs!! Easily! The best part is I have tapered off my  levothyroxine ! I can’t believe it!! I feel better, looks like I will be able to stop my medication, it’s a miracle!!!<br/>I’ll continue to use for 3 months and post an update . So far so great 👍👍
 I'be been using this product now for almost two months.  I've struggled with IBS now for 12 years.  Since starting Zhou's Thyroid Support my IBS has been obsolete!  It's amazing!  I even brought this product into my local wellness and nutrition store - which sells similar products.  The sales person said Zhou's Thyroid Support had everything their products had, except their products had a higher iodine content - and 25$ higher price tag.  Long story short, Zhou's Thyroid Support was equally as good.  I will continue using this product!  Thank you Zhou Nutrition.
 I’ve been taking this for a few weeks now and have noticed I have more energy throughout the day, less hair loss and I actually have some new hair growth coming back! It’s nice to have enough energy to work out again. The only downside I have found is that I need to take one in the morning and one at night. I tend to forget to take my evening one with dinner. I attempted taking both in the morning with breakfast and it upset my stomach. Otherwise I’m very pleased.
 Was diagnosed with thyroid disease and ive had a difficult time  losing weight. Dieting and exercising did nothing. Then I found these and I'm on my second month and I've lost nearly 40 pounds while dieting and exercising. These have helped a lot.
 I have PCOS and Thyroid issues on top of that which leave me moody, irritated, bloated, very little energy and unable to lose any weight. Ever since trying this product, I could feel my energy returning and my mood levels have started to level out. I am also not feeling as bloated and I can eat more than 1 meal a day without feeling nauseous. I can also feel a big difference when I accodentally skip a day because my energy levels drop significantly. I can finally get to big projects that I have put off because of my energy levels. Thanks so much for this product!
 These are the best!  I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism about 4 years ago.  After finally figuring out the right dosage of prescription meds, I was on them for over 3 years and never felt like they were helping me at all.  I slowly took myself off of them, felt a little better, then started experimenting with OTC support.  Nothing worked until I found these!  I feel 100% back to my old self - energy levels have gone back up, I no longer need to nap every day, I now sleep well and all thru the night, and my appetite is back to normal (not feeling like I'm starving all the time), which in turn has helped with weight loss that I thought I'd be stuck with for the rest of my life due to the hypothyroidism.  I'm SO happy with the results I get from these supplements!!  I'm on my third bottle.  I take one with each meal I eat.  I'm a HUGE fan!  Thank you Zhou Nutrition!!
 So far so good. I have only been taking these for a few weeks, so not sure how well they are doing yet. So far I am at least able to sleep at night which is big for me. Hopefully I will continue to see improvement in other areas.
 I have just started using this product, but I honestly feel like I have more energy and just don't feel as run down. I take levo 88mcg, and I don't notice any support from that .
 I have hypothyroidism. ...I am on levothyoxzine ....decided to try this and I must say after taking 2 capsules I felt a difference in my energy. I will update after I continue a week of taking it. Purchased it from Amazon....so far energy is up..but will update on other pros of taking .
 I purchased this product after reading other reviews and thought i would give it a try, crossing my fingers that it wasn't just another waste of my money. Thank goodness for me, this product works wonders on all levels of my health so far. I am a naturally anemic person and never feel like I ever get enough sleep and just feel sluggish all day. I started taking these supplements everyday with food about lunch time, and what a difference this has made on my overall well being. I have energy, don't feel sluggish and I can sustain focus throughout the day. I'm on my second order now, i hope they keep this product around. I love it.
 Omg!!! I wanted this to work for me soooo bad. It had so many great reviews i was so hopeful. It did nothing for me i felt nothing at all. The only thing i seemed to notice was increased appetite. Im so disappointed :(  Update... Anyone purchasing this i hope it works for you. But this company stands behind their products. I was offered a full refund. I appreciate that :) Ty so much
 For years I have struggled with low energy and fatigue. Even after cleaning up my diet, regular exercise, and anti depressants I was still always tired. After starting this supplement I noticed that I was less tired and able to get more done through out the day without having to take a nap. I’m really happy that I’ve finally found something that is helping me to love my life with more energy.
 The jury is still out on this one.  I do feel a little more energy and less depressed.  Ordered one more bottle to give it more of a chance.
 I'm giving this 3,but 5 stars only for the ingredients. I have hypothyroidism and this gives me a reverse effect of what it says it does. I have  chest pains and bloated feeling really bad. It seems to work for a lot of people just not me. I can't take these, good luck to everyone else. Again great ingredients!!!
 Day 3, I started when I got them Saturday.  Generally around 1pm I'm at work fighting falling asleep at my desk,  but not today,  I felt more alert and  not tired which was wonderful.  I hope it continues because I'm out of options, the levothyroxine I've  been taking for years really doesn't seem to help me feel normal.  Usually after work I could easily take a nap, but I don't feel like doing that right now. I'm excited to see if this is what I've been looking for,  I don't feel jittery or agitated at all either.
 I have been using the Thyroid Support for the last 2 weeks and I must say that I am seeing some favorable results.  I had Graves’ disease in my early 20s that I had to undertake radioactive iodine to “melt” my thyroid.  As a result, I have to take Thyroid medication for the rest of my life.  Since taking the supplement, My hair doesn’t fall out as much and I feel not as lethargic as before.  As for weight loss, I still have to see. Though I am optimistic that it would help me with continued use.
 I'm so excited to write this review!! I've only been taking this product for 2 weeks and can already feel a huge difference in my energy levels.  I was battling with bouts of depression, brain fog and fatigue.  Not to mention, weight gain and heavy menstrual cycles. I just finished my first normal cycle in years!! I didn't have the terrible cramps I normally have &amp; my cycle was not as heavy.  My pants are also fitting looser. I feel great! I'm ecstatic that I'm starting to feel like myself again! Highly recommend!!
 I am hypothyroid and need something to combat severe fatigue. The excitement of these supplements helping wore off rather quickly. When I take these supplements I do feel more awake but it has created severe nausea, heartburn and headache. Wish I could swnd them back.
 I've been taking these for three days now. I bought because of the reviews. I don't know if I have a thyroid issue or not but I had the symptoms. Always tired no matter how much sleep or caffeine I got. Since I've taken these I haven't felt tired and not ready to go to bed as soon as I get home. I have to make myself go to bed. I have more energy, no jitters at all. I'm pretty happy so far!
 This supplement is so awesome! I am a college sophomore and I caught my hypothryoidism early, and I’m so glad I did because my student career depended on it. I got to the point last semester that I didn’t even have the will to get up and do basic things in the morning (especially go to class). I already had struggles  with my weight long before college and my lack of focus/concentration became its worst once I came to uni. I took a chance on this product, and it has completely turned my life around!! I’m so grateful I found it, and I pray others with my symptoms seek help and are also led to try this supplement!
 I have had hypothyroidism for 38 years now and in the end had to have my thyroid removed. With no thyroid I will be on Prescription Snythroid the rest of my life so I look to any and all thyroid support I can. This product seems to help and looks like it has good things in it for thyroid support. Give it a try what do you have to lose?
 This supplement has been helping me greatly with appetite control and curbing my hunger pains. I have been trying to lose weight which was very difficult when I was constantly feeling not just hungry, but FAMISHED with incredible hunger pains that left me feeling borderline panicked with the severity. In as little as two hours after a meal I would become incapacitated with hunger, and so I started looking for something to help. I have had my thyroid tested and it is normal, but this supplement for whatever reason has helped significantly with helping me feel less famished between meals and I have finally been able to lose weight.
 Enen though this product did not achieve the goals it proclaimed to do for me, I would order again from this company ,they went out of their way to help my experience to be a better one for me. Thank you
 I'm glad I gave this product a try and will continue to use it.  I feel a noticeable difference, after a matter of weeks.  I read good things about Zhou supplimments and will be trying other supplimment from this company.
 This would be an amazing product. I wish I had known that the L- Tyrosine in it can cause anxiety. For me it gave me a huge boost of energy but I was an incessant chatterbox. I could not quiet my mind or sit to read and most importantly I could not sit to pray.<br/>So alas this is not for me but I do hope it works for you.
 Work great. Knows a different after 3 weeks of using
 I have been taking these for a few weeks now and they have made a big difference for me. It gives me so much energy! I take one pill twice daily. One in the morning. And one in the afternoon around 2-4 pm. Doing so, keeps my energy level high all day with little to no drop at all.
 I have been using this product for about two weeks now. I have noticed that my moods are improving. I do feel more stable through out the day and it does give a boost of energy. There is no crash from it as well. I love the fact that it is all natural. I can't wait to see the rest of the results.
 I feel better when I take it. My energy levels go way up and I just feel healthier. Before taking thyroid support I would get home from work and be exhausted now I have energy to go to the gym. I have not lost any weight from it but I'm in much better shape because I'm exercising and feel so much better!
 I eat low carb and had gained so much energy and felt so good by doing so, but then I got pregnant. 8 months postpartum I still wasn't functioning as before I got pregnant. Even after I stopped nursing, I was overall achy, cold all the time, and felt total brain fog. I was looking for a natural supplement to help because eating healthy and taking my usual supplements was not helping. I am so happy I found Thyroid support. I am feeling like my normal energetic self. My body felt like it went haywire after pregnancy and nothing else but Thyroid Support fixed it.
 My zinc levels were very low and  my thyroid uptake was below normal in my blood test.  I started taking the thyroid support along with my thyroid medication and 6 weeks later my tests were in the normal range!
 So far so good. Seem to have more energy, but still in first month using it.  I set up monthly shipment, as Im optimistic so far.  I'll update once Ive been on it longer than 1mo.
 This had done wonders for my husband! He is a truck driver who works long hours and has a hard time finding time to exercise. This has given him the boost that he has been needing as well as enhanced his mood and over daily energy. He has tried a lot of natural and dr prescribed things and this has so far worked the best!!!!
 I have had symptoms of thyroid dysfunction for years, but drs kept telling me my levels where in the normal range. Well low a couple months back they found my thyroid was riddled with nodules. Rather than waiting around months or years for drs to cut on me and do more nothing, I started researching, bought some thyroid support and a few other supplements and got on taking them right away.
 Is anyone else experiencing insomnia when taking these? I have been having a terrible time sleeping while taking these. I cut down to 1 a day and slept for maybe an hour and had the strangest dreams.<br/><br/>Update: The company reached out to me regarding my insomnia and refunded my purchase. I will absolutely consider this brand in the future because of this. Can’t wait to support them in the future. Thank you for understanding this product just may not be the right one for me. But may be for others. We could use more honest and responsive companies like yours in this world! Please support this company!
 First off, I was told by doctors I a thyroid problem then after getting an eav screening (highly recommend) the lady that it for me said I pretty much had a thyroid problem just not as excessive and I literally never been so happy to hear that just because of the fact I KNEW I had an issue and the docs said no so she also told to take this ... One what a difference!!!  Definitely helped with my energy I would always feel so tired by midday , but after using this I noticed huge difference I don't get so tired anymore and waking up feeling refreshed, before using this I would always wake up in the morning feeling like I was slow and hard for me to get out of bed. I would recommend this to anyone that has those thyriod symptoms.
 Either it's a great coincidence or this product really did help me lose weight and feel more energized. I don't feel anything very strong from it, which I actually like. So many supplements are pretty dangerous because they have strong ingredients in them and I think this is an overall great product to support overall nutritional balance. I received a bottle for free for this review and I think it's very important to follow what you feel your body is drawn to and realize that there is no quick fix, but this is a very safe product to support the thyroid gland.
 It doesn't work for me, I almost finished the whole bottle and still don't feel any changes. Also it makes me cough every time I swallowed it, and I never have any problem taking other pills. I wonder why it works for a lot of people.
 I purchased based on reviews about feeling better with energy and weight loss,  yes it did make me feel good, some nights it kept me up, so i figured out that I should take it early in the morning, but after 1 week, mind you I am on a fruit and veggie diet, I got on the scale this morning OCT 18, 2018, I gained 3 pounds, I was furious and sure enough I came back to look at the negatives reviews and alot of people mentioning weight gain.
 I took a chance on ordering this product since I was having all of the symptoms of low thyroid and my Dr.  Would do nothing to help with this.  I have been taking this for the last couple of months and I feel totally different.  My energy and stamina has increased and it seems to balance my appetite and other issues.  Definitely recommend this product to anyone struggling with thyroid issues.
 I purchased these for my wife. I'm just a couple weeks she has experienced increased energy, focus and a brighter outlook. They are natural and more healthy than the prescription alternative that she used to take. We will continue to use Zhou Nutrition for all our supplement needs. You have a customer for life.
 I've used Thyroid support for about a month now. It seems like it's helping. I don't suffer from foggy brain and my energy levels are a bit higher. I only say this because in the past month I started a new gym schedule that starts at 6am and I have a 2 year old that wakes up during the night. I can't wait to go through another month of using it and to really see how much more it helps me out. I say give it a try. You have to keep trying new things to see what works best for you.
 . I have had low energy levels for the last two years especially from an illness,  I do feel as though I have more energy now.  Because of the higher energy level I am starting to feel more positive about finishing projects.
 I was skeptical of all the great reviews. I've been taking these for 1.5 months. Though I didn't notice much of a change immediately, I certainly did over time.<br/>When I take them I notice increased energy, focus and a decrease in appetite, which is a positive thing for me.<br/>I will continue to stock these in my home.
 Made me feel tired &amp; weak... maybe just not for me.
 I take armour daily and while my numbers are getting back to optimal, I still didn’t feel better. I purchased this in hopes to help with the side effects. Best purchase I’ve made! My energy alone has been remarkable! I’ll definitelg be buying another bottle!<br/><br/>Edit to add: there was a promo for a free bottle and after I followed the steps, I got the bottle within 5 days! I was shocked. Awesome company. Awesome product.
 Thyroid support was not a good idea. I felt jumpy and could not sleep. Too many different ingredients in the mix. Not recommended by me.
 Although skeptical of its claims I have this product a try and have never had so much energy and also my mood is calm and motivated. I take two capsules every morning with my acv and I’m now off my serotonin medication. I recommend trying this product if you struggle with symptoms of thyroid issues
 I love this product! I have been hypothyroid for years and this is the first product to help me feel like my old self again. I only take one a day versus the recommended two, but it is working great! I take it in the morning with my thyroid meds and my vitamin d. I would highly recommend this, and I actually have, to others
 My wife and I have noticed increased energy since we began taking the product. I highly recommend it. My second order arrives tomorrow and I will continue to use it. We are in our 50's and now we are not running out of gas each night. I have to remind myself to go to sleep since I get up very early for work each day.
 I order this every two months, like clockwork. I notice it when I don’t have it— my body gets sluggish and tired. I started taking it because thyroid disorders run in my family, and I wanted to support mine just to stave off whatever genetic crap was aimed at my thyroid for as long as I can
 So far so good- day 3 I definitely notice the change in my energy level and mood (since day 1).  I started out only taking one which I'm glad because taking the 2 a day dose would be too strong/too much - I'm very sensitive to a lot of natural/herbal  supplements but have had no bad reactions with this product either
 The company guarantees this product or your money back.  Cant hurt to try it. Seems my thyroid wasn't a problem, and was refunded promptly. Will definitely try other products knowing they really do stand behind their products/
 I have a low functioning normal thyroid.<br/>I am always tired and lack focus. Since taking this product I have more energy and am mentally alert. It has also helped with my weight loss on my diet. I highly recommend it to anyone with thyroid problems
 I have tried many supplements and combinations.  Some worked better than others.  This supplement is the one that has worked the best for me.  I take it three times a day to stay functional until I can go to my doctor and get back on a regular treatment plan.<br/><br/>If your memory is fading and you feel dizzy or fatigued; if you have experienced weight gain and/or sleeplessness, then consider using these supplements and seeing a specialist.  They literally can make the difference between functioning and not functioning.
 I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism and in my search for more information about my condition found great reviews for this product.  At the suggestion of other reviewers I have been taking Thyroid Support in combination with Zhou's Vitamin K12 &amp; D3 Supplement.  I feel so much better and mentally less foggy.  My energy is improved and even my moods seem to level out.  I can for sure tell the difference when I have mossed a few days. Great product, definitely recommend.
 Only lost 2 pounds although while not working out. I am postpartum. Hope to lose more as I am beginning to work out again. Energy is through the roof!!! You can absolutely tell a before and after. On my second order!
 I was just diagnosed with hypothyroidism a few months ago and went to my doctor to get put on medicine. Long story short, my naturopathic doctor cousin told me to start taking thyroid supplements along with it. Together we went through a bunch of different brands on Amazon, but she did not like the ingredients and most products were loaded with fillers. We came across this one and it was exactly everything she was looking for in a thyroid support supplement on a doctor's standpoint. I started taking it a few months ago and it has made me feel great. I just bought another two bottles.
 I like it and I think it helps my overall well being.  I do not feel so tired on it.<br/>But I have had some severe stomach reflux with it shortly after taking.  I am on prednisone also and that maybe the culprit.  I have had to back down to one a day and then go off.  I'll wait until prednisone is at a lower level.  Hopefully then go back taking it.
 I have hypo active thyroid and have tried various supplements over the last several years.<br/>ThThis one has replaced them all.<br/> Overall I just feel better when taking this. As is the case with some of these things, when I run out or forget to take it is when I realize how much it actually does help.
 I've noticed a boost in energy, but also that I've had a headache every day since taking this supplement. Perhaps, my body doesn't agree with one ingredient or another, but I'll not be taking anymore.
 I'm loving this supplement! I decided to give this Thyroid Support a try after reading all the great reviews... I'm so glad I did!  It came super quick and I immediately started using it.. I'm going into my 3rd week using this now and my energy level has increase significantly, I'm sleeping through the night which hasn't happened in I don't know how long, and I've already lost 12 pounds!  I'm in love and will be a long time customer!
 After suffering with debilitating fatigue, body aches, icy hands and feet, dry skin patches, and inability to focus or maintain motivation due to thyroid issues- for 8+ years- I requested that my PCM order a panel of tests to check my thyroid function. After the blood draw I was told that they only tested my TSH which came back "completely normal" at 2.51. My dr did not feel that the other tests were necessary. I began researching supplements for thyroid support and found this product to be highly recommended with numerous glowing testimonials by others and decided to give it a try.<br/>I was AMAZED that it actually does work exactly as it claims.<br/>My hands and feet are now warm, I have my focus and energy back and I can wake up in the morning with NO pain, stiffness or fatigue for the first time in nearly a decade. I used to be unable to get out of bed on the weekends before 10-11am! now I'm up and ready for the day before the rest of my family!<br/>I also recommended this to a coworker who has also become a loyal customer.<br/>This product is worth every penny and I will continue to use it.
 I'm not one to usually leave reviews.  However, this stuff is amazing.  It has boosted my energy, and it also reduces my appetite.  I usually eat a small meal in the morning after my protein shake and then take this.  Then whala!  I'm not hungry for most of the day and I have sustained energy!
 Didnt work for me<br/> Hair still fell out. Didnt have any extra energy and NO weight loss
 I was skeptical to try this but I did and I am now convinced it works. I have no jitters and no ill feelings. I have followed the instructions exactly as they are on the label. Be sure you eat and drink water - it's very important. I have found myself having to snack every 2-3 hours after taking this product when combined with Energy + Focus supplements but I am awake and I need the food for energy, I suppose. I have not gained weight and have not experienced bladder irritation or stomach upset. I am taking this with the recommended Thyroid Support and Neuro Peak (when required). I volunteer in rescue and have to keep up with large and active dogs. This has helped me tremendously! I love the fact that I don't feel sick nor do I have to carry an energy drink or coffee with me any more. I highly recommend it. The only issue I might have later is that I may become immune to it. I tend to become immune to energy supplements and drinks. At this point, it's been 2+ months and I am doing well on it.
 Made my joints hurt not sure why but had to discontinue before I opened next bottle that I already paid for. Was really hoping it would help with energy which it seemed to until joint pain started. When I stopped taking it few days later joints were feeling normal. Gave an extra star for customer service being so good and giving me full refund. Thanks for understanding product doesn't work for everyone.
 Unbelievable customer service!
 Didn't notice a huge difference while taking this as I have with other thyroid supplements.  But everyone's bodies are different.  I do appreciate that the company gave me a refund since I wasn't satisfied.  That was very unexpected but helpful.
 Before taking Thyroid Support, I struggled with low energy and feeling sluggish every day. I also was going on months without a period. I noticed right away after taking this that I had more energy and motivation. Within a few weeks I even got my period again. I dont think I've ever taken a supplement that has helped me as much as Thyroid Support has. Thank you for making such a wonderful product!
 After taking prescription thyroid medicine for a year, I saw no results.  Blood work didn't change either.  So, I decided to add this to my daily routine.  I haven't seen any changes in weight but I do have more energy.  I'm only on the first bottle, but I'll continue taking it &amp; see what more time brings.  Great customer service too!
 At first I was a skeptic.  I take thyroid medicine anyway so in my head I was wondering if this would help with some of the issues I was dealing with.  So, last month I gave it a try.  My main focus was with memory...the "mental fog".  It is helping for example I would write myself notes now I will still write the notes but I can remember why and what I needed the notes for.
 I have used other thyroid supplements but this one by far is the best. I have felt my energy levels increase. There have been no unpleasant side effects at all. My skin and hair have improved as well as the brain fog I normally experience. I will continue using this product.
 This has definitely helped with my hot flashes. I took one month &amp; loved it. I stopped for a couple of weeks &amp; my hot flashes came back. I'm back on them &amp; hot flashes are 90% better.
 Since moving out of state I have had a hard time finding a doctor  that will give me my thyroid medicine. While in limbo I gave this a try and have been very happy with the results. I have the energy I need to get through the day, my achy joints feel better and my hair is growing in thicker. I will be re-ordering these and may not need a doctor after all!
 This product caused me to have extreme stomach cramps and diarrhea for 8 days. I really wanted this product to work for me because it seemed to help lots of other people. I went to request a refund and they want me to pay 5.99 to ship the product back, I shouldn't have to pay to return something that made me sick
 I’ve been taking this supplement for sometime now and have noticed it helping me with my hypothyroid issues.  The ingredient blend has all of what address the needs of my rebalancing my thyroid problems.
 Major increase in energy levels, but started getting strange heart palpitations.  I've tried a few similar brands and this one is the best for energy levels, but I seem to have an allergic reaction to one of the ingredients.  Took it for 2-3 months, and while on it, I stopped crashing after workouts and meals and my periods were normalized.  Wish I could have kept taking it.
 My husband is just finishing his first bottle.  His numbers have been normal, but his symptoms haven’t changed.  It took awhile into the bottle, but he walked in the other morning and said, “you know that stuff you’re making me take?  I am really starting to feel the difference.  Make sure you order more.”  He is a major sceptic, so this is huge praise.
 This product began  working from day 1.<br/>I have been deficient for the last 3 years and it has relieved my fatigue  and other symptoms within the first week of use. This is my second week of taking  Thyroid Support Complex.<br/>I love this product!
 I'm so glad I tried these. I had bad reactions from the meds from the doc and had to stop quickly. I wasn't about to try more meds, so when I found thyroid support complex,  I was very excited and couldn't wait to get started. Glad I did, I will be staying with this one for a long time!
 I read an article that talked about essential nutrients needed for healthy brain function. This product has lots of those nutrients like iodine, zinc, magnesium, selenium, and B12. I have started to take this about a month ago first thing in the morning on an empty stomach and have felt increased energy and mental clarity throughout the day.
 I was very excited to try this given the reviews. I was hoping for an energy boost and an increased drive since I've been sluggish and haven't found the motivation to get up and get things done the past couple months. I took this every day but saw no noticeable different in anything. Not in my energy, my sleep, my "fuzzy brian" or anything else.<br/><br/>I'm currently taking a sublingual dissolving B12 supplement (5000mcg, max strength) and so far that's helped more than anything else. My husband isn't sure it's working for him, but I can definitely tell I have increased energy and am able to stay motivated longer.
 I have night sweats/hot flashes. Also, since I'm disabled, I'm mostly sedentary, which has wreaked havoc on my metabolism, despite being in my early 40s. My thyroid always comes back "borderline" on my blood work as well. So when I read the awesome reviews on this product, I knew I had to give it a try!<br/><br/>I noticed no improvement on night sweats/hot flashes, but since that wasn't the primary reason I was trying it, I wasn't exactly disappointed. I can't really judge my metabolism, since I can't exercise or do normal things.<br/><br/>The one thing I can say is that my energy level is higher - I can focus longer than before. Also, my appetite almost immediately diminished. I'd say within 2-3 days, I wasn't as hungry during the day, especially the morning hours. This is a huge win in my book! When you're disabled, it's hard to control your eating, and with no exercise, it's a perfect playground for extra pounds to hang around. Having my appetite curbed has helped tremendously! I have started to lose a few pounds (I had about 30 to lose total), and I don't feel like my weight will be a constant battle as it has been since becoming disabled.<br/><br/>While I wish I could give a better overall review of all the fabulous things the pills have done for me, having my appetite curbed is a wonderful benefit. Everyone's body is different, so it may give more results to some and less results to others. For me, I will definitely continue to purchase these!
 I was hopeful with all the great reviews that this would help me with my hoshimotos symptoms, but unfortunately I had some of the same side effects as others. I had terrible headaches in the afternoon and was completely exhausted. I even had to leave the gym yesterday unable to finish my workout because I felt like garbage. Will not be taking this anymore.
 I am 3/4 of the way through my first bottle of Thyroid Support. I have a borderline under active thyroid. After two weeks, I could tell a difference. I have more energy, no afternoon naps, and am surprisingly more focused. Have not lost any weight yet but haven't gained any so I am very optimistic! I will purchase this product again and highly recommend it. I did try another similar product that I purchased on Amazon. I did not see the same results, in fact I was actually napping more. I believe in natural supplements and am looking forward to the continued good results I am experiencing with Thyroid Sypport and it is made in the USA!
 I have hypothyroidism, I started taking this about a couple of weeks ago. So far I have noticed my skin and hair is less dryer. This past week I weighed myself and lost 7lbs. I have taken many thyroid supplements and so far this is my favorite. I will be buying again!!
 I've used Zhou Nutrition for a variety of supplements for some time, but was ecstatic when I found they have a supplement to support my recently diagnosed hypothyroidism! After using this daily for about 6 weeks, I've seen a distinct improvement in my symptoms - namely increased energy, better sleep, and physical weight loss (I lift weights regularly so I rely on measurements rather than the scale.) I also have a very sensitive stomach and have had no adverse reactions to anything Zhou produces. Highly recommend!
 Before I bought this product I was experiencing a lot of fatigue and loss of energy. After reading the reviews, reading how people lost weight (which I thought wouldn’t be such a bad idea lol) and experienced an increase in their energy, I decided to buy it. I do not have a thyroid problem that I know of but i did decide to try it out. Unfortunately i did not experience and weight loss but my fatigue went away and I definitely had more energy. I did not notice any side effects either. Therefore, I would definitely suggest this product for those who have low energy and fatigue for no reason but do not get your hopes up if you’re tryinf to lose weight.
 I was diagnosed with an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism)  in April. My doctor said my levels were off only slightly. However, I wasn't feeling like myself and I was tired, depressed, gaining a lot of weight, very irritable etc. all the hypothyroidism symptoms. I went on the Internet to look for a natural solution. I have Zhou nutrition products a try and was not disappointed. I take one a day only because my levels were only slightly off. I have seen great results. My energy is back. I haven't had any mood changes since I started taking it. The weight gain stopped, but I haven't lost any weight. I'm aware I should start working out but at least I'm not gaining overnight anymore. I feel great. I will keep taking this.
 I am finishing my first bottle and can already tell a difference! I have more energy and sleep better at night. The capsules aren’t cumbersome to swallow like others I’ve tried. Happy customer!
 My TSH is always normal despite having hypothyroid symptoms. This stuff is amazing, I've been taking it for about 2 months energy level is up and feeling great.  Even my hair and nails are healthier.
 I take this along with armour thyroid. It supports this and my mood and overall feeling of well being and energy support.
 Couldn’t tell it did anything.<br/><br/>Update: After writing my review, I was contacted by the company and given a full refund for this product. Just to be clear, I don’t know that the product doesn’t work, it just didn’t work for me. However, due to the exceptional customer service, I’ll be exploring other products from this company.
 Definitly provided me with a boost in my energy and mood after a few days of use. I am almost finished with my first bottle and plan on reordering.
 Initially I took two pills at the same time with breakfast and had been for quite awhile until I saw a review where someone split the pills one in the morning and one at night which I do now.  I have never been diagnosed with thyroid issues but my mom has them and is on medication. I saw some of the same symptoms so I wanted to go a more natural route and see what happens. I have taken thyroid support for about 2 months consistently now-  I am far less tired and generally just feel better!
 Have been taking this for about 4 months now. Sleep better, no more night sweats, much happier disposition, and more energy. My high blood pressure is back down to normal, not sure if it's because of this pill but only change I have made so going to give it the credit. Have not lost weight  but that's ok I feel so much better.  Very satisfied and have recommended it to others
 Much like the other buyers who were suffering from fatigue and weight gain due to their thyroid. I too have noticed a HUGE difference since I started taking this supplement 2 months ago. It's a literal LIFE CHANGER!
 I do like that the pills are easy to take. I do find that I need to take with food as well as pretty early on in the day. I get a lot of every after taking the pills so taking it before bed is not an option. I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism and was looking for an over the counter method in treating it. I guess only time will tell if this is helping me with that diagnosis. Until then, I plan to continue taking it.
 Been on T4 only since 2010, low energy, daily naps, low body temp in mornings, low resting heart rate. After 1 month of Zhou thyroid support complex, better energy, no naps, higher morning body temp and higher resting heart rate, better results than gotten from Doctor.
 Product made me have insomnia and anxiety. After falling asleep I would wake up 2 hrs later and was unable to fall back to sleep. Tried taking it at a different time and still didnt have a good outcome. Was really hoping for positive results
 I hesitated about trying something for my thyroid always heard it was dangerous? But I have been tired for years no energy, always felt like a had a thyroid problem. So I figure why not give a try. Thank the Lord I did only been taking for a few days and I can tell a difference. I love it. Thank you thank you thank you.....scarlett
 I really enjoyed this product. The first bottle I felt amazing and my labs even looked better. But this second bottle I do not feel as if it is working as much. I'm tired about 3 hours  after I take it. I'm not sure if I would purchase a third bottle.
 I have thyroid problems and I'm talking thyroid meds. I take this faithfully every morning after a meal, and I feel a urge of energy. I like this and will purchase more when I get low.
 At first I got the jitters because I wasn’t use to it but now it’s great.  I take it everyday am focused and I dont get as tired. I wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone with thyroid disease.  The iodine helps the boosts my metabolism.
 Lots of energy I mean lots, I fill really good my apetite is under control, promotes restroom times better very happy I will continue buying them the improvement is fast
 I am finishing up my first bottle and absolutely love how it makes me feel. I definitely have more energy with taking it amd have noticed when I haven't taken it. I love the Zhou products so much! I also take some of their other products and love them just as much. Also, the customer service and response time is wonderful! Great company, great products. Thank you so much!!!
 Took it for a week and it actually made me feel sick, I was excited about all the benefits of this product! Customer service is absolutely wonderful, but the product just didn’t work for me! Hope it works for the people interested in buying it though.
 This might have worked for other people, but it gave me a massive migraine. It had me in bed for 2 days. Stopped taking it and my migraine disappeared. Will not order again.
 I started taking this thyroid support supplement because my body temp was always low 96-97 degrees fare height). My blood work always comes back showing my thyroid function in the low normal range. Our region is selenium deficient, so I found this product when looking for something with selenium and iodine.
 I have to say this is the first supplement that showed results. I have had thyroid issues for a long time and refuse to take pharmaceuticals. This supplement grew my eyebrows back, suppresed my hunger, and made me feel good. Try it!
 I started taking these supplements about 3 weeks ago and already noticed a difference. I'm not so tired in the afternoons and the brain fog is starting to go away. I've also noticed less hair loss in the shower. Will definitely continue to order more.
 I started working overnights on September 18th. I was working 8 and 9 hour shifts. I would drink 1-2 cups of coffee to help me get through the shifts. I began taking this supplement on Saturday, October 13, and I have not relied on coffee since. I highly recommend this product.
 So I have been taking this for sometime inconjunction with their DHEA and Test Booster they sell and I have noticed better sleep, less fatigue, less of an overall tired feeling. I work about 12 hours a day and work out after for about two hours (30 minutes cardio). I have not been diagnosed with a thyroid issue , just thought I would try it out and I'm enjoying it. Plus the price is great! If you are curious about it, just try it once and see if it makes a difference. You don't have to work or workout like I do to take this.
 The product delivered support.  The texture of the capsules were dry and sticky.  A little hard to swallow.  I didn't notice any appreciable boost, but I had no ill effects.  I decided that, for me, this product is ok, but not outstanding.
 I cannot recommend this enough! The most notable thing I've noticed: I have more energy throughout the day! Started using after reading "The Blood Type Diet" book.
 This product worked so well for me. I was more alert and focused. I definitely felt a difference when I ran out and stopped taking them for a while. Not doing that again!
 I love this product.  With health products you never know what you are going to get, but this has proven to be effective.  I recently went to my doctor for my annual thyroid test and the results came back that my medication needs to be reduced.  I am hoping we can completely eliminate the prescription but will work with the doctor to monitor my progress towards this goal.
 This did make a difference in my mood. I felt very calm and serene. It also helped a little w/ clearing up my mental fog. I didn't re-order it and I could tell the difference after not taking it, so I ordered more.
 saw no difference. i eat very healthy and go to the gym 4-5x per week and lift heavily. still lethargic, moody, etc. maybe it's all in my head but these just seem like placebo pills. disappointed :/<br/><br/>UPDATE: although this product didn't do the trick for me. Zhou nutrition was extremely nice enough to refund my $. this product may not be for everyone but they understand everyone is different. thanks for being a great company! (5 stars for customer support)
 These are amazing. I was diagnosed with hypothyroid in Jan 2017. I started drinking these around May2017 and changed my eating habits and lifestyle. I refused medication I had blood work done March 2018 and my levers went down from &gt;100.00 to 5.20. That’s a huge improvement and I feel great. I will be going again in a couple of months and see if I am at a normal range. Normal range on thyroid is 0.35-4.00 so I’m almost there! I strongly believe in these supplements!
 Since I started taking this I have experienced gas, bloating, dizziness, and other more personal and awful symptoms. It could be that my thyroid issues were not bad enough to warrant this level of supplementation. If you have a sensitive system you may want to be cautious.<br/><br/>**The company refunded my money immediately after I posted this and that's pretty classy so I have revised my review a bit.
 I didn’t do anything for me. I’m sorry but that’s the truth
 I had been feeling under the weather this week and decided that I needed to up my game, including getting some iodine in my diet again.  I started using the product only a few days ago, and am already feeling much stronger and more stable.
 Product arrived fast and was sealed upon arrival. This product caused severe GI upset, diarrhea, shortness of breath and fatigue. I have also had a headache for days but to be fair, I get migraines so I cannot blame that entirely on this product. Wish I would have done more research before buying this product.
 Absolutely love these! I have lost a few pounds with them, also they keep me going all day with my work and 2 kids and no jittery feeling and no side effects
 This is a great complementary therapy to support a worn out/tired/weak thyroid. I was taking droppers of iodine everyday and it tastes terrible. :-/ these capsules are easy to swallow and definitely work.<br/>I’m so glad we found these!
 Rollercoaster day. Thank goodness it's over. Soooo many positive review s here , not very many negative s. All of my symptoms came from all negatives. Took one pill instead of the two with food to be on the safe side(thank goodness). Made me happy go lucking for an hour or so then sick to my stomach, started feeling like my head was foggy and couldn't concentrate, then I got very tired and felt like a zombie.  I became very hungry and ate way more than I ever do in a day, then late afternoon got the worst headache! Will not reapeat.
 It seems to be working. I have been taking it for a month now and have noticed a difference. Company has wonderful customer service!!
 I recently hit a plateau and these guys helped kick start a second round of weight loss.  I think I've always had a somewhat irregular thyroid.  Borderline for most of my life,  but these have really helped in conjunction with lifestyle of course.
 I tried this supplement not expecting much of anything to happen..but...turns out I was wrong. I have tried many different supplements and nothing has done much for me. I tried this one and am seeing results. People started commenting on how I was losing weight but I didn't believe them because I have such difficulty  with losing weight. I weighed myself (which I rarely do...not wanting to be even more depressed) and I had lost over 20 pounds. I will continue to use this product and see what happens.
 I always wondered if there was a problem with my thyroid, even if it wasn't the extend of being a hypothyroid condition, I still felt I had a lot of the symptoms associated with it. I saw this and all of its great reviews and figured it'd be worth a shot to try something. I've noticed since taking this I've been sleeping better and waking up with a lot more energy than normal, and having that energy last throughout the day, as well as being in a better mood. I even lost a few pounds! Definitely want to continue and see if these results continue.
 I have had thyroid problems for years but my doctor has never prescribed medicine.  Recently, I had a can't get enough to eat problem along with weight gain.  I tried every thing to suppress my appetite but, nothing worked.  I have been using this product one week now and the hunger war is over. I truly recommend Thyroid Support with Iodine if you do not get enough iodine in your food and want to suppress your appetite.<br/><a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Thyroid-Support-Complex-With-Iodine-to-Improve-Energy-Help-Lose-Weight-Natural-Supplement-to-Increase-Concentration-Boost-Metabolism-Reduce-Brain-Fog-Feel-Like-Your-Old-Self-Again-Guarantee/dp/B00S8PW6P6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Thyroid Support Complex With Iodine to Improve Energy &amp; Help Lose Weight - Natural Supplement to Increase Concentration, Boost Metabolism &amp; Reduce Brain Fog - 'Feel-Like-Your-Old-Self-Again' Guarantee</a>
 My doctors have wanted to put me on medicine for thyroid I have refused because my levels are just there. And the medicine is for life. This complex keeps things going smooth for me and so far the doctor is happy my levels have not changed.
 I had radiation done on my thyroid gland in 2009 so of course was told I have to synthroid or levothyroxine for the rest of my life. After changing many doses of medications my tsh was in normal range for a while until March of 2015. I went from being very active, upbeat, on the go football mom to a very tired fatigue person, not to mention the 20 lbs I gained in little over a month. And my tsh skyrocket to 4.89. My Endocrinologist keep changing my dosage but I can feel no change. I decide to do my own research and bought a thyroid support from Amazon which did nothing help. In November my tsh spike to 9.96. I came on Amazon typed in thyroid support and Thyroid Support from Zhou Nutrition popped up. I read the reviews and decided to make a purchase. That was the best decision I have ever made. My doctor state was OK to take with my synthroid I felt better. My energy came back, when I wake up in the morning I jump out of bed, I was able to take my son to his football practices. Keep in mind I have been taking this for less than one month. I started to loose weight. My tsh went from 9.96 to 1.59. I purchase another and planning to take this only and not the synthroid. BEST I have ever felt in almost one year and it's thanks to this product.  Anyone with hypothyroid I strongly recommend.
 THis has helped regulate my tempature and also given me more energy. I’ve had thyroid problems for years and this has been a great way for me to get a better grip on it.
 I have been taking this for a month and have noticed a slight difference in my ability to focus. I have not noticed a difference in metabolism or energy though and hope with continued use I will start to see some improvement in those areas as well as more improvement with focusing. I have had no negative side effects which is a huge plus!!
 I was very skeptical purchasing this product as I have not had much luck feeling normal since my thyroid was removed. This product gives me so much energy but doesn’t make me feel like my heart is racing!! I am starting to feel more normal. I can definitely tell a difference when I have not taken my Thyroid Support.
 It didn't work for me, but everybody is different. Also, you will not find a better customer service. The gave me a full refund!  I am using other Zhou Nation products and they work great. I will still remain a loyal customer.
 Took the whole bottle and did the correct regiment and had NO results. However cravings were just a bit less hence why I gave it the extra star.
 I just received this product over a month ago and it seems to be doing a great job at helping me stay mentally focused and giving me energy.<br/>I also just started a exercise program where I’m just starting to lose weight. I’ve been using Zhou Nutrition products for the past three years and they are all excellent products. I am very happy with Thyroid support.
 It works for me and I love taking them. It really helps me so I dont have to take meds from the doctors.
 Since using this product my nails have stopped spliting and have grown longer for the first time in years.
 Energy energy energy!!<br/>Focus and my gym workouts are less of a chore thanks to 2 pills at breakfast!!
 Have been taking for about 2 weeks so far. Always unsure about supplements, but tried this one after reading many reviews on different brands. This one seemed to have many positives. So far I definitely feel better since taking it - just seem to have more energy and less hungry, so very pleased so far.
 It didn’t work for me :/ but it did help curb some of my appetite and give me more energy!
 I had been having issues with many things related to minor hypothyroidism. This includes the mental fog that would hit me multiple times a day, problems with lower body temperature, dry skin, lifeless hair, and SEVERE aches and muscle pains. I knew I needed to do something other than just changing my diet which had helped slightly but not enough.<br/><br/>I researched and found that iodine and kelp were especially great for helping this &amp; set off on my search. I came across this lifesaver and after looking at all ingredients decided to order.<br/><br/>Boy am I so glad I did! In a little under two weeks I started having wonderful improvements!! Less mental fog and fatigue along with a significant change in my dry patchy skin. Still not through my first bottle but even with these changes I would buy again 100% and I will be ordering more shortly so I don't run out. This product is wonderful!
 I guess it's working, to some extent. I do sleep better. I no longer wake up in the middle of the night. I no longer feel the need to take naps. I don't seem to be more focused. It's only been a little under 2 weeks so I'll keep an open mind.
 I have been taking these for 2 months now and i feel GREAT!!! Tons of energy and i feel strong. I'm ordering my 3rd bottle right now.
 Caused raised blood pressure, anxiety and the worst was kidney pain mid-day after taking this product in the morning. I don’t take any other supplements/vitamins/medication. I won’t continue this brand. Switching to pure brand :)
 I have been using this product for a month now. I have fully finished one bottle and I do not notice a difference at all. I don't notice a difference with how I feel, and I have not lost any weight from it. Maybe you have to be on this product for longer than 1 month. I will buy another bottle and try this product for at least 3 months before I totally give up on it. But for now, after 1 bottle, I do not notice any difference with anything-weight, energy, nothing.
 Didn't notice anything after the entire bottle. I was still exhausted and dragged in the afternoon every day.
 Helps tremendously with that 2 pm crash! I've suffered with thyroid problems for 13 years. I am constantly tired or sluggish and achy. I work 12 hour shifts and by 2 pm I'm looking for caffeine which never truly helps! After a week on the Thyroid Support I could tell a huge difference- my head was clear and I didn't have that crash. So far I'm loving this!
 I’d been taking multiple supplements per my naturopath for my inactive thyroid when I came upon this product. Since I’ve been taking it, I have increased energy and have had an easier time losing weight. On the days I forget to take it, I can immediately feel it. Love this supplement.
 I got some unexpected results from using this product. I was having trouble with frequent urination and waking up in the middle of the night to urinate. Since taking this product, those issues have been relieved. I will continue to use this product and highly recommend it.
 This is the ONLY multivitamin I've found that I can take with my levothyroxine. Everything else has calcium and iron, which can't be taken within four hours of that medication. I can't say I'm super energetic, but I feel the best I've felt since my thyroidectomy.
 While I haven't lost any weight yet with this product, I have experienced a dramatic increase of energy. Before purchasing this product, I felt my energy quickly leaking throughout the day and by the time noon rolled around I was so fatigued I felt like I was swimming through a fog for the rest of the day. I have not tried any other thyroid supplements other than this one, so this review may be lacking in that respect. However, if you are like myself and have issues maintaining your stamina during the day, this product is definitely for you!
 This product is awesome! I waited 30 days to do this review. I used to be very tired (morning, afternoon and night), and I've noticed a complete 180 in my energy level and concentration. I wake up easily in the morning, afternoons are a breeze, and even nights I have much more energy. I didn't notice a immediate difference like some people said, but within 2 weeks the results were amazing. I've also noticed my mood has changed because of the energy I now have, which is great.
 I'm in my second bottle. This is the only thyroid support supplement that has given me any noticeable difference.  I feel so alert and focused and I sleep so well!  I ran out for about a week and felt like my old sluggish self again. I will never be without this again.  Just give it a try.  Even if nothing else has worked for you.
 Helped me almost immediately with GI issues. I noticed after a couple of weeks irritability and pain in my chest. I quit taking it and had some anxiety issues after a few days. I just took it again today after not taking it for a couple of weeks and the pain in my chest is back??? Not sure what is causing the chest pain and anxiety???
 I'm just about finished with my first bottle of Thyroid Support. I have noticed and increase in energy and an improvement in my mood.  I am 4.5 months post partum and have been painfully fatigued. I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism years ago, so chronic fatigue and lack of energy are unfortunately normal for me. BUT I'm very happy to say that I do feel an improvement and I will continue to use this product. In conjunction with the Thyroid Support, I've been taking evening primrose oil which also helps to balance hormones.
 Gave me more energy! I was surprised by how well this worked. It didn't make me jittery like caffeine does, but it boosted my energy enough to keep up in a very busy clinic.
 So far so good. I have not had my usual hypothyroid fatigue!! I had my doubts about this product but thought I would give it a try. It’s been a few weeks now and I don’t have the almost crippling fatigue from being hypothyroid. I take levothroxine, but would still have days where I am exhausted. I track my fatigue days and none since I started this stuff. This supplement has been amazing this far. I will update the review when I finish the bottle. I would recommend others dealing with hypothyroid fatigue/low energy to give it a try.
 My numbers have never been in range to be put on thyroid meds but I have suffered from all of the symptoms of thyroid issues.  I have tried a few thyroid supplements and this one is fantastic!  This is the first supplement that helps me to have even, all day energy and I feel like some of my brain fog has lifted!
 I love this product, since I started taking this I have lost weight. I was never diagnosed with a thyroid problem due to test not showing a problem, but knew something was not quite right and I had many of the symptoms. If you are doing the work this will help it show. I have lost 11 lbs after 2 bottles .... plus regulates my mood
 I don't think my hair is falling out as much, now. Not sure about enhanced metabolism, though. I just slept like, all day today.
 Finally, relief from thyroid symptoms. I fall asleep easier, I find it helps me feel better, think clearly,heck
 I experienced lethargy and a bit of the blues after trying this item for about a week - definitely returning.
 I always thought I had a low functioning  thyroid but the problem was never detected. I exercise a lot daily, and when i'm taking these I loose weight.  the minute I stop taking them althoigh I continue to work out vigorously I stop loosing weight even gain a pound or rwo! This is obviously a great supplement
 I've been taking for two weeks. I haven't noticed anything different in the way I feel so far. Will use for the full month and see if it helps. Was hoping it would help with my energy level.
 I’ve been prescribed Synthroid for 8 years and have never been satisfied. Even when the doctors say the “numbers” were within normal range, I always felt exhausted and sluggish. I read an article about Thyroid Support and decided to try it. WOW! Within a week, I was sleeping better and had more energy and mental clarity. Great product!
 I was on Synthroid and having horrible side effects. I stopped taking that and  bought a bottle of this on Amazon. The difference was amazing. I felt so much better on these pills. My energy level  increased.  I feel so much better.
 I wish I could give more stars, but I have been using this product for a month and all the things it says that supposed to happen, or the other reviews say, did not occur to me.  Quite unfortunate.  I eat wright, excersize, and yet not 1 lb lost on this product.
 Took these daily from the day box arrived. I have seen no changes or improvements at all. In my opinion, they are a waste of money.
 This made me feel really wonky and gave me heartburn.  Some of the ingredients are listed as possibly dangerous on WebMD.  I won't be finishing the bottle.
 not sure if I would buy again.  I feel like I get more hungry now then before I took it.  But that could be my metabolism amping up.  So once done I will probably take a month off and see
 Energy it definitely gave me but that came with racing heart and anxiety.  I was taking this product for 3 weeks and in those 3 weeks of my normal routine of eating clean and working out I was steadily gaining weight. Along with it threw my menstrual cycle out of whack.
 I have an under active thyroid issue. So I’m always tired, can’t concetrate and retain water. This supplement has helped me focus better I don’t wake up tired I’m more energized don’t retain water. I did stop a few days to see if it really works and i felt sluggish and out of it. You can definelty tell the difference.  I’ve tried other supplements but this one has been the best so far.
 Good thyroid support! I didn’t want to go on meds, this product has worked for me.  I have more energy and a good outlook.  Also my appetite is under control!!!!
 I love this product. It has definitely helped with my brain fog and even curbs my appetite a little. I have only been using this for a few weeks, and already notice a difference.  As a busy woman, working sometimes 12 hour days - this helps my energy like nothing I've taken before. I will most likely continue to take this!
 Not sure what rating to give this. I took it for 2 weeks I had so much diarrhea I lost weight, but I was so scared to go out since stomach pain will occur randomly and with such intense that I would almost cry. Idk if I will cry from the pain or because I didn’t know where to run to the bathroom.<br/>I will try again and update .
 Took only one bottle and people started telling me I was losing weight. I loved the way I felt when I was taking these. Just bought my 2nd bottle and will continue taking these
 Originally I had this product rated as one star because it did not work for me. But after receiving a full refund and a message from Alex the CEO I decided to rate it higher. I did not reach out or try to get a refund the company cares about their customers and did that on their own. While the product did not work for me and I was disappointed, hopefully it works for others. Thank you for being a stand up company!
 I love this product! After about a month and a half of taking it I have lost approx. 7 lbs, no longer needing or dependent of caffeine, and feel happier and in a better mood all the time. It's absolutely worth every penny.
 Definitely saw improvement in concentration and energy level without the feeling of jitters you feel with caffeine. With the increase in energy level also came a reduction of the constant state of fatigue I tended to feel. I even started losing a few lbs., which is wonderful!
 This is my 2nd bottle and I'm very impressed. The doctors kept saying all of my symptoms (always cold, exhausted, blurry vision, headaches, and weight gain) pointed to a problem with my thyroid, but my blood work was still within the normal range. The PA at my hematologist office suggested that since my anemia was no longer an issue I consider some natural alternatives. I had just ordered my 1st bottle and showed her the label. She said it has everything she would recommend and most importantly was made in the USA. After only 3 days it felt like a fog was being lifted. I'm not up to going back to the gym yet, but definitely on my way. The PA said it could take 6 weeks or more to correct some of my issues and I should just keep taking the supplements. I really am impressed and have recommended this supplement to my family and friends.
 I really was excited to try this however it gave me MAJOR headaches. As a woman who has Hashimotos and Hypothryoid, I was hoping for some help.  Instead I suffered from Migraine headaches.  Just didn’t work for me
 I started using this because of various symptoms I was experiencing that are assocaiated with thyroid issues. hair loss, lethargy, trouble losing weight, swollen neck. My symptoms have vastly improved. I was also on a birth control that I stopped taking around the same time, so I am sure its a combination of both that have helped alleviate these symptoms. I will note, though, within a couple days of taking this I was working on my feet and noticed I was able to stay focused and leave work with energy. Around the 2 hour mark, when I normally would be exhausted, I checked in a still had energy. 5 hours later I finished what I needed to do and went home with some energy still left! That's the experience that hooked me. Unless I begin to see adverse effects (i havent), there's no reason in my mind to stop.
 I'm cautiously optimistic. Most supplements may be good for me, but I don't really feel a difference. With this one I do seem to have more energy and feel better overall. I'm going to keep taking it for a few months and see how things go. Definitely worth trying!
 I absolutely love this product. I live a extremely busy and highly stressful life. I am a special education teacher with a large caseload and then a single mom of three active boys who are in lots of activities and one of my son's also has Asberger's Syndrome. I was feeling extremely drained and moody, you could say at my wit's end, willing to try anything to give me my energy back. I bought my first bottle of this three months ago and I was so thrilled with the results that I now have it on auto order. I have energy again and I am able to make it through my day and evening less moody and exhausted.
 Excellent product and customer support. I have been on Naturethroid for 7 years. Supplementing with this really made a difference in brain fog, energy etc. will purchase again!
 I normally don't write reviews but felt like I had to for this product. I'm going to be 48 soon and prior to taking this product I was gaining weight,  feeling lethargic and my moods were eratic. I got to say that after a few weeks of taking this product my energy level increased, I lost a few pounds and my moods are regulating. I an in process of ordering this product again!
 I've been taking them for 2 weeks now, so not sure it of the impact yet, but I do feel like I have more sustained energy through the day. I took it to my nutritional and she was happy with the ingredients. I have a large growth (5.3 cm) on my thyroid that I have to have removed, so I am taking these to help my body get  extra nutrition  before I have the operation.
 I'm not on thyroid medication, but I have hashimotos thyroiditits and all the symptoms that come with it. I love taking this knowing I'm nourishing my thyroid. I feel good, it doesn't have a nasty taste to it like another one I've tried. This will definitely be a mainstay in my medicine cabinet!
 I took these hoping they would help with my thyroid nodules but they ended up affecting my sleep and causing insomnia for four nights in a row. As soon as I stopped I was back to sleeping better.
 I have several autoimmune diseases that zap me of my energy. I have been researching different vitamins and minerals to help with my Hashimotos and came across this thyroid support. I have been using it for a little ove a month now and can definitely see an improvment.<br/>My overall energy is better. I don’t feel so lethargic anymore. I am very thankful for this product.
 I ordered this based on the reviews after searching through a ton of products.<br/>Taking this thyroid support did make me feel more energy through the day. It also helped me lose a little weight.<br/>I did stop taking them for a week due to having to start an antibiotic. I have started the support again and I can definitely tell a difference when I use it.<br/>I will definitely be ordering it again!
 This product works wonders along with my prescribed meds! I am happy I took a chance. I am finishing up my 1st bottle and I a second order in transit now. This is the missing "puzzle piece" to my daily regimen...
 I have a condition that makes my thyroid fluctuate from extreme hyper to extreme hypothyroidism, so it has been difficult to manage on thyroid replacement therapy. My doctor was changing my dose constantly trying to balance my thyroid. I started Zhou thyroid formula along with the dose of thyroid replacement that made me feel the best (Temp, energy, skin, hair, etc) over a year ago. I have finally found balance. All my labs have been normal and I feel so much better.
 Bought it for a non-Amazon user. He likes the stuff.
 I love this product. I take it everyday with my prescription thyroid medication and it has made a noticeable difference in how I feel. I am no longer tired all the time. I now actually have a lot of energy. I am thankful that I have found this product.
 Love this product! Have used it over the last 45 days and have noticed a significant different in my energy level, appetite and overall health. Even lost some weight...I would definitely recommend trying it out!
 I am so glad that I decided to try this. I see a huge difference in my everyday self and my energy levels when I take this in the morning.
 I don't think this is a bad product. Maybe from other ppls reviews I was hoping it would be a miracle also. I've almost finished the bottle so almost been on this a month. I'm noticing a difference but not quite miraculous. BUT I'm a lot less tired, I lost 10 pounds in 2 weeks (not sure if its a combo of this supplement and diet and excersize), it helped my depression a little but didn't get rid of it. Not sure about focusing, I have a hard time w focusing and paying attention especially at my job where I need it. I ordered another bottle and see if I take this longer if I get better results, but I'm definitely going to try the energy and focus suppliments from Zhou next. I'll note I'm not aware I have thyroid issues persay but I do suffer from fatigue, poor metabolism, depression, and not able to pay attention well so why I'm giving these a try. So hoping taking these longer will give me more results.
 I didn't notice any difference whatsoever.  Was hoping it would help my energy levels. Maybe I just don't have a thyroid problem.
 I have been suffering with brain fog and chronic fatigue from hypothyroidism for about 16 years. I  am taking synthroid but I still had symptoms until I tried Zhou Thyroid Support. It has worked wonders for me. I'm starting to feel normal again. I felt an increase in energy on the first day. Plus, my mood swings have decreased dramatically. I have spent so much money on supplements trying to find something to help me. This product works and it is affordable.
 I am very happy with this supplement. I have autoimmune disease and I suspect I am also on the verge of menopause so energy and hormone support are very important to me! I started taking these, 1 a day and did notice a change in my energy levels, but I REALLY noticed when I ran out of the pills how much they were actually helping. For me, it was a subtle improvement which is good in my opinion, I don't want to bounce off the walls! I will definitely these in stock!
 You can't take this if you are diagnosis with a thyroid disease.
 I have taken thyroid medication for years and still I felt tired all the time.  I took one bottle of this and started feeling more perky!  I am never be without?!
 I have been taking this for a week now and I do feel it is working I seem to have more energy throughout the day to where I would run out of steam midway through. So far so good! Started out taking two at a time may try 1 daily instead to make them last longer. I don't have thyroid issues that I am aware of but would like to keep it healthy so I feel the supplement will do just that.
 I was willing to try anything to finally lose weight and stop being so anxious. I was doing everything right! I had 2 kids in 2 years and someone told me my thyroid is probably out of whack. However I didn’t want medicine. THIS STUFF HAS BEEN A LIFESAVER! I’ve finished one bottle and my husband knows when I forgot my dose that day bc my mood is off! So thankful for this product!
 I have noticed a big difference in my energy level and all in all how I feel. Love this product!!! I also take the Calm Now and they compliment each other.
 I noticed such a difference while taking this.  It really works!  If you're looking for something to combat anxiety and stress I would definitely recommend.
 I have been taking this for about a month and I'm feeling so much better.  I sleep better, wake up a bit more refreshed, have less hair loss, more energy, clear skin.  I will definitely keep taking this and seeing what kind of readings I get on my blood tests in June when I see my doctor.
 I did not notice a difference when using this. Of course this does not mean the product does not work. Everyone's body is different. Try it for yourself and see.
 There's not enough iodine.  You can get 150 mcg of iodine in a vitamin pill.
 I got these for my mother when she started getting a bulge on the side of her neck.  She had part of her thyroid removed in the 60's and never received medication.  This supplement has been heaven sent for her.  Not only did the bulge disappear, but she says she feels better than she has in years!
 I have been nursing my son for 2 years, on his second birthday I had been weening him for 6 months. I knew my hormones would be out of sorts but not as bad as they where, It was taking longer and I felt really out of sorts. Through my whole time breastfeeding I never lost my pregnancy weight, now I am losing weight it is coming of slow but I am okay with that, and I feel better. It has only been 2 1/2 months but over time I will be myself. My goal is a year and cut back to 1 suppliments to see if my body will take over...
 So far it seems helpful!  While I haven't lost any weight, I don't feel as sluggish and feel more focused.  I've only been taking it for a couple of weeks, so hope to keep up the benefits that I have already experienced.
 A great product to stimulate healthy thyroid function. My values are within normal limits, but close enough to the high end that my endo put me on levothyroxine for a few months. I did not appreciate any benefit form the medication so I got off it. I continued to feel a bit run down so I added Thyroid Support Complex to my daily supplement regimen and I feel great!
 I am almost done with my first bottle and noticed a difference. The most significant difference is my mood and concentration. With my mood being better I can function through the day and get more done. I don’t have a thyroid due to cancer and this has helped me regain myself!
 I truly needed a boost to my thyroid medication and this product was just the thing.  I have found to have much more energy through out my day and sleep much better at night now that I have been taking Thyroid Support.
 I have not drink this for to long but definitely notice I different in my body all kip trying them and see what happens
 Not worth the money. But the liquid nascent iodine. You will have much better results!
 It has given me a big energy boost. Now I added exercise and a healthy diet. But I have completely stopped my coffee intake and still feel like I have more energy all day long.
 I am absolutely amazed by Zhou Nutrition. They have excellent variety of products, great quality and amazing customer service, so when I was looking for Thyroid support capsules, I knew where to look. I was not disappointed.
 I have had a problem with my thyroid for the last 20 years. My doctor would not give me the medication because my blood work came back in the normal range even though I had family history and all the symptoms to support having a underactive thyroid. I have used this product for 4 days now and I feel great. I am actually planning things in my life again knowing that I can accomplish them now. I'm looking forward to the future thanks to this product.
 I don't notice any difference it seems to make me sick. I changed my rating thanks to the great customer service. This may work for you it just made me sick but I am very sensitive to meds.
 no noticeable affect, will not purchase again.  Company gave me a full refund.  Good company with which to work, they stand behind their guarantee.  Not too many companies do that anymore.  Thank you Zhou Nutrition.
 This made my brain fog worse and also caused terrible headaches. I even decreased the recommended dosage and still had headache.<br/>However, I give customer service ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️!! I didn’t ask for a refund, but was offered one after reviewing the product. I have no doubt this company is trying to help their customers feel better!!
 I love this supplement! I have hoshimotos and had my thyroid removed 18 months ago. My levels have been all over the place since and my energy level was bottomed out....but since I began taking this thyroid support I feel like I'm getting my life back! And the price is ever so reasonable! Don't hesitate just try it!
 I cannot believe how much better I feel. I have my energy and my life back. Seller contacted me by email just to make sure all was well with the product.
 I couldn’t really tell a difference. I hoped this would boost my energy and curb my appetite but sadly it didn’t. But supplements work different for everyone.
 My second time buying the product.  In fact my friend of years commented on how long my nails are.  My hubby. Had to help me comb my hair, because I was sick and my hair is so thick, long.  After two weeks you will notice a difference in hair and nails After a few days you will notice your energy level increase.  I took two right before breakfast daily.  I am totally impressed!  Worth every penny!!
 I've seen quite the difference in my energy since taking this product. 5 stars
 On my second bottle of the Zhou Nutrition of Thyroid Support and I have to say...I feel better than I have in months. It wasn't a dramatic change for me but I'd say three weeks into taking it two a day I sleep better and I just feel more alive.Thanks Zhou Nutrition!
 It took about 2 weeks to really feel the effects but I love this product! I work 10 hour shifts and I would get 3/4 through the day and start nodding off but now I can make it through the day and still have enough energy to start working out again! I don't get hungry as often and it's helped me lose weight. I will definitely keep ordering these.
 I have been battling overwhelming fatigue for 7 months.  I am a very healthy 35 year old female.  I have had 4 thyroid tests run with inconsistent results, so I am not being treated for low thyroid.  This supplement makes a VERY noticeable difference in the fatigue and seems to become more effective the longer I am on it.
 I gave it 3 stars because it might work for others but I just can’t get past the major migraines the product gives me. I tried it for 3 days (1 pill a day) and in those 3 days there was a constant dull pain that shot through my head as well as dizziness.
 It seems to be helping me sleep better, and have more energy when I'm awake. I've read about and tried many, many vitamins/supplements, to the point at one time I was taking a handful of pills 2x a day - and nothing was helping. I stopped<br/>everything altogether months ago and noticed no difference. I happened upon this and thought I would try just one more thing - and it's awesome!  Will be ordering more soon!
 after reading all the reviews i had truly hoped this would work.  i guess it did a little too well.  each time i took this i suffered severe insomnia.  i am glad i can return it.
 Not noticing much of anything 1 month in. Perhaps I need to take for longer, perhaps I got a bad batch, perhaps an underactive thyroid is not my problem, though it runs in my family.
 I was on a thyroid medicine and had to drop out because of lack of insurance. So I searched and found your product. I love it. It does what ever the med was doing.
 For 45 years I have had an under active thyroid. Had been on the standard prescription for years.  For the last 19 years I have had it made for my thyroid deficiencies. Since taking Thyroid Support Complex by Zhou Nutrition, my doctor has lowered the strength of my prescription twice!  Looking forward to my next checkup.
 Since taking Thyroid Support Complex With Iodine, I have been feeling better. I do not feel so tired throughout the day and I am sleeping better at night. Overall, much more energy. I have not noticed any weight loss though. But I have only being taking this product for 2 weeks now. That may be something that comes over time. I would definitely purchase this product again.
 I have been using these supplements for the past month and I must say that I have noticed a significant improvement in my mood, focus and overall functionality. My appetite has decreased tremendously! I didn't believe the hype at first and thought it would take quite a while to kick in, but the results were almost immediate for me. l will be stocking up on these in the future.
 This works great and I have seen such a difference since I have been taking them. I was experiencing brain fog and I always felt fatigue but after I started taking this product both of these symptoms cleared up. My energy level increased and I could actually think with out it feeling foggy. I would highly recommend this product to everyone.
 The taste is so off-putting and they didn’t seem to help me much. Maybe slightly more energy, but nothing very noticeable.
 I have been using this product for about three weeks and I have noticed a difference in my energy level. I have tried many different thyroid supplements in the past, and this has been the o my one that I actually noticed a difference right away.
 I liked the fact that the day after I took the first 2 pills that I felt so much better.  I was not sluggish and feeling like I had to go to sleep.  ALL DAY
 I have used this product consistently for a couple months after having tried other products prior. I have low level hypothyroidism and wanted to seek out a natural remedy before beginning a medication management regimen. I have finally reached a great deal of balance both mentally and physically with taking Zhou Thyroid Support and also subscribing to a healthy thyroid diet.<br/><br/>Before beginning this product I had many symptoms such as constantly being cold, emotional disregulation, tiredness, poor sleep, thinning hair, slow heart rate and weight gain. All the women in my family have thyroid issues, so when I was taking a nap midday while wearing a sweater in the beginning of June while on a family vacation in San Diego, they brought the suggestion to have some testing done for hypothyroidism to my attention. After getting my results back my doctor and I sat down and decided to try a natural route... and here I am!<br/><br/>Today I am healthy, awake, clear headed, able bodied and happier. I appreciate this brand's commitment to quality and highly suggest anyone in need of thyroid support to check this brand out AS WELL AS begin a thyroid healthy diet (lose the gluten and dairy). Worked for me!
 Just finished my first bottle and I love how much energy I got. Also, an added bonus is I lost 10lbs in the month I was taking it. About to purchase another bottle!!
 Seems to help. I'm 6 mo post partum and I've been taking it about a month. Seems to help lift the fog a bit.
 Has more iodine, copper and selenium than other products for a more economical price. Our doctor recommended we add a product which has more of these minerals to support good thyroid health. We have ordered this product from the same supplier with excellent service and quality of product.
 After trying another Zhou product, incame across the thyroid support. I definitely had memory improvement within the first few days. This is going to become a permanent staple in my daily regimen.
 I feel that this Thyroid support is helping, I haven't had as many days when I feel foggy you know just not connected.I am much sharper.I will continue to take this.
 I usually use a different brand. There was a sale so I purchased this. I opened it after the return window closed- so I will just have to discard.<br/>It tastes terrible and made me sick.<br/>I use multiple supplements from amazon and this is my first negative experience.
 happy to rate this since I found it from the amazon ratings.  I needed something to help with general energy and to support my thyroid after I came off medication.  I also need weight help, and I'm thinking the thyroid is still affecting me, so I took this for just a month now.  I started realizing after a couple weeks, I had more energy and overall well feeling.  I'll check back once I have a few months to see if the weight starts coming off.
 My roommate said she is not starving any more, she sleeps better and no hot flashes. She is very happy with the product and plans to continue buying the product.
 Started taking this support after the first week I started having some pains just below my ribs about where my liver is. Didn't think much about it until the second week. Stopped taking the support and a few days later the pain went away. I felt it was hurting me more than helping. I have not had any further symptoms.
 I waited till I had almost a month in and have honestly not noticed any difference whatsoever.  My verdict is it probably did nothing for me.  Will I order again, no.
 So far, they seem to be helping. I'll continue use, hopefully with long term use, it will improve symptoms of my low thyroid problems.
 More energy and make body temperature up!!!.<br/>I didn’t lose weight yet.<br/>I take Levoxyl 100mg everyday.<br/>After 4hour I took this medicine.<br/>Work very well.<br/>But I take around 9:00 AM.<br/>If I take late this medicine then trouble with sleep.
 This is made me feel so much better. I've had thyroid issues my whole life and nothing has seemed to help until I started taking this. My energy levels are up, I'm not always hungry, I sleep better at night, It's easier to focus and I've even noticed weight loss. This is such a great product I highly recommend this to anyone looking for relief. Definitely want to buy again.
 I’m almost finished with my first month of these pills. I take two a day. I have noticed an increase in energy. When I forget to take them, the next morning I find it very hard to wake up and stay awake. I haven’t noticed a change in weight.
 Great to supplement with my daily thyroid meds. I feel healthier and better overall. Highly recommend.
 So happy I found this product.<br/><br/>I've been using Zhou Nutrition Thyroid Support now for almost two months, the vitamins and nutrients it contains have helped me with many of the issues associated with my thyroid disorder. I'm definitely more energetic, which of course helps me maintain my focus too. And it's allergy friendly, no soy or wheat! I am allergic to soy and have Celiac disease, so thanks :)
 This product sent my blood pressure sky rocketing! I have never had blood pressure issues and had it tested a few months ago and was fine. I started taking this and now it’s through the roof!
 I have been taking this supplement  for about 1 month. I have to say it works. I had terrible  insomnia  and on medication.  No longer do I take anything . The daytime tiredness disappeared, I feel more energetic.  My mood is better l, m much more calm. I shall continue to take it.
 I had started gaining weight even though I was following my diet to a T. I started taking these and the very next day I had more energy and felt great! With 3 days I had already lost weight and gotten back to where I was when I started! Lost even more now!! This stuff is great!!
 After reading all the reviews about weight loss, being focused and not getting sleep, I decided to start off with just one pill vice two. The pills help with being focused and provide energy (no major weight loss). I sleep well at night, so I don't see some of the problems the other reviews are having. So far so good.
 I was so looking forward to getting this. As soon as I got it I took as directed but had constant headaches each day.Took it three days straight.  Then figures I would cut dose in half and see if the headaches would stop.  It didn't :( I had to stop  using it.  It came very fast and was packaged fresh so I can't complain there.  I guess it just doesn't work for me.
 Zhou Thyroid Support is the perfect dosage for me! After being lethargic and air-headed, I feel so much better, have energy, engage in critical thinking, make solid decisions, form plans, perform better. What a change in sixty days. My family, friends + colleagues have noticed the difference.
 I was diagnosed with thyroid disorder 4 years ago after years of  doctors telling me there was nothing wrong with me.<br/>I finally asked to have my thyroid checked based on a TV show I saw and sure enough it was the source of all the issues I was having.  I was prescribed with 2 common medications at separate times and neither worked to my satisfaction.  As a matter of fact the 2nd medicine had me depressed and gaining weight like crazy.<br/>A month ago I decided that I would have to take my health into my own hands so I started researching and came across this supplement. I figured if I have to take something for the rest of my life I want it to make me feel better.<br/>I've used this supplement for 30 days and I feel so much better.  Depression is gone,  my body and joints no longer ache and I feel like a vibrant 43 year old instead of an 99 year old lady.<br/>I just reordered and can't wait to see what happens next.<br/>All I can say is try it you have nothing to lose and you could end up feeling better.
 I loved this product! With in 30min of taking it I felt energy...I ended up losing 6 pounds. I guess I had an under active thyroid. Ill keep buying!
 Have just finished my first bottle of Thyroid Support, it will not be my last. Energy levels are much better, mental clarity is much better! Would recommend this to anyone with energy issues.
 I experienced an allergic reaction to the kelp in this product. Headeache, dizziness, elevated blood pressure. I love Zhou products and I take several of their supplements. This one just did not work out for me.
 I've been on this pills for 2 months. I noticed I'm not as tired and sleeps better at night.  I have not had night flash as often as before I  started using this pills.
 I have just gone through my first bottle and can definitely see a huge difference in energy and sleep. I will continue the use as a supplement with my physicians advise.
 Delivery was quick.. I have been ta king these for a while and I am seeing some ease... I take Levi and was having lots of bone aches... will update in a month...
 I feel like this product really did not help with my thyroid. I finished the bottle in hopes hat eventually I would feel a difference but it was really not life changing. I was really hoping it would help. The pills were at least easy to swallow and did not have a really bad smell like other ones.
 I have just been using this for about 3 weeks and I have been able to lose about 6 pounds, for me that is a lot!<br/>I have always worked out and run a lot but I have always struggled to lose weight, losing abot 2 pounds per month eating healthy and exercising almost every day, now this has increased that fat burning I do not know wxactly how but I know that its working great for me and I totally recommend it!
 This is my second bottle of this product. I can notice increased energy, better focus and even some weight loss.
 It was a very new product for me to try. It seemed to work for me. Would recommend it for people that suffer from not very active thyroid.
 You really need to give this a try if you haven't yet. It was a night and day difference for me with Hashimoto's.
 Not  truly gluten free! Rice flour filler they put in it is garbage, send me into an allergic reaction that’s all rice flour mimics  the protein in gluten.
 I'm starting my 3rd month and can tell the difference in energy, digestion, and weight loss! I won't go without again!
 Ingredients are quality. Yet, I have not seen or felt any positive effects. It gives me diarrhea, with one capsule per day! Will not buy again
 Good product, fast shipping. Seemed to curb my appetite and had a general sense of well being.
 I love this supplement! It gives me energy to start my day with exercise, and get through my day at work. I also feel that I can stay focused and think more clearly. It helps me stay on my low carb diet plan as well, and prevents sweet cravings. It has the iodine I was looking for in a supplement too. Would highly recommend this product.
 I love this product. I was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism years ago and have two benign modules on my thyroid.  My numbers were borderline and my doctor didn't feel I needed any medication.  I was always exhausted and would take a nap in the afternoon.  Since I started using this product, I have lots more energy and I've even lost a little weight.  I no longer nap during the day and I feel more like my old self again.  Highly recommended!
 This is the best product . I feel fantastic since i started taking it and i have so much energy . Thank you for a fantastic product !!!!
 Have been trying this for over a month and feel more energetic and my hair isn’t falling like before. I feel this is really helping my thyroid problem and want to continue to use. Definitely worth trying.
 I just ordered my first bottle about a month ago and I notice my energy levels have gotten so much better within this time. I have hypothyroidism and I have tried a lot of the holistic supplements. This one works great for me and I take it along with some of my other supplements every day. Doesn't make me nauseous which is a plus! Love it!
 Pretty good product. I definitely had more energy when I took it. It reduced some swelling I was experiencing. I would purchase this again.
 Ordered this product and it arrived quickly. Makes taking the multiple supplements needed for my Hashimoto’s a bit easier.
 This has helped me feel like me again!!! My energy is coming back, hair loss is slowing down. Really happy with this product so far!
 I read a lot of great reviews however after I got my shipment I realized I should have looked for a gummy option. For someone who hates taking pills this is not the product for you. The pills are ginormous..have not taken the pills consistently enough to see if there was an effect or not. Looking for a gummy option this way I can be consistent
 I am not diagnosed  with  a thyroid problem,  but have struggled with fatigue,  feeling lethargic,  and troubles with weight.  These have changed my life!
 Great product! It has really helped me get over the sluggishness I've been dealing with that my doctor said was normal. Waking up in the morning is a lot easier now!
 THIS HELP SHRINK MY THYROIDS BACK TO NORMAL SIZE....NOW I SEE THE DOCTOR EVERY 2 YEARS INSTEAD OF EVERY YEAR BECAUSE OF THE SHRINKAGE.
 I was nervous about all of these positive reviews, but after living with sub-threshold hypothyroidism for some time, I decided to give it a try. It really does work! After the first few days of using it consistently (at the recommended dosage of 2/day, it looks like some people only take 1/day to make it last longer), I've found myself waking up easier in the morning (no more snoozing the alarm multiple times), and have totally gotten rid of my mid-afternoon slump that I used to have, every day, where I would be quite literally falling asleep at my desk. Great stuff, will continue to order!
 Could not tell a difference after taking the bottle. Gave me no more energy than when I wasn't taking them.
 I have been taking this Thyroid Support supplement for a month, and feel like I've had more good days than usual. I have multiple health issues, and I felt like this helped with more energy. I didn't feel as cold as I usually do. I'm looking forward to continuing taking it, and hope that I'll see even more  positive changes. I didn't notice any negative side effects.
 I came across this product while looking for something else for my husband.  I read the reviews and thought I'd give it a try.  I suffer with adrenal fatigue but had gotten so sick of taking so many pills that I gave them all up a while back.  I noticed the struggle with lack of energy, insomnia, weight gain, anxiety and brain fog were back with a vengeance. So I decided to give it a try.<br/>I have to say, it's one of the best things I could have done for myself.  It's been 30 days and the brain fog is gone and I have so much more energy.  Thank you so much for making this product!
 I was very hopeful for positive results, but unfortunately I had to stop taking this supplement because despite taking a half dose early in the morning, it was keeping me up at night.<br/><br/>***Review was edited after the company provided a full refund due to my dissatisfaction. Great customer service!
 I've been having problems with excessive sleep (12 hours a day). This product helps me adjust my sleep time and now I am able to wake up on time to go to work. I've never actually got diagnosed with thyroid problem but as a female in the mid-20's I think I have been experiencing some of the symptoms. I take one in the morning and one before bed. The effect was noticeable after a few weeks. Overall I think the Thyroid Support complex is helpful.
 Great item, I have been using it now for 2 months.  Just what I was looking for.  Thank you!  Fast shipping, accurate item and description.
 I'm on day 4 of taking the Thyroid support, and I can tell the difference! I still take my Levothyroxine as recommended, but this is giving me the extra boost I needed! GREAT PRODUCT! LOVE ZHOU!
 Seems to work pretty well i feel more energy with this supplement will try again
 My husband bought me these as a "gift." Lol but seriously glad he did. I take them right after or 30 minutes (when I remember) after a meal and they are amazing at giving me energy. My bathroom breaks have also been "healthy." I don't feel sick or anything. Great product.
 ORIGINAL REVIEW:  This did nothing for me.  I took it for two months.  Very disappointed.<br/><br/>UPDATED:  The company contacted me less than 24 hours after my review and offered me a complete refund.  Based on their honorable response, I would recommend this to someone considering this pill as it has worked for many (just not for me) and knowing that the company stands behind their product and will provide a refund if necessary.  I would give this 3 1/2 stars if I could.  Very few companies care about the individual customers needs, but clearly this company does.  If they put that same care into their product, then it is worth a try!
 I wanted to like these, but unfortunately they gave me horrible headaches. I appreciated the quick and easy customer service and the no-hassle refund.
 I’ve been in a funk since my 2.5 yo was born. I have hypothyroidism so most days I have 0 energy, drive, motivation, etc. it takes me hours to get moving, housework builds up, I don’t want to do anything etc. After a week of taking these, I feel way more alive. Starting to regain a routine again.
 I definitely feel more energy when taking this, which is great because I bought this to help boost my metabolism. I haven't been taking it long, so I'm not sure how it will effect me in the long run, but for now, I'm pleased
 I took this supplement for a couple months, hoping it would help with fatigue.  It did nothing so I cancelled the standing order.  Wasted my money!
 Zero value.  Waste of money.  I should know better than to believe reviews.
 So far the quality of ingredients and their function show positive benefit to anyone who has history with thyroid disorder.  Will continue to take and update results.
 I have been feeling better since I started taking Thyroid Support Complex about a month ago.  I only gave it 4 stars because I can not be certain that my feeling better is totally attributed to this product.  I plan to continue to take Thyroid Support twice a day at least until my next physical exam and see if there is any improvement in my thyroid tests.  I was hopeful that I would drop a little weight but that has not yet happened.
 I have been struggling with side effects from my low thyroid.  Dark circles under my eyes and a dark hue to my skin.  Additionally, my lack of iodine was also apparent.<br/>I tried this and have been completely pleased with the results.  I've had my students ask if I've done my make up differently and even my husband noticed a difference!
 I have noticed an increase in energy since I began taking this.  I have also noticed increased mental clarity.  Love this product!
 This stuff is amazing! It's the first thyroid supplement I have taken that actually works. I am sleeping better, have more energy, and my migraine headaches have decreased. Would highly recommend to anyone with thyroid issues!
 This what my body has needed, Ive been feeling run down and tired all the time..but now I feel like I have more stamina since I’ve been taking it..I know it’s not a total fix of all my symptoms but I have to say it has helped me to have more energy to do things that I haven’t done in a long time ..So for that I say THANK YOU!
 I love this! I have had an underactive thyroid for 20 years now. This is a great supplement to my Synthroid and really helps with my alertness during the day and now I can sleep all night.
 This has been a great supplement.  I have more energy, my skin is not as dry and my hair looks healthier.  So glad I found this thyroud support
 Started working within a week, coupled this with St. John's Wart.
 Waste
 I'll admit, I was sceptical at first. However, after about two days of taking the supplement in the morning, I noticed a remarkable improvement in my energy and concentration.  I did not feel jittery or nervous. It's a gentle "boost", and I'm happy there is the option for monthly refill, which I will be taking advantage of. For those that don't want to me on Armour Thyroid, this may be a nice, natural solution.
 I finished the whole bottle and then waited 2 weeks without taking it before leaving this review. I can now say that this had no effect on me whatsoever. While taking and without taking it, I felt the same.
 While I've been feeling sluggish for a long time, it was only recently that I reached out to my doctor's office to have my thyroid tested. The results came back "borderline" but within the normal range, so they were hesitant to write me a prescription. These have made a great difference in my day to day activities and I'll certainly keep taking them while continuing to have my annual tests repeated by my doctor.
 I can't begin to tell you how much it's helped me.  With my hypothyroidism my hands get extremely dry and they crack and peel.  Not any more!  Since taking your Thyroid Support my hands are normal!!  I sleep better and just generally feel better.  Thanks!!
 I can't live without this product!  I was using another brand and had to switch. I was t happy with that brand and found the Zhou Nutrition Thuroid Support! Happy to say I'm super pleased. I have more energy and feel much better! I just hope this brand stays available.
 Used for hypothyroidism...<br/>Felt great....<br/>Although my tsh levels went up(to 34) and my free t4 hormone was low (at 0.8)...<br/>But that's because I completely stopped taking the synthetic lavatheroxin drug from the pharmacy for 3 weeks from a dosage of 150mcg to no pills at all...
 I love this stuff, can tell a difference when I forget it, I was having issues with my thyroid levels bouncing around and at my last blood draw they said they finally leveled out
 I'm someone on the more hyperactive side of the thyroid spectrum and this supplement has really helped me slow down and focus at work. It doesn't make me drowsy or lethargic and it's certainly helped with my confidence as I feel more calm and self-assured in my abilities.
 It is still too early to tell, but I do believe it is adding the boost to my current Thyroid medication. The weight is starting to come off again, and I believe it is from my increased metabolism.
 I have been on this supplement for over two weeks and I do not see any improvement with fatigue and I surely haven’t noticed any slight weight loss!  I am so disappointed!  I am still taking it daily!  I hope to give an update with more positive results soon!  I haven’t given up hop yet!  Can anyone advise me?
 It is okay for now. I have only been taking it for a short time. I have felt and experienced more energy production but Am also taking other vitamins with this. I need to finish the bottle to be sure. Wish I could say more.
 Love this product, my thyroid start to function on his own, used to used levothyroxine 88 mcg. Been using this suplements about 4 months. The Doctor lower the dose to 50 mcg. Recently, but will stick to the thyroid support. This one is the best I've seen.
 Didnt feel like they helped me
 I have a prescription for thyroid medication but thought to give these a try as well.  I found i just feel better with a little more energy and better mood when i add these to my daily regime.
 Three in our family are using this. One hashimotos,using Armor. Two borderline numbers, no prescriptions. All three have less brain fog, better sleep, more energy after one month use. Bought more and will try another month and see if we still think this is what is helping.
 I feel as thought I have a sluggish thyroid, but my tests show normal. Until I can see an endocrinologist I thought I'd try this supplement.  I really feel better and more energetic. and my appetite it lower, so I am not comfort eating anymore.
 This works I am a 75 yr. old woman and have been having trouble with fatique and mental fog, it's been 2 days and there is a big difference.
 Can’t really say I’ve seen a noticeable difference in any symptoms. Info notice if I take this at night it tends to keep me awake. Will update once I use the entire bottle.
 I've been taking this for a few months now and I think it's helping! I'd probably notice it more if I stopped taking it. Hasn't done anything for weight loss but I definitely notice more energy.
 Second bottle didn’t work. The first was amazing. Oh well, moviing on to another. I definitely am interested in a every 30 days purchase with a brand that’s consistent with results. Good luck 😕
 Cannot tell you how much I appreciate you and your team of staff taking the time to produce a product that actually works!  My energy, focus and enthusiasm is getting clearer every day that passes!  Thank You from the bottom of my heart!
 I purchased this product and lost .5 pound every 2 days until I ran out. So I bought another bottle. My doctor refuses to believe me when I say I think something is wrong with my thyroid so I’m really glad I found a product as great as this one because it really helps and proved me right :)
 So far I like the energy they give me. I have had no weight loss though
 This product does not work at all. I have taken half the bottle and literally can tell no difference
 I really like how it gave me the boost of energy that I need some days<br/>I've even turned my coworker on to it and she loves it as well
 This product has helped me tremendously. Every thyroid panel I've ever had run, everything comes back "normal", but all my symptoms point toward hypothyroidism. This supplement has given me my energy back, and I've lost some of my stubborn weight. I will definitely purchase again.
 My thyroid has always been a bit off, but fortunately not enough to warrant medication.  Had wondered in recent years though if it could be causing my weight gain and lack of energy, so figured getting this would be worth a shot.  While increase in energy and such has been minimal, I have lost almost 10 pounds since I started using the 1st bottle, so definitely a positive there.
 When reading more about supplement, got scary reviews. Potential health risks.
 I notice a difference with certain things, I haven’t been taking any meds And never have for thyroid but with how my weight goes back and forth and other symptoms I have it makes me think it’s that. Thyroid problems run in my family as well, I’ve just not found a dr who will actually go fully into detail to test me.
 I’ve been taking this product for about a month and i noticed changes in my energy levels and focus. I take it right before my workout and it makes me feel great!
 My total thyroid hormone went from above 5 to 3.5 after 2 bottles of this. I plan on keep taking it with hopes that my results will get back to normal range
 I’m taking this because I’m using pink salt which doesn’t have iodine in it.  I have low thyroid and have felt better and had more energy since I started using it.  I plan to keep using it.
 I believe this really is effective but I had to take it longer than just one month.
 This stuff is fantastic! It has helped me lose a little bit of weight, but my favorite thing about these supplements is the mental clarity! The brain fog is gone, and my energy has definitely increased throughout the day.
 First thyroid formula that works for me.
 I bought this product a month ago and am now waiting on my second order. I've had symptoms of a thyroid problem for several years now and non of the testing said there was a problem. I started using it and within a few days I didn't feel as moody and was dropping weight.  I feel great and would recommend this to anyone who thinks they might have a thyroid problem. Great product for a great price
 My physician suspected a low thyroid and has suggested I get tested. I decided to try Thyroid Support to see if my symptoms were addressed before going for having to go for testing... well it worked! No more shivers, now have energy and less fatigue. So happy with this supplement!
 I just completed my first bottle and have started taking the second. I am noticing that I have a lot more energy. I originally started taking with dinner but had to swap to breakfast after the first week. I would wake up at 3 am every morning. Since changing to breakfast I am normally getting a second wind around the end of my work day!
 Under active thyroids run in my family.  I have requested testing a few times over the past several years because I have been experiencing the following symptoms that I knew were possibly related to thyroid issues:<br/>-Cold ALL THE TIME<br/>-Trouble sleeping<br/>-Anxiety/Depression<br/><br/>My results were always just within the "normal" range, but very close to breaking that threshold to "not normal" range.  So I was never put on a treatment plan.  On a whim, I ordered Zhou Thyroid Support.  This is uncharacteristic of me, as I am a skeptic of vitamins and supplements because I have never really experienced a difference when taking them.<br/><br/>I feel like a new person!!! The previously mentioned symptoms are gone, but so are the following other symptoms that I was unaware could be thyroid related:<br/>-Brain fog<br/>-Poor attention span<br/>-Lack of energy<br/><br/>Not only do I feel different, but my boss has even stated several times how I have been "on my game, big time."  I just started my second bottle and I honestly cannot imagine life without it anymore.<br/><br/>PS: I think this is my first amazon review ever.  That is how much I love this stuff!
 Ordered this product because I started to feel exhausted after a day of work. I'm an analyst that sits in an office so I didn't think I should feel dead. Everyone may be different but this stuff really helped me get my energy and focus back. Plan to subscribe to this moving forward so I can continue to crush it at work.
 I have only been taking this for a couple of weeks - twice daily.  I was running behind and forgot my morning dose.  I can tell!  I didn't really notice until now how much better I was feeling and how much more awake and energetic I was feeling.  I'm definitely a believer.
 The bottle of Thyroid  Support Comlex is a great  supplement to my diet and life. I feel fabulous —-/ I have Engery ., feel alert and  alive. I can’t start my dAy without this boost . Thanks for changing my life❤️  Deborsah
 I wasn't sure these were going to help me. But I bought them and I started taking these about a month ago. I feel more energized when I take them! Definitely will keep buying these!!
 I have depression and get pretty bad anxiety, especially in the colder seasons. I was looking up different symptoms I was having and found this as a remedy somehow. Aside from improving my mood, I found myself able to focus more at work. These work great with consistent use.
 No obvious change in weight or overall feeling. Going to continue taking to see if time helps.
 I'm reviewing this on behalf of my wife.  She is was worried her Thyroid might be acting up while we don't have any medical checkups to verify if it works, my wife did feel better.  She would will buy again.
 This Supplement is amazing, recently started working a second and third job and didn't want to drink a ton of coffee or take a lot of caffeine pills to keep up with everything while also being safe and healthy since I have a heart problem. This Supplement has really helped me probably couldn't last without it.
 Only been taking 3 days but already have more energy and not as hungry.
 I was a bit skeptical to try these but after reading such great reviews I figured I would give them a shot. I was thoroughly surprised and I've been taking these regularly and have lost about 8 pounds in two months after changing nothing else. I feel great and can tell that I have more energy too. Not bad for making no real effort other than taking a few vitamins in the morning! I will continue using Zhou Nutrition products for as long as they make them!
 Great
 Brought my energy levels way up but without feeling nervous or jittery.  In fact i am actually calmer than i was before starting this supplement.  Ive alao ahed about 10 lbs since starting!!  Its a “Cant do without” supplement for me after taking it for 4 months now.  Thanks Zhous!!
 I am so impressed with these! I am just about finished with my first bottle. I’ve taken them religiously each day and I feel so much better! More and better energy, better focus, I wake up truly rested and feel ready to start the day. It doesn’t make me feel jittery at all. Highly recommend this product!
 Would not buy again. Did not really give any more energy. Noticed no real difference from taking them. Tried taking them along with neuro-peak and got light headed dizzy. Excellent customer service! If you are unstasified with results they will make it right. May have different effects on others. Worth giving them a try!
 Haven't had enough time to review yet (only been a month), but haven't seen any negative side effects. Supplements like this need to be taken daily, doesn't work as well if missing doses. Excited to see how this journey goes moving forward.
 I read all of the positive reviews and was hopeful it would give me more energy. Unfortunately all it gave me was terrible heartburn, bloating and gas both days that I took it. Going to stop taking it immediately. Totally not worth the discomfort I got from taking it.
 Fabulous product that helps with energy levels and weight loss that do not come easily with Hypothyroidism. I have ordered two bottles and love it. It gives me just the right amount of iodine and B12 to supplement my prescription.
 I started thyroid support at the beginning of Feb. No changes initially but I'm at the end of my first month and have experienced 6lbs of very unexplained weight loss.  My diet has not been great but I plan to jump start that today. Fingers crossed that I continue to see a difference. 2 years of struggling to lose weight due to my hypothyroid diagnosis and PCOS has been no less than frustrating.  This may be my miracle supplement
 Horrible, gave me massive massive headaches at First days, but decided to keep using the product, headaches went away after the second day and seems to be working great. I can definitely tell a great energy left and I am happy with the product
 I was too tired and cold anytime even when the weather real nice outside. My family doctor advised me to use some thyroid suppliments. After I used to take this product for 2 weeks, my health is better!
 I started using Thyroid Support in June. The thyroid is slow to respond but I can already tell a difference if I forget to take it.
 After a few days of taking this I noticed a huge difference in my energy. I was overall a lot more positive. However the first couple nights I noticed I had a little harder time sleeping but now I'm use to it. I'm about to order my 2nd bottle.
 I have had multi-symptom PCOS for 8 years and developed thyroid deficiency 3 years ago. I eat healthy, exercise, and no matter what my weight fluctuates and thus my symptoms (anyone with PCOS gets it). I'm at almost the dose of NaturThroid that someone without a thyroid gland at all would take. So I tried this. It has helped me regain my focus (I also take Neuro Peak as well as Green tea from Zhou), energy, and overall health. I haven't lost any weight, but that wasn't really my goal. My skin is clearer and healthier, my hair is a little bit thicker, and I have energy to get through the day with just one cup of coffee instead of 8. Be warned - eat before taking otherwise you will feel like you might puke a little. This is common with such a large amount of minerals and vitamins (especially the metals!). The magnesium is super helpful too because it keeps you from being (don't mean to be unladylike here) super constipated which has been a problem for me in the past with low thyroid. I hope this review helps convince someone to give this a try - if it seems it might not help, I promise you it will even if your thyroid seems to want to ruin your life!
 This has really Helped me- I have had more energy and less foggy ness. I didn’t even realize how good I felt until I ran out and went a few days without taking it..suddenly I was sluggish, tired, depressed etc. I just bought my second bottle and excited to keep going! -also, taking these while on a ketogenic diet I have lost 12 pounds in 5 weeks..so that’s a bonus as well!!
 Was sceptical at first,  but can honestly tell a difference after taking for 2 weeks. More energy and better concentration. Would definitely recommend.
 I am still in the midst of trying this out but take synthoid and decided to take this to boost my immune system. I will say within a week, I felt like I was done with coffee and quit cold turkey (I’m not sure why— I just felt like I didn’t need coffee anymore) and I feel pretty energetic. I ran out a week ago and this week I’ve taken a couple of long naps so maybe I need to start up again. I definitely think this helps boost your thyroid.
 This product is good. I took it for about 30 days. I did feel increased energy but did not lose any weight while taking. I do have thyroid problems and take 100mg Synthroid daily as well. Still the product is overall good!!!
 Didn’t do much for me but make me feel weird... doesn’t say much since I’m sensitive to any medication but I took it for about 3 weeks as instructed and didn’t do anything. Worth a try though.
 After a few days taking two a day, I noticed my energy was back up and the fatigue I'd been going through for the past year and a half has been in decline. I overall feel better, more energetic, less tired and more active, awake and in the moment since I started using Zhou's Thyroid Support. I feel more productive and industrious. I don't get the "down time" in the middle of the afternoon as my energy level has remained consistent since using the Thyroid Support. I can feel myself losing weight since starting to use them. I've used these for a few months now and will keep coming back. I highly recommend! Price is amazing!
 Got this mainly for help with low energy levels and to alleviate some of my thyroid issues, but I didn't notice any improvement over the last few weeks of taking it. Kind of bummed out because it seemed to have help a lot of people and hoped it would do the same for me.
 It's a great product!!!  I have noticed a difference when not taking this supplement.  I had more energy n focus. ,😊
 I took the month supply and I saw a change in my energy and slept better
 In combination with Crossfit and keeping my extra carb intake lower, this supplement is helping me lean out and overall feel much more like my energetic self.
 I’ve been taking this supplement for almost a month, and while I haven’t experienced any weight loss, like a lot of other reviews, I have experienced mood improvement and better energy!!!
 I definitely feel the difference! :)  I’m on day 25 and I feel more energy, and my brain feels so much clearer !
 Sadly I tried taking these, but within 5 minutes I was dry heaving every time.  Not sure what is in it that disagrees with me, but clearly something did :(:(
 I purchased Zhou Thyroid Support with Iodine to replace the current Iodine +2 that I had been taking. I was excited to try it because I saw the way the company stands behind the product. I have to say I didn't notice immediate change, but rather a gradual one. When I remember to take them every day I DO feel more energized and a clearer mind... I have only been on them for about a month so I can't give long term feedback. But I believe every person is so different and there is no "miracle cure" that will be the same for everyone. That being said, I feel like this is an affordable, health, supplement to help my Hypothyroidism.
 Helps me with that drop in energy. Can't wait for my next bottle to help me through those bad days.
 Excellent product. Feel like I have more energy and my eyes are whiter.
 Worst experience! Sever palpitations, sweat, dizziness. I thought I was having a heart attack. Went to the cardiologist the next day and he assured me all was well. The Doctor advise me to stop taking it
 I've been suffering from lack of energy and just not myself for about 2 years and now I am actually starting to feel myself again. Its taken about a month to see any difference but I am gradually starting to return to full self.
 I have noticed a difference in my energy and thought process.  Another bonus is it has helped me with reducing my hunger or unnecessary snacking!!
 I have hypothyroidism and hashimotos. I was skeptical but willing to try just about anything to feel better in addition to taking levothyroxine. Also, it was on sale at a terrific price.<br/>Wow! The cloud is lifted. I have more energy then I have in a very very long time. I'm very grateful for this stuff.
 I was really excited to try this product because of all of the spectacular reviews. Unfortunately, this product didn’t do anything for me. I suffer from hypothyroidism and I am really sad to say that these didn’t do anything for my symptoms.
 I feel overall better. I am not as tired. I have not lost weight like others have mentioned, that is really the only bummer. I have only been on this for 2 months so may take additional time.
 I love this! I ran out and didn't order a new bottle right away and I can definitely feel the difference in not taking it. It has given me increased energy and just all around feeling better. I have also lost a few pounds. Bonus! This will for sure be a staple in my supplement regimen.
 What made me interested in this product was from research telling me most Americans do not get enough iodine in their diet. Also, my water is reverse osmosis, so I do not get any of the minerals from my hydration source.<br/>I need all the help I can get to make sure I'm 100% at my job, which is very physically and mentally demanding partially due to being 6 days a week 10 hours a day average. Since taking this I did not notice much at first, but a couple weeks I realized I had more of the things advertised: focus and energy. Also, before I took this product I needed at least 8 and a half hours of sleep, otherwise I would function like a zombie. I am waking up on my own around 7 hours now, with just as good work performance. I'm opent to the possibility of placebo effects, but it just seemed like too many positive changes I noticed to be one, and I know my nutrition was definitely lacking in a lot of the ingredients in this, especially iodine.
 For me, I found that this product did not work as well as a previous product. Update: the company gave me a full refund for my purchase. This is a level of professionalism that I look for in the companies I order from.
 I am not sure if it's too early to complain?? I have been taking this for 2 weeks now, and my moods have gotten worse and I am gaining weight! I am consistent when taking these, and it's like il taking candy! My diet hasn't changed,  so I dont understand why this is happening! I'm am retuning!!
 I was suffering from severe fatigue every day. Drinking coffee and still needing a cat nap every day; and I still could barely function.  I do suggest taking your dose I  the morning or you will be not be able to sleep at night.  Sometimes I take only 1 pill  (suggested dose is 2) if I did not have an overly active day ahead of me. I'm definitely hooked!
 I have been having problems lately with concentration and sluggishness.  Since taking the thyroid support supplement, my concentration has improved, I have stopped gaining the one to two pounds a week and I am more productive, which, for an entrepreneur is essential.  The ingredients also complement my daily multi-vitamin and does not provide more than I need as a daily supplement.
 I love this product..I just love it.ar first I thought the great change was all in my head but when I ran out or the product I can definitely tell the difference..and will be receiving another bottle soon.thank you so much for this product, it is definitely worth it if you have thyroid problems, for me it help with my hormones and overall feeling, I feel these capsules have given me my life back..thank you!
 I've felt even better than on Rx synthyroid!
 Awesome product i feel so much more energy
 Very pleased with this product.  I could certianly tell subtle changes....I wasn’t completely crashing after work, my headaches went from one a day to one every couple of weeks (so thankful for this), &amp; i just felt better overall!!  I would definitely recommend this product!
 Sadly did nothing for me disappointed after all the raving reviews. But the company reached out to give a refund and gift trial of any other supplement in the range. Good service!
 If you have a thyroid problem or any similar symptoms this product is 100 percent worth trying.
 I feel so much better overall after taking this product.  I have even lost 8 lbs.  I have recommended to several friends and family.
 I have been trying to get my hyperthyroidism under control but it look like nothing work but I'm trying thyroid support with my thyroid medicine and it's help me I have more energy now
 I have taken it for 30 days.  I want to continue and see if begins to help me more.  I do feel it has helped slightly with my energy.  My massage therapist asked what I had been doing differently as my body was a lot less inflamed.  Taking this supplement was the only thing different.  My body gets swollen and it can be hard to move and painful.  Less inflammation is a great thing.  Again, I’m hoping after 60 days, I’ll see even more improvement.
 My energy and positive moods seem to be coming back since I started taking the thyroid supplement.  Thank you
 Will reorder often. The product makes it easy to go to the bathroom and eliminate a lot of waste from my system,<br/>making me feel better.  I have not noticed any other changes.
 So far this supplement is great! It came the next day after it shipped, a day earlier than Amazon initially stated. I'm really happy that it's a full months supply in one bottle as well, because a lot of supplements do not give you enough capsules for an entire month but these guys do! I've been taking it for about a week, and I do not feel a drastic change yet, but subtle things. I feel slightly more focused and energetic, though it's too soon to tell if it's helping my metabolism. Overall I really enjoy this product so far though!
 Almost done with the first bottle. My most noticeable consistent change is that I wake up every morning and shake off the sleep hangover pretty much instantly. I generally have more energy, but waking up ready to go is a great change. I still like to hit the snooze sometimes, but its b/c of the thought that 'I like sleep' vs. 'I need more sleep'. So I need to work on my willpower, but I definitely plan to keep ordering this.
 I truly like this product.  It delivers!  I have suffered the effects of Thyroid problem for years and this supplement has improved my life.  I noticed a marked improvement after a week.
 I bought it for myself to try it and for my Mother which has Thyroid issues. We both felt worse taking it. Threw it in the trash.
 Really glad I found this product. I felt like it regulated my body in more ways than just my thyroid.
 Love it
 I just finished my first bottle and I’ve noticed several great effects. I have much more energy and better focus. For a long time I had persistent joint and nerve pain in one of my hips, and that has stopped. I haven’t had any headaches, and sleep has improved. Would definitely recommend!
 This stuff is truly amazing! Everyone is a little a different on how long it takes for the effects to kick in. It took about 3-4 weeks before I felt like most symptoms were gone.  I have this on subscribe because I couldn't imagine going without it.
 I was really pleasantly surprised by these. My benefits, as I see them:<br/><br/>-Stable, reliant energy (not only when I take them, but generally as well)<br/>-Nails that are much stronger, longer<br/>-Feeling more at peace, less shakey
 Have been taking these pills for a couple of weeks. The only difference that I have noticed is that I do have more energy while working out. Once I stop workng out I will continue with a rush for about 1 hr and then my body slows down 😑😑😑. No weight loss at all.
 Hi! I didn't feel any different. I was hoping to loose weight and feel more energized but nothing happened.
 Was not effective for me
 I have benn using this product for a month now and I love it!  I have more energy and I have been sleeping better!
 Out of all the natural thyroid supplements I’ve tried, I’m happiest with this one. I take it in the morning with something fatty (piece of cheese, handful of nuts, etc.), and I noticed immediately that it even helped with my allergies, and I had more energy in the afternoons. I’ll definitely be getting more.
 I started taking this about two weeks ago. I’m not sure if it takes awhile to kick in? But I haven’t felt anything. I was concerned about the side effects but fortunately that hasn’t occurred. Unfortunately nothing has, I was really looking forward to more energy but I will have to look for another product.
 this helps reduce my frequency of hot flashes, I will continue to take it
 I have noticed a huge difference in my energy and I’ve lost a few lbs without making other changes. I will definitely order again.
 I have been using this product almost 3 weeks and have notice a change in my energy and I feel my appetite has been somewhat suppressed​.
 On my 3rd bottle of Thyroid Support and it has really helped with the emotions/hormones.  Before, all I felt was rage all the time, now I am human.
 I got immediate gratification from these, I'm clearer, more alert and actually want to do things now.
 As a Graves Disease sufferer for 15 years and nothing helping me to feel better, I decided to try Zhou Nutrition Thyroid Support Complex with Iodine. After a few days I found myself definitely having more energy as well as sleeping sounder at night. I have not had as many issues with hives and leg cramps and I had been having. I did notice that for me, I take one pill in the morning and one later in the afternoon. Just having more energy to be able to do things with my kids later in the evening after school without feeling like I was going to fall face forward asleep, is worth alot. I even came home from working all day and cleaned my carpets! Something I would never have had the energy to do before. I am thankful to have found a product that actually works for me.
 Hi - I purchased this 9/6/17– I have only 10% of my thyroid left. I’m always constantly tired, no energy, brain fog. My doctors check my thyroid sometimes it high or very low. My meds doses are never the same . I feel that this product has helped me with my energy and I have lost 3 lbs since taking it. I will order again and again!
 I’m a big fan of these supplements by Zhou lately. I had been using their boost elite for a while now and noticed this on a lightning deal and decided to give it a shot. I’m glad I did and I’ll definitely be re ordering in the future.
 Gained 6 lbs in two weeks. Should not take with Hashimoto thyroiditis. Threw away.
 This supplement supports my thyroid. I take it in addition to synthroid and I noticed more energy, focus, better moods and less fatigue after only a few days.
 I cannot take these.  They cause an upset stomach every time.
 This is one of the only supplements I've ever taken that I felt an immediate difference after taking.  I feel stronger &amp; have more energy.
 I felt a bit more energetic while taking this but I also had a lot of unplesent Digestion issues while taking it. It was kind of a wash for me. I see lits of other reviewers who were very happy with it. But it wasnt for me. I had stopped taking it for a month. And tried again to get the same results.
 This is the best stuff. My aches and pains are gone. My thyroid has been diagnosed as hypo and this is a great supplement to Gain back my energy and all the pains are gone!!
 Just started using this.  I really hope it helps my metabolism.  Weight loss for me is soooo slow.
 The product wasn't right for me, but it did give me more energy and focus. The customer service is excellent though so I'm giving it 4 stars for that.
 Seems to be working well Im taking this instead of my rx...my girlfriends has been taking it to replace her rx for months her bloodwork came back she is where...she should be with her t4 and t3 levels
 These are great. I tested High on my tsh a few months ago (then retested normal) but thought I'd give these a try as I'm vegan as well and they have a good amount of b-12. So far so good. I'm not dropping weight like crazy but have more spunk to get thru the day.
 I have been struggling with intense and frequent hot flashes for 6 years. I do not believe in poisioning my body with pharmaceuticals. So, I have been looking for a natural alternative. Over the past 6 years, I have tried hundreds of supplements, creams, etc. This product has been the only thing that actual works. I noticed a significant decrease in intensity and frequency (hot flashes are basically gone) within just 2 days of taking this supplement. Cannot thank Zhou enough for making such an awesome product using high production standards producing a quality product.
 Love this product. Getting ready to order more. I'm also going to check other pro they have<br/> I've gained so much more energy with the thyroid support. I no longer get the afternoon tiredness and I'm actually sleeping better also. I'm even eating healthier. I  highly recommend this product to anyone who is on the fence about it.
 Great product. Ive been taking it for a few weeks now and I really feel the difference.<br/>Would definitely recommend it to anyone with thyroid issues.
 This is my first bottle but so far so good. I have noticed my memory fog has gone. My energy has been about the same. I think i wont be able to tell the difference for a few months
 I waited until I took all of the pills to write this review, I did not notice a single change in my energy or anything else. Would not use again. Updating my review, I was given a refund without asking. I believe that speaks volumes for a company. Thank you!
 Did nothing for me, i didnt feel any extra energy or focus since i started taking it until I finished it
 I have been taking this a few weeks and can tell it has improved my mood,energy and focus support I haven’t seen any weight loss support yet but hope that will come w continued use!
 I've been taking these pills for about 3 weeks now and I can totally see and feel a difference.  I have more energy, my focus is so much better and my nails are stronger and longer.  I can't believe how taking these pills have made me feel.  I definitely recommend and I will continue to purchase. Thank you!!!!
 i was taking this product for about 2 weeks and honestly did a really good job keeping my energy levels high, but gave me terrible terrible bloating and digestive issues. i don’t know which ingredient caused it but does not make my tummy happy. would like refund please
 Didn’t make a difference and there is no return policy. May work for some people but not for me and without a return policy I give it a low review.
 This works well for me, I have Hashimoto's so I only take it when I fluctuate to a low position (not enough in the system) and this helps to bring the my level back up.
 I have been taking this product and have seen an increase in my energy level and my sleep has improved as well.  I don't feel as sluggish during the days before I started using this product. It'only been a little over 2 month's and will continue to use ...Pleased with the results so far.
 This stuff worked for a few days then started to make me dizzy. I have hashimotos and this seems to make it worse :(<br/><br/>Update:  within minutes of submitting my review I received an email from Zhou stating they would give me a full refund so I have updated my review to 4 stars.
 I had extremely high expections after reading the reviews for this product. However, I’m on day 5 and still don’t feel much different. Hoping it just takes awhile to kick in. Going to finish the bottle to see. I’ll update if any changes.
 I take this every day not sure my body can do without it.
 This makes me feel more alert and gives me more energy. I take two in the morning to start out my day and I feel great!
 My energy level has increased to the point I usually don't need my multi-vitamins.  I no longer have the 3pm need for a nap.  I can push right through the day until time for bed.
 I was skeptical about this product at first but still decided to give it a chance. I have anxiety and depression but after a week of taking this supplement I've felt stable. I have energy and am in a positive mood. I just ordered my second bottle since it was on special. I definitely recommend!
 Have been taking for several weeks and I do have an increase in energy and motivation.
 Waste of money
 My thyroid levels have been all over the place for the past few years, making me decide to take action. I feel like a have more energy and have less mood swings since ive taken this product. I get my next blood work done in a month and im very curious to see if they are back at normal levels. I definjtely plan to continue taking this product.
 I’ve noticed a big difference in my energy level. I’ll definitly be back for more.
 Finishing first bottle. Definitely feeling better!
 It's helping me to have more energy!
 I've found it very helpful in stabilizing my energy levels in the afternoon and it definitely takes the edge of my appetite.  It doesn't make me feel shaky or jittery and will continue to purchase it.
 I have hypothyroidism, Taking levothyroxine for the past eighteen (18) years with level adjustments as needed.  Taking lower dose on hand than current level when in-between doctor visits, which is why I ordered this product.  When tested two months later, surprised to find the thyroid functioning had stayed consistent.  I take just one capsule daily with the levothyroxine.  I believe the minerals do what the product label states: "supports", the thyroid.  I will be purchasing again.
 Feel so much better after taking the thyroid supplements. My hair isn't falling out, my nails are stronger and I sleep better.
 I take this with my subscription of levothyroxine and it has done wonders.  I can tell an immediate difference if I skip a dose.  Gives me more energy and everything.  Love it.
 So far I am liking this product. I have to be honest and I don't know if it works. I do know that since I have started using it, my weight has been going down and surprisingly my dry eyes from Lasik has gotten much better. I am using a lot less eye drops during the day.
 ABSOLUTELY WORTH EVERY PENNY!<br/><br/>If you have doubts, follow the instructions carefully, eat right, do your homework,knowledge is power.
 I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's disease, and they quickly placed me on medications for the rest of my life, but I also asked if I could take this on a daily basis as well and my NP said this was fine as long as I wait an hour after I take my medication. It has everything the thyroid needs, so she said why not! I have been on my medication for a week in a half and been taking these supplements with it and I feel wonderful, and so energetic.
 I was skeptical. It this really does help with my brain fog
 Thyroid support has really helped me in many ways. I used to feel tired all the time, bloated and moody. I am on my second bottle, and I dont want to be without it. I dont have the mood swings anymore and find that things just dont bother me the way they used to. I feel more positive, and the bloated feelings are gone. I feel like I have lost weight as well. This is worth the money for me.
 I will give some credit here and say I noticed a good improvement with energy on day one with one pill. However, I can't go thru life with a headache either. Seems odd to me that a supplement that claims to be natural has a green capsule? Maybe it contains chlorophyll?
 My whole family has Thyroid issues, and I am always low in energy. I am taking this because I need it.
 I wish I could say this Thyroid Support Supplement helped, I really wanted it to. I tried the full dose at first and got headaches and thought maybe it was too much and should ease my body into it so adjusted it down to a capsule a day or every other day but I felt no change. It may work for you,  it just didn't for me.
 I have purchased many but this one Zhou is the very best. It has restored my energy level.  I feel so much better. Thank you.  Thank you!!!!
 A Miracle pill!!!! My lymph nodes in my neck have been swollen for over 3 months and my Dr could not do much aside from suggest surgeries. in addition, I was retaining water in my armpits and they were swollen. So without doing a large number of hit or miss test and everything else most Doctors cant nail what is wrong. So I take the time and try to nail thing my own. I normally gain about 30 pounds in a few months, every year and I lose it every year.....over and over. In any event I have reduced my calorie intake for the past 2 months and have lost 20 pounds but still have the water retention in my armpit and my lymph nodes are swollen. Normally I juice only for 30 days and I lose the weight and the swelling. But dieting alone does not make the swelling (water retention) go down. In any event I got this Thyroid Complex to see if I possibly have some kind of thyroid or gland problem or may be fighting something (bacteria, virus, etc). And I honestly did not expect much. But after taking this for the second day, my lymph gland in my neck is back to normal and my armpits are back to normal and not retaining water any longer. And I cant say its "in my head" or a placebo effect because its something you can actually feel and see is gone. So I am still not sure what I have but i can attest that this pill is doing something and something major. So I would HIGHLY recommend it.<br/>I have taken a lot of pills so I am use to taking pills. These pills are the normal oblong shape as many are. But its substantially bigger. I took pics of it compared to my other pills. You can see its noticeably longer as well as thicker in width. Despite the size increase I have no problems swallowing it in any nature. I guess if you are a person that has problems swallowing pills, it may be a factor though.
 I don’t know,it was my body be better by itself or because of this pills.Thank you millions times,I feel like I  in was early 20 years old again.Finally,I can be myself again.Thank you
 I knew something was wrong over 20 years ago but Docs keep saying everything was good. Them finally a T3/T4 test proved it about 10 years ago. Nothing was working, lack of energy and cravings persisted. I've tried everything from Armor to other naturalistic and then I tried this. This stuff works! Energy is back, cravings are diminishing and  the iodine is a must! I've only been taking it for about 3 weeks but I can already tell a difference. Thanks!
 I started taking this when I was feeling run down; I’ll post a follow up review after a couple weeks to let you know if I feel better, too soon (2 weeks) to know yet!
 Took this for one  day and couldn't figure out why I felt so anxious and couldn't sleep.  I realized the only thing I changed to my plan was this thyroid supplement.  I had such high hopes based on the positive reviews. :-(
 Great product! Felt immediately better and my sluggish thyroid symptoms decreased. Weight fell faster, had more energy, hair stopped being dry. I approve and would purchase again.
 Really feel better taking this. I have more energy and losing weight. Well find out at the end of the month if it has helped with my thyroid numbers. I ordered my second supply.
 It really gave me energy...I always felt drained all the time. Thanks!
 Sleep great now, lost 5lbs but stopped.  Would Iike to know when i should take it. Optimum time for optimum results. This is a good product
 A lot of great ingredients in this bugger!
 Does nothing but gives headaches
 I got the bottle and after a month or so I realized that I los 3lb. I know it's not A LOT but since I was straggling trying to lose some weight and nothing was working it is big for me :) I feel more energetic and I actually play outside with my son more than ever. Thyroid problems runs in my family but my test results was normal for now. I'm going to keep taking this to keep it that way as long as I can
 Gave me severe muscle cramps. But was very pleased they gave me a refund and wanted me to find something that works. Seems like a great company that puts customer service first!
 After being diagnosed with a thyroid issue and told to minimize my salt intake, I hit the Web and found myself on Amazon looking for iodine products. Because of the amounts of positive reviews, I purchased this.<br/><br/>Initially (first couple days) I noticed I wasn't as bloated after eating. After about 3 weeks, with exercise and healthy eating, I began losing more fat..thus, getting over my fat-burning hump. Based on your health status and eating habits, if same as mine, I would definitely recommend this product.
 I got diagnosed with thyroid problems over a year ago got put on prescription medication for it and lost my insurance I tried the Zhou thyroid support and LOVED IT!!! found it working better than my prescription medication highly recommend for thyroid issues.
 More energy than I have had in 10 years since diagnosed with hypothyroid.  Highly recommend
 This supplement works wayyy better for me than my old prescription medication that I used to take for hypothyroidism! I've only been taking it for a couple weeks now but have noticed a huge difference in how I feel everyday. I have a lot more energy and can stay focused all day! Definetly will be subscribing
 I have been taking these supplements for almost thirty days now and have noticed a difference. I take my two pills at night right after dinner and after just a few days I was sleeping better than I have in a while. I woke up feeling good and energized. I will continue to use this product because after one month I still can tell a difference.
 A have had trouble with my thyroid for years! I’m so tired and weight gain is terrible. After I started taking this about 5 days I noticed I had way more energy and I felt like since I was more active I lost weight. I love this product and would definitely recommend.
 I was excited to try this, as my energy level has been pretty low. Unfortunately, I was only able to take them for two days because they made me sick, so it's hard to tell if they would have worked for me.
 What i like about this pills is that i get my energy that i need. No more energy drinks for me i am so thankfull that i found something to help me. I have all the symptoms of thyroid dificiency,  if i don't drink my pills i get a really big headache and feel tired and just can't be my self. Thanks to the company that makes this i am more active and i can do so many things in a day.
 everything about this product has been wonderful. with the first pill i noticed a change, i felt better. as i continue to take it, one a day, i feel back to normal. thank you for a wonderful product.
 This stuff gives me.the pick me up I have been lacking for so long. Thank you!
 Within a week of taking Thyroid Support Complex, I could tell a difference in my enengy level and feeling of well being.  I will continue taking this excellent product.
 I have noticed some improvement in my overall well being, but am not sure it is all related to the product or may be a small amount of placebo effect.  I have reordered the product as I felt it is worth the improvement.
 I have been struggling with hypothyroidism for the last four years. I had a partial thyroidectomy due to a large goiter. I was on Synthroid for a little over a year post surgery. I felt absolutely horrible on the medication. Needless to say I got off the medication and have been dealing with the effects of a sluggish underactive thyroid. I didn't want to give up and I definitely didn't want to continue feeling the way that I've been feeling (exhausted, depressed, weight gain, hair loss, oily scalp, interrupted sleep,etc) so I decided to order this product and give it a try based on all of the reviews. I started taking this product five days ago and I have to say (although too soon in my opinion to give a thorough review) that in the short time of taking it I've noticed my scalp is a little less oily and my energy levels are slowly climbing. Today I woke up at 5 am without my alarm going off. I usually have to hit the snooze button! I'm pleased with this product thus far and cant wait to see how I feel by the time I finish the first bottle!
 Arrived in perfect condition, in a timely maaner. Will buy from this seller again. No side effects and easy to take. I need to be on this product for a few months and then will have a new blood test. If my thyroid level has improved I will upgrade my review. But for now I will just say it seems to be a fine product.
 This supplement is amazing. Prior to taking this supplement,  I felt run down and low on energy.  Since I have started taking this supplement my energy level and mood are so much better!
 I noticed that this supplement does exactly what it says. Aided my thyroid problems which allowed me to start losing some pounds. I would buy again from this seller.
 I have thyroid issues that aren't severe enough for medication but enough to have many uncomfortable symptoms. This definitely helps with those symptoms!! I feel like I did before I had thyroid issues!! It's amazing and now a staple in my supplement routine. I would recommend this to anyone dealing with thyroid trouble!!
 Thyroid Support Complex with Iodine from Zhou Nutrition has helped me so much. It gives me energy and keeps me from putting on the unwanted weight than comes along with hypothyroidism. I've tried several other kinds of supplements and this one has worked the best.
 Appears to be working just fine. The first couple days I could actually feel my thyroid glands reacting which could scare people but I thought it must be working? I'm only a few weeks in and seems good so far.
 Empece a tomarlo hace una semana con mi hija, me controla mi ansiedad me da mucha energia , creo que pronto pedire otro me gusta y a mi hija tambien le ha funcionado ,gracias Amazon
 I've been taking this supplement for about 2 weeks.  Overall I can report a slight increase in energy level - I'm definitely feeling less sluggish.  I've also found that I'm less susceptible to carb cravings which has allowed me to successfully stick to my diet plan and lose a bit of weight.  I'm pleased and plan on continuing to use this supplement.
 After doing a self diagnosis and knowing that most of my immediate family members suffer from hypothyroidism, I decided to investigate a natural remedy for thyroid issues. I came across this product and decided to give it a try. I have been taking it religiously for almost 3 months now and have noticed a difference in my health. I have been able to lose weight easier with diet and exercise, where as before taking this product I felt like my efforts did nothing. I also have a relief of other symptoms commonly associated with hypothyroidism. I will continue to use this product, it's great! It's nice to find something that actually works. I will say that like any other supplement if you don't take it consistently it probably won't work like you expect it to.
 This helps! It's hard to know just how much but I can say that it helps enough so that I do not like to let any time lapse between bottles! It has helped with some hormonal issues that I have been having.
 I have been taking this for about three weeks now. It seems to boost my energy levels. I am more productive at work and at home. The energy levels are more natural feeling. Natural as in having energy and the drive from eating healthy not from an energy pill or anything loke that. I was taking two per day but i was having dreams. I know we all dream but I never remember having any until taking two per day<br/> I started just taking one when I wake up the last few weeks and I havent noticed any dreams. The last few days I started back to two per day and haven't noticed any dreams. I'm not sure if it has helped me loose weight but it does seem to curb my appetite. I have lost 6 or 7 lbs but I have been walking more. So i guess you could say it helps give me the motivation to excersize. I will be ordering another bottle.
 I can feel a real difference in energy and stamina with this support capsule!
 I really enjoyed the product. I felt much more energy throughout my day, and it has aided with weight management
 This stuff works !! U do have to take two a day , but it’s worth it!! I feel like crap if I miss a dose !! I don’t feel sleepy or as irritable.
 I have tried a few thyroid supplements with no results. I definitely felt a difference when I started this product, in that I would be hungry and my stomach growling a few hours after eating, and I eat the same things during the workday. So I know it has kicked up my metabolism a bit.
 I took as directed for a week. When I started, my pain levels were high and my energy was tanked. Today, one week later, I have been up and going for 14 hours. I had the energy to mow the lawn, do laundry and housework, and babyset two grandchildren.
 Wasn't sure this stuff was going to work since I was always tired, dragging and had no brain energy. The difference is tremendous. Definitely helpful when you are working and going to grad school. I'm able to get out of bed and have mental energy without any jitters. I will continue to order this. I use their curcumin also which is great for muscle aches and inflammation.
 I am so impressed with this thyroid support supplement! I've been struggling with major fatigue and brain fog for so long, and after just a week on this baby I started seeing a noticeable difference in my energy levels! Definitely will be something I continue to use!
 I feel so much more energized since I've been taking this product. I don't go a day with it!
 Just started using it over a month ago and I have to admit it makes a big difference! More energy =more happiness:)
 I was very skeptical that this product would work as described but I was surprised by how quickly this product worked. Thanks to my thyroid, extreme fluctuations in body temperature kept me awake all night.  Within a matter of days, these issues have nearly been eliminated and I’m actually getting a good nights rest.
 No noticable change in anything after 30 days off taking the product. Nothing... Feel like I just flushed my money down the drain.
 No weight loss with this product but gives me energy.. I have goiter thyroid that is why I chose to take this product and my THC levels have went up some.
 I notice a huge difference in energy. Also, I was on synthroid for years and am now 2 months off of it and only take this. Finally my thyroid levels are normal.
 I have been taking the Thyroid Support capsuls for about a week now.  I<br/>have noticed that I have more energy.
 as described, haven't taken long enough to see results yet.
 Taking it for almost a month.  I have improved energy.  However I still take my Armour and drink coffee.  Not sure what is actually working...  I have a hard time falling asleep now. Kind of a good thing. Caffeine maybe?  Time will tell if this is a long term product.
 it wasn't for me, but the company was very generous.
 I would love to be able to take this product every day, but it makes me irritable and i get headaches
 Definitely could tell a difference with a week of starting this supplement even though I’ve been on synthroid for years with no relief of fatigue or hairloss!! This supplement improved all my symptoms. I plan to continue taking!
 Haven't noticed any difference like many others claim.
 I had been trying many thyroid natural remedies. Finally a Supplement that truly helps. I did not realize just how much until I quit taking it for over 2 months. I did not feel energetic after I did not reorder. I looked for other reasons, just was not thinking right. I tried other idea's , not necessarily a Thyroid helper but a feel better, more energy supplement. Nothing helped. Then I looked back on my Amazon orders of what I was taking when I felt better. This Thyroid Support is what it was. I am back taking it and notice I am getting things done. Also some weight loss , not a lot but I feel like moving and I think that is what is helping also. It is good!!! It Works! If anyone thinks it may only work for certain people, this could be true, but for the price, I strongly suggest trying it.
 I cannot praise this product enough. I went from crashing fatigue syndrome to actually having enough energy to work out, stay up and do projects for work, and generally live life to the fullest. I could sleep for 12 hours straight before and still be dragging exhausted, but this has completely changed me. Excellent product, I'm a believer.
 I started using this after feeling sluggish throughout the day chasing my 3 year old around.  I LOVE it.  Nothing harmful and no more constant doctors visits to try and find a supplement to work.  Ill use this forever!
 It has only been a couple of weeks since I purchased this product and I can not believe how much better I feel since I have been taking it.  I am more alert and have so much more energy.  I bought it because I had purchased from this company before and was happy with their quality.  I am really happy with the Thyroid Support!.
 I've been taking this for almost a month and I do find I have more energy. Treatment for a hyperactive thyroid lesion left me tired all the time, and I feel like my system is "rebooting" slowly.
 I had a total thyroidectomy about 4 years ago. I feel like one pill a day does not suffice for all the roles the thyroid does. I am severely hypothyroid and suffer from a multitude of horrible symptoms. This is my first time EVER trying a thyroid support. The first time I took this pill, I was a bit jittery, like my chest felt accelerated and my hands were sweaty. It was weird but I wasn't uncomfortable at all just a jittery and sweaty feeling the very first dose I took. Never happened again. I only take ONE pill a day because I am trying to make the bottle last-  I'm student/mom and have a limited budget ( I WISH i can be part of this "free or discounted " program everyone is apprarently on... ) So far Ive been able to lose 6 lbs in one month, Its mainly due to my recent diet plan and daily excerise and weekly spin class ! I can't notice a significant difference, but I hope this is what's helping me lose pounds ( and you know how hard that is being thyroidless) but I cant be sure. Other than the first day with the sweaty hands and jittery chest... I can't feel a difference ! im hoping long-term it will help .
 Even with "normal" thyroid test results, something was off-brittle nails, thinning hair no energy-all classic signs of a thyroid problem. Just purchased another bottle because I've seen a significant improvement overall with my health
 I choose this product because my thyroid function tests were in the low-end of normal range. After using this product for a few weeks I had lab tests done and I showed improvement in my thyroid function levels.<br/> Granted it could be a fluctuation in test results  but I believe that this product works .
 Actually really liked this. Felt slight increase in energy but not much. Mainly noticed I was actually slimming down quicker when combined with diet and exercise. As always, when supplementing it is diet and exercise that is KEY. Would buy again.
 I'm loving Thyroid support. During the 2 mo I've been using this product I have more energy and my brain fog has gone away.
 This has truly made all the difference in my day to day. While this isn't my only supplement, this has certainly made many of them more manageable by the ample supply of needs met in taking 2 of these per day. I was suffering from an iodine deficiency, which was impacting many other areas of my thyroid health - I had taken iodine supplements previously, but they were smelly and messy. This is my second order of Thyroid Support and, combined with my Ferritin (seriously, if you have Hashimoto's, look into Ferritin as well) I've seen a dramatic change in my energy, sleep and ability to concentrate. Additionally, the team at Zhou has been very attentive, checking in to see how I felt after taking the supplement. Really wowed by their product and service. Thank you so much!
 Great product! I have hypothyroid and this really helps manage symptoms. More energy and u feel ski much better throughout my day when taking this supplement.
 I have more energy yet am sleeping better.  Both are a major life Improvement.
 Amazing product instantly felt better after not feeling so well from hypothyroidism. I’ve used other brands before but this one by far works I Stanton for me and will not miss a dose :) thank you!!!! Just received also collagen and excited to try!
 This affordable yet high quality supplement has been a wonderful addition to my Hashimoto's regiment. I have felt more in control of emotions and less in pain for months now. I take NDT Nature Throid along with Turmeric and other supplements. This supplement is a deep green gel pill and easy to swallow. Love it!
 I really wanted to like these after reading all of the positive reviews. Unfortunately, these didn't work for me and I didn't feel any different when taking them. I've taken the whole bottle and would not purchase again.
 On my 3rd bottle. Works great! Better than anything else I’ve ever tried. Kelp makes all the difference and I’ve taken kelp which is awesome but this is even better. No jitters.. energy all day. Just feel great and no crash. I still love coffee in the morning just for the sake of having it.
 I have to say that I recommend it.<br/>I was undecided to buy it cuz I say probably it wont work, but definitely it Does, For a week I been taking the pills  and I feel great for reals. I take Levothyroxine in the morning I wait 4 hours and then I take thyroid support and lots of water!!
 I am taking medication that has affected my metabolism and was extremely frustrated. I have noticed a subtle difference since taking this supplement. I feel like over time it's definitely going to help me to maintain a healthier metabolism.
 I bought it based on the good FeedBack’s, but after using half of bottle, I should tell you that please do not waste your money, it makes you, hungry and tired. Such a waste of time and money.
 I just finished my first bottle of this and all I can say is Wow! I could tell a difference in my energy levels within the first couple days. I don't need an afternoon nap anymore. This is a jittery type energy boat, but the energy levels I had when I was younger (I'm 43). I will definitely buy this again and use it regularly with my daily supplements.
 I purchased this product a few months ago to help with mental concentration and fatigue I suffer from on a daily basis due to an auto immune condition. I have noticed a great improvement with mental clarity and lessened fatgiue since starting this medication. I would definetly recommend it.
 No real difference. Was even more tired after taking.
 I have this on my subscribe and save and get a bottle every month. I really like this product. It has helped me maintain my weight after a doctor -supervised weight loss program, in which I discovered I had a slight thyroid dysfunction. Will continue to buy.
 Great product! Definitely recommend this to anyone who has hypothyroidism like myself. Just FYI I sent the link to these supplements to my doctor and she told me that they won't interfere with my daily medication at all! I'm taking Nature-Throid but I assume it's ok to take with the other medications as well! :)
 I have hypothyroidism, and currently take medication for it. I was very concerned that this product included soy in the ingredients. Soy is proven to affect negatively the T3 hormone. I have cosulted with various Endocrinologist to confirm this information. Having that said if this supplement eliminated the soy ingredient i would most definitely purchase this again.
 I'm sorry this product did nothing for me except create anxiety and depression. All it really is is vitaman B. It not only did clear brain fog it really screwed up my head. I wouldn't use it but if you do be careful.
 Noticed no difference, I was really hoping these would help after reading all of the reviews. I finally finished off my bottle and still no difference =(
 I've been taking this product for two weeks and have noticed improvement in my energy levels. This seems to help keep me balanced. I would definitely recommend.
 i think it helps.. i am still pretty thin but then i eat healthy, i detox often, i walk 4-6 miles a few times a week...
 Zhou's Thyroid Supplement, actually works! Within 24 hours of taking this for the first time I experienced a overall sense of well being, calmness, balance and I started to feel temperature regulating to temperature changes back to close to my normal state before I started to develop Thyroid issues. I bought two bottles and love the 100% satisfaction guarantee the company offered! Yes, I would strongly recommend this product! It also offers some other interesting positive side effects if you know what I mean!
 Really wanted to see what the hype was about.  But this did absolutely nothing for me.  Finished the bottle and I don't feel any different.  Contacted customer service and they were no help... I feel duped :/
 This is the only thyroid support aid I've ever taken that actually got me through the days when my energy is at its lowest. I don't need to dose myself with copious amounts of caffeine just to function anymore!
 No change
 I have felt more energized since I started taking this! I have lost a few pounds and do not feel nearly as exhausted as I use to.
 Definitely less tired after taking 1 month.  I also noticed losing weight and less brain fog.  I would like to continue to see if these benefits continue to improve.
 This really has helped with my mental clarity.  It took a couple of days and I actually noticed how well it was working.
 My husband takes these and they help with his thyroid meds.
 Great product,received on expected date. I'm into natural products and discovered this product on amazon. I been using this product for several days and feel great. I purchased the thyroid and water supplement and will reorder again. I'm over 50 and strongly recommend natural products best for me. Highly recommend.
 This actually works. Worth the purchase.
 I purchased Zhou Nutrition Thyroid Support about 2 weeks ago. Within the first few days I felt significantly less tired. I wasn't falling asleep on the couch like I always do. I have energy to take walks in the morning when we wake up. I haven't seen any weight loss yet but it has only been about 2 weeks and I haven't changed my diet. I am very pleased with just how much better I feel after taking this vitamin!
 I started taking this thyroid supplement because I was feeling fatigued and cold all the time. I definitely have more energy since I started taking this.
 Since taking this vitamin I have more energy and my hair has become healthy again! I highly recommend Zhou Thyroid Complex.
 This product works very well. I am more energised and less anxious. All of the supplements work well together IMHO. Thanks ZHOU
 Very good product.  I thought aging had me sluggish. 2 days after starting this product. I had all my energy back and I am feeling 10 years younger.  Thank you
 This stuff has brought my whole body back into balance. My OB looked at the ingredients and said it was everything good that my body needed and then proceeded to test my thyroid after six months on this. My numbers were perfect  and I've lost almost 30 pounds.  There is a side effect for women but it's extremely positive. My sex drive has soared! I've recommended this to numerous friends and they seem to be happy with it as well.
 No negative side effects. Starting to see some results
 I have used Thyroid Support now for 2 weeks. I felt my prescription thyroid medication alone just wasn't enough for my hypothyroidism. This supplement has truly given me an extra boost. I don't feel as fatigued and I am actually losing some weight. I'm anxious to see the continue effects!
 I feel so much better since taking this! The prescribed medicine just wasn’t working ! I feel like my old self again !
 I love it! I haven't seen the weight loss others mentioned but I feel amazing when I take it!
 Almost finished with my first bottle abd couldn’t be happier. I can really tell a difference in my overall well being. Definitely will continue!
 Use product to aid in regulation of thyroid to aid in energy and weight loss. I noticed gradually, more energy and less cravings for sweets 🍫
 I've just ordered a second bottle of this. I was feeling so tired and this has helped me to feel more energized. I'm sleeping better and noticing less brain fog. Will continue to use this product and I think I'll give a bottle to my daughter who is a new mom and had half her thyroid removed. I'm sure she could use the boost!
 seems to help.
 Better than I expected. I have tried many things and this one is the BEST! I take with food due to the cayenne but makes me feel better!
 I Love this product it was exactly what I ws looking for. I had problem's with my metabolism and a lack of energy before I tried this product. I take it everyday before eating a meal, and afterwards I'm left with more energy, my thoughts are clear because I can focus more, and I was able to lose 5 pounds in 2 weeks while exercising with this its great!
 All women must get this! It will give you energy, a sharp mind, and put you in a great mood. It has iodine, magnesium, selenium, copper, B-12, manganese, cayenne and more! These are all essential vitamins, minerals and spices that are good for the body. For Zhou Nutrition to put them all together is awesome! I also lost five pounds not even trying. Buy it today!
 I am very pleased with this product. I am hypothyroid and am taking this along with d3 and astaxathin (sp?) for about a year. Just this past month I had to request bloodwork ahead of schedule because of heart palpitations (which having hypothyroidism I knew I needed to back off the Synthroid). The results came in showing I definitely needed to cut back my synthroid. And the only thing I can say is I think this product is helping somehow.
 I've only been taking this for half a month but so far, I feel like it's made a difference in my mood and energy level. I've never been tested for thyroid problems, but had many symptoms of hypothyroidism and I figured I would give this a try before getting tested at the doctor. I will update more after I've been taking it longer.
 I liked this. Helped me feel not as blah and tired.
 Gave this 4 stars and not 5, because I was not able to stop taking synthroid, however my energy levels increase dramatically!  I will keep using this product.
 I am working to lose some weight but wasn't having much luck and thought I would try this product. This is week two of taking the Thyroid Support. It seems to be working. I feel better, have more energy and am even down a few lbs. I feel confident about this product and have ordered a second bottle.
 I took this consistently for 2 months, but it did nothing for me. 🙁
 This did not work for me and will not order again.
 These are easy to take no after taste and really do help. I felt less fatigued and more clear headed . I would say it takes about 1 week for you to feel the difference.
 I had been taking a liquid iodine supplement for a few years. When I initially took it, I noticed a difference and my levels came into the low level of normal. That supplement was out of stock on Amazon and this was a suggested product. I figured I would try a bottle and then switch back to my liquid one. After about a week and a half, I realized that I was back to my old self. I lost the brain fog and was sleeping better through the night! This supplement has more than just iodine and is well rounded. This is my new supplement! If you are taking a multivitamin with this and you are usually sensitive, it might make you nauseated. I just take my multi in the morning and this at lunch or night.
 Definitely seen a difference since I've been using. More energy and even though I have been eating horribly my metabolism is definitely faster.
 I have been using Thyroid Support Complex for almost a month and have seen no difference in weight or other symptoms :-( very disappointing, I have a low Thyroid and HATE taking any type of medicine. I wanted to try this as it showed positive differences in some people. I am not wanted them.
 I was skeptical at first, but within a few days I found my entire mood changed. I feel more alert and calm. I only take one a day instead of the recommended two and I really notice a difference. I wouldn highly recommend. I suffer from Hashimotos and take 100mg of Synthroid daily to balance. This was a game changer.
 I got the shakes &amp; felt worse taking these. 👎🏻 They did boost energy but feeling shaky &amp; sick trumped any good of it. Disappointed, was really hoping for a great outcome.
 Excellent!! Should definitely get 5 stars! Reading reviews...a few negative but our bodies are all different.  Overall,  the reviews are positive. I went without for a month due to surgery and felt so weak and  depressed, once back in my system..a new me!!!
 I have been taking these for about three months now and I have already lost 18 lbs, something I was not doing even while going to the gym 4 days a week. I even have more energy and seem to be happier. I have these on auto ship just so I do not forget to order and run out.
 I feel like this product is exactly what my body needed.<br/>I always like to have this on hand<br/>Love this product!
 I am not sure this is helping yet. I am sleeping longer.
 This stuff works great! Definitely a good energy boost.
 Thyroid support has given me my energy back after 2weeks. I will stay on this because my pre<br/>Prescription medications have not helped. As far as weight loss I am not sure because I doe not weigh myself. Although my pants are a little lose. Maybe it's weight or water. Also there are no side effects which I am happy about. Will continue using this product even if only helps with my energy. Thank you
 This thyroid support has proven excellent I've begun to awake alert and ready for a the day My energy remains full with no afternoon crashes I recognize improved alertness as well as spare energy to exercise My hands and feet are less cold than previously as well The support I was taking before this one apparently was non effective as I quickly noticed these improvements after 5-7 days of taking Thyroid Support Complex
 Can’t tell that they have helped me at all.<br/>Won’t order again.<br/>I wasted my money.
 I was so excited to try this product but gave me massive headaches. Can't continue with them. They did help with energy levels just can't deal with the headaches.
 It has definitely improved my energy and mood.  I have also noticed a difference in bloating and inflammation while taking this.  I will b ordering again soon.
 I have been using this product for almost 6 months now.  I use it with my Nature Throi medication.  I have noticed a huge difference in my energy, focus, and metabolism.  I love this product.
 It's really made a difference in my overall mood since I began taking it.
 I've been taking this in place of the levothyrozine I was on for over 15 years! I feel wonderful!!! (I do not recommend going off your prescriptions without your doctor's consent)
 I have suffered with thyroid issues for 25 years and I have felt my best when  taking this supplement..this product works better for me than syntheroid!
 This is legit the best! I'm currently on medication for an underactive thyroid. That medicine always makes me so tired, with no energy. This has saved the day! No more tiredness. Lots of energy! And I'm able to focus on my work!
 Pleasantly surprised and pleased  with product, notable increase in energy with steady 2 to 3 lbs a week weight loss. I am not usually a fan of buying supplements from sites which it is not the primary business (Amazon) but will definitely be more open minded going forward.  Will buy again and again.
 LOVE it OMG<br/><br/> I finished two bottles so far my energy is back after being diagnosed 4 years ago with hypothyroidism. Also my dr said my recent labs show my T levels are almost back to normal. I am so happy and will continue to order this product.
 #'s came back a little high - so I decided to try this as a friend recommended it before going the pharmaceutical route .<br/>My voice had been hoarse for a very long time - that is gone. Sleeping is better. Hope my #'s come back normal on next check!!
 Wouldn't have believed it until I tried this for 30 days and when I ran out I could DEFINETLY tell a difference. #Hashimotosucks!
 I have been taking this supplement for 2 months now, and I can certainly say it has made a huge difference on my energy levels and other symptoms.  My thyroid numbers were always borderline, doctors told me they weren't "low enough" for treatment.  I decided to start taking this to try to address the issue on my own. I am so glad I did!  I would highly recommend for anyone who suspects they have low thyroid.
 This is the BEST supplement I have ever tried. I buy two bottles every month for my husband and I. If I miss one day I can feel the difference. I have Hashimotos but my TSH is normal so I'm not on medications and this supplement has made me feel normal again! Try and you'll see why it's recommended and praised so much.
 I didn't see or feel a difference.  It maybe something I didn't really need.
 I have bought it for my teenage son, and he has been taking it for two- three weeks now. It is difficult to to say if it does anything or not yet. May be he needs to take it longer.
 I have been taking Synthroid for years and still felt tired and sluggish and I am half a bottle in and have had twice as much energy on a dailey love this product!
 I have taken this for several months and it was working great. I had more energy and I was able to keep from gaining weight. Recently, it started causing digestive issues. Unfortunately, I've developed an intolerance to soy, so I have to stop taking it. I'm very disappointed.
 I am appreciative of the quality of the product and effect of the additional B in my vitamin regime
 Absolutely love this product noticed a difference the first time I took it!! I’m more focused not hazy and drained like I normally felt going throughout my day totally helps to balance me out I liked it so much I got my mom to try it since she suffers with thyroid issues to and we are both hooked now it’s part of my daily routine in the morning !
 After taking this for a little less than a month i have noticed my fatigue lower which is great! Im excited to see what else this will improve!
 I ordered this because of the reviews, but I have been taking it for 2 weeks now and I cannot say that there is any improvement. I have even been more lazy and sluggish. Very disappointed. Waste of money.
 Love it! Compliments well with Zhou's other products.
 This product works very well for me.  I normally have cold hands and feet but they and the rest of my body warm up when taking this product.  I was diagnosed with a sluggish thyroid, but only want to take natural products.  This has helped!
 Keeps my thyroid healthier
 I really enjoyed this the first week and a half or so of taking them but now it seems like it doesn't make any difference. Not sure if I will repurchase. I was hoping this would be life changing by reading some people's reviews.
 I was hopeful,  but it didn't help
 So far, so good! Seems to be working. I also take vitamin B12, which gives me more energy.
 I had tried another Thyroid support before trying Zhou and this one is much better including easier to take. After years of being told my thyroid was therapeutic yet still not feeling well, taking a support like this has been a life saver!
 throw away the money
 I can feel that it has improved my metabolism.  I could not lose weight before, even with daily exercise, but now I can.
 Didnt help. Was hoping but unfortunately I was dissappointed
 Got these for my daughter who has issues with her thyroid. She noticed it's effects almost immediately. She says she can think clearer and has much more energy!
 I skipped a few days and I felt the difference!  I feel like it helps with energy and "brain fog".
 I’ve been taking this for 3 days and feel more alert, energetic and seems to help with brain fog ~ I’ll post again after a few weeks of use
 I didn’t notice huge changes but did see improvement in my sleep and energy level after one month. Perhaps more effects in time Liked that it didn’t make me nauseous at all. Customer service was fantastic. They were willing to refund my money or give replacement if I wasn’t satisfied
 I've been taking this for 3 weeks now and am really starting to notice an increase in my energy levels! Haven't lost any weight really but am so impressed with the energy I will continue to take!
 I really have seen a huge increase in my energy level. I love this. It makes me want to get up and get the day started. Thank you for this product!! Will definitely reorder.
 This has really helped improve my energy and control my weight. I was gaining weight very rapidly after weaning my son and my hormones being out of wack but now I’m stabilizing and even losing weight!
 So far I like this Thyroid Support It help me go to the bathroom.I have a hard time going to the bathroom.I'm not sure if it helping me to lose weight because I Didn't weight myself yet.I Just brought a Second bottle.I will let you all Know how the Second bottle works..Going to weight myself before I start the second bottle.
 I didn't know what was wrong with me...I had always had several irons in the fire and do everything I attempted very well but in the past year, I went from a once-a-week-much-beloved nap to a daily 3-4 hour nap, fatigue with just a little bit of activity, and the WORST brain fog ever (so much so that I couldn't get any irons out of that fire).  And I was losing hair too...and so sensitive to cold that I was layered up everyday at home with the heater going.  Finally I went to reputable sites and started reading up on my symptoms and of course, I was meeting the criteria of someone with some thyroid issues.  So among other tests, I requested a full thyroid workup...results came back with my TSH as within normal limits but very high antibodies which my endocrinologist said was 'attacking the thyroid'.  I asked him what I should do about it and he said 'nothing to do'.  Well, that wasn't good enough for me!  So I came to Amazon and looked up thyroid support and found Thyroid Support Complex with Iodine.  Within 3 days, my brain fog was a 100% better!  I hadn't even realized how bad it had been until it was better...more importantly, I was able to get a grant proposal written (no way I could've done that before starting Thyroid Support).  Hair loss has slowed down greatly...it's winter time so I don't know about the 'feeling cold' has gotten better but the napping is decreasing and fatigue getting better.  I've only been on it a month and just got my second bottle so I have no doubts that all will continue to improve.  :)
 It took a week or so but I definitely have noticed increased energy and I have lost a couple pounds without changing my diet. I am planning to continue taking these, they are a good quality product
 I had ordered 3 bottles. But received only 2 bottles. I am not sure where to complain and i am now skeptical to buy again. I am going to open a chargeback if i do not receive any reply soon.
 I was diagnosed with an enlarged thyroid but the blood work fell within normal ranges. I was tired all the time and had a sore throat.  I decided to try the Thyroid Support and it has made a big difference in how I feel and the soreness is gone.
 Very satisfied with results. Noticeable increase in energy levels &amp; appetite control. Weight loss has been slow, but steady. Will definitely keep using &amp; recommending this amazing product.
 I struggle with my thyroid and have many blood tests to check on it. Its within normal range but just barely. I am always tired, have low energy and just cant seem to function without almost half a days worth of sleep. After about 3 days of taking this thyroid support i noticed a huge difference! More energy, didnt feel sluggish and  was up and awake after 7hrs of sleep. By awake i mean functioning like a normal person not a sloth. This supplement has really helped. I take it along with a daily multi vitamin.
 This product is great!!! I feel a big difference since I have taken this. My doctor said my thyroid wasn’t working. I wanted herbs not prescription. I love this product. Thank you..
 There has been no change and I don’t feel any differently than before
 Good stuff. I only take one in the morning and have definitely noticed that I don't get as run down by mid day as I used to. Have also noticed a decrease in appetite.
 It leaves me feeling energized in the morning. Great stuff.
 Didn't feel much of a difference.
 Seems to be helping, almost taken the whole month now and with diet and exercise I really see a health improvement!
 Loved it and felt amazing within 2 days!
 Pass on this.
 I will definitely be reordering! This thyroid supplement has helped so much with increased energy and focus, but best of all it has helped to settle down my anxiety!
 i have subclinical hypothryoidism and this did nothing for me :(
 So far so good. After 1 week of using this I have lost 5 pounds. I have more energy and generally feeling better in myself.  My colleagues have also seen a change and are wanting to get some themselves.
 This has made a huge difference in how I feel.  No longer exhausted is a huge plus.  Would recommend trying even if you are not diagnosed with a thyroid problem but have similar symptoms.
 I was hopeful that this supplement would add some energy back to my days, but I'm suffering a side effect if miserable gas and stomach bloating. I stopped for a few days and side effects stopped, then resumed once I tried these again. I'm certain the effect is from the thyroid supplements.
 This product is absolutely amazing and THE REAL DEAL!!  I haven't felt this good in years!  Noticed a difference in energy levels within 12 hours. I take one pill at night and one in the morning. I'm sold for life!!
 I feel more energized in general taking this product. It also has all of the nutritional components in one formula that my doctor recommended I take to support my thyroid.
 Love this product! It boost my energy and mood within a few weeks of using it! In combination with my prescription this helps make my days easier and reduced my legargy greatly! If you're at your witts end like i was this is worth it!
 After a flurry of tests which came back good, I was still discouraged with my low energy and weakness. When I read how the Thyroid Support supplement had worked so well for others I decided to give it a try.  Within a couple of weeks I noticed i had more energy all day!  After the first bottle, I was thrilled. Saw my doctor today and he said to stay on it as long as it is working.
 After 30 days of use, I didn’t experience a noticeable increase in energy levels or health.
 It's the perfect compliment with my thyroid medication! I was still feeling foggy and run down with just my prescription. Since taking this, the fog has been lifted!
 I did not feel any difference
 I really like this product. A few days before it arrived, I had stopped drinking coffee. After starting this product, My energy seems to be at an even burn all day. No afternoon crash. Maybe it's a coincidence but I WANT to get out and exercise! It's been a while since I have felt this good from the inside out. I've gained about 50# in the last 7 years. I feel good about tackling this and succeeding at letting it all go. I plan to keep taking this as part of my daily regime.
 Out of all the thyroid support supplements I have tried, this by far is the best. It not only helps with my energy levels but it also helps with my mood and memory. I have a 7 year old and a 2 year old plus I'm a nursing student so energy and memory are very important to me. I would highly recommend this product
 This is the only thing that has truly given me more energy and less sleepless nights ever since I got diagnosed with Hashimoto's. I have been using it for over a month now and within the first two to three weeks notice a difference!!!
 I've been struggling with thyroid disease since I was 19 and over the past 10 years, I've tried so many different products that claim to offer thyroid support, and this is the first one that seems to help. I've struggled with weight loss over the past 10 years, and even with good diet and exercise I wasn't really able to lose any weight. So I discovered this product about a month ago and I've bean taking it consistently (along with diet and exercise) and i've been consistently losing weight. Great product!
 I don't normally submit reviews, but this has been working great for me. I have been diagnosed borderline for close to 20 years, but doctors will never prescribe medication - this seems to do the trick for me. I would recommend for others in my situation.
 I've been using thyroid support for a few weeks. It helps me feel energized and not so sleepy all the time. I have been able to enjoy doing more thing with my children. I love this product.
 I have used this product as prescribed and honestly can not tell after going through a bottle whether I feel any better or any worse. I did not drop any weight.
 I love this product! I've been using it for about 6 months and was able to completely eliminate my synthetic thyroid medications.  Will definitely continue ordering.
 Ive been taking these for a month and have only gained weight. I feel a rush of energy at first, almost like I took a shot of espresso and then crashed a few hours later. I started getting headaches soon after taking these supplements, not sure if that is the cause but I will see now that I will stop taking them.
 I think it's doing something ! My last Doc appointment my Thyroid TSH level was off ; I'm hoping to surprise her !
 It gave me energy and alertness. Wasn’t as sluggish as normal. I have normal thyroid but after taking this I felt better thruout the day. When I didn’t take it, I felt it
 My wife had more energy while using this!
 Felt better after a week
 I am just completing the first bottle of Thyroid Support. I have felt more energetic, have experienced a reduced urge to eat between meals and have lost 6 pounds. I have not had any adverse effects. I would recommend this product.
 Gave me energy , grew &amp; hardened my nails ! ( a surprise ) as well as gives a full feeling thats comfortable as well . Im sure the other benefits to my body are working fantastic . Great product !
 I have been to the doctor twice to check to see if I have a thyroid problem. My grandma had to have thyroid surgery. Thyroid problems are a major problem for my immediate family as well. We suffer from depression as well. I read somewhere that a thyroid problem is linked to depression. I bought a bottle off of Amazon and am thoroughly impressed. I'm about to have to order again. I only have a few pills left. I do feel like I can focus better and have quit taking my Lexapro for depression as well. I feel happier and my husband also told me that I look skinner. That is definitely a plus! Love this product!!
 I have not completed my first bottle yet but I can tell I do not feel as tired as before.
 DID NOT help me with anything, felt more tired than before, gained weight, felt more bloated, felt sluggish all day, did not want to do anything.
 I've tried many supplements, and nothing curbs my hunger like these. Since I started taking these pills about two weeks ago, I've lost 3 pounds and felt more energized throughout my day. I finally have the energy to work out regularly! I'm not constantly thinking about food! Thanks, Zhou Nutrition
 I love this stuff,  I just order my third bottle yesterday.  I've tried other thyroid pills with no results,  but i have lost weight and have more energy!
 I was very unhappy with this product it didn't do anything it said it would. I didn't lose weight and was just as tired as I was before I started taking it.
 Well long story short I went to the doctor and he told me that my thyroid was a little high but of course no treatment or nothing for me, so I was reading the reviews from this supplement and some people been losing weight on this so I was ok let's give it a try... and after a month I didn't lose weight but this supplement did something weyyy better, it helped me with my dizziness/ vértigo and lightheaded and another veryyy important thing ISURTISM. OMG it's like a miracle, after 1 month my facial hair had improve a lott. So,yes just ordered my 2 nd one, love it!!thank youuu!
 I've been taking this a week now. I have hypothyroidism and take synthroid daily. But I still have brain fog, carpal tunnel occasionally and lack of energy. So far Ive only noticed a few differences<br/><br/>I have more energy. But I'm also not sleeping well. I was taking the supplements at night, I switched to the mornings when I eat breakfast (you're suppose to take synthroid an hour before food and then take these supplements with food). but haven't noticed a change in my sleep since taking these in the morning (4 days so far)<br/><br/>My biggest change may be TMI. But it's my bowels. Every morning I have a major bm. Huge. Not wide and painful, just long and powerful.... again, TMI, sorry. But I have uncomfortable cramps for an hour or more before hand and then relief feelings for hours afterward. They don't hurt but make me well aware of my bowels. It's not bad enough to quit (yet). I'm hoping my body is just adjusting. Before meds, I had a bm 2-3 times a week. On synthroid alone, its daily. But with this supplement it's um... powerful is the best adjective I can think of. And 1-3 times a day now. With as much as is coming out, I guess this means my metabolism is in overdrive and i should soon see some major weight lose?? At the rate I'm going, i better lose weight! I think everything I eat goes to poo. It's not diarrhea. It's just powerful long giant BMs.... now I need to find and buy a portable plunger. Haha.<br/><br/>My urine is also different. The smell is quite odorous. Not bad, just strong. I found that if I drink more water, I don't notice the smell. I read that b vitamins can cause that to happen.<br/><br/>I'll finish the bottle and update after I've been on them a month. I sure hope my bowels adjust to this soon.
 Super bummed.  After all the good reviews I had high expectations. Unfortunately  Did nothing for me.  Felt no difference
 Wow my heart races with this
 An excellent blend of ingredients that provide maximum support for the thyroid. I saw an improvement after using these for a month. These were easy to take and I thought that the price was reasonable.
 Love this product! I take this everyday and on mornings I forget I definitely feel more lethargic. It has changed my days for the better!
 I looked it, it definitely have me energy and I did notice I feel better overall!
 Didnt do anything for me.
 After only 2 days I felt so much more motivated than on just my Thyroid medication. I felt I had more energy and a willingness to get more done and accomplished. I am glad I decided to give this Zhou Thyroid Support Complex with Iodine a try; I will be getting it each month!
 So far so good, I haven’t felt any major changes/weight loss etc yet, but feel more awake and energized. Will post an update after I finish my second bottle
 I've been on this for almost a month now, I've noticed a bit more energy and it seems to be helping my metabolism. I've recommended it to my friends who have hashimotos and hypothyroidism as well. I use this along with my armour prescription daily.
 Didn't get a different
 For me other brands work better
 I'm not being paid or receiving any "additional benefits" for posting my review BUT this stuff WORKS. I'm a generally physically healthy 37 year old Mom and wife but have struggled with mental fatigue (which ends up translating as physical fatigue), depression and anxiety for over nine years. Although I have been taking two different prescription anti-anxiety/anti-depression medications for over three years I have still felt like a "shell" of who I used to be. This year I had my thyroid levels checked by my Doctor and although everything came back within acceptable limits I decided to try this product to test whether or not it would<br/>have any effect on my mood and energy. While I can't say that this product alone has been a "miracle worker" I do think that it has played a significant part in my road to recovery. As a recovering alcoholic and prescription drug abuser (Adderall: if you've never taken it I beg you not to start) I've also been taking Neuphorin (can also be purchased on Amazon), Magnesium and Niacinamide to boost my system. The latter two supplements are often suggested for former alcoholics and really do seem to fill in the nutritional gaps that possibly played a part in my former excessive desire for alcohol. If you can mentally check off any of the struggles that I've mentioned above I can't imagine why you would not TRY this Thyroid Supplement- in almost all cases, it can't hurt and might actually surprise you with it's effectiveness! I'm now over 130 days alcohol free and almost a year Adderall-free: pretty awesome and very encouraging. Last thought: the company even offers a money back guarantee--you can't lose, even if you don't feel that it works for your individual needs---"win-win"!
 terrible made me and my wife feel sick  im very disappointed  must have got a bad bottle
 Good product
 Ive used for over a month and waited to review to see if it really worked or not. Im a full time mom and work. As i get closer to 40 i notice that im literally tired all day.<br/>I tried jet alert and any stay awake pills i could find.<br/>Ive had my thyroid checked. Was put on meds for depression to see if it helped me. And nothing.<br/>I decided to try energy pill search on amazon and ordered these.<br/>I feel the affects. Im not dragging threw the day. Im not grumpy. I dont spend the day yawning.<br/>By bed time im ready for bed.<br/>Im so happy about this product
 Taking synthroid, but high dosage caused heart palpitations. So I now take a lower dose with Thyroid Support and I am feeling better. More energy and sleeping better.
 I', sure this works for a lot of people, but after trying it for awhile, I am just not feeling any extra energy or focus. I wanted it to work, but it just isn't doing much for me.
 I purchased this product began taking 2 pills per day faithfully- has done nothing for me! Won’t buy again.
 One of the best Thyroid support supplements. Increases my energy. Won't be without it. Have energy to spare. Highly recommend for anyone battling low thyroid issues. Very helpful with assisting with losing weight.
 I've been taking it almost a full month. I can't say that it has changed my energy level or weight much yet.  I am going to give it another month because if you've been deficit of energy and living with mind fog for awhile,  it may take more than one month to really see good results.  Also for half of the month I have been on an new medication from the doctor that may be adversely affecting the results of the thyroid support supplement by causing a weak feeling with headaches.  I will need to update again after the doctor either changes or cancels the other medication.
 I have been taking nutritional supplements for years and did not find any change from taking this product.  Will not reorder.
 I have hashimotos and wanted to see if this supplement made a difference for me, it did not help with fatigue or weight loss.  I took it for 2 weeks every day.  I didn't notice feeling any different when taking this supplement.
 The product looks fine inside and I want to try it but the packaging was all crushed as well as the bottle<br/><br/>Update: not 24 hours after they read my review they corrected the issue with a refund!!!<br/>And my first bottle that came had been amazing! I have not felt this good in a long time
 I love this I feel like makes me feel lighter have weighed my self but I feel that it helps me when I drink it I can tell the different I feel better and I know I’m the long run I will notice more results would recommend
 Jury is still out on whether it works!
 I noticed a good difference so far but still too early to tell.  Will take another blood test soon to see if there is a difference.
 Best natural thyroid support supplement...I have been on a prescription for years and found that I no longer need it.  Not only does it help with the function of the thyroid but my energy level is high and my skin looks even better.
 I have an under active thyroid and I've been taking these vitamins along with my prescription thyroid medication. The vitamins have been great. They give me energy and make me feel really good. I have purchased these twice now. I'm very glad I tried them. I reccomend these for anyone with thyroid issues!
 I really wanted this to be the answer to all my problems, but it wasn't.  It gave me a headache and an achy body.  I have been using Hairfluence by Zhou for several months and I love it, so i thought this would be a good addition.  This just wasn't for me.
 This is a great product! I am borderline hypothyroid so my doctor won’t prescribe medication, but I experience all of the symptoms. This supplement gives me more energy!
 I have taken this Thyroid Support for about a month and have noticed a significant increase in natural energy...not jittery like with caffeine! It has put me in a better mood and I have the energy for my busy days!
 I have hypothyroidism and I do not take any medications. I feel that this helps out with the fatigue that comes from being hypothyroid. I have a lot more energy after taking these.
 This product works great for me. I have been telling my doctor for a while now that something was wrong with my thyroid but they never could find anything. Since I've been taking these supplements I can feel the difference in my energy level. I plan to continue using them.
 I LOVE this product. I have Hashimoto's and this helps so much! Thank you so much!!
 I’m going with 4 stars because I haven’t noticed much of a difference. I am going to give this product 90 Days (I’ve been sick and traveling) before I make a full judgement. But the pills are average sized, no strong smell, simple enough to take. I’m still hopeful that more consistency on my part will help see results as others have.
 Love this product!
 Works pretty good. 8 was sceptical at first.
 I started feeling bloated not sure if its connected to this product or not, but disappointed and am going to stop taking.
 I just started taking this and I feel better. I can't wait to get my labs run again so I can see how this is helping me.
 A friend recommended this to me and now I'm on my second bottle. I work a lot of hours (60+ every week) and have trouble staying awake and also with losing weight. I started taking this and I'm finally seeing weight loss and have more energy than I have in a long time. Well worth it.
 Helpful
 Easy to take and no side effects so far (I’m almost finished with the bottle). I also feel a bit more energized.
 I have been using this product for 4 months now and have been very pleased! After using it for a few weeks I noticed several changes in my body. I am not tired, I have more energy throughout the day, I haven't felt moody, and to top it off I lost 4 pounds! This product truly has been amazing and I would recommend it to anyone suffering from a thyroid issue.
 Great product! I've had thyroid issues for a long time and I can feel the difference when I take this product. The company has great customer service and stands by their products.  This is one of several supplies I take from them and am very happy.
 I have lost 50 lbs using this product. It gave me energy and not the type where I will crash after hours of not taking it. It also made me focus it is ideal for me. I didn't feel any or see any adverse effects
 Just ordered my second bottle , I feel like I have more energy .
 Very good, doesn't give me an upset stomach
 Not sure
 I started taking Natural Thyroid along with my regular thyroid medicine. Within days I started feeling more energetic and I began losing weight. I've been taking it for a month and 10lbs have disappeared. I'm so happy with this product that I ordered two more bottles.
 This has actually made me feel worse....major headache! I stopped taking for a couple days, headache went away.  Started taking again, headache reappears.  Not sure what is in this causing the headache but I not sure this product is for me.
 I quit 150mg of synthroid cold turkey and started taking this daily. My energy is through the roof! I will never go back on synthroid!
 I'm almost finished with my first bottle. I was very skeptic at first,  but the reviews convinced me to purchase a bottle. I do feel less fatigued at the end of the day and I've  even started exercising again. I seem to be able to accomplish more everyday. Definitely worth the money.
 I've tried a few of their products. Good company to buy supplements.
 been having symptoms of hypothyroid/adrenal fatigue growing for the passed 6 months or so, this seems to be helping, haven't lost weight but I definitely can tell when I take it. I have more clean, clear energy and much less stress energy. I don't crave snacks at night, and I fall asleep much easier.
 I am truly happy with this product!! Since adding Thyroid Support to my daily routine of supplements- I have noticed an increase in my energy level, mental clarity and my weight has gone down (which is a plus!). I highly recommend this product!'
 I first bought this product because I was always feeling listless and lazy, had to push myself to get anything done.  When I started taking Thyroid Support, I was more energetic without being over-stimulated. My mood and memory also improved, and I have been able to lose weight more easily.  I will continue to take Thyroid Support.
 After being on medication from my doctor for a sluggish thyroid for about a year and feeling no change in energy nor any sort of weightloss. I decided to check on Amazon for some sort of natural source to help my thyroid. I saw these and read the reviews and figured what the heck. I got them and tried them right away. I did t feel different that day but I have felt better in the days following. I can't say that I'm back to 100% but I do feel better than I was. Not all days a great but most days I feel like I have energy to make it through the day. I haven't seen any weight change as of yet. I am hoping that the weight will start coming off soon. I just ordered my second bottle in hopes that they start making me feel less zombie and more human!
 With Thyroid disease my energy levels are close to zero, since starting this product I have a lot of energy.
 With all that was wrong with my body due to hypothyroidism, I have non of the symptoms anymore. I took the pills as directed and after three days I was feeling wonderful already. I will continue to take them. Thank you so much!
 It has helped me gain energy and focus. Good product
 I've begun using this Thyroid Support and am happy with how it is working for me.  It's still too soon to tell if it's helping with any weight loss, but I definitely feel like I've got more energy!  Enough so, that I've reordered it to keep on with it.
 I really haven't felt like Thyroid Support has made a difference after two weeks.  Will continue and update..
 Definitely gives me my energy for the day!
 This made a big difference on my quality of life. I have an under active thyroid.  I now have more energy and feel so much better.  .. it took about a month to see the results.
 Very good product.  I try to never run out!!  This is a great product to take along with your regular thyroid medication.
 Tons of energy. I have seen an improvement since I have been taking this. I take one on the morning when I wake up and one in the afternoon.
 didn't notice any change I was still tired as usual
 Couldn't tell it did anything.
 I started taking this in hopes to help my low T3 numbers without having to take prescription drugs. I suffer from horrible fatigue among other issues. So far after a month this has helped and I am going to continue to take it to see if it will keep improving and see how my numbers are in 3 months. Much better than taking all the herbs and supplements separately!
 I started taking Thyroid Support Complex with Iodine a few weeks ago and I have more energy and focus. It is reasonably priced and so far, does what it claims to do. I will definitely be buying another bottle!<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00S8PW6P6/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0
 Great product!  Energy level increase and less brain fogginess for this 50+ gal!
 Definetly helps me get through my day! Never felt better. If taking consistently, it will make a huge difference. Definitely my favorite supplement.
 I was hoping this would work, but all it did was make me bloated and constipapated... now, having said that, I just recieved a full refund from the company and didn’t even ask for it, so for the company itself, I give 3 stars!!!
 Kinda bummed it didn't do anything for me. I love all the positive reviews though. Happy it is working for others.
 I have taken this for almost a whole month and I love it!  I will definitely be buying more.  I feel like I have more energy and honestly haven't been eating as much since I began taking it.
 I have only been taking this product for two weeks.  My doctor said my tyroid test was normal, but tyroid disease runs in my family so I decided to give this a try.  I have seen an increase in my engery levels and am feeling better.  I will update when I have taken it longer.
 HyPO thyroid and decided to try this. AWFUL HEADACHES. Discontinuing. I’m disappointed that I wasted my money.
 Lost 4 pds in two days.. I am one of those skeptical people who don't believe it until I see it and try it for myself. This product work, and I have no pain in the feet, legs, or back in the morning when I get up. I will give an update in 30 days, to let everybody know how they work.
 Love that my blood work comes back normal since I started taking this. Great product!
 I read all of the reviews, and decided to incorporate this into my daily routine for 30 days or more and did not notice any difference in my overall body health and/or well being.  I think that for some people this product was very helpful - but for me it did not contribute to a better overall feeling.<br/>Zhou Nutrition was very understanding and extended such wonderful customer service - that I would consider buying other products from them without hesitation.
 Works
 DOSENT WORK FOR ME
 2 weeks in on my first bottle and have noticed a huge diference. My anxiety has been much less present and I feel more clear headed. My energy has been higher as well. I do not feel jittery from it like anything else you may take for energy.
 Got a bottle of these for my girlfriend as she had been experiencing symptoms related to low thyroid activity. She says she feels better while taking them and plans to continue.
 Made me feel great at first, but after that started feeling sick. Took for a few weeks before I had to stop.
 I will be ordering this product again. It provided mental clarity &amp; more energy.
 I haven't been formally diagnosed as Hypothyroid but I've been displaying all the symptoms. I took other supplements that claim to do the same thing but this one has worked out better in terms of energy, pain relief and appetite control. I'm still waiting on the weight loss to kick in but overall its a good product and its gentle on your stomach with no side effects. I am excited to receive my next bottle to see how much better I'll feel after two months on it.
 Been taking for over a month now and don’t see or feel any difference.
 I have been taking this for about 60 days and I can really tell the difference in my energy level . Seems like a great product .
 I've been taking Thyroid Support Complex for a month. I've noticed I have more energy and feel better. Something I've missed for a long time. I won't miss a dose!!
 I used this product for two weeks and felt great.  So, I went off it for a week and felt awful.  When I am taking it, my appetite decreases, and bloating goes away.  I'm going to stick with this!
 LOVE LOVE LOVE! Gives both my husband and I good energy that lasts throughout the day!  Appreciate the energy that went into this formula!
 Been taking this about a month.  Haven’t noticed a huge difference in energy, but I’ve lost 4lbs after gaining for no reason!  Hoping to see continued results with long term use...and get off of synthroid!
 Great Product! Helped with lots of hormone issues. I haven't lost weight but I'm less bloated and just feel better all around
 I started taking this to boost my thyroid function in order to improve my energy level. It really did help quite a bit. I was impressed!
 I purchased a bottle with the hopes that I would get  help with dropping some weight. Thyroid issues run in my family. As I've taken them, and of course watching my food intake, I've dropped 8 pounds. It hasn't even been 30 days. I will continue to purchase this product.
 Gets your system going in the morning.  4 starts because it gives my heartburn initially.
 I've been hypothyroid for 30 yrs. These capsules work for me. I dont feel dead like I usually do and keep my energy level balanced throughout the day.
 They seems to work. I'm ordering more. It helps keep my weight in control. Just ordered my 5th bottle. Really like them. I have a lot of energy.
 I don’t leave reviews often, but I think this one has merit. I had many of the symptoms with a sluggish thyroid. Always tired, bad, blue moods, forgetting everything, foggy brain, issues with concentration, no motivation… I could keep going but I don’t have all way.  I take some supplements and usually I don’t see much of a difference, so I usually just don’t write a review. Well I received this supplement on Saturday, and decided to give it a try yesterday. I took my first pill right before bed. This morning I woke up ready to go. I didn’t want to snuggle more in bed, I didn’t want to call into work and stay home. I was ready to go. I woke up feeling like me right before I had my son. I took my first pill of the day this morning and I am here sitting at work like a normal person, for the first time in some time I am not consumed with sluggishness. To me this is pure success! I can’t wait to see how many other benefits I get to experience with continued use.
 Feel good,  a bit pricey. May go back to the less flashy Solaray product.
 I have had several doctors tell me all my thyroid labs are in normal range, but with my list of symptoms, hypothyriodism is the only thing that made sense.  After about 2 weeks of taking this supplement, I noticed that I was back to my regular (read pre-babies 12 years ago) sleeping patterns, I had lost 5 pounds, and my hands and feet were not blocks of ice anymore to list a few changes.  I could not be more happy with my decision to purchase this again and again.
 This works marvelous!!! I've always felt like i had a thyroid problem and this is definitely helping me this is my 2nd order now!!!
 LOVE thyroid support! I started using this product because my previous medication skyrocketed in price. I was skeptical of course but it has proven to be worth it!
 Love ❤️ this product I’m on my second bottle and definitely will continue to buy it
 works
 Clean ingredients and energy has been great.  My thyroid numbers have improved, although I have been doing many things to get here, along with this supplement.
 I did my research and this product had the best ratings and reviews, I had high hopes that it would work for me but....<br/>I've taken the supplements for a lil over 3 weeks now. Honestly, I'm not sure I see any difference at all.<br/>I'll not be repurchasing.
 This is amazing!  You can start feeling it right away!!
 Pros:<br/>- Combines everything you need into one pill<br/>- Endocrinologist approved these.  I recently showed the bottle to the Dr. and he said that none of the ingredients would interfere with thyroid medication<br/>- Brain fog has been reduced.<br/>Cons:<br/>Despite others losing weight, I have not witnessed that.
 This is the only Thyroid support that has helped me feel better,  i have brain fog, less hair loss , and it has wben helped with weight control. I use it with my Synthroid daily.
 This was not for me. I took it for a few weeks and it made me gain weight and made me feel so much worse. It might work for some people but if I were to recommend this to someone, I would caution them that it can cause the opposite of what it is supposed to.
 I take this every morning and if I forget or skip it, I can really tell. I love feeling awake without the caffeine jitters.  Definitely be buying this again!
 These pills do work. I have been suffering from thyroid gland deficiency for 12 years now, and I was totally in control of the problem with the medicine my family doctor prescribed for me. But the truth is that since some unscrupulous oral surgeons here from Utah performed oral surgery and left me very bad because of negligence and ineptitude of them, my life changed to 360 degrees and apart from all the health problems that it Cause, even suicidal thoughts I have had from that. And for more than 2 years that happened, I do not sleep well and even obese and I started, with so much anxiety, depression and stress. Obviously, that thyroid deficiency has increased with the health problems I have had as result of that negligence. And I had several months without being able to sleep normal and I was almost not sleeping at all for a few weeks, before I started taking these pills. No medicine from my doctor to effect. But thank God since I started taking these pills, I'm already sleeping for at least 5 to 6 hours in the evenings. I had not slept in an hour. I just want to ask Amazon and the company that sell these pills: Please, if you can lower the price for at least $ 6.00 dlls, because I need to buy them every month, and I am low economic resources and it is difficult for me to buy them every single month. Hoppely, you take in consideration my petition. Thank you.
 I am not saying this product doesn't work. It just didn't work for me. I didn't feel like it made a difference in my energy or weight. So many people had miraculous results and I hoped that this would work for me.
 Adding pep to my step. Increased my stamina during workouts. Happy
 I have been taking Thyroid support for 3 weeks now &amp; I am very pleased with how it has helped me. I am less hungry, I have more energy,  clearer mind and sleep better now. I'm going to get a bottle for my friend for her birthday.
 Did help me.
 I decided to purchase Thyroid Support after years of trying medications prescribed by my doctor. My thyroid was dying...I had goiter, I couldn't lose any weight, I had no appetite or energy, and I had been in a fairly severe depression for the past 5-6 years. When I saw the ad for this product I looked at the ingredient list and figured I'd try it...what could it hurt? Within 2-4 weeks of using this, my life is completely changed! I've lost weight, I have energy to do things during the day, my goiter is gone, and the best part is that my depression is all but gone. I feel like an absolutely new person!
 I have been taking for 4 days.  Bloating, brain fog, weird feeling all over.  Will stop now.  Would like refund.
 I really liked this in combination with the green tea supplement. I've noticed a change in weight and mood. Would recommend this to friends.
 No they didn't do anything but make me sick😕
 Great product. Within the day of taking, I have more energy and feel better. More focus, clearer thinking, more energy, and I just feel better.
 My husband and daughter have seen terrific results with their energy and sleep. I did not want to run out so I purchased 3 bottles.
 So far this has really worked great for me! I have more energy and less fog. I feel more like me :) Definitely going to buy this again!
 I have so much more energy since I’ve been taking this supplement . It’s so important to take it the same time everyday for the best results. I’m looking forward to my health improving !!!
 I am 61 and this last year I was feeling fatigued. I read up on my symptoms and found out that I might need thyroid support. I have finished my first bottle of Zhou Thyroid Support and have been a lot more energetic than I was. My friends have noticed and remarked on it!
 Wow! All I have to say is that I haven't said "I'm tired" since I started taking this thyroid support. I am only sorry that I didn't try it sooner. I also have a lot less aches and pains. Thank you Zhou Nutrition.
 I’m on my first bottle and I can feel my energy level increasing. I’ve even started back exercising, which is something I haven’t been able to do because I was always tired. Pills were a little hard to swallow at first, but I quickly got use to them after the first couple of weeks.
 My doctor told me my thyroid was a bit sluggish, and I have been using this for over a month and it's worked great!
 Didn't notice anything.
 I take this twice a day, once in the morning and at night. It's helped a lot with my aches and sluggishness. Improved my mood as well. Definitely will continue using!
 I’m loving this supplement... I feel more focused and have more energy after taking this for a week. Thank you!
 Love the extra energy I get from this supplement! It's awesome.
 Higher energy. Better sleep pattern.  Highly recommend.
 I have just started this brand and am hoping it lives up to the results others have had. I am a preschool teacher and am dragging by 6 p.m. I have hashimotos and have been getting my thyroid medicine bumped up.
 I have been taking these for almost a month and I  notice my energy has increased, I sleep much better I will continue to take these, I just feel better
 I read all the great reviews and thought I'd give it a try. I've suffered with severe under active thyroid my entire life. This has helped me tremendously. I had a non existent immune system, woke up tired after sleeping 10-12 hours,  etc etc etc. I take this along with d3, echinacia, amour, and a multivitamin. I have more energy and feel better than I have in my life. Hope it helps you too.
 I've been taking these for 2 1/2 weeks.  I must have needed some or all of the minerals in this because it is the only thing I've changed in my routine and I have felt a major up in energy.  I am not one to sing praises of products but I plan to keep buying this one!!!
 I don’t have any known Thyroid issues but still always felt like something was off..so, I gave this a try and LOVE it! Love it so much I ordered one for my significant other as well! Will definitely reorder!
 I am on my second bottle and feel great!! For 20 years was on Levo and Syn and had horrible side effects that included horrific cystic acne, loss of hair. I will continue taking this!!
 Great product! Works very well n has iodine! Win win! I will definitely order again! :)
 Helped me get my energy back!!
 I can tell a difference when I don't take these. The o ly thing I do t like is the size of them.
 So far so good. Take it in addition to the low dose thyroid med I'm on. Only been on it a short time.
 I think I like this fine.  Just diagnosed with Hashimoto Disease and it was one of the first products that has the vitamins in it that I need. I have not used this a month yet.  When I do not take it I can tell the difference.
 I am feeling stronger and more focused on these - I am on my first month but can already tell a difference in my energy and motivation!!!
 It did exactly what it said it would do. There were no side effects. I feel better and my nails aren’t brittle anymore.
 Noticed a general improvement 3 days after I started taking the Thyroid support. Started feeling more energetic and focused. Seriously helped me fighting procrastination which is great.
 I hoped this would help me with my weakness and dizziness, but it's not. It's probably a good product, but not for me.
 I don’t really feel a difference except I don’t always need a nap at 5pm. Overall it’s good, I just don’t know if it’s actually working for me. I expected more results judging all the great reviews from everyone.
 I was hopeful this would help with my borderline thyroid - my dr will not prescribe me anything even though my mom had the same problem. So far I’m halfway thru the bottle but don’t see any results - maybe it’s me?
 I have hypothyroid, and ever since taking this (so far about 2 bottles now) I have seen the improvement after my check with the doctor. It has helped me improved my metabolism, and energy level. No more fatigue! I will surely recommend this if you would like to go the alternative way over taking prescription from the doctor.
 No difference for me in any of the areas the product claims to help.
 Is been really helpful 🙂
 I was extremely hopeful when ordering this product, I even paid extra to get it here the same day.... I had taken it faithfully as directed...but notice my sleep was a little more relaxed and longer, no extra energy as of yet.  I am happy that it worked out for so many of you tho'. I am still holding out  hope.
 I feel better than I have in a long time. More energy and don't feel like I have to have a nap to make it through the day.. Also the swelling in my feet is gone!
 This supplement helps both myself and my husband with our sluggish thyroid and at the same time assists with weight loss and concentration.
 Ordering my second bottle today. After switching from synthroid to armore and adding this I have went from feeling like a 2 out of 10 to an 7 out of ten. Haven't felt this good in 5 years. I had my thyroids taken completely so it has been a struggle but the change in medicines and adding this has helped completely.
 I have been looking for the right blend of thyroid support for sometime.  Now I have found it and I am thrilled with the results!
 It didn’t words for me I’m so sad , I had faith in this pills
 I started this supplement after a long fight with my doctors about my symptoms and "normal" tests this has helped my symptoms so much I put on my subscription service but I ran out a few weeks before my delivery and i was only 2 days without and could notice to difference
 If you are sensitive to magnesium, I strongly discourage you from buying. However, if not, you feel amazing!
 Fast shipping and product was exactly as described! Worked great!
 I have been looking for a product that is not overal priced and delivers the support I need and I believe I am getting this with this product.
 I only been taking a couple days and already feel better , mentally,emotionally. Suggest Take with food or u will get slight headache . I over all feel happier it's crazy. So glad I found and tried this! Will definitely reorder and update after 1st month
 Both my fiancé and I have thyroid disorder and are on armor thyroid, even on armor we were still a little sluggish, this has really helped in boosting our energy levels and keeping our thyroid numbers in check:).
 We bought for my son after reading the reviews. We have found that it works. He says that he doesn't feel tired as much as he did and we have even seen some weight loss. I would definitely recommend to anyone who is kinda on the line with their thyroid numbers. It works. Thank you thyroid support.
 This is my first bottle but will be purchasing more! Have more energy &amp; less brain fog. I am also getting more restful sleep than before
 I did not feel any different.  There appeared to be no positive benefit from taking this,  which was disappointing.
 Been taking for a month. Have a little more energy, but I think it's too early to tell.
 i HAVE ALREADY NOTICED AN INCH OFF MY BELLY FAT AFTER ONE WEEK OF USE WITH THE THYROID SUPPORT WITH IODINE. ANXIOUS TO SEE THE RESULTS IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS.
 loving this ,,,have more energy...a must try
 More energy!  And it seems I’m more alert.  I stay focused!  Will buy again.
 The product is what I expected. It shipped fast.
 Thank you!
 Have been taking this for about 2 weeks now. So far no dramatic changes other than in the morning I find it's a little easier to "wake up" whereas before I would be groggy for longer. I can resume this review in a few weeks to see if any other changes have occurred.
 I feel great! Energy, weight maintenance, less fatigue. I will definitely be buying this product again!
 I am very pleased with how I feel with this! I’m alert and awake and have so much more energy. No weird side effects either.
 Fantastic product. No odd effects or tastes throughout the day, no extreme ups or downs.<br/>Will definitely buy again.
 So far it seems to be helping me with night sweats.  I feel better, have more energy.  My cold sensitivity is a lot better! My constipation is better and I am sleeping better at night.
 not sure if i notice a difference yet or not, but i do seem to have more energy
 Have more energy and less sluggish. Only been taking for 2 weeks. Can't wait to see if my labs change
 Within a couple of days, my thyroid issue symptons were disappearing!
 I really wanted to love this. Gave me energy but caused me much stomach upset.
 I have been taking this for a couple of weeks and am starting to feel the difference
 I was recently diagnosed with thyroid issues, low iodine and low vit D! Took months to figure out ! Was very, very fatigued! I'm on my second week of this thyroid support and have to say I have not yawned once or woke up for the day wanting to go lay back down! My entire family has thyroid issues! I have passed the good news along!!
 These don’t work. I waited until I was finished taking the bottle to leave my review. Energy levels stayed low, did not lose any weight, don’t waste your money like I did. I’d give zero stars if I could.
 This supplement works really well for me. I was having pretty severe fatigue and was losing quite a bit of hair and had other symptoms of thyroid issues, but my blood tests from the doctor indicated that my thyroid was on the lower end of the scale but was not at a point where the doctor wanted to do anything about it (I prefer supplements that work over prescriptions anyway). I started this supplement and noticed my hair quit falling out after about a week (this was a lot of hair falling out, not just a few that are normal everyday, and I now have a lot of baby hairs growing in) and once it got in my system for a good week or two the fatique went away. I am not the best at remembering to take my supplements regularly, but I do see a difference when I take it everyday and make it a point to take two every morning because it is making a difference. I am happy with the product and price.
 Thyroid support has been amazing for me, I just ordered 4 more bottles on Amazon for the family. We also are loving Neuro quest, boost elite, Hairfluence. Thank you for making us feel alive again.
 I love these! Make me feel normal again if that’s possible 😊
 I really liked this supplement except for the fact it gave me heartburn.  I've since stopped it until I can discuss it with my doctor, but aside from that-- I would recommend it.
 I immediately felt a difference with my energy and my appetite. This product is the real deal!!!!! I honestly felt like there was no hope with supplements for weight loss and fatigue but I’m so glad I have this supplement the benefit of the doubt!
 Didn't seem to do anything at all. Very disappointed.
 I wasn't exactly sure what to expect when taking this, but it definitely gave me energy and alertness. I take it before a workout and it has helped out a lot. As for actual thyroid support, I have no idea. But I am happy for what I personally use it for.
 Love it!
 I loved it will keep using it
 This product has given me more energy than I had expected! I’ve been using it for about 2 weeks and I can see my clothes are fitting a bit better. Would reccomend!
 It seems to really help my energy when I take these so I approve!  They are a little pricey but so are all supplements.
 Had the 1st bottle, felt the difference in few days. Did not experience any issues and felt a surge of energy and clear mind.
 I was looking for something that could give me a boost of energy. These are amazing! I've been taking them for a month and will continue to take them.
 I have been using this for more than 3 weeks and did not notice any difference but some time feeling headache after taking this supplements,not sure that's caused by this, so stopped taking this now.<br/><br/>I have got my refund for this product.
 Unfortunately I didn't notice too much of a difference.
 Fine product. Shipped quickly and priced competitively. I would buy again .
 Significantly reduced muscle soreness but more importantly, I felt more calm and less stressed.  I tried a different brand and did not receive the same benefits.
 felt really depressed after taking it
 I honestly have more energy after using this product. I was so exhausted and could hardly stay awake past 8:30pm; esp since Winter. A co-worker recommended this to me and I can feel a difference. I am excited to say, I feel more "alive" and not so stinking tired!
 I feel more energized with these. My T4 was low and this is helping. I have also noticed that if I take it at night, I seem to get a good rest. I have a lot of trouble sleeping and this helps
 Fast delivery. Seems to have great reviews so I thought I'll give it a try. Will purchase again.
 My wife was looking to start a weight loss regimen and her thyroid acts up with most weight loss products.  This gives her the energy she needs to kick start her day.  She loves it and she can notice a real difference now!
 I believe this truly helps.
 I have seen such a difference since I started taking this a few weeks ago. I even feel better. Even if I forget to take a day or two I feel like crap but once I take it I feel so much better. I’ve even lost some weight.
 These pills made me feel 1,000 times more exhausted than I already was. I suffer from hypothyroidism and not only did it not help, it made me feel way worse.
 Have had hypothyroidism for 14 years, love this stuff
 Tried 1 bottle. Didn't notice any difference
 I did notice improvement in energy levels, but I do think that it would be better if taken regularly for 3 months at least. I went through 6 months of chemo, so my thyroid was badly affected. I look forward to my next bottle of thyroid support.
 Since I started taking this product, my energy level increased which I have not had in a long time. Remember to always look into supplements and their interactions with other prescriptions. I will purchase this product again because it works!
 Bad, I was very hungry, it just vitamin B12.  Hungry!!!!, doesn’t work for lose weight.
 I am on day 3 and half my eye lashes have fallen out. I’m done with these!
 I have been taking this supplement for about a month and definitely notice a difference in my energy levels. I am much peppier, i sleep better when I take it and seems to be helping. Testing out on the "low end of normal" for years with my thyroid and numerous Drs not helping out, I think this is.<br/><br/>In Exchange for this review I received free product.
 Too expensive relative to other equivalent supplements. I don't know if it is effective or not. But, I take issue with the price.
 I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism and my symptoms included extreme lethargy and that has completely changed after a week of this supplement! Waiting to get my numbers checked again.
 I really enjoyed this product it has gave me so much engery and help promote sleep. I also like the fact that it help me focus more.
 It's helps
 No noticeable changes.
 Have been taking for a few weeks and already feeling better. My doctor wouldn't do a full thyroid panel as my tsh lab came back within "normal" range which is so broad. Helps with mood swings and fatigue. Don't really use it for weight lose but I feel like I have lost a little weight.
 I love this supplement! Gives me a good boost during the day and has helped my mood tremendously. I’ve also noticed my sleep quality is better and my legs don’t feel as restless when I’m trying to fall asleep. Will definitely be ordering more in the future!
 Good product.
 Love them!!!  Really notice a difference in how I feel and I'm NOT hungry all the time!!!
 Fantastic! I've had a goiter on my neck for pretty much my whole life. In just a month of taking this medicine it's nearly gone.<br/>I feel better! I have more energy! I love this product!
 Great product and customer service. My wife and I both use Zhou products and have not been disappointed! Highly recommend!
 Finally I'm able to lose weight.  The doc said my thyroid levels are fine but this helps
 Took the entire bottle and did not feel any different.
 Only been taking it for a week but seems to be working ! I would recommend it.
 I finally found a thyroid supplement that is helping with my many symptoms.
 Great product. High quality ingredients and gets the job done. Definitely feel like it's helped me. Would buy again.
 I love this brand because it actually works and makes me feel better!
 I have noticed a big difference in my energy levels and other symptoms after 2 weeks of use!!
 Been on it for 3 weeks and feeling great!  What I like about this supplement is the herbs that are included, like Ashwagandha and Cayenne.
 Really has helped with my thyroid. I would recommend giving it a try.
 It is my first time trying a thyroid supplement. So far so good. Haven't been taking it long enough to see any real results as of yet, but I definitely feel a lot calmer than I usually am. Arrived in a timely manner, looking forward to long term results!
 I have not been diagnosed with a thyroid condition but had all of the mental fog tiredness and depression that comes with age and unbalanced hormones. After reading multiple reviews, and the awesome price point, I decided to give these pills to try and set of numerous trips to the doctor and pharmaceutical prescriptions. This pill has been wonderful! I take it in the morning with breakfast and mid day at lunch. I feel like I can go through a whole day with no more brain fog or lack of energy while sitting at my desk for eight hours. I would highly recommend giving this a try if you're going through the normal aging slowdown process
 I have been taking this for 3 weeks now and so far I am feeling more energetic and able to workout again.  I had a total thyroidectomy last September due to cancer and this has given me the extra boost.  I will always have to take my prescription thyroid medicine but I have liked the results of adding this to my daily routine.  I ordered a couple more bottles.
 Love this product! I wasn't sure if it was actually helping until I forgot to take it. My headaches and fog returned with a vengeance and I realized I had forgotten to take it for a few days!!! Love, love, love this product!!!
 Have been taking for about a month now. While it hasn't help my weight loss so much, I am feeling less run down. I intend to give it some more time because I like using natural products to help my body work at optimal rate. I know it is helping me.
 I am 26 years old and have been diagnosed with Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and have a pretty extensive family history of thyroid disorders, but my doctor could never pinpoint anything wrong with MY Thyroid. I had all the normal signs of thyroid issues. Brain fog, Fatigue, Sensitivity to cold, EXTREMELY dry skin and hair, weight gain, aching joints ect. I had been suffering with these symptoms for the past 4 years with no answers or anything that even remotely made me feel any better. I have been taking this supplement for about a week now and can tell its working some kind of magic. I have more energy. My dry skin isn't as severe. My appetite has changed and I'm eating less and staying full longer. I've already lost about 3 pounds. My joints also aren't hurting as badly as they normally do. I am so pleased with this product. I will definitely be ordering more!
 Great product. More focusing and energy. Thanks
 I definitely feel the difference and the pills don’t make me sick!
 How well this worked was an amazing surprise! I've been feeling better through the day, losing weight (with some diet and other stuff, but this helped), and even my digestion seems to be more regular.
 I have only been taking it for a month but it appears to be providing me with more energy.
 Love the product. Finally something that works
 After using 2 other brands steadily over the past 8 months, I started feeling lethargic and sludgy again, so I switched to Zhou. After taking twice a day for 3 days, I already felt a difference. My slow thyroid symptoms pretty much melted away and I feel like my happy go lucky, energetic self again. I have ordered this product twice now, and have stayed very satisifed with how it has made me feel over the past month.
 I ordered this product because I felt sluggish &amp; fatigued. After a few days of taking this I noticed an increase in energy. I also lost a few pounds. It's an awesome product.
 I have only been taking this for a couple of weeks. I've noticed more energy and even my food cravings especially sweets have decreased a lot.
 Works well, it helps to give me some additional energy.
 Not sure if i have been on it long enouvh. Results havent been quite so quick as others have written. Maybe if i take it longer i might see results, but not yet
 I would recommend giving this a try! I have suffered with thyroid symptoms for years- in testing, my results are always low, borderline, but not low enough to require medication. I have been taking this supplement for a couple of months and have to say, that I feel better! It wasn't overnight, but give it time and I think you'll be pleased!
 Made thyroid problem worse after a week, worked at first, now thyroid is swollen, in a decent amount of pain, read the iodine can actually cause your hypothyroid into hyperthyroid for short time and then go back to hypo.
 I have been taking this supplement for a few weeks now and I have noticed increase in energy especially during workouts. So far I am impressed with this product.
 Only a month in, but so far so good.  Taking in conjunction with Armour thyroid.
 It has given me a little bump of energy and helped with my weight. I am drinking less caffeine to get through the day.
 Works very nice, no longer tired &amp; have lost some weight.
 Just received my second bottle and I suffer from hypothyroidism...this has lifted my fog, made me feel more energetic, and lost a couple pounds in first month. I would highly recommend this to try.
 It really helped us feel more energetic and less hungry, especially my wife. A great product highly recommended to those with thyroid issues.
 Good product and priced fairly.  Been using it for a year or do now.
 I just started using this product. Like many reviewers I have hypothyroidism and take armour thyroid. I find this gives me a boost of energy. I feel less sluggish especially when the ole 3:00 pm tiredness hits me.
 I didn't notice much of an energy boost but I do feel better since I started taking these vitamins.
 This is a great product. I have been experiencing symptoms of low thyroid for a while. I always felt cold and noticed an immediate improvement after taking this supplement. No side effects. Feel great after taking it. Definitely recommend.
 I feel great since I started taking this.  And NO side effects!
 Amazing product!
 Amazing difference it makes in my day. More energy and overall feel better.
 I love this product ordered 2nd bottle notice increase in energy after about the 1st week
 some days I felt a difference and other day I felt nothing... probably won’t buy again
 I saw no change when taking this product as directed.
 Tested as having low thyroid over 20 years ago. After moving back to midwest, I  keep being told I am "normal." What is normal for some not so for others. This is my first bottle. I believe it is helping.
 I noticed a difference the first day I took it. I was surprised. It felt so good to have more energy. I recommend to a coworker.
 I tried it and I definitely felt like I had more energy throughout the day and it wasn't like that "crash and burn" kind of energy either.  So far I've only lost a pound or two but I'm going to keep it up, because it does help me drink less coffee.
 This has worked for me, I have lots of energy, have lost 5lbs with my first bottle
 I feel more energized after taking this
 Works pretty good. I have clinical hypothyroid and this is excellent support
 We have been using this complex for over a month and have noticed that we have increased energy, and less digestive issues. We would recommend this product.
 Wow is all I can say! This stuff has made all the difference. I had no expectations but this had made me feel like my old self again. I’d suggest this to anyone. This has been a lifesaver. My energy level is back to normal and no side effects.
 Feel less bloated more slim in my clothes and have more energy throughout the day
 I have been taking this for about a month.  I'm not sure if it is helping, but its not making anything worse.  I've got to give it some more time to be sure! (will update on month 2)
 Love this product!  I can absolutely tell a difference in my energy level
 I have only been using this product for a few weeks but so far I am glad I found it.  My energy levels have gone up and I can get through my day easier with better focus.
 This supplement has been a game changer! I will not go a day without them, being hypo...I was always fatigued, low energy etc. I take 2 each morning after breakfast and I feel great all day. I will never go without these EVER!
 After working 3rd shift for so long I was always tired with bad eating habits. Within a few days I noticed a difference more energy and less snaking. I would really recommend and continue using this product.
 Much more energy. Better sleep. Feel better in general
 I bought a bottle not expecting much, I was very surprised. Not only did I have more energy, but the mental fog lifted and I lost a few pounds. This will be a part of my daily supplements from now on.
 I am happy to say that this is a very good product. I have Hypothyroid and struggle with fatigue, weight gain, hair loss, very irritable at times, and water retention. With this product I feel more energetic, happier, a lot less bloated, and my hair is not falling out as much. I will continue to purchase this product,Thank you for making a great product!!
 Been using the product for about 3 weeks and the only thing I can say is different is my sleep. Haven't seen a difference like others have commented. Will keep using it to see if there is a change.
 No change , except made me anxious.
 Seems to do a decent job. In between my first and second bottle. Waiting on the second because I waited too long to order. I can tell a difference.
 Didn't do anything for me, however, the customer service is amazing!  They emailed me stating they are refunding me and apologizing that I wasn't satisfied which I thought was awesome.  I will try other products by them now for sure!
 Been using for two months now and definitely have more clarity, focus, and energy.
 At first I think the first two weeks I saw some difference in more energy and lost a couple lbs, but the next couple weeks I gained it back and felt more hungry and not as much energy.  I may try a different product, I don't think I'll use this one again.
 So far, pretty pleased. Definitely have more energy!
 after using this product a month, I found out my thyroid problem have improved. I felt my energy come back.
 I have been taking Synthroid for over a year now.  My levels have increased, but energy and weight was still a problem.  Since taking the Thyroid complex I notice an energy increase and I am down 4 pounds.  It’s working for me.
 I love it! I was scepticle at first but was very pleased with how it suppresses my hunger, plus I have more energy!
 I'm almost through my first bottle, and the is a difference in my energy, for sure.<br/>I'm excited to see how I feel after a few months of using the priduct...but I an happy with the results so far.
 I have been having a lot of fatigue lately and I realized my B vitamins were low. I have the mutated gene that makes my body hard to absorb b-12. This supplement gave me a boost in energy. Helped me have energy in the morning. I highly recommend it.
 Thyroid Support has given me more energy, more alertness, and just an overall feeling of well-being since I began using the product about 3 weeks ago.  I will continue to use this product because of the good results I have had.  Also, I was happy with the natural ingredients and affordable price.
 Great product I could really tell a difference
 I love these so far. I wanted to take something that was more natural and easier on my stomach. I am almost done with the first month and so far I love this product. I really dont have anything negative to say at this point.
 Love this supplement, I have not been as sluggish since I started taking, I will continue to take this supplement
 From the first day of taking this product I started to notice that I have better clarity and focus during my daily routine. Brain fog has been a major problem since my Dr. discovered hypothyroidism 3 years ago. I will continue to purchase this product, as I have not found anything that works so well.
 Good energy from it, made me feel good.
 Highly recommended product. Within days of use I noticed a big increase in mental focus and energy. On days that I take this I don't feel like I need caffeine which is a major change for me. I generally live off of caffeine.
 The first time I took one of these my leg cramps disappeared, so I make sure I don’t forget to take the recommended dose(2 a day).
 I am still on my first bottle and I am not sure if it's helping or not but I love the formula.
 I like it so far but haven't been taking long enough for a better evaluation
 Unfortunately this product did nothing for me, Went through the whole bottle and did not feel any different.
 Gave me horrible head aches
 My thyroid level is much more regulated and at a "normal" level. It's great to be able to do that without becoming dependent on medication.<br/>Just remember to take your doses earlier in the day so your sleep isn't disturbed.
 Nice supplement to our daily regimen.
 This supplement has everything my thyroid needs to stay healthy.
 I have taken this for the past 4 days and I don't wake up groggy anymore! Waking up has been difficult for the past 4 years. Very happy with the product!
 Have taken this for 2 to 3 weeks now and it seems to give me more energy and even reduce the brain fog somewhat.
 Excellent supplement. I've been using this in conjunction with my synthroid and it's helped helped with energy and brain fog so that I feel almost like a functional person again.
 I started this 2 weeks ago and I have been feeling so much better than I ever have with thyroid prescription. I have suffered from hypothyroidism for almost 10 yrs and this is the first time I have started to feel like myself. I will Def be making this something I constantly take!
 Did not work at all.
 So far this product seems to help my energy level.
 I haven't been diagnosed with hypothyroidism but I have all the symptoms. I even specifically asked to be tested the last time I was at the Dr but they told me my results were normal. I'm 27 and was always tired, my hair was falling out, I had brain for all the time and I was gaining weight when I shouldn't have been. After reading the other reviews I decided to try this and at first I definitely was skeptical. But after the first couple of days I noticed I had more energy and I didn't want to sleep all day. I've lost 10 lbs in a little over 2 months because my energy level is much better and I can actually exercise. I get all the housework done and usually have a little umph left to play with my kids. This product is definitely worth a try if you have the symptoms of hypothyroidism or you're just feeling drained every day. My hair also  completely stopped falling out about 2 weeks after I started taking it. Try it!
 Have not used long term yet, but so far it is great, easy to take once daily and with no side effects!!!  I'll followup another reivew once I have taken this for a few months.  At this point it does seem to be helping with brain fog and just general sluggishness.  I'm very happy at this point and plan on continuing to use to find out the true long term benefits.
 I have noticed an energy boost then i take this. also i am able to focus more.
 I took it and felt nothing until the 3rd week. I noticed at work that I wasnt tired and fatigued and ready to go to sleep by half my work day like i usually wanna do. Not sure why it took 3 weeks to kick in but it was worth the wait.
 Zhou Nutrition Thyroid Supports has been great.  I’ve really noticed more energy and focus throughout the day. No caffeine boost needed in the afternoons.  Great product!
 I was a bit skeptical about this product, but man does it help boost energy. I definitely noticed a shift in my moods for the better!
 I didn't really tell any difference while taking this supplement.
 Feeling a lot better after taking these. Was told may have a inactive thyroid. So did some research on supplements and found these. They work for me and glad to have found them.
 Love this product. My energy is returning and I'm feeling very whole again. My hair is growing quickly and I've noticed my mood improving probably due to my energy coming back. Definitely recommend this product!
 Gave me heart palpitations and I felt extremely "out of it". Unfortunate.
 I have taken this for almost 2 full months and notice absolutely no effect from it.  I am going to quit taking it since it hasn't helped. This is not an indication of anything wrong with this supplement or the company.  I am the type of person that meds don't always work the way they are supposed to, so that doesn't mean this supplement won't work for you.
 Great product. I definitely feel an improvement in my energy level.
 good product. would recommend
 It has helped me a lot. I have more energy and feel better.
 I’m just about finished with my first bottle of this. I have to say I did feel an increase in my energy.  I feel it is helping me with my weight loss goals.
 Just started using it so can not say one way or another about he product yet. Thankfully have no side effects yet though as I typically get really nauseous when consuming any amounts of zinc in supplement form
 This product has given me so much energy!  I am almost done with my first bottle and awaiting my 2nd bottle.
 Did not work for me.
 My son has low thyroid and since taking this, he has noticed increased energy and stamina.
 I love this stuff! I don't know if it's in my head or not, but I feel like as soon as I started taking this, I noticed a difference in my enrergy. I will continue to take this.
 I am so happy to have found this product and nutritional company!!! They make quality products and I look forward to trying more of their products!
 I have been taking this for almost 2 months now and am planning to re order to continue taking it. I feel I have an under active thyroid. The first test showed under active but my doctor tested again and said it came back normal and shrugged it off as being caused by my medication but I have all the symptoms of hypothyroidism. I decided to try this product to see if would help me and have noticed a significant difference. My husband has noticed too. It seems to be balancing my hormones and my hair isn't falling out, I'm more focused and feeling better with a little more energy. I have also started to be able to lose a little weight too. I would recommend it for anyone that feels like they have hypothyroidism.
 I have been taking this supplement for a couple weeks now. Maybe some slightly increased energy but the little bit of energy has been worth it so far. I will continue taking it and remain hopeful to see its other effects soon. I plan on giving it 90 days so I'm keeping my fingers crossed!
 I like to try to find what works, this did not. I have tried several but in its defense everyone bodies are different.  So give it a try if you like, didnt hate it just wasnt for me.
 I was already on thyroid medication for an inactive thyroid. I still had no energy and it was a struggle waking up in the morning and when I got home from work, I was exhausted.  I took thyroid support since December and I noticed I had more energy during the day, I'm not as exhausted when I get home from work and I noticed that I'm awake late at night.  My weight also stabilized, when I was on my prescription;however while on the supplement my weight stayed the same.  I would buy this again.<br/><br/>Please note that I  paid full price for this medication and I was not compensated for providing my review.
 Wish I could continue taking this supplement but doctor doesn't want me too.
 Great product!! Love it!!!
 I have only been taking these a little less than a month and I can see a difference.  I would have given it five stars but I'm a believer in allowing things a little more time before I decide if I'm head over heels.  If you are looking for a thyroid support supplement this is a great one to start with, now weird dry mouth or unfavorable side effects.
 Great buy
 Good product at a good price, thank you.
 Great when in a low-carb diet, it helps with the lows of energy.
 Great product!! My energy has increased, and it has served as a great supplement to my thyroid medication.  I will definitely continue to take it.
 Already feel a difference!
 Working Really well so far, I have noticed mood, energy and digestive improvement.
 I never write reviews, but I really feel like I need to for this one. I bought these because this year I have been experiencing an overwhelming afternoon crash.  I have been focusing on eating clean and exercising 4-6 days a week, but every afternoon I was crashing.  I felt a definite improvement when I took my first bottle, but I wasn’t sure if it was the clean food or the pills. After the first bottle was done, I decided to hold off ordering another-they are kind of pricey.  I went one week without, during that time I was so sluggish abd nonproductive.  I was literally exhausted every day, could not sleep at night, and could not stop eating crap food.  After a week, I broke down and ordered another bottle.  I felt an immediate improvement.  I feel so much more focused and energetic, I’m not craving junk food and I can’t wait for my night time Zumba class!  I’m pretty sold on these right now.  I’m only rating a 4 because I really haven’t lost any weight, but I feel great regardless.
 Used for a few weeks and saw a change.
 No increase in energy.  No change in mood and definitely no weight loss.
 Feeling MUCH better. I had all the symptoms of hypothyroid. I felt like both my thyroid and the Synthroid I was taking had quit working. I bought this based on the good reviews I read on Amazon. After about a week I definitely noticed a difference. I DEFINITELY feel better: better mood, more energy, better sleep. Have already purchased a 2nd bottle. Thanks Thyroid Support!
 This stuff is great.  I actually take the supplement out of the gelatin callers and mix it with a drinkable multivitamin that I take daily.  Really like the product.
 This product in combination with St Johns wart is just as effective as an antidepressant. I feel energized, focused, and in a much better mood. I'm definitely not going back to prescription antidepressants!! :) Thank you for this wonderful product!
 Love this product, I can’t believe how well this worked it for me. I feel like I just need one supplement, not 30.
 This product has increased my energy and I don't feel as sluggish. I was hopeful that it would help with some weight loss, but it has not.
 Does the job and does it well; could feel affects within the first week!
 I did not notice any difference at all.
 Recently just started taking this as I wanted to take a more natural approach to thyroid issues. So far I do notice increased energy and less brain fog.
 Love the energy and clarity these give me. 2 months taking them and have never felt better.
 These pills gave me AWFUL heartburn. I was however refunded for my dissatisfaction which I greatly appreciate.
 On my second bottle and I can feel the changes. I do have more energy and wake up feeling refreshed. It has made me happier throughout the day and feel like I handle challenges better. I will continue to order, and have recommended to multiple friends.
 I have noticed an increase in my energy level and am going to continue taking it.
 I have taken this and the water away pills and find both highly beneficial. I can distinctly see a difference in my ankles after having taken the water away pills; I reordered the water away pills immediately but didn't put in another order for the thyroid support. A month later - after not being on the thyroid support pills, I am once again ordering them, as i truly believe it made a difference in my overall health.
 I bought these for my mom two weeks ago. She suffers from hypothyroidism and is constantly fatigued and stressed. Since taking Thyroid Support she has more energy and feels less stressed. She will be ordering more and has already recommended to a friend who just ordered a bottle for herself.
 Great energy!
 I got these because I have been diagnosed with some thyroid issues (early stages) and wanted support. I use sea salt and kosher salt and so needed iodine from another source. These pills offer well rounded support that covers my dietary deficiencies.
 This is my second bottle ,😊 I feel more energized ,awake everyday ,,have lost 5 lbs since I ordered  the first bottle  ,I could not even loose a lb before , when I wake up in the morning my brain is not foggy, I am not tired,, I am ready to go , 😉😊
 Works for me.  I am Hypo-thyroid and take a prescription drug.  Thyroid Support gives me more energy.  Ordered for a friend as well.
 I've stopped taking my thyroid med, can't wait for my thyroid test results,  waiting three months. Waiting.
 It gave me some engery. It didn't help much as I thought it would do.
 This product works great. I've noticed an increase in my energy which has helped me to become more active. This is exactly what I was looking for in a thyroid support product.
 I tried this product for a month then had 3 days without it before I started again and I could tell the difference. I was sluggish. This product definitely helped with my fatigue. Highly recommend!!
 This made me more tired and I actually gained a few pounds.
 Prior to taking Thyroid Support, I was not sleeping so well. After about three days I slept the whole night through. Since i've been taking it, I have more energy and feel great!!
 Great product. I love the change in how I feel. I am a huge natural supplement believer, and have tried so many that claim to do something but don't. After a few days of taking the Thyroid Support, I could tell a definite difference. I'm already on my second bottle.
 I feel like I definitely have more energy after taking this supplement! Just opened my 2nd bottle!
 I take this along with my synthroid and it has done wonders for me.  My hair is not falling out in bunches any longer, my nails are more healthy than ever before, and I started to loose weight.  I just started my third month and will continue taking, love the way I am feeling!
 Almost immediately I have noticed I have more energy and I’m much mite alert! No more fatigue! I would recommend this product!
 Love this product! It helps me get through my day with a little pep in my step!!
 I started feeling better after taking this just a few days.  I have already told many people about this product.
 I have noticed an improvement in my energy levels and decreased appetite after taking it nearly 4 weeks :) hopeful to see more improvements!
 I was diagnosed with Hypothyroidism back in December of 2015 and literally was losing my mind on trying to get it under control! I started taking this supplement a long side the DHEA supplement and my prescription Naturethroid and have received astronomical results in how I feel and function.  My numbers have improved with my thyroid and I feel great!
 I have purchase my first bottle after reading tons of good reviews about this supplement and I'm very pleased to say that I was feeling way better.  More focus and energy. I am ordering my next bottle through Amazon's subscribe and save.
 So far, I like this supplement.  I've been taking for two weeks and am only taking one a day but can really tell a difference in how I feel physically and emotionally.
 Great company...awesome products!
 I bpught this a while back and really love the effects its been giving me. I have more energy and focus, and have also lost weight! Will order again.
 These supplements are great for an energy boost and also help with weight loss
 Energy booster.  Mood enhancer.  Great product.
 Off my Levothyroxin for 3 months until next blood work.
 I’ve taken a full bottle of, and currently on my second.  I do believe this has helped me with my focus and energy.  I’m able to sit through class lectures without struggling to stay awake.  That alone makes it worth continuing!
 Recently diagnosed with Hashimoto's disease, I would looking  for solution that was natural and would help with some of the symptoms I was suffering (being tired, forgetful, irritability). This has really helped, and I've even lost some more of the baby weight with which I was struggling!
 No not really I didn't really see a difference
 could not tell a difference in using this. I have hypothyroidism
 Love the product, fast shipping!
 Feeling better every day since I started these supplements. Looking forward to seeing my lab numbers in my next blood draw. I know there will be improvement because of the way I feel.
 This product is making me very anxious and not feeling very well after taking. How do I get a refund?
 These work pretty good. I feel more energetic and I have been sleeping better since I started them 2 weeks ago. I definitely feel like I can get through the day now. Give this a thumbs up!
 This is the only thyroid medicine I have found that works.
 A great product for thyroid support helps with the the condition.
 I seem to have more energy and I feel better after taking this supplement.
 Have lost 7 pounds and feeling full of energy! Must reorder!
 Wasn't sure I needed this, then saw the cold symptom and thought this might just help me. I'm always quite easily cold and love it when its warm and hot out rather then cold and chilly.<br/>I've noticed what feels like slight pulses of warmth in the cold mornings and I've noticed the cold win doesn't cut through my thin body nearly as bad as before.<br/>I've also clearly enjoyed a nicer energy boost although I also take the Energy+Focus (only 1 pill in the morning) so that very likely helps a good bit. I usually go through the day and don't start to feel tired until times past 1 o'clock in the afternoon and that's usually when work slows down and I just start to feel tired.<br/><br/>Over all, so far its done its job and has shown signs that I've been able to notice saying its working well.<br/>Thank you for another great little product and for a great price.
 Wanted this product to work out, but did not notice any increased energy or focus. I had such high hopes for this after reading so many positive reviews. It didn’t work for me, but hopefully it will work bette for others
 Had my thyroid tested recently. Some of my numbers were just slightly outside the normal range, but not enough that the doctor wanted to medicate. They recommended I try a thyroid support complex. Since taking this supplement everyday, my energy levels are up. Definitely now a part of my daily routine.
 I've been taking Thyroid Support for about three weeks. From the beginning I've felt calmer, with more energy, with more focus.
 Improved my thyroid function. After using Zhou Thyroid Support for 3 months my thyroid fuction improved. Verified by my blood panel.
 Excellent product help increasing my energy
 It is often hard to distinguish what is actually working when you are taking a number of things for a problem, but after a month of taking<br/>Thyroid Support, my physical exam showed improvement in thyroid activity.
 This worked well.
 Great product -- so much easier than taking a bunch of other capsules separately.
 I've experienced increased metabolism,  better skin and hair, and my sleep is actually restful. Also, since adding thyroid support I'm no longer experiencing stiffness and body aches.
 I am about to start my second bottle now and I am hoping to see results as I get the Thyroid Support in my system. Right now I cannot tell any difference in the way I feel but I am hoping that it will become more apparent very soon.<br/><br/>Lisa Geist
 I've been taking this for about two weeks and have felt a gradual increase in energy.  I haven't had any side effects, and will continue taking it.  I hope for continued improvement in overall energy.
 It really seems to help, I started feeling better just a few days after I started this, thank you!
 I actually dont know how many stars i Yould give this product but for know i will give it 3 stars just because I  havent notice a difference maybe I should take it with my prescription for it to work. My main concern is my mental fogness and I still don't feel the difference. But maybe I should keep on taking it and see what happens in a couple of weeks.
 Wonderful product. As someone who had a Total Thyroidectomy 11 years ago, it's a constant struggle learning what my body needs in conjunction to the daily thyroid pill from my Dr. This product has everything I need to function. The Iodine helped clear my back acne up right away and my weight has maintained even though I've been a bit bad with the Holidays. I highly recommend this product.
 I feel better when I take this!  More energy for my sluggish thyroid!
 This has given me more energy with no side effects. I am pleased with the results.
 I've been taking this product for almost a month now and I have already noticed increased energy and less brain fog! Definitely recommend it for those who suffer from hypothyroid!
 good product did not work with my prescription medications unfortunately
 I have used this product for the past two months and have noticed a big change. My clarity is much better than before, have more energy and also have lost weight in the process. I highly recommend this product
 I have noticed a big difference in my energy since starting. Taking as directed and increasing my water intake has been key.
 On my second bottle love this product!!! It works!!!
 Didn't lose any weight, and I clean homes for a living constantly on my feet walking almost 20k a day. don't waste your money.
 So far I feel great with this product. I love the energy!
 loved it, has really helped me, i have no thyroid so this gives me a huge boost
 Met expectations to improve thyroid function for a percentage increase in weightloss. Noticeable different &gt;25%. Difficult to gauge effectiveness exactly, but did see improved results.
 It's hard to tell at this early stage - but it seems effective.  I will continue using for sure, and update this in a month or two. But so far so good.
 So far I like it. I haven't seen as amazing benefits as everyone else, but I do feel more energized. Hopefully with continued use I reap more benefits. Will definitely get another couple bottles.
 Just finished my first bottle and what a difference. I feel more energized than before. I can't live without it. I highly recommend it
 I was diagnosed with hypothyroid in 2010 and even though I've been on medication I've struggled with my energy level, Weight gain and moodiness. I started taking thyroid support about 3 weeks ago and have seen a difference in my mood and energy level. I am only giving it 4 stars because I haven't seen a difference in my weight, but am hopeful.
 I'm very happy with this thyroid support product. It has helped me with my energy level as well as my ability to think more clearly
 So far its been good I have more energy during the day and don't feel like I get that midday crash.
 Ever since I took this Thyroid support, I feel less tired than before! It helps me to work and enjoy life better. Thank you.
 Very great product, saw results!
 Seems to help
 I've been taking this for 3 weeks and really found it's helped suppress my appetite and keep me going at work
 Absolutely worthless…finished the whole bottle as directed, ZERO benefits. Huge disappointment, 1 star is still too much, I wish zero was an option
 Awesome product. I will buy it again.
 Gave me a little more energy in the mornings.
 I’m so very thankful for this product!! It has done a number of changes for my moms life!! She has been pain free and no more fatigue!!! Thank you so much this product has been a blessing
 I love this product. Gives me lots of energy and helps me to maintain my weight.
 I was taking armour thyroid without any supplements and feeling tired and sluggish still, so I decided to research and buy supplements, thyroid support complex has given me energy back that i have not had in a very long time.
 It did nothing for me but give me a headache and stomach cramps. I would not recommend.
 Have been taking this for a couple of months now, and my metabolism had significantly improved, along with my mood, energy, and over all well being. Will continue to take this everyday!
 I was very hesitant at first, but my energy levels are so much better while taking these vitamins!  I have the energy to work out and I actually want to!
 I bought this product a few weeks ago after reading other reviews and decided to go ahead and give it a try ! I take a prescription thyroid med but it just doesn't seem to be doing enough but taking this in conjunction actually seems to be helping !<br/>I've had a lot more energy lately more than I've had in along time , I've already ordered a second bottle .
 I have found Thyroid Support by Zhou Nutrition a great product and will continue purchasing this product, I’ve completely gone off my armour Thyroid medication , because this has made my thyroid levels great.
 I am pleased with this supplement, I did feel a tad bit more energetic! I can only hope it gets better if I take 2 a day like the bottle suggests.
 This has been a good product for Me. Seem to not drag as bad and have noticed less bloat. I'm not AS cold.
 Endless energy. I have a very busy lifestyle, I have a busy job , three young kids and compete in natural bodybuilding. This takes a toll on my system. This product helps bring my natural energy levels up big time. Highly recommend.
 I have always been borderline hypothyroidism. I would prefer not to take medication so I thought I would give these a try. I have noticed more energy and much less bloated. I just got my second bottle today!
 I have not noticed any change taking these pills. I have been taking two a day since I got the bottle. And nothing . I will not be reordering.
 I started taking this thyroid support because my perscripton medicine didn't seem to be working very well, the addition of this supplement has seemed to help me feel more like myself. The only downside is that the pills are kinda large.
 I have been taking this formula for three weeks now and just made the remark yesterday on how clear thinking I've been.  For the past year I've been so foggy brained and unable to remember even the simplest things, or getting so distracted so easily that nothing was getting done. I can't attest to the energy because I'm also taking pseudoephedrine from allergies, but historically that hasn't helped with the fog brain at all. I'm extremely pleased thur far.I think I've lost maybe 3 pounds but I'm not actively doing anything to help with that.
 I have been taking this for almost a month. I love it. I have more energy and have slept through the night for the first time in a long time and wake up ready to face my day.
 I felt the fog lift by the second day.  It was great along with Thyroid Armour my doctor prescribed!!!
 I purchased and have been using the product for the last 30 days.  I felt it help balance out my cravings and I was able to drops some pounds.  I also notice I had more consistent energy throughout the day.
 I've tried a lot of different supplements but this one by far is my favorite. I like that the one pill has a lot in it so I don't have to take a bunch of different supplements. In reading about thyroid support though I did find that vitamin b6 is beneficial and this supplement doesn't have B6 ... just B12. So, I'm going to order B6 to take a long with it as well as continual exercise, no processed foods and making sure that foods with goitrogens are cooked.
 I have only used this for about two weeks<br/>Already seeing a difference<br/>Cant wait to see results even more with continued use<br/>Also use hairfluence byZhou loving this company and their products
 I love this.. It has really helped me get back on track.
 Great! I was suddenly feeling sluggish and gaining weight even though I maintain a healthy lifestyle. After doing some research, I was hoping that this product would help me... and it has! I feel like myself again and definitely notice a difference when I forget to take it.
 I loved  it.  Gave  me energy and felt I lost some weight . Going on my second bottle. Highly recomend!
 This is a wonderful product!! It has been years since I have felt the type of results I'm getting now. I feel not only more energetic but also I feel enthusiastic. This Thyroid Support has enabled me to start daily walks without being exhausted afterwards. I started with 4,000 steps a day, and now I'm about 7,000 steps, plus additional steps I take at home while doing housework!! I'm thankful that I have become more productive!!! I'm also glad I decided to try it!!!
 Excellent service, quick delivery.  Decided to try this product after reading the reviews and am very pleased so far.  I am finishing my first bottle and excited to receive my second bottle free!
 I admit I was skeptical when I first tried this product, but I had been feeling very sluggish, so I figured I'd give it a shot. My energy level increased dramatically. I love this product.
 I feel like my energy has boosted since I started using this product! I will continue to monitor how I feel and update as I go.
 I have so much more energy now that I've started taking this. I'm about to start my second bottle so hoping to see a little drop in weight soon as well
 Great product!  Really felt a difference...definitely felt a boost in energy.  I have low thyroid so this product really helped me.
 Started using this product 3 weeks ago and I'm thrilled with the outcome. Big boost in my energy, metabolism up, I feel stronger and brain fog lifted as well. Highly recommend!
 I love these pills!! They do everything promised and more!!
 I have only been on it for a month and at this time I really can't say but  i ave ordered another bottle and after a couple of months I will be glad to give an update.
 I’ve been using this for a month and can definitely feel a difference. My husband says it’s helped I’m prove my mood and I just feel better.
 So far so good! I'm only 2 weeks into taking this so haven't had a chance to see the affects of it. I'm looking forward to it because I've heard &amp; read some great reviews. It takes about 30-60 days for any supplement to work, in my opinion. I would definitely buy again.
 I used this paired with the Green tea extract supplement, and it caused my stomach to hurt really bad. I’m not sure if my body was just adjusting to them, but I couldn’t continue using them after a couple days<br/><br/>Edit: Although my body reacted poorly to this supplement, Zhou Nutrition has showed amazing customer service! They provided me with a full refund and is even letting me try another one of their products free of charge.
 I love it!<br/>I have more energy and it has helped on my depression problems almost done with the first bottle , planning to buy another ! So far so good !
 Definitely seen improvement in energy! Not ready to run a marathon, but feeling better than I have!
 Thanks
 doesnt work...waster of money
 I am almost through my first bottle of Thyroid support and I am so happy with the results. I have struggled with symptoms of hypoglycemia for years. This supplement has really helped those symptoms diminish. I will definitely reorder!!
 It seems to work, will update my review as I finish my first bottle.
 It did NOT help me I had a bad reaction my face got a rash and it got soooo dry as well! So not happy with this product
 Great product! Definitely feel less bloated
 Doctor always said my thyroid was fine. After taking this supplement, I have had more energy, I'm sleeping better, and my clothes are fitting better. Plan to keep taking!
 Thyroid issues run in my family and I was tired of feeling drained all of the time. I decided to try this Thyroid Support and it seems to be working great! I can get out of bed easier, losing weight seems easier, I don't feel like I need a nap by noon... I hope it continues to help.
 I truly believe that these helped regulate my irregular periods and PMS/PMDD.
 This product along with changes in diet has made a marked improvement in my thyroid levels.  I seem to have more energy and have lost weight., breaking a weight loss plateau.
 I just started taking these, and I have already seen a big difference on my energy level!!  I have tried several different products for thyroid at our local health food store &amp; none of them have helped like these!!
 I love this product, ever since I started taking this product along side N.O pro and Spiralini, I have a lot more energy through out the day and feel great!
 After a month of use I have seem some changes. I don't feel as exhausted all the time and have a little more energy. I bought another bottle and hope to continue to see good results.
 Works much better than my synthroid.
 This product is great. My energy levels improved and a general feeling of sluggishness was gone. The pills never upset my stomach either.
 This product really can help! I'm not diagnosed with hypothyroidism, but I do have a lot of the signs of hypothyroidism. My energy has definitely been up since I started taking Zhou thyroid support.  It's definitely worth a try!
 High quality ingredients - and really helps me manage stress. I'll buy again!
 I received an empty package. There's nothing in the  envelope that was delivered to my home.
 Been taking it for a week now. It seems to be helping.
 This has iodine so if you have Hashimoto's, be careful with your dosage. I take one a day in addition to my other supplements and it seems to be working well for me.
 Loving the thyroid support!!!!  Noticing that it is helping me sleep better at night and think more clearly.
 I am very happy with this product and will order again.
 These have definitely jump started my workout and I've been feeling better about my exercise productivity after almost a month of use. I don't know what the long-term outcome will be, but I am starting to feel some immediate results in both my performance and overall body functions.
 I felt more awake and had stable energy throughout the day. I didn't take two at once. One in the AM and one in the afternoon. I eat primarily Paleo and exercise regularly. I'm exchange for my review I received a free bottle of this product.
 Since I've been taking this i feel more energized during the day and I've lost weight.
 Great product!  I’m been struggling with thyroid issues for years and I take medication daily. This product gives me more energy and reduced mental fog or fatigue.<br/><br/>Staying on it!
 My lab results always showed I was in range, etc. but at 65 I felt off my game. I was searching for an answer when I came across this product. I took it for a solid 3 weeks before it dawned on me that hey this stuff is working. I highly recommend. There is no "wow" factor. Give it the opportunity to get into your system. Time well spent.
 I felt less tired and had more energy after only one week of taking this! My head feels more clear also
 This has been a life changer for me!! I have More energy, focus, and an overall feeling of greatness!! I am on my second bottle now!! Love this stuff!!
 What a great product for that extra you may not be getting from your thyroid medication. Thank you
 Good stuff.
 Feeling so much better
 About to order my third shipment. I've lost 6 lbs and have more energy.
 Have taken this for a month and feeling great! Less tired😃
 Definitely noticed an increase in energy. I noticed my stomach becomes irritated when I take the recommended two pills per day, so I just stick to one per day.
 Works great!  Gives me some much needed focus and energy!
 makes you really shaky.
 The product is great. I feel that it gives me a lot of energy. I will keep taking this product. I am impressed.
 Good product.
 I am pleasantly surprised by the difference I have seen in such a short time using this product. I have noticed increased energy and am even down a couple pounds within the first 3 weeks! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking to improve their energy levels and boost their weight loss efforts!
 Okay product, but I don't think this is worth the money.
 Helps me alot with sleep and focusing!
 Will buy again seems to give more energy
 I love this stuff!  Better energy, better sleep, and I handle stress better.
 I am hypothyroid and this does seem to help with making me feel for energized in the morning
 I do definitely have more energy and feel better overall since beginning to take these pills. I'm ordering my next bottle now to be sure I don't run out. Love it!
 I've been using this for about 3 weeks it seems to be helping my knees I was having a lot of pain in my knee joints. Hoping this is the answer so I can get back 2 riding my bike
 I really noticed a difference in my energy levels and I just felt like my body started functioning better only after a week of taking these. I love them and will continue to take these.
 Have felt so much better since starting
 I had to stop taking this product because it made me feel dizzy and more tired than usual.  I will not be buying this product again.
 I’m about half way through the bottle. Definitely noticed a difference in terms of energy, I think I’ve noticed a difference in metabolism. It might be to soon to tell though.
 Amazing product! From Day one I noticed my energy levels saying consistent throughout the day instead of crashing as soon as I got out of bed. I feel like the weight is coming off faster without any change to exercise or diet. I couldn't seem to loose more than a lb a week even with significant workouts I am up to 2 + without changes except these pills in just a few weeks! I have also noticed my focus as work has changed! I have tried many things at once, diet, exercise but nothing was working to make me feel like I had the energy to be focused and passionate like I used to be. I won't say this is a magic pill but it's the closest thing I have found over the counter and I have been refusing for years to go on prescription medications as I was raised in a homeopathic household my whole life. This is a great great product! Give them a try! I even received an email from them following up after my purchase so I enjoyed the personalized customer service for an online purchase!
 It doesn't work for me :(  I read all reviews and I bought it because I needed something to help my thyroid. After 2 weeks taking it I didn't see any change and I asked the seller when He contacted me by email, if I needed to take it for longer to see results but He didn't answer. I stopped taking it because I got headaches and I gained weight too! I have taking synthroid for 15 years and I don't feel good.
 I'm taking this for only 8 days. I must say that I feel different. ..more energy and happier!
 love it
 B vitamins work just as well.
 I bought this product once before last year and I actually did see results. I had lost almost 10 pounds fairly quickly. I recently purchased another bottle which I have been taking for the past month. I did lose about 6 pounds at one point but when I weighed myself again I am only down about 2lbs. I have been working out and lifting weights and watching what I eat and I feel skinnier in the stomach. I am going to continue to use this product
 Followed the instructions on taking for a month and did not notice any change or benefit from it. Received full refund from company
 Very good product.
 Great product! If only it wasn't so pricey 😑 that's my only concern
 Noticed results with first bottle more energy and lost 5 pounds in first 30 days as opposed to zero without them.
 I took this product according to the directions and there were zero noticeable effects.<br/>However, even without asking for one, a full refund was issued. The service was good even if the product wasn't right for me.
 Serious energy improvement. Love it. Will continue to order this and my other zhou nutrition products. Good brand!!!
 Good little boost I was looking for.
 Best product!! Will continue to purchase!!
 This gave me a burst of energy that i never had before im definetly sold on this product i will purchase another bottle.
 I have taken the thyroid support for a month and have noticed increased energy.  I am waiting on the weight loss but I know it is coming!
 I absolutely love this product. I have tons of energy and feel more alert.
 Love these vitamins! On my second bottle
 I have a thyroid problem and have found this to be a great way to help regulate my thyroid.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who needs that extra boost for a hypoactive thyroid.
 I started Thyroid Support on my doctor's advice.  Took about a month to start seeing some effects.  Just ordered my second bottle and can't wait to see how much better it gets!
 The product did nothing for me
 I like the product I think it helps every order another bottle
 This is a good product.  I definitely feel like I have more energy.
 Definetly a must buy if you struggle with energy, motivation, and drive to get things done.  Will continue to purchase this product for my under active thyroid.
 Great product..has really helped my overall well being plus have shed a few pounds
 I feel so much better after using this supplement. Combined with my prescription thyroid medication, I feel like I have a new lease on life! Thank you Zhou Nutrition!
 Finally a product that works for me. I was about to give up on thyroid supplements till I found this. Couldn't be happier.
 I take Thyroid Support along with my natural thyroid prescription and I feel so much better....more energy for sure and my mood is more stable! I would recommend this product! If I happen to forget a dose, I can feel the difference so I try not to forget to take it!
 I think this is a good product, the ingredients are very helpful, but my condition has changed, not thyroid, but diabetes!..
 I like the product. It does make me feel better. My issue is that half the time I can’t remember to take it!
 The main thing I have noticed is that my neck feels skinnier.  Where before it felt very swollen all the time.
 I love this product. I’ve noticed a subtle energy boost and increased health.
 To be honest, I cannot tell if it's doing anything.
 Using this as part of my weight loss program! Feel great and losing weight!
 I have been using this product for a little over two months now and its made a massive difference in my everyday life. I have hypothyroid but my levels are very random. I have not been diagnosed with Hashimotos yet but I think we're getting there. Anyway, these vitamins have made a world of difference for me. I feel more energized, I have better night vision, I dont feel nearly as groggy, I've been able to lose weight, I feel less angry and more level headed. Overall, I recommend this to anyone with hypothyroid specifically. I'm not sure about other thyroid issues but this will probably be something that I take for the rest of forever.
 Have noticed marked improvement with this supplement by way of energy levels.  Have been taking this consistently for about 45 days.
 I was very skeptical of any product I buy online but this was a great purchase. I was worried about getting jitters or that uneasy feeling you get with certain pills, to my surprise there was none. Great product will continue to use.
 I am on my third month of this, I was told my thyroid was in normal range even though the doctor refused to check my T3. Since taking this I feel much better.
 This product definitely made a difference in my energy level and general overall mental clarity.
 I have been taking Thyroid Support from Zhou for the last 3 weeks and feel great for the first time in a year.<br/>My energy is back up I don't feel so depressed.I have hypothyroidism and have been taking .65mg of levothyroxine for the last year and felt like it was taking my life from me. I'm hopeful that Thyroid Support will keep me feeling great.
 Great source of iodine and other minerals that tend to be overlooked in other supplements.  Also a brand I trust.
 After taking this I am actually starting to be able to loose the weight and I have lots more energy.  Absolutely love this product.
 I have definitely felt a difference in my overall health. I will continue to take this vitamin as it's seems to be doing good things for me.
 Pretty bummed, was excited to give this a try hoping it would help. Unfortunately, it wasn’t for me.
 I've tried multiple "energy" pills through out the years and this one is by far the best. Sustained energy all day, no jitters, no crash. I'm 5'11", 200lbs, 36 year old male.
 After my first month taking Zhou's thyroid support, I've already noticed a difference in mood and energy. Will definitely purchase again in the future
 Oh, absolutely loved how it made me feel. So much more energy, no anxiety, felt great, but if you have asthma this isn't the pill for you. But, loved how better I felt!!!!
 I had my thyroid checked and was told it was fine but I had all the symptoms of it not being fine...I feel so much better while taking these. So much more energy!
 I have been using this for three weeks and feel much better
 Thanks to this and a few other Zhou products, I've been feeling great and my body maintains balance!
 It's been helpful for me, being borderline hypothyroid but wanting to do things as naturally as possible. I combine it, though, with additional iodine.
 Fantastic Product, only been taking for just over week and already my eyebrows have grown back a bit &amp; my nails are healthier &amp; stronger. Thanks Zhou Nutrition! You Rock!
 My energy level has increased !
 Thyroid disease is an awful disease to have. This product, while not the answer to every issue, is a great start to take control of the ones I have. It helps me not to have to buy many bottles of  different supplements. Thank you Zhou!
 I have tried similar brands before and did not feel any effect.<br/>I noticed a difference in a couple of days with my energy and decrease in my water retention<br/>High Recommend using this product
 Love
 Been taking for 3 weeks now. It does have a little "wake me up" feel to it and I do feel better. Will order again and see how month 2 goes.
 Along with magnesium It seems to give me the boost I need but don’t totally get from my thyroid medication. I feel more energetic and my moods seem more stable.
 I have been this product for 3 months and it was been working great for me. I Noticed some great enhancement in my metabolism, focus, energy and sexual drive. I am very satisfied so far.
 I really wanted something that wasn’t going to give me jitters for energy.. I’m glad I gave this a shot! I’ve really noticed a boost in energy and focus!
 LOVE THIS ZHOU THYROID SUPPLEMENT!!!  I have been been using this along with Armour Thyroid and have noticed increased energy and less hair loss.
 They have made me feel alot better and have noticed my energy has gone up. I felt fatigued before I started taking these, I do recommend them.
 Glad I have these to take.
 My weight bounced all over the place for years.  I was tired  and draggy, but these support pills keep me uplifted and stabilizes my weight.  Love them.
 Great product with all the different minerals you need
 My doctor said this is the best Thyroid complex she has seen. After suffering hair loss from a thyroid issue this brought my numbers back up to normal and my hair has started growing back.
 Absoutly great ... I feel more energy with these this is my second bottle... However I haven't noticed weight loss yet ..
 I have ordered my second bottle. I’ve lost 5 lbs. but more importantly, I just feel better.
 I feel more energized since taking this daily.  I rate it a 5 star
 I have experienced a noticeable increase in my energy levels and a sustained trend with my serum TSH results. Other supplements I have tried in the past have not worked nearly as well. Highly recommend!
 A friend recommended the thyroid support for weight loss help, and although I am still working on that, I can report that I have noticed an improvement with my memory.
 Love this product!! I have an under active thyroid and take medication but I always feel like I am in a fog and have trouble focusing. When I take this I feel the affects right away and can focus. It has changed the way I work and can now concentrate and get things done the right way!
 Felling much better!! More clarity in thinking, increased energy, elevated and stable mood. Great product.
 I bought this hoping it would help me lose some weight because it seems like I have gained a few pounds that won't go away since starting birth control. I am a female in my early 20s, and I am a pretty active person. I am 5'3", I weighed between 130 and 140 pounds when I bought this, and I have a somewhat muscular build. I usually walk between 8000-13000 steps a day, and my job involves a lot of heavy lifting (30+ pound boxes) and walking 4 hours a night. So, I am definitely not terribly unfit. I took this at least 1 time a day, 2 when I remembered, for as long as I had the pills, and did not notice any results. I did not appear to lose weight, and it had no effect on my energy levels. I did not give it one star because I could have used it more regularly. Everybody's body is different, and just because it didn't work for me won't mean it won't work for you though.
 Used it for the first time and really felt good. Not tired and energy throughout the day. I would definitely recommend this product.
 I've been taking this for the past few weeks. I've definitely noticed and increase in my energy, which is what I needed. It has messed with my stomach a little but not enough that I'll stop taking it.
 Really good product! I just started to use it and makes a difference on my energy level ...
 Amazing product, my thyroid has gone up since I have started taking Throid support complex. I wouldn't go without taking this on a daily basis.
 Great stuff. More energy since taking it.
 Headache side effects and made thyroid sore ....
 Very happy with this product. I felt better after a day or two of starting<br/>to take it.<br/>I haven't checked my TSH since I started taking it but I do feel a<br/>difference.<br/>I would recommend this product.
 I love this product! It has the correct amounts of each vitamin that is recommended daily. As opposed to other products that overload with way too high amounts of some and way too little of others.
 I started taking this several weeks ago and do notice that I have more energy ...also seem to sleep better with less hormonal heat issues. Will see how thing progress and will update.
 I have really been loving how I feel after taking this! In the past I have taken prescription medications for my thyroid but with this supplement, I don't feel like I need to. Time will tell when I check with my doctor but so far, loving it.
 I’ve taken this for a few days now and is getting severe headaches in the afternoon. Would not recommend this product
 I feel like this helps support my energy, digestion helps.  I defiantly notice a difference when I'm not taking them.
 Enjoyed this product, I just wish I didn't have to take two a day. I'm already on thyroid medicine but I could definitely tell a difference with this product!
 Bought one for my girlfriend and she loved it! Helped her cravings and she’s been in a better mood since she’s been taking them!
 I found myself feeling better since using this product. I have more energy and have just felt better all around
 I tried another brand after this one but came back to this. This makes a huge, noticable difference in my energy level. I am very happy with this product and will continue to use it.
 I have hypothyroidism and I am on 75 mcg of synthroid but I still had trouble losing weight.  By the end of the first bottle I had started to drop some wright and my energy level went up.  I don't know how it will be with others but for me it worked great and I'm continuing to take it.
 I never thought anything would make me feel like I used to.  I am 61-1/2 and feel like I used to at 30!!!  Thank you.  I have tried diet pills, anything to get energy, this works.
 I have a struggling thyriod, I was able to use this and delay thyriod medication. I felt a noticeable increase in energy and focus taking it
 I like this, when I can tell it works is when I quit taking it for a while.
 Love it, curbs my appetite and I have lost inches off my neck and face. I feel so much better since I started taking it 3 weeks ago.
 These pills work!! Not over the top where you feel it kick in and wear off I just feel better and have more energy. I have a sensitive stomach and haven't had any discomfort yet. For now I am pleased with product.
 Love this product. I feel like my energy levels are back to where they use to be. I will continue to order this!
 The highest recomended dose of prescription stimulants and tons of caffine and energy drinks left me still exhusted at my job. On days off i slept more than anything else had to force myself up if it was even possible. With less than a month after starting this supplement i have so much energy that i dont even recognize my former self. Thank you.
 I have been using it for a month, my TSO went a bit down and T4 is in healthy range now (went a bit up). Will be using it another month.
 Love this Product! Would Buy Again !
 This stuff really works! I was skeptical to try it but when I started using it I noticed a dramatic decrease in fatigue and way less brain fog. Highly recommend!!!
 I absolutely love this it defently gives me more energy, I just feel like how I used too. Definitely recommend this to anybody that has thyroid issue
 I love it. Is being very helpful during my weight loss process
 Three years of hell with medications. I was on this for 10 days and my medication had to be decreased. I’m neer stopping
 I really wanted this product to work....but alas it didnt. Very disappointed. :-(
 This will be my second time purchasing a bottle of this product! It really helps me to be more regular, and I have notice my energy levels have gone up. All in all it is a great product and I highly recommended it to everyone.
 I like the product so far. It has helped with my up and down drowsy feeling. I still feel tired but not as much. I would like to continue taking to see if areas improve.
 I had high hopes for this product.  Possibly I simply don't need  a thyroid product at all.<br/>I had no noticeable changes in any way after 7 days of use.  For me $ not well spent.  I hope it helps others solve their problems.  Update!  To my surprise I was issued a refund. I did not request one.  I feel this companies customer service works over and above to insure customer satisfaction.<br/>Thanks to customer service for being the "best I've seen."
 Good stuff!  Does what it claims!  Feel like I have increased energy and that extra thyroid support I needed.  Thanks!
 I really feel my energy levels coming back and the night sweats I was having disappeared!
 I have been using this for 10 days, after 7 days I all the sudden noticed I was starting to feel better already. I have been struggling with weight gain as well with my thyroid disease , even though my doctor keeps saying my labs are fine, I feel awful and tired all the time and it's been so frustrating. Even with exercising and eating better all the time I wasn't losing that weight. Last week I started feeling better and I lost 1.5 lbs, without doing anything different. This is the only change I have made in my life and I honestly think it was this. Makes me wonder why in the world my Endocrinologist never told me about these. I can't wait to see how I feel after I keep taking them!
 I have been taking this about a month now and i feel such a diffrence. In a hurry i forgot to take my capsules one day and i really did feel the diffrence. I love this product!
 I have tried this for one month and definitely notice an increase in energy, which is exactly what I was hoping for!  I'll continue to take it..
 The energy I found taking the thyroid support was noticeable. I didn't have any side-effects although I was warned about them. I highly recommend it!
 I have used a full bottle of Thyroid Support and noticed increased energy and focus.  I look forward to continued used.
 I've used this to help with my thyroid and it does wonders. This has helped me so much and I just ordered my second bottle plus Zhou Nutrition gave me another complimentary bottle. Thank you thank you. I love Zhou products!
 This product provides me with more energy, not sure about weight loss, but I do fall asleep faster. Will buy again to help me with my hypothyroid condition.
 Great product.  I started feeling better the next day. <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Thyroid-Support-Complex-With-Iodine-to-Improve-Energy-Help-Lose-Weight-Natural-Supplement-to-Increase-Concentration-Boost-Metabolism-Reduce-Brain-Fog-Feel-Like-Your-Old-Self-Again/dp/B00S8PW6P6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Thyroid Support Complex With Iodine to Improve Energy &amp; Help Lose Weight - Natural Supplement to Increase Concentration, Boost Metabolism &amp; Reduce Brain Fog - 'Feel Like Your Old Self Again'</a>
 This stuff is the best. I love it. With me only having half of a Thyroid this supplement helps out a lot and now I have more energy and I feel relaxed.
 Definitely helps with energy, if I forget to take it....I notice a difference. I would highly recommend if you are suffering from thyroid deficiency!
 Love this product and will be purchasing again in the future!
 Lover his product!  I have Hashimoto's Thyrodism and this gives me everything I need to keep that under control! 💗
 I'm not sure if the product is helping or not. I've been on it for a month,  but I haven't felt a difference taking it. Perhaps i just need to be on it more than 4 weeks. I'll review again at a later date.
 This Thyroid support was really great! I definitely had more energy and mental focus. I will buy again!
 Gotta say...I'm on no meds currently for under-active thyroid, but the condition has been affecting me for years.  I also have chronic anxiety and depression which has affected my life in the following ways:  loss of interest in my passions, lethargy, irritability, lack of motivation...i could go on.  I am on meds for the anxiety only.  I started taking this (one pill a day in the a.m.) about a week ago.  I noticed a difference within a few days, small difference.  But today, one week later, I notice a big difference.  I have more natural energy (not caffeiney or anything like that), more motivation to get up and go do things i want to do...and some things I don't want to do but must.  I haven't noticed any weight change, but I am imagining that once you feel more energy, less lethargic, and more motivated, that's when you get up and start movin' and the weight comes off.  Mental hazey feeling has left somewhat at this stage.  I'm gonna stick with it and see how i feel in a month.  I'll update y'all then.  Good luck!
 This is great product! It has helped with my low energy levels and weight gain!
 EXCELLENT PRODUCT! Works as advertised.I have much more energy at the gym,and definitely have a better overall feeling about myself.Just starting my third bottle,and plan to continue!
 I have been dieting for 2 years, lose a little gain a little, after hearing my mom and sister have thyroid problems I decided to try thyroid support. Right away I felt great, my weight isn't yoyoing anymore when I lose it is keep it off!
 WOW THIS IS FREAKING AWESOME LOST 5 POUNDS IN 2 WEEKS WITH NO PROBLEM GOOD PRODUCT WILL ORDER AGAIN
 This product is wonderful. I have energy now that i didn't before. Most of my thyroid problems have lessen or went away!
 Great product.  I've lost weight because I don't feel hungry - especially in the afternoon/evening when snacking is the most tempting for me.  And, no jitters or headaches like you get with caffeine products.
 I had tried several other products with no success.  I noticed a difference immediately when I started using this product and make sure I take it every day.
 My family has a long line of thyroid problems. This helps me feel better about making sure I can delay those ends as long as possible. I'm
 I love this stuff! I've been battling with being hypothyroid for almost 10 years and nothing has given me more energy. My hair has noticeably gotten longer and I've been losing a lot less of it.
 I really like this product, and  believe it helps! I feel more energized &amp; think clearer! I will continue to use it and  benefit from the results!
 I started taking this in conjunction with some other lifestyle changes and saw some improvements in my energy.
 I have been using Thyroid Support Complex as a supplement to Armour Thyroid for more than one year and I am very satisfied with the results.
 My daughter is trying these. So far so good. I will update after she uses her first full bottle.
 I seem to have more energy after a month of use.
 Waste of money, i dont either feel different or see any difference
 I didn't notice a change the first month of taking it. I know sometimes things can take 6-8 weeks to take effect so I'd be willing to try a second month.
 I really love this product!! I dont know what I would do without it :)
 Has anyone taken 3 pills a day instead of 2? Only been taken it 3 days now gives me energy but i want to try to take it 3 times times a day!
 Love this stuff! It works well! I've noticed my hair isn't as dark and thick and PMS symptoms are much lighter.
 I was skeptical when trying this product, but it has proven itself over the last 30 days. I have more energy throughout the day and an all around improved mood. I would reccomend trying this product to anyone suffering with thyroid issues.
 Didn’t notice any change, I took it for a month consistently. complete waste of money
 Took it for 30 days and my fell out a lot. Had to stop using it, did give me energy though.
 Absolutely amazing! My metabolism is much faster and my focus is 100% improved
 Great product. I've used it now for 45 days and noticed a difference in my sleep, fatigue and skin! I'm not as tired as I use to be and don't feel I have a cloudy mind. Crazy but true. Love it.
 I really haven't noticed a difference.
 More energy.  My hair isn't as dry and thinning has lessened, and falling out have improved--generally, healthier hair.
 This is a good blend with iodine. Gives me extra energy.
 I have been using Throid support for 2 months now an I must say that I do find myself more energized and able to focus and accomplish tasks that I want to get done. Unfortunately,  I have had no weight loss results but I do feel better overall.
 Product came on time and so far it seems to have helped with boosting my energy.  Can't wait until I get blood work done to see how my numbers have changed.
 This is by far the best thyroid support complex that I've ever tried... it has cut my appetite substantially, and has really helped with my energy levels.
 These are awesome!!! My mood and energy are drastically improved!
 Happy with product.
 Very Good👍🏻Thank you🤗
 Felt more energy and was able to focus at work much better.
 May not work for everyone but worth a shot. Great customer service
 this stuff works and i will be getting more.
 I have been taking thyroid support for almost a month. It has given me a lot more energy. I can definitely tell when I forget to take it. Highly recommended!
 I like how this product makes me feel but I develop skin rashes. When I discontinue the rash disappears.
 I definitely felt less foggy. No weight loss, but i went through Thanksgiving, over doing it, and didn't gain 10lbs. I for sure feel it's positive.
 I like it. Helps me focus and gives me energy
 I have taken prescription medication for Hypothyroid for years, but I have never felt that it addressed all of my symptoms. After researching the options and reading the reviews, I decided to try Thyroid Support Complex by Zhou Nutrition. I wasn't expecting a miracle, but I hoped it would help some of my symptoms and it would help with weight loss. I have lost some weight this month, but I have been following a pretty strict diet, so I wasn't sure this supplement really helped. Then when I was studying, it occurred to me that I have been able to get through an amazing amount of coursework in the last few weeks.  My ability to concentrate and stay focused on my studies has been so much better since taking Thyroid Support Complex.  I have reordered and will continue to order this in the future.
 Thyroid support is awesome! I noticed a difference after about 2 weeks and will never go without it again!
 I've really noticed increased energy and feeling more positive since I started taking this a few weeks ago.  I take one pill with breakfast and one with lunch.  So far I'm liking the results
 I am happy with this product and I've ordered it several times.
 I believe this has worked for me coupled with my thyroid medicine and a gluten free diet.
 Haven't taken long, but I do believe it has given me more energy
 I could tell difference within a week.arrived very quickly.
 Several years ago I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism and was on a prescription medication.  I prayed and God healed me from this illness and medication.  When high stress levels unfortunately occur in my life the thyroid doesn't perform as it should causing facial acne, dry hands and hair, low energy.  I discovered this product several months ago and decided to give it a try.  I am bless because the symptoms began to diminish over time..  Not long, maybe a couple of weeks and now I make it apart of my daily regiment.  I prefer natural supplements over over the counter or prescriptions when possible.
 Recommended by my doctor, great product.
 I feel good.
 I absolutely love this product. I feel more energized and focused when I take it!
 This product delivers. It does what it says it will. I can see it beginning to help with weight loss. and the customer support is outstanding. I couldn't recommend it more highly.
 I started taking thyroid support about 2 weeks ago. I was so tired of my energy levels being so low and having no motivation to do anything. I love how this supplement gives me that boost of energy to help me get through the day!
 I have Hashimotos and am still within the "normal" testing range, but my numbers keep getting lower each year I am tested. I was definitely having symptoms of hypothyroidism, including weight gain (and I run 15-20 miles a week and eat clean), super dry skin, being cold, exhausted by lunch. I know my body and decided to try something natural to help combat some of these symptoms. I have been taking this for about 1 1/2 weeks and have noticed a difference. I don't crash by the afternoon anymore, don't feel like I am going to scratch the skin off my legs from being so dry and have actually lost several pounds too. The suggested dose is 2 pills/per day, but I noticed that I had a hard time falling asleep the first night. So, I only take 1 w/ breakfast and all is well. I will continue to to order these. I finally found something that helps the Hashimotos!
 Just ordered another bottle me and my wife was using the same bottle we both really can feel the deference when we take it
 I have only been taking this for a few weeks, but I definitely feel an increase in my energy and ability to focus. So far, so good.
 Have only been using it for a few weeks, but so far I have seen improvements in my weight and I seem to have more mental clarity than before.
 Love it!! I am amazed at how much energy this has given. I feel 10 years younger.
 So far it's helped me feel better and not so tired during the day.  I'm hoping  the longer I take it , it will help in other areas too like weight gain and  focus ,  im halfway my first bottle!
 Thyroid support complex gave me extra energy and mental clarity. Thanks for a great product!
 i really like this product. it has made my engery levels go up and im not as tired as i used to be.
 Definitely feel a difference, but I personally don’t take it everyday.
 Been taking for 2 weeks and have noticed a change in energy! I also noticed I am not as fatigued throughout the day also!
 I feel great after taking this!! I have so much more energy and my hair has stopped falling out. I would definitely recommend this product.
 Great product with quality ingredients.
 After three weeks of taking this my need for a three o clock nap is gone.  I feel much more productive and less moody as well!
 Just finished my first bottle. Ordered my second because it seems to make me feel better! Recommended to my sister in law and works for her too.
 This supplement is great!  I've been taking it for a month now.
 Only been using it for a month &amp; believe it's helping me.
 I had way more energy,and I could tell the difference with my focus/mental clarity. I will definitely purchase again.
 Energy
 Nice product.  I felt good energy and no jitters.  Happy to have this in my supplement stack!
 I like the fact that I've seen improvement in my memory and energy. What l like least is the smell of the capsule.
 Will not reorder. Not effective.
 I love this product.  I decided to try it after 2 friends independently told me they were taking it, and loved it, on the exact same day.  The energy is the best.
 Love the whole line of products.  Have lost weight and my mood is a lot better.
 Just received my bottle i ordered from Amazon and started taking this week. So still early on but seems to give me a boost of energy. Will keep taking and see what happens.
 I like the energy and the hunger  control that I get with these vitamins. I am drink them every morning and have energy all through my work day. I am able to sleep well and feel rested. I I going to order this again.
 I just ordered my second bottle of the thyroid support product because the nutrition it provides is critical to an efficient metabolism. I also supplement this with additional iodine. It's a great product!
 I've been taking this for almost a month now I don't feel any difference so I don't know if its working or not will let u know when and if I feel something different
 I noticed the increased energy and mental focus right away. I am Definitely making this part of my vitamin regimen!
 halfway through bottle improvement shown. taken 5 months after being diagnosed with hypothyroidism. highly recommended
 I started taking thyroid support about a month ago and then switched to Zhou Nutrition after I finished the other bottle.  What I noticed with both products was the increased energy, but I have to say that with Zhou nutrition, I no longer had constipation.  Since I was a child, I've always faced constipation and low energy.  I remember being always tired but attributed to my days always being full of activity.  Only after taking the thyroid support do I realize what normal tiredness really is.  I have energy to last me through my 12 hour work days and still have some to spare.  Since my doctor diagnosed me with low thyroid, I am so happy that I found this product.
 Seems to be working.
 Just started taking. I have Been hypothyroid for 20 years. I like the idea I am giving my thyroid needed support
 My body is not swollen anymore. I lost 3 pounds and i feel great. This product is really working.
 Relieved some minor tyroid issues
 Been taking for a month now, and I have noticed a HUGE difference in my energy levels.
 I take the supplement 2x per day and my TSH levels have improved significantly and # is now in perfect range.  Highly recommended
 I have hypothyroidism and this product helped me a lot. I would eat and take hours for me to use the restroom, with this product I eat  breakfast and take my pill, in 5 minutes my metabolism starts to work!! 2 pills a day and I'm sure ur gonna love it! This is my 2nd bottle.
 Excellent service and healthy combination of nutrients
 Love it
 I had more energy and was able to focus better within days of taking this product.
 I feel SO much better since I started taking this. Energy, focus, you name it. It's a must have
 Its been a few weeks and Im starting to have more energy. I can feel it when i miss a dose. I will definitely be ordering another bottle!
 Found a couple of these in my bottle. I feel like I'm not getting my value for what I spent :(
 Love this company and definitely see a difference when taking these!!
 Have taken product for one month and still trying to figure how much it is helping me due to other health issues. Looking forward to see how much the second month helps.
 I started taking these a month ago along with the Green Tea supplement to help lose weight. I lost around 4 pounds so far which is fair.
 I had been fighting with all different kinds of symptoms of a sluggish thyroid, and after speaking with my doctor decided to try this supplement.  It has really improved so many things for me.  I will continue to use this product and would highly recommend.
 Tried for a month and it did nothing for me
 Personally, I didn't notice enough of a change from this product for it to be worthwhile. 3-Stars because I do believe those who say it worked for them, it just didn't do anything for me
 I really like this product. I have so much more energy when taking this. Really helps me to feel like my old self again
 It’s such a good product. I have a lot more motivation and energy since I’ve been taking these. I highly recommend them
 I buy multiple products from Zhou and every one of them have been excellent high quality items! Will continue to purchase from this company!!
 This product gave me instant energy. I got a subscription so that I never have to be without Thyroid Support. I have lost weight because I have the energy to exercise.
 These pills did nothing for me. 2 months and $40 dollar down the drain. I guess they didn’t make me feel worse so that’s a plus?
 Absolutely love this stuff. Totally feel a difference. Just ordered my second Bottle
 I feel great after trying this supplement. I highly recommend it if you have thyroid issues! I have more energy and have lost weight too. Great product!
 Great support. I will be buying more of this product!
 Definitely feel that I have more energy when I use Thyroid Support
 I have been taking them for about 3 weeks now and I have not had to take one nap (I usually nap about an hour a day). It took a week for them to kick in but they've been great!
 I feel like my 'old self' after taking this for a month! I love that it's all natural and affordable!
 Wasn't impressed. Especially for the money, I figured it would make a lot of difference. Two weeks later and I actually feel more tired than I started, and definitely not a positive change.
 I have definitely noticed a difference in my energy and my hair is getting thicker.  I will definitely buy this product again.
 Great product!
 Seems to be working very well.
 Since taking this product I feel better, have more energy, and seem to have more clarity of mind.<br/>I would recommend.
 I feel like I have more energy, seem to sleep better and not having to take naps in the afternoon.  I will continue to use this product.
 Absolutely love this!! Been on it 3 weeks and have seen an amazing difference. I take it along with syntheoid  and it is perfect!!!
 I have been taking it for a week and am starting to have more energy later in the day
 It was great an gives me energy.
 Finally a product that has addressed my thyroid issue. I have lost 5 pounds and my energy level has increased. I am scheduled for surgery in July to remove the left half of my thyroid. I will continue to use this product.
 I have only taken this for one month. I will be reordering soon to see how longer term results affect me. So hard to get immediate results when it comes to the thyroid.
 Definitely feel better overall! Haven't lost weight, but I'm not exercising. Not sluggish anymore. Wake up and I'm ready to go. Sleeping better too.
 I bought my first bottle on Amazon prime and pleasantly surprised. I noticed energy, feeling so much better.Thank you!
 I have only been taking this for 3 weeks and feel a major  difference.  I don't feel as tired and have more energy  throughout  the day. I haven't lost weight but it's hard with hypothyroidism.  I will keep trying this product
 It's really helped me feel so much better. :)
 I didn't notice any significant changes, maybe a small upswing in energy.  I did take two a day for thirty days before I made any reviews.  I won't be buying these again.i do have to say the company is very good about not wanting you to dislike it.  They even issued me a money back guarantee.
 Love this stuff! Tried it out and noticed a huge difference! My sister and friend have purchased as well. Worth the money!
 Just a waste of money. Didn’t notice any changes with energy levels, etc.
 Love these! I can really tell a difference in my energy, and I no longer need naps everyday!
 I just started to take the thyroid support pills a few days ago and I definitely can feel energy I haven't had for a long time .
 finished my first bottle and it improved my energy level. it is great.
 I have only ordered one bottle of Thyroid Support but plan to start on my second. I have hypothyroidism and was looking for something to help regulate my metabolism and energy.  I have definitely noticed a change since taking these. They help with energy and control appetite, but like anything you have to work at things to expect major results. As other reviewers have mentioned, you need to take them in the morning otherwise you may be awake at night. I only take one capsule currently, as I get the same results as when I take two of them so for now that is what I'm doing. I recommend!
 Good stuff, Wife loves it
 it works
 I have so much more energy when taking these and my mind doesn't have that "foggy" feeling like it normally does. I don't like to run out of these because I can tell such a difference in my body when I do.<br/>Thank you for such a great product!
 satisfied buyer
 I'm so pleased with how I feel and even the weight I've lost since starting the Thyroid Support  Complex.<br/>I sought this out when I could not take my prescribed thyroid meds.  I try to heal with natural products anyway,so  I'll make certain to keep using and telling others about this product.
 I'm  on my second bottle and I feel like a nee person. Still not where I want to be,  but I believe if I keep using it I will get even  better
 This has noticeably helped keep my energy up and me feeling great.
 Excellent supplement - gained energy and felt better overall when taken every day - Thanks!!
 No change took for month
 Works as good , if not better, than prescription drugs.
 I suffer from hypothyroidism. I felt so weak and just tired of doing my normal routine. When I started taking this product in a matter or a couple of days I started to get my energy back. So, happy with this product.
 I am going on my second bottle and really have noticed a difference in my energy level
 I've been using the Thyroid Support Complex for about a month now and I love it! Feel better and have more energy!!
 I have been taking thyroid support for a couple of months now and am feeling much better.  I feel less tired and more alert.  I will continue using since I feel it has improved my quality of life.
 This thyroid supplement is great.  I have been able to stop taking my prescription Thyroid medication.  Thank you so much.
 I tried these after experiencing hypothroid symptoms for a while but my doctor said my levels were fine. I noticed the positive differences the second day I took the thyroid support tablets. My energy level did a 180. I recommend if you too have problematic thyroid symptoms!
 It works! A great relieve when you need to stay awake and focused. Rescued me when was working night shifts
 I have a noted change with these supplements. So much so that I will continue to purchase them. I was hesitant at first. But, now I am a believer in this product.
 I feel so much better with this!
 Helped me when I was transitioning from Levothyroxin to Armour.
 Love this stuff! Finally, losing a couple pounds!
 This product works great. I get more energized. I wasn't suffering from insomnia on it. My hair also felt so much healthier.
 This is an amazing product. It really helps with my energy. I feel the difference from my prescribed thyroid meds and this. Will continue buying it
 Great product! I was suffering from extreme fatigue and resulting weight gain. Increased my energy and is helping the slow process of losing weight (easy to gain; very difficult to lose).
 Haven’t taken it for long but can definitely tell I have more energy and not as fatigued.
 Good product. I take it once a day along with my thyroid pill and I have good sustainable energy through the day.
 I am on levothyroxine and hate having to take it.  I decided to try this product to see if I could tell a difference.  More energy, less brain fog and I am hopeful that when my blood levels are next tested, I can decrease the dosage of levothyroxine.  Would prefer to go natural all the way!
 Amazing product!! I feel much more enrgized now and i sleep much better!! First bottle is almost gone and will be buying another one!!
 Great product! I feel like I have more consistent energy through out the day.
 Works great!! Gives me the energy I need to keep up with my 3 wild children! Will buy again!
 I feel better using this, I feel like I have more energy. My functional MD approved of me taking this and suggested I continue taking it.
 Good product.
 This did the trick for my brainfog
 Great for your thyroid.  Lots of the natural iodine it needs. I knew I needed this combo of stuff but was really lazy about actually taking it. I  have been sleeping better. Not sure if it's the product but I hope it keeps up. I had Hashimoto's, I'm almost baseline and I hated the feeling of Synthroid. I'm gonna keep taking this
 This product works great. Will buy again! I have way more energy then I used to. Product works really fast!
 Gentle lib the stomach.
 Wouldn’t think this product would work out for me but it  has worked wonders definitely recommend purchasing this product!!
 I really wanted this supplement to work for me but it didn't.
 So far so good, I'm hoping to see more of an improvement with my second bottle.
 No bad taste or aftertaste.
 Great product! Have been using it for 3 weeks and already notice a difference in my energy level.
 Waiting on my 2nd bottle. I could feel the difference. Just feel better overall. Getting labs soon.
 Still trying it out, only on the first bottle though. Felt a little hotter at night but less tired.
 I have been using this product for almost 60-days and am 100% satisfied.
 This puts together a lot of the herbal supplements that are evidence-based for thyroid support.
 I have been taking this for two months now..i feel wonderful have more energy, less brain fog and just over all feel normal finally.. Those is the best I've  felt since iv had thyroid.. Thank you so much thyroid support
 I feel like this is helping me.
 I've been trying to find an endocrinologist who can help me and haven't had luck! This product worked wonders for me! I've only been taking it for about 2 weeks but I feel like I have a lot of energy, which was totally lacking! I will be buying again!
 This has made me feel great, I am very please with this brand and will continue to purchase their products.
 I love this product it actually does make you feel like your old self again I'm pretty much tired and run-down all the time I don't get enough sleep I go to work out I don't have any energy. When I take the thyroid support I feel awake alert not a burst of energy just good to go you don't feel anything in particular as it in like you're having a good day like you had got some good sleep the night before that's the best thing that could be a my opinion I'd recommend this to anyone give it a try you have nothing to lose and everything to gain! I haven't noticed any kind of negative side effect or anything it's all on the upside!
 seems to help my engery level
 Really have not seen any results.  Also was told that if I submit a customer review I would get a free bottle.  Only happens if you put 5 starts.  I emailed them and haven't heard a word back
 I've been taking this product for almost a month and I really like it! My energy level has increased! I fee more focused and less groggy at work!
 Supports my diet with the necessary ingredients. I love the company's full transparency policy. This product clears my mind and helps me power through the day.
 It seems to help more than others I've tried. There are so many factors that affect our energy level.  This is the most effective of those I've tried.
 Works well. Saw a decrease in my hair loss.
 So far I like that I have more energy. I feel a difference overall.
 Completed 1st bottle. Have noticed improved focus and energy not sure about metabolism. Definitely enjoying the focus and energy!
 This works. I always struggled to get my thyroid to the right levels the s mixed with medicine worked finally!!
 So far so good! I've been using it now for about four weeks and I have noticed a change in a few places. Call me crazy but I see a difference in my skin. Having thyroid issues tends to cause me t breakout and now the breakouts are minimal. My cravings for sweets has also diminished some and I sleep much better! Energy is also a bit better, so all in all I feel very good about the product!
 Results were noticeable but not overwhelming. Ordering again.
 tried other products that didn't work till i tried this thyroid product and it works great!!!!!!!
 amazing all i got to say i feel so much better all ready only 3 days in if your on the fence try it
 Beware! This stuff is pretty powerful. I made the mistake of finishing a bottle and stopping without tapering down and it had me really friggin depressed. Nothing else was going on in my life at the time so I can only attribute it to this product. Be careful with this stuff. I give it three stars due to the lack of warning of the potency of this product.
 VERY pleased with this product.....
 Great product...take first thing in the morning on an empty stomach and no problems whatsoever.
 Just amazing how fast my energy and reservoir of energy was replenished!
 It works, I feel more energy and focus. Also my digestive system has improved
 My Husband and I Both love it ....we are so glad we stumbled on to this product<br/>  Thank you,<br/>Kimberly and Bill Petersen- McCance
 did not help in any way
 IT HAS IMPROVED MY ENTERGY AND CONTROL MY APPETITE . Also has helped with wait.
 Have been using this supplement for 3 weeks, and have definitely noticed a difference - more energy and mental clarity!
 Feel great after 1st week taking it! It hasn't necessarily helped me lose weight, but I could see the potential of long term!
 This is a great product that I've purchased multiple times now. You won't be disappointed.
 I already went through a bottle with great results. I made a mistake in buying a cheaper brand, I'll be going back .
 This product gives me a natural feeling of increased energy levels and i have been steadily losing weight while taking it.
 Got refund, because it didn't helped me
 Since using this product, i have more energy, and feel better
 So far so good. Giving it time to work. My doctor told me to take iodine so I thought I would give this a whirl.
 I actually got this for help with menopause. I do feel like I have more energy. Thank you.
 Have had cold intolerance for the past few years...i’ve been taking levothyroxin for 19 years.  Didn’t not realize until a couple of months ago that I still have thyroid symptoms even though I take medication.  Silly me trusted my GP for the last 19 years when I go in every year to get my blood work checked and he says that it looks good.  So about 2 months ago I decided to do my own research and dig deeper about hypothyroidism.  I found that lots of people are in my shoes, and have experienced the same exact problem.  What did I learn? I learned that you need to listen and pay attention to your own body and symptoms.  My body and symptoms are telling me I need T3 because my body isn't converting the T4 into T3 which is the active thyroid hormone. These doctors aren’t testing for everything they should be. They should check T3, T4, Iron,<br/>R T3, TSH, Antibody levels TPO &amp; TG<br/>(My other symptoms are lack of energy, cold intolerance: feet cold at night, dry itchy skin, scalp, voice a little husky, hair still falls out some, weight gain &amp; brain fog)  So I really want to take a natural T4 and T3 instead of the synthetic drugs.<br/>Anyone with hypothyroidism do a search on iodine and iodine deficiency.  Very, very interesting.<br/>While on this, I noticed my feet were not cold at night.  Only took 1 month but would like to see the difference if I continue.
 Haven't had any bloodwork done since I started taking the product but I do feel better overall.
 As advertised!!! Will Buy again. Great Company. I have bought other products from Zhou Nutrition
 love, love love love love it.
 I am on my first bottle and noticed that after a week (taking two a day) has increased my energy significantly and I have also noticed I am more focused. I cannot wait to see what happens with continued use.
 I feel so much better after taking
 I have added this to my workout/healthy eating routine &amp; noticed extra energy in the mid afternoon!
 This product helped me to maintain my weight and burn fat by evidence of non gaining any weight.
 I don't know that I've noticed much difference other than in my poops. If you have constipation issues this will definitely help.
 I like the extra support along with my thyroid medicine
 First off, I have PCOS and have always struggled to lose and/or maintain weight, even with regular strenuous exercise and healthy eating.  I have been taking Ovasitol for the PCOS and have lost almost 40 pounds in the last year (seriously, if you have PCOS check them out).  Anyway, I had hit a particularly difficult plateau but wanted to drop another 10 pounds, plus possibly make it easier to maintain the weight loss without a 6 day/week exercise routine.  At my last physical my TSH levels were on the high end of normal.  Apparently not enough of a concern for my doctor.  However, given my weight and GI issues, I went in search of a little help.<br/><br/>After reading so many positive reviews, I was hopeful for some weight loss benefits and maybe improvement in mental clarity or GI problems.  No dice.  Like a number of other reviewers, I had more bloating, no different in mental clarity and I gained 3-4 pounds in the two weeks I took it! - major no go since weight loss was my major goal.  After reading further reviews, it seems ill advised for people with Hashimotos so I will not be continuing.  I can't say there were any major side effects that can't be resolved after discontinuing and I never had any terrible headaches, nausea or any other terrible side effects while taking it, so there's that. I guess it's just not for everyone.<br/> On the upside - I guess it confirmed that my particular thyroid issues stem from Hashimotos. There weren't any
 Couldn't tell it made a difference
 I feel such a difference taking this supplement
 I ordered this product because I am tired, and have a tyroid issue.  I am on meds for my thyroid and take a iron pill too.  I have noticed an increase in energy.  I have been more positive and just feel better.  Give it a try!
 I've noticed improvement in my overall state<br/>Of mind. I'm going to keep using it
 I love this product and feel like it complements my synthroid perfectly. I also take Hairfluence with it.
 I have noticed that it has helped with my energy and focus. Has even helped with weight loss.
 I have Hypothyroidism and this supplement really helps me.
 Not happy and satisfied with the product as I would like but may work well for others.
 I love this product! After purchasing this I have seen a tremendous change in my everyday life. For years I have struggles with having low energy and not being able to concentrate. After reading up on thyroid disorders I began to realized I struggled with a lot of the symptoms associated with them. The weight gain, low energy levels, and brain fog. Being such a young woman (I recently turned 24 years old) I began to feel as if there was no hope and that something was truly wrong with me (It seemed as if I was aging beyond my years at an fast pace). I didn't want to take medication and looked for something more natural when I found this. After the first few days I saw a huge difference in the way I was feeling. I was more focused and energetic. The first time I ran out of product I went a few days without them and felt horrible. So I brought some more and have been repurchasing them every since. These "Thyroid Support" pills are a must, I honest haven't felt this good since my early teen years!
 Just starting on this supplement. Bothered my stomach at first but it does go away if you stay with it.
 I been taking this supp for 6 months now and never let me down. im more focus and more energetic than before despite having full time job as a nurse and part time in school.
 Working well. I have been able to avoid taking synthroid.
 Love this product. Highly recommend ! Try this.  You won't be sorry. All t e products I have tried have been great !
 Great product will be buying again soon!
 I really notice a difference in my energy levels and I don't always feel so exhausted!
 Noticed my memory and energy return almost immediately would strongly recommend
 I am on my first bottle of thyroid support and have seen a change for the better with my hair and energy! Hope to see more results in the months to come!
 Just started taking it, but a month has increased my energy levels.
 It seems that my energy levels improved after taking this product for 2 weeks.
 Love this stuff! Felt a positive change in energy. Will definately continue to use ☺
 Middle aged woman with life long blood sugar issues.  This is a great fit for me.
 Great product! I wasnt sure how effective it would be at first but after about a week I definitely noticed a change in my metabolism and energy. Would highly recommend it.
 This product is amazing !!! I have already lost weight while using it for just a month
 Unfortunately I experienced headaches, swelling to my face and hands and fatigue (one of the reasons I ordered this product).
 Definitely helps with energy! If I forget to take it in the morning, it's noticeable.
 I like this product. I can feel I have more energy after taking this for a month.
 I love i tried already  👊💪🙋‍♀️😍for sure I'm going to ordering every month since i have Prime Amazon🙋‍♀️
 I have been using this for several months and I can honestly say I feel it is helping my thyroid more than any other product I have tried.  Thank you!
 Helping a great deal with my eye disease due to Graves.
 The product has everything necessary for full thyroid support. I take 2 daily and have noticed better sustained energy and overall well being.
 great
 I've been taking this product for about a month. The wonderful thing is it has no side effects. I've also noticed some minor weight loss and more energy. Looking forward to taking longer-term to see the results.
 I didn't know how bad my brain fog was until taking this and actually having energy again! I love it!!
 Awesome product, I got my energy back 😃
 Great product with high quality ingredients!
 I've had more energy since taking this supplement, and less inclination to over-eat. I use vitamins too; this is a good addition.
 Bought this for my wife. She loves it. It has helped her tremendously!
 I've been taking this for about a month  and have noticed increased energy and Focus. I'm hoping I start to loose some weight but I am<br/>Also weight lifting. So I will definitely give it another month 😊
 I have more energy every day to do the things I need to do
 Great product. Added it as a monthly subscription.
 This is worth it. It took probably a week to really feel the difference, but I am glad I stuck with it. I can actually stay up a 1/2 hour later now!
 No side effects, but not helpful either
 I feel like this Thyroid support is really helping me feel better. I recommend this product.
 So far this works amazing! Gives me extra energy.
 Helped me get back in shape after holiday binge!
 I thought I was going to like this product, but it had side effects.  For instance when I took the recommended dosage, I experienced racing of my heart and nausea.  So I backed off by taking just one pill, but felt extremely lethargic.  Then, after reading a book on good health which stated soy is a bad ingredient, I became very upset to find there was soy in this product.  Just for the record, anyone who is interested in improving the condition of their thyroid should NOT be taking anything that has soy in it as it will make your condition worse.  Soy is NOT good for the body, and some manufacturers are getting the message to leave this additive out of our food supply, but many are not.  This product also contains magnesium oxide which is a trash additive that is also NOT good for your health.  I have found a thyroid supplement that does NOT contain these additives and am happy with it.
 Great product works as advertised
 Really gives me an energy boost
 I just got these in the mail about a week ago and I can already feel a difference, I'm excited to see how the rest of the month goes!<br/>I'm receiving a free bottle for this review
 Really feel the energy I dont wake up tired and sluggish
 It gives me the energy I need, its the perfect boost!
 Using for weeks now. Feel more mental clarity and sleeping better
 This is a great product for thyroid support. I am on thyroid medication, so for the most part, my levels are already balanced but I have felt great energy and have lost a few lbs. I would order again!
 Love this product,  when I'm out, I see a significant difference in my hair, skin and the way I feel! Way better than any medication by far!
 I feel better after taking this Thyroid Support have more energy.
 After about 4-5 days of consistently taking this supplement, I find my energy again. I feel better. I am a repeat buyer of this product- I love it!
 Works great.
 Awesome product
 got my energy back! best supplement for Hypothyroid. I feel my energy back on the first day.
 I love this product! It really helps with my symptoms ...
 Great product! I also use their DHEA product...which I also love!
 Extreme focus.
 Love this product, really helped me
 But the company have issued me a full refund so for others it might work for you worth to try
 Helping with my weight loss
 Love these pills.  Have great energy since I've started taking them.
 was suprised, but I actually had more engery and was able to focus
 Such a difference in my daily life!!
 So far it's done great! I'm feeling better than i had been.
 I felt better when i took it.  Will buy again.
 It has all the nutrients i need for my thyroid problem. I love it.
 Great extra support for woman living an active lifestyle but needs extra help with weight
 Working great. I feel great. I started taking this two months ago and really notice a difference with my energy level.
 I can see a difference with using this supplement and will continue to use.  Give it a try if you think this is something you may benefit from!
 I take this for thyroid support but since I started my iron levels stayed normal. Great product.
 Well i guess i don't have a thyroid issue... because i haven't felt that this changes my energy level really at all. So maybe that's just me. I like the B vitamins and everything and the fact that it has iodine, but those are also included in my multi- so i feel like i could take either. For me it's just ok, but maybe for those with hypothryoidism it's more of a necessity.<br/><br/>*Review update- the seller contacted me with a full refund as the product wasn't what I was looking for, I'm giving this now four stars as their customer service is obviously above and beyond- no fault of theirs that this just didn't work for me!
 Don't waste your money
 So far I have been feeling great, my energy is up and I am waking up easier in the morning. It has been a few weeks but I think it is indeed helping my metabolism. I would definitely buy again.
 I been super happy with the product. I feel more awake, alert and has had some weight loss.
 Works great!
 My energy is up during the day and I am resting better at night!
 Great
 I will say I was a bit skeptical at first, I have always read those promises about increased energy, only to find it was from overdoses of caffeine or other stimulants.  This product has been more subtle and gradual.  I have noticed a steady increase in my work performance and a noticeable lack of willingness to just sit around and be idle at work. lol.  I have not experienced any negative side effects.  I cannot actually say whether or not this product is increasing any hormone production, but I have noticed some changes in my energy levels.  Like I said before, not caffeine or jittery energy, but genuine steady energy.
 That product make a big difference in my health.. thanks
 Fast delivery. Great product.  Noticed small differences after a week.
 this is a miracle  it will give you your life back and definitely you will lose weight you will love it !!
 Quickly saw an increase in energy and overall feeling of wellness.  Highly recommend!
 Didn't really help at all, couldn't tell any difference
 I can't say that this has helped me lose weight like I anticipated but I have noticed less bloating and more interestingly, that it's completely gotten rid of my acne. I noticed it's effectiveness when I ran out and started getting acne again a couple days after I stopped taking it. Once I got another bottle, acne dissapeared within a day of taking it again. I also notice how much more energy I have. It seems to prevent that late afternoon sleepiness.
 Great product! Within a week after taking I felt more energized. Will buy again!
 I have seen such an improvement in my overall energy levels. Make sure you take for about 2 weeks it took sometime to start working for me. Give it a try. It is worth it.
 Amazing product I felt a big difference after  3 days, recommend to everyone with thyroid trouble.
 Love the product  Have much more energy and sleeping much better.  Been taking for one month
 Started taking this a month ago and absolutely love the energy that it gives me.
 I love these products, helped balance out my fatigue and increased my energy ;)
 Great energy supplement that doesn't give you a crash!
 It works pretty good for me! Recommended.
 Product was shipped promptly.  More energy since using.
 Have definitely noticed a major improvement in energy since I started taking this plus I'm not hungry all the time!
 Increased energy and clearer mind. Will continue using.
 Great product
 Starting my 2nd month supply... could tell a difference within the first week of taking this... will be ordering again
 Energy bposting for sure!
 I feel like I have more energy to get through my day.
 I love this product!  You will feel better and have more energy.  Give it a try!
 This is helped me so much! I bounced a big difference when starting to take this
 Notice a huge difference in my energy level when I take this supplement!
 I like how it improved my energy and I always feel ready to start my day
 Both my husband and I take these daily. Really helps with energy and fatigue.
 This supplement is an awesome support for my thyroid ..
 Definitely noticed a difference taking this! helped with my fatigue
 Love this stuff!
 It seems to be helping. I'd like to give it longer and try the full bottle
 So far so good, after 1 month I feel like  I have more energy.
 I like this product so far.  Been on it a few weeks and I feel better.  Will update post later
 Been taking for about a month now and this really helps boost my energy!
 I tried this supplement for a month. It did make me more focused.
 Great supplement that is helping my iodine levels normalize and help my under active thyroid with any prescribed medications. I see a noticeable difference in my energy levels so I'm happy with the product.
 I have take thyrod support for the past two year just as a 9suplement while going trough menopause and i made the mistake of stop it, my last physical exam came with a a bad results , immediately  when back to this one wich amazon recomended and my last test where normal levels again thank you so much
 Good so far
 Good supplement for my under active thyroid.  It helps me keep my metabolism going.
 This did me no good or bad.
 This product has helped with great results.
 Love love this Product! Helps my energy and my stomachs bloating ..
 This vitamin blend really helps with energy. I love it and recommend it for anyone with thyroid disorder.
 So far I have noticed my energy level has definitely picked up since taking this Thyroid support. However, I have not noticed any weight loss as of yet. This is only my second month taking the thyroid support instead of seeing a doctor to get a prescription for synthetic thyroid medicine. I look for all natural remedies before putting my body through the dependency of synhetics. I am hoping I will loose some weight in my stomach if I keep taking them. I only eat once a day and not much when I do eat. So I’m keeping my fingers crossed that this works. I will leave an update on progress in the future.
 Really helped my thyroid numbers!
 Great product. I have recommended it not only for my fiance but also my sister.
 Great product, really helps my energy and memory.
 I am very pleased to find something that works this well, have had problems keeping my thyroid level normal in the past, can tell a difference in the way I feel after taking one bottle.  Ordering my second bottle.
 Very good...noticed a difference within a week
 This would be my second bottle, I love it. It keeps me alert and focused.<br/>I'm gonna keep buying it
 I have recently purchased and started taking this supplement. I have noticed improvement in my energy and focus. Bonus I had to start wearing a belt!!! I do exercise 4 days a week also.
 It really does work.Thank you
 I've had a problem with getting 3 menstral periods a month...no one could figure out what was wrong...tests, ultra sound and more tests. I started taking this and ever since I've only had 1 cycle a month and other positive changes have happened but this is the biggest for me
 Love this product! I have more energy and clearer thoughts again! I've been waiting for a product like this for many years and it is finally here! Thank you Zhou Nutrition!
 Great product
 Great product, works as described, fast shipping and amazing customer service. As expected results may vary but good quality on this product.
 After reading the reviews and trying dozens of different medications and supplements I ordered a bottle because I figured what do I have to loose. I've had issues with my thyroid since my teens and the lack of energy and concentration has gotten bad to the point that I've lost jobs because of my poor work performance.  I honestly expected to at the very least get a bit more energy right away because of the aswaganda ,which I've taken in the past. It's only been 3 days and today I had to call off work because of the side effects! They seemed to have intensified my tiredness and also caused dizziness and rapid heartbeat. I'm scared to continue taking them and really disappointed because I thought I finally found something that would help. I even paid an extra 10$ to get them mailed faster ,positive they'd work. I'll continue my search and hope this may be the help others are seeking.
 I've been using this for about a month, and I have definitely seen an increase in my energy and I've been in a better mood.
 More energy and focus very happy
 Its the fist time I'm taking them someone recomended them to me so I will post my result after 2 months trial
 Great so far. On my second month and bot feeling as fatigued. Great product!
 It's work great, I feel improvisation in my metabolism, I loose 2 kg after using half bottle
 I have been taking the Thyroid Support for a month and I feel so much better. I would definitely recommend it to anyone. My husband took me to Disney World and we had a wonderful time.
 Great product! Great results!
 Whoa... my digestive track was off the whole time on this... it wasn't for me. I tried for 3 weeks before throwing it out.<br/>With that said I've updated my review. The company actually contacted me regarding a full refund. I knew their was a full refund policy but usually companies hardly ever honor them so I didn't waste my time trying to obtain it. But they took it upon themselves to reach out to me about it. For that I am giving them 4 stars. Every body is different so just be safe when trying anything new and listen to your body.
 Quality
 I feel so much better, my dr refuses to put me on thyroid meds, this is really helping
 So far, it's doing its promise. I hope I would not disappoint in the near future like some of the products before that only works in a few weeks then goes to the toilet. Thanks Zhou Nutrition.
 Great product.
 This helped boost my energy.
 Have been taking for about 2 weeks and have noticed more energy in the afternoon, plus my ability to focus has improved. I will be using this product daily.
 I love this stuff. My focus is better and I've stopped taking diet pills and weight has stayed the same. No jittery feelings at all.
 This stuff is the best!
 Just started using this product.  Hoping it will give me the support I am looking for.  I have noticed that I have more energy.
 My husband loves this product!! It has improved his focus and weight retention!
 Been taking for 1 month.  I feel less tired during the day,  and sleep better at night.
 Has all supplements I need in one pill
 This supplement is everything it says it is. I feel less sluggish &amp; have more energy. Helps with overall mood as well, since having more energy makes the daily outlook much more bright.
 Excellent product!!!!
 I felt much better after a week- more energy and sleep better!
 Definitely have more energy.
 This supplement helped so much I ordered a second bottle!
 Great Product
 Felt more energy seems to help.
 Amazing! Working wonders!
 Great product, was feeling more alert and active after first dose!
 Good natural way to maintain thyroid health.
 Great product!! Helps my thyroid stay regular!
 I noticed more energy!
 Helps me to feel better mentally and physically
 Really well made supplement, I felt more energy and MUCH better taking it. (This was a review I left to receive another bottle by the manafacture)
 Been taking it for 2 weeks and I can see the difference
 I feel so much better when taking these.
 This is one of the best thyroid support complexes I've tried. I notice the energy burst.
 Great product... feeling and sleeping better.
 Thyroid Support has been a delightful surprise.<br/>I have more energy as well as clarity of mind.<br/>So happy I have discovered this supplement!
 I love it !!
 Love this
 All I say is this stuff Is AWESOME!  I now have the energy to do more things.
 I tried this product for a few weeks. I went for blood work recently and my numbers were better than ever.
 I am feeling so much better since I began taking this. My mood and energy level has improved tremendously.
 Great product ! Quick results !
 I love it! Gives me more energy.
 I have only been taking a couple of days and have already noticed more energy. No gittery side effects.
 I love it!!!
 Love it!!!
 Love it!
 I've been using this stuff for about a month, and I'm a convert. As a long-time sufferer from hypothyroidism, I take this as a supplement to my regular medication (which by itself helps enough to get my blood work in the nominally "normal" range and relieve the worst symptoms, but doesn't actually make me feel much better). This supplement gives me a much-needed extra boost. I have more, healthy, energy, enough that I am noticeably more productive and feel much stronger overall. I seem able to sustain exercise for longer, and have lost a few pounds in the last month as well. Other positive results include: less joint pain, fewer muscle aches, and better sleep. I also seem to have lost the subtle hoarseness that I had learned to ignore, but that I now realize is another thyroid symptom; I'm an amateur musician, and I can once again sing for an extended period of time without my voice giving out! That may be the sweetest benefit of all.<br/><br/>I'm in my middle years, and really have not felt this good physically since sometime in the late '90s. I plan to continue taking this supplement.
 Great product! Has made my long days much more tolerable and keeps me focused longer.
 It works wonders! So much better than being on synthroid.
 I have been taking these supplements for over a month now. The first week, I had a few panic attacks because of the brain fog lifting. The second week I had less. Then I started taking 1 pill instead of 2. I feel much better. The brain rog is gone, I am more alert and I have lost 7 lbs.
 Gives me a good amount of energy and could definitely feel a difference once I ran out!
 Very good.
 Great product that gives you energy!!!
 Gives a great burst of energy. I actually notice that I eat less when taking these and I have lost about 1-2 lbs a week since starting them.
 Im incredibly grateful that Zhou Nutritions "Thyroid Support with Iodine" is available.  It makes a huge difference in my health and well being.  Thank you Zhou Nutrition.  I love this product!
 Gives me a little more energy than I usually have.
 Great product!
 I've been on thyroid meds for 2 years (hypo). Even though my levels have been acceptable, I haven't really felt as if my meds were addressing all my issues, fatigue, sleepiness and brain fog.  I've been on Thyroid Support for 3 weeks now, I  feel as if I have my old self back.  I have energy, I am sleeping better at night and the fog has significantly lifted.  This is loaded with good stufi  including iodine which is usually lacking in many hypothyroid patients.  I have recommended this to my family members who also have hypothyroidism.  This isn't something that should be used instead of medications Rx'ed from your physician, it should be used in addition to.
 I have been able to think so much more clear with this product!
 It seem to help a great deal
 Great product that helped me a lot
 Just started second bottle. Slowly feeling more energy. Need to check thyroid numbers next month to verify its helping. Noticed 1st bottle came in green capsules and the 2nd bottle came in beige capsules...not sure why???
 Good product will use again
 2 thumbs up
 I haven't  seen a difference yet but no aftertaste or side effects. I will try it a little longer to see if there is any notable change.
 It is a great supply
 Thyroid support helped me feel better and have more energy.i have only taken one bottle and am excited to see how my health is after several bottles.
 Great product, super fast shipping l!
 Loved this! Energy for days!
 Love that there are no side effects almost done with 1st bottle this second bottle is the perfect gift
 This product increased my energy level.
 It's been helping me....So glad I bought it...
 Awesome product!!!

 Seems to be working great! Already ordered more just to keep it going!
 Great product

 Great product!  Felt better than I have in years and keeping my weight off.  Feel like this really helps!
 Since I started taking, I have felt a difference in how I function on a daily basis.  I will be taking again.
 Made me feel sick :/
 This is the best Thyroid supplement I have found on the market!!! It is superior to the one that GNC sells!!!
 It helped out
 It works
 I love this product. It takes a few weeks to get in to your system but it does make a difference. I ran out and I definitely feel the difference.
 Love it because it works
 love it
 I have been using this product since Christmas time when it went on Lightning Deal. I can't say enough time has gone by yet to know if this product is life changing or not, and I for sure am not one that believes a pill or supplement can be the answer to improve health or lose weight. However, I do notice a difference when taking this product, it's not a huge difference and yet it is. I normally have a hard time to stick with cutting soda and snacks out of my daily activity, and though I think about it still the desire for them so far hasn't been very strong at all.<br/><br/>I feel good with this product, weither it's a coincident or not I don't know, but I don't feel like I have to sleep over 8 hours like I started feeling. I wake up early and enjoy reading with the extra time. I have been feeling good for the past month, and who knows what changes in my life have contributed to it, but for now I'll continue with what works and this is part of that.<br/><br/>The customer service for this supplement has been great as well, they offer loyalty discounts and promo codes, helping me be able to try the item to see if it works well for me without me paying a super high amount.
 Just started my second bottle and so far in love with it!
 It has helped me feel less stressed and it seems to have helped with weight loss.
 It works! My prescription just wasn't cutting it. Felt tired and icky...after adding this, I am feeling much better.
 this product works for me. since taking it I can feel a difference and seem to be getting more done in life. I highly recommend signing up for amazon subscribe and save and giving this a try. I will definitely be a customer for a long time :) and no there is no bad aftertaste, no burping bad taste or anything like that. just take them along with your regular medicine or alone and let them do their magic, you wont regret it
 have only been using for one month but seems to be helping me with increase in energy
 Amazing. I am more focused and I never have a crash through out the day
 I have more energy and my brain fog is gone
 Amazing, I've taking for a month and works great!
 I have h/o Thyroid problems but taking no Rx meds, experience low energy, brain fog, but feeling much better today.
 Love it!
 I have been using Thyroid Support for a full 30 days now. I am a full time mom and student and have been very overwhelmed and unable to actually focus on my school work. Being over 40 I am just not used to sitting at a desk all day long!  I have ADD so this is common for me.  I take ONE at breakfast and another at lunch.  These capsules give me the energy and focus that I NEED!!!  An added bonus....  I am rarely hungry now and I sure as heck am not craving carbs like I used to. I will continue to take these until I am done with school for sure!
 I have noticed a significant difference in my sleeping and weight change. All good! Thank you.
 Still using
 Been using this product for almost 2 weeks now and it works just like the description says
 I Love This Product...It Helps Me So Much Thru Out The Day..
 I loved Thyroid Support Complex with Iodine. I have hypothyroid and am often feeling tired and low energy. So I did my research and reviewed many different supplements/ vitamins, trying to decide which would help with my symptoms the most. I'd like to also say that I didn't have good luck with synthroid, it made me feel worse. So I've only used 1 bottle this far of Thyroid Support Complex with Iodine, but I definitely have noticed benefits. I feel less tired and sluggish all the time, although I still have bad days. And I don't feel as foggy brained. I feel like Im abke to think more clearly. I look forward to my future and hope that I continue to feel the way I'm feeling now. It's so nice to wake up not feeling exhausted. I definitely recommend Thyroid Support Complex with Iodine.
 Great product!<br/>Great value!
 Can tell a difference in how I feel and I've been using the product for 3 weeks now
 Good product, excellent service
 Really awesome energy
 Yes
 Love this stuff! sconce taking it I don't feel so blah anymore!
 Amazing!I love this product and and my husband started using them as well.
 Love this product. Have more energy
 Definitely feel like this helps with keep my energy up. Good product
 Great product!! So nice to find all the supplements I need in one affordable pill. Approved by the homeopathic m.d. treating my Hashimoto's thyroiditis.
 Well honestly I couldn't ask for anything better. I currently suffer from a slew of health conditions in which I have to take 13 meds for. I can honestly say I have everything that the pill claims. I have more energy day to day with in about 15 minutes of taking it and it lasts all day. (Minus one med there) I have improved thinking and mental clarity (that's a second med gone) I have a vitamin b defficency and low vitamin d (hello no more shots and no more extra vitamins!!!) also with having other chronic pain disorders I am prescribed 4 narcotics a day. While taking this thyroid support daily for the past 25 days I've only had to take 3 out of 100 pills. I'm in love with this product. I'm in love with my new life. And I love that it's natural remedies.
 I have been taking it every day with my other vitamins I cannot tell if I have extra energy or not but I do not feel any worse by taking them.  I try to eat healthy and watch my calories so the extra nutrients from vitamins can not be hurting me in any way.<br/><br/>update: the company has offered me a refund based on my review.  I don't feel a refund is in order but it is good that they back up their product as they claim.
 The product works just allow time for it to work. I can only rate it as a 3 because I'm not done with the supply.
 So far, this supplement has helped give me a bit more energy through the day. I am hoping that the weight loss comes with it soon.
 Great product, has the ingredients I was looking for all in one supplement.
 I love the natural energy it gives me!
 Wasnt for me
 These products are definitely a bang for your buck. Very potent, do what they say they're going to do and more. Always fast shipping.
 Feeling a big difference in my energy since taking your product
 This is my 4th purchase.
 This vitamin is packed with everything I need to support my thyroid. Especially thankful for the good amount of Selenium. 👍
 GREAT PRODUCT.  TOTALLY RECOMENDED
 Love this product! Totally helping me!
 Great product
 I feel much better using the Thyroid Support Complex.  Will continue using this product.
 Great product! I can already feel a positive difference
 Great product!  Has helped me tremendously.
 did not see any change
 Customer Service is amazing!!!
 It didn’t work for me 😔
 Great product. Works wonders. Love it
 I LOVE this stuff! It actually does what it claims it will!
 I thought that this supplement didn't work for me at all until I took it on an empty stomach. I have started taking the two pills together in the morning, before I've eaten, and I can actually feel it kicking in now. I don't know if this will work for other people, but for me the switch in how I take it, and when, made a huge difference, so much so that I've taken myself off my prescribed thyroid medication and cut my antidepressant dosage in half, with no ill effects whatever. And these were my ONLY prescriptions. Low thyroid seems to have been the source of all my long-term health problems.<br/><br/>I see people complaining about burping and aftertaste if they take it on an empty stomach. But I suspect they are just washing the capsules down rather than taking them with a full glass of water. I highly recommend this product, and I suggest you work with it to figure out how it will perform best for you. It certainly has changed my life for the better.
 My daughter says it works. Gonna give it a try!
 After seeing my doctor about extreme tiredness I decided to research thyroid issues on my own. I chose this product after reading positive reviews and am SO happy I did. My energy is back and better than it has been for years. Side note: I crushed my finger in a car door as a teenager which caused the nail to split and it has remained that way for 40 years. Within the past couple weeks, I noticed that the split has grown in and appears completely normal. I didn't expected that to happen but am grateful it did.
 Give it a few days up to a week maybe a week and you will feel a difference throughout the day all day.
 This product is amazing! I have my energy back, i feel like my normal self again.
 This has given me more energy than I have had in years.
 This purchase was for my second bottle.  I am very overweight.  I have issues focusing and concentrating.  I tend to start things and go to something else before finishing what I originally started.  I am lucky to sleep 4 hours a night and am so tired and unproductive during the day.  I have tried many supplements to help address these issues.  I love these pills.  It has done a lot to help my cravings.  My brain is clearer and more focused.  I have a lot more energy.  Prior to taking these I was averaging about 6,000 steps a day; I am not up to 13,000 steps.  I have only lost a little weight although I cannot blame this on the supplements.  I am still making unhealthy food choices, even though I do not crave food like I used to.  I am sleeping slightly better and I am waking up less during the night.  My nightly average sleep is now about 5 hours.  One thing I want to note is when my first bottle ran out and before I ordered a second, I got really tired.  More tired than I was before I started taking this supplement.  Perhaps my body just needed time to right itself, but I did not wait to see.  I started taking them again and the high level of energy returned.  I do recommend taking these in the morning.  I found I could not sleep when I took them later in the day.  My brain would race with all the things I wanted to accomplish.
 Good product.
 Not impressed
 I've been taking this for a while now. I can't honestly say I've seen much difference in energy, weight, insomnia, or any of the typical thyroid problems. I'm on Levothyroxine, too, of course. I keep taking it in hope that it's doing something, but I'm really not sure it is. But hey, it has worked for so many people, so I'll still recommend it!
 Great product. Shows good signs after couple weeks. Would buy it again.
 I am feeling good using this with my clean eating and exercise regimen.
 Excellent products
 I absolutely love this product!! Thank you!! I feel great!
 Increased energy and help with the hypothyroid symptoms synthriod does not eradicate.
 Before taking Thyroid Support Complex with Iodine I wanted to get my endocrinologist's approval since I was already taking  a prescribed medication for a hypothyroid condition. She gave the product a thumbs up. I have experienced increased energy and a heightened sense of well-being since taking this product.  A benign menigioma brain tumor left me with multiple hormone issues and this product has made a difference in my health. I'm grateful.
 I LIKE THE PROD USE IT FOR OVER A YEAR
 Great supp. Did exactly as described and came with world class support from the Zhou customer service team.
 Best thyroid supplement on the market!
 I have been using this product for a few months now, really can tell a difference with my energy levels when taking the Thyroid Support!
 So i recently had left a bad review because the pills were not working the way there were suppose to , but the fact they messaged me back and apologized for this situation made me feel good! They reached out to me  and tried to satisfy with me with another product. I can at least say they are trying to solve their problems with this tablet, but i dont blame their product either because i know sometimes the human body can have allergic reactions to certain medication  ! Next time i purchase from you guys , i will be planing to take the DHEA 50mg  ! (:
 Honestly, I have been bought this a long time ago, but I didn't start taking it until Oct of 2016. For the first few weeks, nothing happened, however, I see a change in my energy a LOT! I don't need 14 hours of sleep anymore, my fuzzy brain has cleared up and I wake up early and it's been doing my life good. I was hoping to lose the weight as well, but it hasn't happened yet. I stopped taking it for two months, and then started up again in February.  I have post partum hypothyroidism and I have been trying to lose the weight and go back to my original weight. I am going to continue with this product and hope that it works out for me.
 This has definitely given me more energy, I don't feel as sluggish as I use to.
 This is a great product and I could feel my energy improve shortly after taking it.
 I've only taken these for one month, but I do feel more energetic.
 Seems to be working good. I've noticed a energy boost`
 gets rid of that foggy feeling
 Product seems to be working, feeling more alert and more energy.  I am on second bottle now and will continue to use for a few more months to be certain.  Overall, I am pleased.
 Severe fatigue, headaches, brain fog, joint pain and weight gain are some if the issues I was having before starting Thyroid Support.  I have hypothyroidism which is getting worse and I am waiting for an appointment with an endocrinologist.  During my wait I decided to order this product.  After taking this for a month, my headaches and brain fog are gone.  The fatigue level has improved, although I still have some issues.  My joint pain has improved as well.  I have lost 7 pounds, HOWEVER I have also started 6 hours of water exercise per week and watching my diet.  I believe Thyroid Support helped me with the weight loss because in the past I would kill myself exercising and loose a pound every 2 weeks.<br/><br/>Thyroid Support is well worth trying.  I am very pleased with my purchase.  I never expected this to be the "Holy Grail" but it has helped me with some of the symptoms that come with having hypothyroidism.<br/><br/>GOD BLESS!!
 I could not tell any difference, in fact I felt more tired during the month I took this, and I am just now 3 days off of the product. I unfortunately will try anything once to feel better and have energy as I work a lot and try to keep up with my young son when I am home, but this literally did zero to help me with energy levels or with losing weight. Maybe it is best used for another purpose.
 I can say that this product has helped with daily energy. When I don't take the pills for a day I notice that I'm more sluggish and feel out of it. I wouldn't go without it.
 I have low thyroid, medication has never completely helped solve the problem. I can feel like a normal person by adding this to my daily routine.
 Love this product
 Helps a lot
 I was excited to try these supplements after reading a lot of the reviews. Unfortunately I did not notice any difference in how I felt. I won't be purchasing them again.
 Works well
 Great product!! I am already having more energy:)
 I did not feel any different and gave it a full chance to work.  Just being honest.  I am over 50.  Not sure if that matters or not.  But it did not work for me at all.  I would have loved to lose some weight, but more than that, I just wanted to feel better and less fatigued.  This product did not work for me.
 Have been looking for something that works and this was it!
 I have the symptoms of thyroid disease, however I had the test done for it at Kaiser and it came out normal.  My daughter has Hashimotos and she has pointed out to me that  I have many of the symptoms she has.  I decided I would try something OTC on my own and so far, it has proven to be a good idea.  I purchased a bottle of Thyroid Support,Complex, and although I haven't quite finished my first bottle I can already tell I feel better, I have increased energy and I am no longer lagging behind my dogs at the park, I am walking with them.  I plan to continue using Thyroid Support Complex and watch my negative symptoms disappear!
 Excellent product. Helps to lift mental fog.
 very good!!
 As far as I could tell, it did nothing for me except an unexpected side effect of weight gain...
 This product is great. I noticed I had a lot more energy after just a few days.  I will keep on using this product.
 I just took this product and I feel like I'm going to throw up. I take vitamins and supplements regularly so I'm not sure what is in this that doesn't agree with me. Unfortunately, it appears it is not eligible to be returned (according to Amazon). So $20 bucks wasted on this. Sigh.
 Good ingredients, unsure if effects were fully felt.
 A+++++
 Love your product will buy in the future lost 21 pds. Love it 😀 and yes it's the truth know advertising or lying lol take it try it I don't post but I like these product
 WOW! Honestly, I wasn't expecting this product to work so quickly and so well! My energy is really good. I've only started taking it for less than a week, so time will tell how it will help improve my thyroid function. But its doing something, because I've notice my bowels moving through more frequently...a little loose, but not watery, no discomfort, and certainly nothing alarming.
 great product
 Good stuff. Would recommend to anyone who takes natural supplements. Seems to lean you out over time
 Gave me more energy!
 I love this stuff. Gives me just enough energy to get through my hard days. And I like that it doesnt mess with my tummy.
 It didnt work for me but it might be benefit for some one else .
 This product is amazing. I cannot tell you how amazing I feel inside and out. I've definitely list 5 pounds in a month!!!
 Love this!
 As someone with hypo, I noticed a difference in my energy level, metabolism and mood. Would recommend !!
 Wonderful stuff!
 I noticed an increase in my energy immediately.  I'll continue to purchase this product.
 This product has worked better than anything I have ever purchased before.  I feel awake, no jitters, and more alert. Have ordered twice now and will be ordering every month
 Helped very well
 So far so good with this product!  I ordered a second bottle because I have so much faith in how well this works and will improve my health
 Good product and bonus not expected.  Thank You!
 I love this!!!
 Great product with great results! On 2nd bottle now!
 Three big green pills have really helped with my energy level and focus.
 This is a great product.  It has many of the natural  supplements to help your thyroid.<br/>The product came quickly as well.
 It really works. Gave me the motivation to start working out again. Gave me alot of energy that i never had
 Ive only been taking this for about 3 weeks and it seems like its working.
 Good product! I feel more energy and focused than ever
 I can tell the difference after one week of taking this.  I'm on my second bottle which is about to run out.  Now if they only have something for asthma.
 Love this, no after taste and really helps my metabolism.
 Great product. Really helps!
 Have taken product consistently for over two weeks. Haven't felt a real improvement in energy, have actually had to take an afternoon nap several times. Haven't had a change in weight but have notice that my face is super bloated looking.
 I have been using this for a month now and I love it.
 Great product..almost finished my first bottle.
 Does what it says it will do. No side effects.
 Works so good!
 Started feeling a lot better after taking this for about 2 weeks.
 Great product! Definitely helps keep up my energy level!
 I have been taking this for about a month and definitely feel a difference.....I already ordered 3 more bottles!
 Worked wonders for me.
 Very good product. Feel more energetic throughout the day and helps me sleep better at night .
 Excellent great product.
 Love it
 Great product.
 I have noticed a good increase in energy -- not the jittery kind of increase with too much caffeine.
 Amazing product! I've been taking it for two weeks and feel a huge energy boost. I've also lost a couple of pounds.
 Not working very well at all
 Great Product! I have purchased this 2 times now and see a real boost in energy.
 I don't know if this is actually helping my Thyroid that sometimes tests low, sometimes is just fine, depending on the day the blood test is taken - but it does what I need it to do. That said, I only take 1 at a time, not 2. When I took 2 I had too much energy and I have to sit and focus - but 1 does just what I need it to do and I really notice when I don't take it. I have never finished a bottle of anything before - literally. I usually forget to take supplements that I would swear will help, but this one I have and I am on my 2nd bottle now.<br/><br/>That said, every individual needs to assess for themselves. This has Iodine in it, so be very careful and be aware that more is hardly ever better. I highly recommend starting with only 1 which is why I am only giving it 4 stars because it's irresponsible to say I love something that I intentionally cut the dosage in half for. It does work, for me, but someone with an actual thyroid problem, on medication, will likely have very different results.<br/><br/>Be careful and be smart about it.
 I WAS DIAGNOSED RIGHT AFTER I HAD MY DAUGHTER 4 YRS AGO WITH HYPOTHYROID, HOW EVER I WAS ON THE LOWEST DOSAGE PRESCRIPTION POSSIBLE, WHEN I FOUND AND READ UP ON ZHOU THYROID SUPPORT I DECIDED TO TRY IT, I LOVE IT! AND I AM NO LONGER ON MY PRESCRIPTION AND MY DOCTOR SAID THAT THIS VITAMIN IS WORKING GREAT FOR ME AND MY THYROID IS FUNCTIONING AND TESTING NORMAL. I'LL KEEP TAKING THIS INSTEAD OF A PRESCRIPTION ANY DAY!
 Really feel that this supplement works, have only tried it for a month but am reordering it.
 I love this product!  It has been a great help in trying to balance my thyroid levels.
 Great product that gives the results it promises
 Great for energy!
 It's works . Helps your metabolism
 I love this product! I can tell a huge difference in my energy level if I forget to take it for a few days. I recommend it completely!
 This product actually works!!! After I would take this within 30 minutes or so I feel like I have more energy than usual.!
 Ordered twice now. Gives me that extra boost of energy on a daily basis. Really enjoy this product and plan to continue to use this.
 I think this product was a complete waste of my money.  I don't feel any more energized from taking this.
 Gives me so much energy..
 This product has really helped to stabilize my thyroid better than any other I've used in the past.
 Wonderful product
 as described thx!
 Good energy and mental clarity.
 Feel Great!  Have more energy now!  Great Product!
 For mAny years I have struggled with sleep or have that energy but this past year it got really bad where I sleep my day till it was time for work I hated it I just no energy for nothing !!! First day taking these 3-25 I went to work came home ran to store by now I'd be exhausted nope my family cooked out I prepped everything cleaned up an still had energy but was time for bed I slept all nite and I'm awake 7 am never in my life have I ever felt this refreshed n ready.  I know just 1 day but I'll take it. I'll update in a few weeks
 Fabulous product.....have been using this for several months now!
 I have added this to my daily supplements. So far so good!!
 This is awesome!
 I've only been using for 3 weeks. Still too early to expect results.
 Admittedly, I should have researched BEFORE taking this. I did not. I now have an enlarged thyroid, after taking this for a few months. I am hoping to save someone the worry I'm feeling right now. From what I have read, one of the ingredients, Bladderwrack, can cause not only thyroid enlargement, but thyroid cancer in those of us that have hypothyroidism.
 Had to return when I found out the product has rice flour.  I have an extremely bad reaction to rice products so I didn't want to take the risk.  Will read the label more carefully the next time. Base on the reviews I'm sure its a great product. I will exchange for one without rice flour.
 Work well but takes a while for them to work.
 It worked for me as far as energy and weight loss. It made me have dreams, something I don't do, lol. Did enjoy that part as they were funny, weird dreams. But,  weight found me again and more than before taking....I began researching and couldn't find if all their ingredients are what they say they are soooooo, I discontinued use and researched NATURAL foods that can regulate my thyroid. Different results for different people so make the BEST DECISION FOR YOU :)
 My hair was getting thin on top.  I have less hair loss while taking this product
 Too soon to see the effects, but I'm feeling less tired overall.
 Awesome product!
 Continue to order over other brands tried.
 Feeling less tired when taking this.
 Disappointing. This product did not do what it advertised to do.  I have hypothyroidism and am on a synthroid thyroid medication.  My TSH levels are 'normal' on the medication,  but I was still having symptoms of fogginess, difficulty losing weight (in spite of low carb diet  and regular exercise), and tiredness.  These were all the things that this product claimed to help.  I took the product regularly for one month and found no difference whatsoever in my symptoms.  In fact, I even gained 2 pounds which seemed to be water retention.  I'm not sure if the water retention was from this product or not.  I am disappointed in this product which is yet another thyroid support product that does not help.  I'll keep looking. The customer service was prompt and responsive, however when I told them hat it didn't work, they blamed me, of course by saying that I needed to exercise and eat healthy.  I have exercised regularly and ate a healthy diet for years. Blaming the consumer is a sign of a faulty product.
 Absolutely love this thyroid support.  And it has helped me start shedding some pounds.  Definitely a must when taking supplements.
 So far I have noticed quite a difference in my energy levels since taking thyroid support.
 Seems to be helping. I am definitely sleeping better and digestion is better. When I test for thyroid issues my test always come back negative. However, I have several symptoms of a sluggish thyroid. My neck hurting was one of them. I took these and my neck/throat soreness went away. I stopped for a week and it came back so I am continuing to take them.
 This product really helped me feel better. Mind was clearer &amp; more energy.
 I have noticed a decrease in my fatigue and an increase in my metabolism after 2 weeks on this product.
 I feel 20 years younger after beginning my daily regimen of Thyroid Support! Thank you!
 Fast shipment. Easy to swallow. I'm feeling more mentally focused after the first month. Thank you!
 My energy level picked up in days.
 I have always been skeptical about trying out supplimets, I am not to comfortable with putting things into my body. My husband convinced me to try these. The change was unbelievable. I felt like a whole different person. I have not said I am tired for the past month. I can get up and do what I want, when I want. The best part of all is that my migraines went away! I was not even expecting that at all! I would usually get a migrane or two per week but this past month, nothing! Definitely ordering again!
 Love this product!
 As another customer also said, possibly my thyroid was fine enough to not need extra supplements. However this product made me feel awful. I was constantly bloated,tired, and generally worse as far as some of the issues it was supposed to "cure". I purchased 2 bottles hoping side effects mite go away but stopped taking. Disappointing and waste of money.<br/>** Added another star because the company sent an apology and refund for one of the bottles immediately after I posted the review.
 After one month taking this supplement, I'm losing weight and feeling more energetic. I plan to stay on it.
 This is a great supplement. I feel more energized and less hungry.
 I like these a lot! I wasn't sure how effective these were until I didn't take them for a few days. I felt like I was dragging. The only reason I'm giving less than 5 stars is I recently recieved an empty box in the mail, and it was a small, sealed box that the bottle wouldn't have fit in, so no one stole it or anything. Not sure who to talk to about it, but... anyways, great product, hoping to resolve this and continue buying :)
 It work great!!!
 Will order again liked how it help me feel more alert!
 I love the product
 No weight-loss but improve
 Works great! Really felt like I had my energy back! Will reorder!
 I wanted to give 5 stars because I really think they had potential to work. Unfortunately I learned the hard way that some herbs used should not taken if you suffer from Lupus. It triggered a horrible flare and hospital visit. Ofcourse this is my own fault, I was just really hoping for more energy.
 Got rid of the brain fog and keeps me going throughout the day!!
 This gave me more energy. I could keep up with my toddlers!
 I think this could be a good product.  I struggle with taking it regularly.  I feel better when I have taken it for a week straight.  Not sure how it will help with my metabolism.  My body seems to store everything I eat.  But I'm not active at all so that could have a lot to do with it.  I went from 115 to 171 over a period of 3 years.  Late 30s, have always eaten what I want without a second thought.
 Great product!
 Awesome product
 Did nothing. But again I didn't know what to expect. Worth a try if you want to check it out.
 Probably need to take it longer, but my wife notice nothing yet.  However, she has a pretty severe thyroid issue.  This may work very well for others.  Zhou Nutrition was concerned about the lack of success and has been very good to work with.  The company gets a 5 star rating.
 No bad taste from the pills and I have so much more energy
 I just finished my first bottle, because I've been battling an underactive  thyroid for 19 years, it's only been 30 days, so far, but I do feel like I'm sleeping better, my temperature is a bit more equal. I'm going to see how it evolves over the next few months with continued use.
 I use. It to help me improve my Thyroid I am very happy and use it daily
 Great product!! Defiantly ordering more!
 Good supplement if you run out of meds, good price comparatively.
 I have definitely noticed a change in my energy level
 Felt like my circulation was a better!
 Love the product works wonders for me.
 Just what I needed at a great price! Thank you
 it seems to be giving me more energe and I have lost 3 pounds, I'm reording
 Good product and service!!
 Great product l! Can't go without it!
 This product gave me my energy back love it will buy again
 First time I took this my neck was hurting a lot. I wasn't sure if I happened to get sick on this or not so I decided to try again. I have noticed that I do have more energy towards the end of the day. I am taking only half the dose. I have been gaining a lot of weight on this so I'm going to try something else
 Makes me feel more energetic, liking it so far.
 I love this product!!
 So far so good,  can't wait to see over  several months!
 I was skeptical but thought what the heck-give it a try. Whether it is the placebo effect or the ingredients, I do feel better. More alert, not as fatigued, joints feel a little better, mental cloud has lifted. No apparent side effects.  I'll continue use since I do feel better.<br/><br/>Update: After a month of taking these supplements, I feel great!  So much more energy, depression has abated, joints feel nearly painless.  I'm very pleased with results and will continue taking them.  As always, check with your doctor or pharmacist first.  My pharmacist checked for adverse reactions with my RX meds and approved.
 Seems to work well
 The jury is still out for me on Thyroid Support. For years I have experienced nearly every symptom of hypothyroidism, and I had really high hopes that this supplement would help me the way so many other reviewers claim. I can't honestly say that I noticed a huge difference. There were a few days that I felt like maybe I had a little more energy or wasn't quite as depressed, but there was no obvious night and day difference for me. I've taken it for 2 months and did lose about 2 pounds, but I was putting a lot of effort into losing weight, so 2 pounds was rather disappointing. I'm willing to keep trying it and will hopefully experience greater benefits.
 This helped me tremendously. I suffer from extreme exhaustion and low metabolism. I am also borderline hypothyroid and was looking for a natural remedy instead of big pharmaceutical.
 I really wanted to like this product, as I use and recommend their caffeine capsules. When taking this I would feel a burning in the back of my throat. In order to help ease the burning I would drink with a huge glass of water. It took me (reluctantly) finishing the bottle to realize it was the cayenne pepper as an ingredient that was the culprit. I don't know how, but somehow the cayenne really irritated my throat, like it felt like the capsule itself was dissolving before it reached my stomach.<br/>This particular product wasn't for me but I will continue using their other products.
 I was really skeptical at first, but then I read all the reviews and took a chance iin ordering.  I am very pleased with the product within a few days I no longer felt sluggish and tired all the time.  This is the first product I've taken and it worked right away.  I feel like I'm more energized and focused and the bonus is, people have been approaching me saying are you losing weight!!! Yes, I am!!!!  I've lost weight and can't wait to see how much more I will lose!  Thank you so much, great product!
 I actually feel better taking these natural supplements as opposed to synthetic chemical support.
 This product really works, I feel great taking the product
 I love it and how it makes me feel good
 it works! great product lost 5 pounds first week
 Lost,10 pounds
 This has made me feel human again. All of my blood work shows I’m within normal range regarding thyroid, B12, iron, etc., but I still had all of the symptoms of hypothyroidism and was on the cusp of normal vs. hypo. I was extremely fatigued, losing hair, always cold, and gaining weight. After only a few days, I feel normal again. I almost forgot what normal feels like! I forgot to take it the other day and felt a difference. Definitely worth it!
 Product did nothing for me. Switched from another supplement to see if this one would be better, and my nails and cuticles started falling apart (after the last product I used had just made my nails incredibly thick and strong). I'm sleeping terribly. Cannot concentrate at work. Hasn't helped my energy levels/stamina. Package is pretty, but the product is ineffective.
 I feel a difference after just two weeks!  I actually have some energy
 Energy is increased, I am feeling balanced out and more like I used to. Good product.
 I finished one bottle. It made me feel better &amp; I had more energy, I ordered my 2nd bottle &amp; it is on the way : )
 More energy
 great product
 Seemed to give me more energy and focus!
 Think it's helping!  Think I need another month to make sure.
 I bought this product for my daughter and it has improved her level of energy plus she has lost a few pounds since taking it.  She does not test out of the normal range for thyroid levels but she has many of the symptoms for hypo-thyroid. This product has helped her so much that now my sister has ordered it too. I think it is certainly worth trying.
 Didn't work
 Has helped me a lot
 I continue to feel better everyday
 I have suffered from under active thyroid for years.I would always had to be taking/drinking pills  for each health issue that comes with having thyroid (weight gain, cold intolerance,dry hair, memory problems, Irritability) . Within the first few days I felt significantly less tired and I wasn't falling asleep  on the couch like I always do. Also, I've been able to lose the pounds that for many years I wasn't able to lose even though I was going to the GYM, eating healthy meals and with just in a few weeks of taking Zhou Nutrition Thyroid Support Supplements  I've lost 5 pounds.  I am very pleased with just how much better I feel after taking this vitamin! I really recommend this product to everyone that suffers from thyroid.
 It's helping me feel so much better
 My skin has really started to look great, thanks for the fast shipping.1
 While I haven't been taking them for long, but I can tell right away whether or not I've taken it. They help eliminate "brain fog" and, in general, I have a lot more energy and greater ability to focus. Clearly, I was deficient in something this supplement contains.
 Gave me more energy and mental clarity
 Great product
 Love this product! For a long time I was experiencing brittle hair and nails, was extremely tired all the time, and I was also having a really hard time losing weight. I read an article that talked about having an under active thyroid, and wondered if that was it. I tried a few different thyroid supplements but definitely like Zhou Nutrition the best because after 1-2 weeks I actually can tell a difference, as opposed to others that just don't seem as effective. I've been taking them for two months now and was able to drop 10lbs! I also am not as tired during the day, and my hair isn't coming out like crazy in my hairbrush. This isn't a substitute for a serious medical issue by any means, but it's definitely a great alternative if you notice these kind of symptoms and want to help alleviate them! No side effects for me!
 Great product. It is assisting in pulling me out of a pretty deep depression that was only made worse by certain pharmaceuticals. After some research I decided to try a thyroid support product, as some of the secondary and tirteary symptoms seemed to line up with what I was experiencing. I seem to have lucked out with Zhou. Not only is this product high quality, but the customer support is excellent. I will definitely be continuing my use of this product. I'll also drop the obligatory disclaimer that I wasn't paid or given any product for this review. I wasn't even going to write it but the email from the company founder was a very nice touch and I genuinely hope that someone else can benefit from this product as much as I have.
 I've used this product for 30 days and feel like it does curb my appetite and My hot flashes seem to have cooled down a bit as well.
 I like your product because it seems to not be overpriced, it has a variety of studied infredients in it, and it doesn’t product any negative effects (at least that I’ve noticed). I haven’t noticed a positive change yet, but I have been switching between different products.<br/>One thing is puzzling though. I purchased ThyroMate and was comparing the labels on your bottle and theirs and it appears the ingredients are the same. What is different between them? Or is there a difference? I’m trying to figure out which product to continue purchasing if both are exactly the same.
 Bought this for my wife and it made a massive difference
 So, I just ordered my 2nd bottle of this. I am 31 years old and as early as 15 years old, my thyroid hormone levels have been a little low. They will be low for about 3 months, then normalize on their own. However, they have never been significantly low that I have received treatment, but I do experience some of the symptoms that come along with having low thyroid hormones including hair thinning, slow metabolism which led to weight gain, and irregular bowel habits. Basically everything slows down. So after completing my first bottle I have lost about 5lbs, that is without dieting. My hair seems to be growing a little more. I do have a little more energy. So far so good. I will have to continue to use the products to see If i can get even better results.
 It did nothing for me!
 made me feel a lot better
 Ever since I've started taking this Thyroid supplement I've had more energy in the morning, no grogginess, more clarity and sharpness during the day, and less fatigue during the later part of the day after work. Just these benefits alone are worth it to me as I suffered a lot from chronic fatigue despite getting a lot of sleep the nights before.<br/><br/>I've been taking these now consistently for around 4 months now and it's definitely a supplement I'll keep purchasing.<br/><br/>I come from a history of family members with thyroid issues and I have told them to try these supplements but for some reason they'd rather take prescriptions :/  maybe I'll get them on the wagon someday.
 Great product!
 I have used the whole bottle and have noticed a significant weight loss. I currently working with a nutritionist who had determined that my thyroid was sluggish not enough for RX meds so we resulted to this. It has definitely helped. This is not a weight loss pill by any means but for those of us who suffer from slow thyroid function this does help.
 Love this stuff!  After a few days I had a lot more energy, after two weeks the brain fog that has been arounfd for years was finally gone.  I feel like I finally have the amount of energy that I should for an active younger person.  Highly recommend!
 It has helped me lose weight
 good product!
 I have had border line hypothyroidism for years, taking snythroid or other dr prescribed medicine left me feeling extremely nervous and anxious even at the lowest level and don't link the idea of being on meds for life. This product has made me feel better ( I have been taking another thyroid supplement from the health food store for years) after taking it for a few weeks. My energy level seems good and I don't feel so foggy.<br/> I hope they continue to make this, I feel a difference for sure.
 It didn't work for me at all. I'm highly disappointed. I will continue my search to a supplement that suitable for me.
 This was my first bottle of the Thyroid Support. Within the first week and a half, I noticed that I was more alert throughout the day and didn't fatigue easily, as I normally do. I also noticed an increased energy level. I am looking forward to continuous results and will update this review as I move to my second bottle.
 I didnt notice a difference. No energy change and still have brain fog. I took this thinking it might work because of the reviews but it didnt work for me.
 I have been using Thyroid Support for a few months now. I love this product. I feel so much better with more energy. I have never tried a product that has given such good results like the Thyroid Support has. My doctor has lowered my thyroid medication twice. I only have to take half of the lowest dose now. I think that is amazing since I am a senior who has been on thyroid meds for many years. Thank you so much for making such a wonderful product. It has made such a positive difference in my life.
 After reading reviews I decided to order the thyroid support, neruo peak, &amp; keep calm. I have been taking them now for a couple of weeks and have noticed absolutely no difference. I hope I can get the money back that I have paid for them. They may work for some people but for me they didn't work at all. Update: after reading my reviews the company issued me a refund so I raised the rating by 2 stars just because of the customer service
 I have only been taking this for 4 days and to be honest the first 2 days I felt more tired and cloudy. After the third day I noticed I felt more alert and energetic. I am not sure if the long term effects of this supplement but for anyone who feels fatigued and unfocused I would recommend you give this a try. Again, it took a few days to notice an improvement and it's not like an energy pill so no crazy side effects,i just fell over all better.
 Terrible product...I ordered this product because I felt groggy after waking up in the morning and thought it would help with that and give me more energy.  Took this product and went to business calculus class and my whole body was overheating and I was sweating like crazy in class.  I felt super anxious and paranoid in class and my heart was pounding like crazy...I literally thought I was going to have a heart attack after taking your product.
 After about 2 weeks of taking this, I noticed a difference in my energy levels.  I am working on bottle #2 and notice when I forget to take it.
 I could tell a radiance in my energy and alertness and endurance. I got to get some more.
 Feel so much better, I halved my synthroid (plus the synthroid caused my hair to fall out). This is so much better. Definitely recommend!!
 I'm very happy with this product. I was on a low dose of thyroid medication but I've been trying to stop all pharmaceuticals. This product has given me the same benefit as the prescription I was taking without the side effects.
 I have been taking the supplement for a month now and I definitely feel an increase in my energy level. I know some reviewers have said that it keeps them awake if they take a dose at night but I have not had that problem. In fact I have been falling asleep earlier and sleeping better since I started this. I was hoping that I might lose a bit of weight on it but that hasn't happened yet. I'm going to continue to take it longer than a month and see what happens. I feel like it has also helped my focus and I don't feel as foggy brained since I started it also.
 If I took two tablets (as recommended) a day, I would need to start running marathons. Oh My Goodness, this is crazy? I feel so much better and this is only day 4. I feel so much better, did I say that already? ha ha! I tried 2 the first day and it upset my stomach  some]. So I decided to lower the dose to 1 a day, and with that I started feeling almost immediate extra energy. I figure, if it's working this well on 1, i better stick with 1. I have a couple other issues that go along with low thyroid, so, it will take a little longer to see if this pill works on those. I will update as time goes.<br/><br/>Update: November 27, and still just taking one pill a day and still feeling great! I notice my dry skin is clearing up, water retention seems to be gone, brain fog has cleared up, still my energy level is much higher, and I am even walking more each day. I am getting better and better, this pill is amazing. May not work for all, but it was exactly what I needed.
 OMG I don't know where to start but it has been three days that I stopped taking this product and am finally feeling good. Second day I started taking these my heart began pounding in my chest, I was sweating and shaking but for some stupid reason continued taking these day after day and I only took  one pill a day. This product just didn't work for me, and I am lucky that I stopped taking it.
 I love it.  I have notice weight loss, but most importantly I feel full of energy and happy.  Thyroid Support is kicking Hypothyroidism in the butt!
 While I've never been diagnosed with thyroid issues, I decided to try this anyway. I'm always tired and sluggish. I've been taking this for almost a month now, and I feel so better and have amazing energy! I will definitely continue taking this product, along with other Zhou products!
 This unfortunate did not worked for me. It gave me no energy whatsoever and I didn’t feel any improvement in my health. Such a bummer because I have tried other product from this brand which is amazing.
 I started the thyroid support a couple weeks ago, so far I’m feeling a lot better. I have been working out and had no results with weight loss, I have no thyroid, since taking the thyroid support I am seeing results. I take it with my thyroid med. I feel better and have more energy. I’m looking forward to feeling 100%. I’m very satisfied so far.
 Works well have noticed increase in energy, hoping for weight loss, other reviews say it sometimes takes awhile after a second bottle. Excellent customer service!
 This had absolutely no effect on me what so ever! My energy levels have not increased after taking this. I’ve had non stop headache. I workout 5 days a week and since taking this I haven’t lost any weight. I would not recommend that this be taken by anyone.
 LOVE this product! I have several different products from this company and love every single one of them! The thyroid support has helped with my hot flashes and also gives me energy!
 Good
 I have had hypo thyroidism for  20 years and this was the first time I have attempted to use something other then my medicine. I was a sceptic but was proven wrong after about 2 weeks. I have had a noticeable difference in my energy level. Even my family has noticed! Will definitely be using this product again
 I have just recently been diagnosed with postpartum hypothyroidism. I decided to tackle this with a holistic approach, and then I found this item for sale on Amazon. I purchased it and felt a great difference. This is my second bottle, and I plan to keep it as part of my daily supplement regime. It has great, straightforward simple ingredients to help supper my energy and my thyroid.
 I have faithfully been taking this product for a month now and I have noticed a remarked difference in my energy level.  I work nights and was always exhausted.  I no longer need a nap on my days off.  I'm more focused on my job and don't feel as if I'm dragging myself in every night.  In addition, after seeming to be stuck forever on that one number on my scale, I have dropped four new pounds.  Besides the weight loss, I have also noticed less hair loss in my brush everyday.  I'm thrilled.  I have already purchased my second bottle.  Having tried several other thyroid supplements in the past, this is the only one that has actually made a difference.  I highly recommend this product.
 I have been taking thyroid supplements for about a year. Decided to try this one. Have been taking for a week and it just dawned on me why I'm not feeling good this week. This has made me dehydrated, jittery, and feels like I'm on artificial caffeine. I'm writing this review at 2 am because I can't sleep like I normally do. I will not be taking any more of my barely used bottle of this product.
 I have been extremely satisfied with this product! I've had issues with my thyroid for many years, and I've always tried to deal with it naturally, through supplements versus synthetic drugs. Since beginning to take this supplement, I've noticed a definite increase in energy, my pants are starting to fit a little looser, and my hands aren't as icy cold as they usually are! I look forward to even better results in the future. I would highly recommend this product!
 I bought this supplement on the advice of my ex husband who started taking this to help with his sugar cravings.  I have to say that I have been very satisfied with this product.  It gives me great energy when I needed it most and it has helped reduce my sugar cravings.  I usually get them around 3 pm and now, I have noticed that I am not craving sweets.  I am grateful he recommended this supplement because it has benefited me greatly. Being over 40, my metabolism is not where it used to be and Thyroid Support has really helped with that.
 I have just started my second bottle of these pills. They definetly suppress my appetite. I noticed a significant change in my energy and cravings on the days I forgot to take these. I have not had any negative side effects while taking these. I would recommend these to a friend.
 Didn't help or make a difference. Too late to return.
 Have been taking for about a week and a half because hypothyroid runs in the family.  I can't really tell if it's helping but there are no side effects either.  I feel like it's a proactive step to fighting genetics.
 I decided on trying this after I had some blood work done for my thyroid. I really do think this gives me more energy. I'm more awake at work, I can continue working at a faster rate and I don't feel sluggish around 2pm. I did not receive this as a promotion or discount.
 This isn't going to make you lose 2lbs every day right off the bat, but if you take it for a month or so while making healthier diet choices and increasing exercise, it can give you a nice boost. Does seem to help keep lost weight from coming back as easily as well.
 And a final sheesh!  A sucker born every minute....a fool and his money.....
 I bought this because I suspect my metabolism is off. I am in decent shape, work out 3 - 4 times a week. I started following a low carb diet to lose weight - I need to lose around 15 pounds. These supplements have worked well for me along with my diet. I've noticed increased bloating/water retention if I've forgotten to take these for two days consecutively or more, so I think they are working for me. My only concern is the very high levels of vitamin B12 - 2500% of DV. I am not sure why it has to be so high and my research on the internet shows that there are no dangerous side effects from high doses of B12. I would prefer not to though, because I would probably be OK with it being up to 300% of DV, but 2500% is a bit much. I take one pill once a day or once every two days. I haven't felt the need to take 2 per day. Once I run out, I intend on buying more.
 I did not notice any improvement in weight or reduction in anxiety with this product.
 Didnt feel any energy boost. I am always tired and I am young....
 Nice supplement if you’re trying to avoid meds. Mine were screwy from a mistake at the doc and I actually didn’t need meds! I had to work to get my levels back to normal and this helped!
 Amazing! I recently learned that my TSH was high (just outside of parameter) meaning I have hypothyroidism. Before taking RX levothyroxine I wanted to see if this product would help. After taking it for 2 weeks, my TSH was rechecked and it was within normal range!! I am so glad I tried this first and will continue to take it. I also noticed increased energy and mental clarity.
 Wasn't really happy.. Did not give me energy &amp; didn't help with my appetite.
 Struggled with Hypothyroidism since DX in 2007.  I take Armour natural thyroid replacement but still suffered with many many symptoms.  Have been taking Thyroid Support for just about one month and have started feeling much better.  Had chronic insomnia for over three years and I am very happy to report that I have been sleeping like a baby for the last two weeks.  I also have more energy and better mental cognition.  I will not stop taking this. I highly recommend this product for anyone with Hypothyroidism.
 These have given me a boost in energy as well as feeling better
 I'm not sure if I have a thyroid issue but over the last year I've had symptoms that point in that direction.  Mood swings, weight gain, irritability and fatigue.  After some google research I decided to try a thyroid supplement.  I found this one on Amazon and with the great reviews I thought I would give it a try.  I've been taking 2 tablets every day for the last 30 days and I have noticed a big difference.  My irritability has almost vanished and I feel I have more energy.  I say if you're having symptoms of a possible thyroid issue it is definitely worth it to give this supplement a try.
 My godddd thanks God this pills give me the energy I was needed because I work night shift and trust me helping me to keep my self focus..sooo good IAM highly recommend
 I LOST WEIGHT WITHIN DAYS OF TAKING THIS WHICH WAS AN UNEXPECTED SURPRISE. I ALSO JUST FEEL BETTER.
 I've now been taking this 2 or 3 weeks as directed and haven't noticed any changes or benefits at all which is pretty disappointing.
 I've been taking it for more than a week now and it seems to work in boosting up my energy to get through the day.<br/><br/>Either that or it could be some sort of placebo effect.
 After 2 months of research on thyroid support for the reasons of hair loss and what might be good, I took a chance with this product and its awesome. Been using it over a month for now and really see good results and wish I did know about this product before. Feel less stressed too and weight didn't go up this month:) Next step is to have it on subscribe and save some $$.
 After using this product for a few short weeks, I feel a difference and my blood tests already came back with an improvement. I would definitely recommend and I will be buying again!
 Well so far I am encouraged that I may have found a supplement to help my fatigue and mental clarity. I have only been taking for about 2 weeks, but I feel a difference. Have not noticed any improvements in my metabolism yet...but I'm hopeful and just happy that I don't seem as foggy lately and dragging. Hope it continues and not just a placebo!
 I highly recommend this supplement! I feel more relaxed and calm even on my craziest days. Also helped with my splitting nails. I feel less hungry and a lot thirsty.
 Bought this along with the sleep aid and it has been the same. It has not work at all. So dissapointed. I took time to read the reviews and sadly didn't work at all.
 Found no difference
 Not sure why, but I've been using this for 3 weeks and still don't notice a difference in my energy levels at all, will finish the bottle but was hoping to have some kind of results by now. Only thing I have noticed is that I am losing weight, though I am already skinny so if anything this is turning me off of these even more =/
 I have been taking these supplements for a little over a month now and I do get the net impression that my energy levels have been slowly but surely increasing.
 This support complex has been very helpful in boosting my energy levels. I will definitely put it on my subscription list when I finish the bottles that I have.
 I gave it only 2 stars because even though it got here VERY fast...i still haven't noticed any difference in how I feel, since I started taking it 3 days ago. I'll have to come back later and post another review if things change. I find that the pills get sorta stuck on the way down...but no other negative effects.
 I have only used the product for 30 days but could actually feel the difference, unlike others I've tried and could not.  Reordered another bottle-can't wait to continue &amp; see how I feel!<br/><br/>This supplier is quick and courteous $!
 I didn't notice any change or difference with this product. Waste of money!!!
 Made me feel sick, wasn't for me.
 I have tried a list of products from other companies and they jus DO NOT work...A big wast of $! But this product really DOES WORK!!
 This item is a rip off! It DOES NOT WORK!!...I took it exactly as directed for 3 weeks and NOTHING changed. I even cut back on my sugary foods,still no energy or anything it was described  as being able to do! It made me feel sad and down alot,like I was moving in slow motion! Do NOT buy!
 Wonderful energy and clear headed feeling renewed.
 This thyroid support helps improve how I feel throughout the day.  Before I was always tired no matter what I did. Now I feel like I can function like a semi-normal person.
 This product was recommended to me by a friend while discussing my symptoms. I have been suffering for the better part of 10 years but my doctor has always told me my thyroid levels were normal. Up until last week, after showering, my hair would fall out in clumps. I am 31 and practically bald. Since I have started taking this, 7 days ago, I have already noticed that I am not dead tired by 6pm and my hair is no longer falling out at an alarming rate. I lost 3 hairs this morning while washing, drying and brushing and I say that's a massive improvement. I am prepared for a long haul with this and do not expect all of my symptoms to go away immediately however I am confident that this product will continue to prove its effectiveness for me, as it has for my friend who is now regrowing her hair after 9 months of taking the supplement.
 I did not notice any changes while using this supplement
 I have struggled with my thyroid (Hypo) for years, Lately I was always in such a terrible mood and could literally not stop eating (I never felt full), I began researching something to add to my daily Synthroid and came across this. I decided to give it a try. Week 1 I really did not feel any difference but I kept taking them, my week 2 I really began to notice my mood had gotten better and I had much more energy. I really began to notice into week 3 that my almost daily headaches had gone away! This product is great, its in a capsule to I don't get a medicine-y taste in my mouth. Would really recommend this!
 Three and a half weeks in, definitely more energy and starting to see a lifting of the brain fog.<br/>I have also lost a couple of pounds ! Would recommend. I'll post again next month.
 I loved how with in a few days I had a lot more energy with no side effects. I had a slight bump in my metabolism. Just enough to be noticed but not enough to make any tremendous progress. If the metabolism boost would have been more significant I would have rated five stars. I still will purchase this product again.
 Did not feel any different or better using this product.  This company stands behind it money back quarantee if not satisfied.  I would diffently consider using other products of theirs.
 so far so good only been using a few days
 I have bought two bottles thus far and have not noticed any changes in energy or weight loss.  I exercise at least once, and often, two times per day.  I eat pretty good most of the time - lots of good protein and fruits and veggies.  I thought this would help to take a few pounds off but it did nothing for me.  Disappointed.
 This product had a horrible smell of an ashtray. Plus it taste just like it smelled. I undid the auto delivery a number of times when placing my initial order yet I received a second auto order anyway.
 Didn't notice any difference.  Took it to help with my energy level.
 Love this product. I have hoshimotos thyroid disorder and this product gives me more energy, more concentration, and I feel so much better.
 I have been on thyroid medicine for years. Since I started taking this I have had my dosage lowered. Great service, great stuff!
 Great product. I have noticed a change in my energy level.
 This is day two of me taking this product and honestly I felt it working within 30 minutes. I feel like I've had more energy, I was as clouded in the mind. But it's only day two so we'll see. I did feel a bit shaky, like if I had a cup of coffee with nothing to eat, but other than that I'm pretty excited to finish the bottle and see how I feel.
 I read the great reviews and really wanted this to work to provide energy and boost metabolism, however, it did nothing for those two areas and just ended up making me feel nauseous.<br/><br/>Edited because the owner provided full reimbursement. I appreciate someone willing to stand behind their products. Although it did not work for me, it may work for you.
 I had half of my thyroid removed 4 months ago and my levels had<br/>Risen quite a bit but still within normal range but I felt horrible.. thought I'd give this a try. Took just about The whole<br/>Bottle and just realized since I've been taking it I feel 10x worse. Tons of anxiety. Zero energy. Headaches and starving. Glad I made the connection and stopped taking it!!! I hope I can go back to how I felt before I started this pill.
 I have been using Thyroid Support for the last three months hoping my doctor would say my thyroid numbers for a low producing thyroid would improve and it has and, I  believe, helping with other areas of my health that were improved on my blood test, that are affected by a healthy thyroid.  If you are not allergic to it as with any supplement, I highly recommend it.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Margaret
 Did not notice any benefits using this product
 I am so glad that I purchased this item so far I can tell a difference in this past week and how I feel and my appetite has been decreased I believe this is going to work plus  don't have that foggy brain anymore I feel so much better.  Highly recommended
 Hello My Fellow Thyroid Challenged People!<br/><br/>Here's my broken Thyroid story...<br/><br/>I was diagnosed with Hashimotos a few years ago. I was on Levothyroxine and it worked, but my insurance ran out and so did my meds. As we know, when our Thyroid's are off so are we. In general, I felt like crap! I was always tired, my energy level was always down and for me when my thyroid is off I feel it in my feet and legs-I feel that annoying pins and needles thing and my feet hurt, especially if I've done a lot of walking/standing.<br/><br/>I had to do something to feel better. So I started researching thyroid supplements and what to look for in them. Then I came to Amazon, and looked up the top 3 Thyroid supplements and I looked at ingredients and price.<br/><br/>This one had the same ingredients in it as the one that was about $7 more and both had very comparable reviews, and the third didn't compare as far as ingredients and was about the same price. So, I bought this one.<br/><br/>It took a few days but my energy level got better and the very annoying feeling in my legs went away. Overall, my entire system was running much better-including my digestive system. I was constantly bloated, no matter what I ate and I just felt WRONG. It was extremely frustrating. I've learned the hard way that my Thyroid runs the show and when it's off, everything is effected. I wasn't really expecting for my digestive issues to improve, but it did.<br/><br/>Energy, brain function, tingles in legs/feet, digestive issues---ALL SO MUCH BETTER!<br/><br/>I just received my second bottle of Thyroid Support and the only problem with it is that there isn't someone reminding me to take it! I've always been really bad at remembering any kind of pill ESPECIALLY when it's recommended to take with food. I tend to forget. If I forget for a few days in a row, my Hashimoto's Monster starts roaring. If I remember consistently, my Hashimoto's Monster shuts the hell up and I feel better...SO STRANGE HUH???  =/<br/><br/>I think that even when my insurance is back on track, I will continue to use these supplements. I really like the all natural alternative to beating down my monster.<br/><br/>Bottom line, if you have a thyroid issue or think you do-TRY THIS. I doubt you'll be disappointed and if you are, they will refund your money even if you return an empty bottle. You really have nothing to lose.<br/><br/>***Just remember to take it.***
 I bought a bottle just to try since all the reviews I read were great. I was very skeptical of it if would help and I noticed after the first week I felt more energy then I noticed my hair wasn't falling out anything like it had been. Well I finished the first bottle and did not reorder right away then I started to feel very sluggish again and when I washed my hair it was coming out a lot once again. I've had my thyroid checked by my doctor three times they keep saying my numbers are normal. So needless to say I've ordered my second bottle and won't let it run out again. Very pleased with this😊
 Product works great as outlined.
 Noticed no difference
 I wish I had found this supplement sooner.  Within a few days of taking it, I was able to feel the difference in my energy.  I take it in the morning with breakfast and am good for the whole day.  I also notice the difference in my energy levels when I don't take it, its pretty substantial.  I also love that it is GF, soy and dairy free!  Thank you, Zhou Nutrition.
 Give me energy and refreshes my memory, but I can only take one a day, taking two takes away by ability to sleep.
 Waste of money
 This seems to be a good thyroid supplement. I've used several bottles. Capsules are easy to swallow and well tolerated.
 I have a thyroid goiter is genetic and it had for mass tumors inside and this thyroid support has shrunk it and strength for tumors the doctors cannot believe this is the only medication I am taking for my thyroid this product is the best
 Great products but sadly not suitable for vegans because the capsules are made of bovain gelatin.
 I noticed no difference when taking this supplement. Waste of money.
 does not work and you cant get your money back even if you still have half the bottle
 There is no proof in my life and experience that this has worked. Just another gimmick.
 Feel less tired, without increasing my thyroid medicine, results were within a couple of days.
 I really didn't notice much of an effect from these, but hey, they didn't kill me either.
 I received this 1/23 and started taking it on the 24th. By the second day of taking this I could tell I had more energy as I felt like doing more. I have not been diagnosed with a thyroid  disorder, however I have many of the symptoms. As to weight loss or less hunger, a couple pounds but I have also been more active and eating less with better choices. I will say  my appetite is still there but not as strong, I don't feel like I'm 'starving' anymore which makes it easier to eat less. I can't tell if it is helping the brain fog yet. I will put this on Subscribe and Save for now.
 Started taking them as soon as I got them and wanted to love them.  The reviews for them were so good. I am happy for the people they worked for but for me they caused a rash that burned and itched.  There was also some tingling in my fingers which I hadn't experienced before taking them.  I will stop taking them and see if it goes away.
 After reading all the raves I expected more. I think this product made me irritable and short tempered so I stopped taking it and now my mood is back to normal
 I feel like myself again after just one bottle.  It works gradually day after day.
 Great deal!!!!
 Thyroid function is a major inhibitor when trying to conceive. When pairing this with my synthroid, my tsh numbers have been low and I feel great. Positive pregnancy test last month.
 No help whatsoever. Actually made me feel sick in the morning. Will not buy again.
 Love this vitamin!!  I started to feel more like myself right after the first pill.
 Hey everyone, I'm not typically a person who writes these but after taking the thyroid support supplements I've felt better and have had a noticeable amount of more energy, which is helpful when working two full time jobs. I will definitely be getting more!!!
 Love how they are helping me with extra energy in the morning. Will post another review after taking for a month.
 I feel like I’ve waste valuable money because this stuff is junk. Doesn’t work at all for energy or  appetite
 This did absolutely nothing for me. In fact, everything that it says it helps support I had the opposite effect. I took this all while working out 5 days a week for an hour and eating clean. I actually gained 6 pounds, I felt more exhausted than ever and actually became manic. This product also has B12 in it which is great for some<br/>people but in certain doses can give people like me chronic migraines. Everyone's body is different. I'm 30 years old, 5'4 and 130 pounds. It definitely wasn't for me.
 Makes me feel extremely sick.  Will never buy this product again.  The product is not  as described. Should not be sold.
 This works great, I have so much more energy after taking this and it is the boost that I needed for my metabolism. On a side note, if you are taking a multivitamin that is high in Vitamin C, or a Vitamin C supplement, take it a few hours apart from this. The vitamin C reduces absorption of the thyroid supplement.
 It's been 3 weeks, I was so excited to get this based on other reviews but sadly, I'm not getting the same results as other reviewers 😐.  I've experienced absolutely zero effect and still have a tough time sleeping at night.  I'll post an update once I finish the bottle (still hopeful).
 I took them for a month, seemed to do absolutely nothing..
 I have taken these for one month and feel some better.
 I really like this brand for nutrition. The Thyroid Support Complex supplement along with their caffeine pill gives me energy with no jittery feeling.
 Purchased for weight loss and energy.  After taking for one month, neither happened
 Well i needed energy through the day , it helped me sleep at work . Lol
 Not sure if they worked or not but I like them.
 Not sure if these did anything for me
 Good product, Wonderful customer service
 I could feel a difference in my energy level right away. I have only been taking it for a short time but plan to continue.
 I tried one bottle after dealing with some issues. I did some research and figured it was worth a try after looking at the contents in this supplement... Expecially iodine. After a week, I started to notice some differences. One problem I was having was really dry skin and skin irritation in my throat area. Very strange and annoying....but this is where your thyroid is located. I've been dealing with this for almost a year and couldn't explain it. After taking the thyroid support, the issue has completely gone. I would recommend this product.
 haven't noticed any results with energy etc.
 I should have paid more attention to the ingredients before purchasing as some of them are not natural as I was hoping.
 Took as directed combined with the Green Tea Extract and noticed just a bit of energy but not much else.
 So far so good only time will tell if This works!
 I have used this product for weeks and I feel exactly the same is before I started taking it. It is not worth the money.
 Works good. Definitely felt a change!
 JUST GOT IT FIRST TIME TRYING IT
 Personally, after using this product daily for one week, I do not feel any different. I have not had any changes in my diet or metabolism. I feel this product poorly effects my acid reflex, so this product was not a great choice for me. I will say the shipping was very fast.
 Was taking Synthroid, but didn't like the side effects that came with it.  Started taking Thyroid Support two months ago and my TSH results are in the normal range.  Happy customer.
 No changes observed
 Not impressed
 So I ordered these along with a different vitamin and both had broken capsules. This one had far more.
 I finished my first bottle and have noticed positive affects on my mood. However, I gained 10 lbs. I am not happy at all. I ordered another bottle before hopping on the scale. I will be returning it.
 Really couldn't feel a change
 It seems to be helping
 I have been taking this for about a week now, and have definitely noticed an increase in energy! My moods are better, and i was struggling with a bit of a mental fog, which hasn't been an issue since I've started on this product. I am very happy with my purchase and plan on continuing to use it.
 good
 Not sure about this
 Trying a second bottle just to be sure.
 did nothing
 I took it as directed, did not notice any difference in my body or sleeping habits and I didn't have any weight loss with it. I actually gained 3 lbs. I drank nothing but water while I was taking them and tried to eat as healthy as I could. Not satisfied with my purchase, will not buy again.
 thank you for being an honest company.
 Not sure it works.
 this product did not agree with me
 impressed with the results.
 Didn’t do anything for me... I didn’t see an improvement in weight loss or energy... people are over exaggerating about this product
 Amazing product that literally gives me the focus and energy I lack given my hypothyroid issues. Amazing company as well!
 I am on my second bottle, however I am trying an experiment and have stopped taking my normal thyroid meds given by my doctor.I want to see what results I get only from using Thyroid Support, if this is all I will need ,I will most definitely review​ this product again,and give it 5 🌟!!
 Saw no difference in energy, weight or mental performance.
 Ordered this but now realize it was probably a mistake after reading your email to me with a large number of terrible spelling mistakes.  If you can not use spell check how can you make a formula that is safe to consume.?
 A bit pricey but good quality!
 I purchased this based on the hundreds on reviews stating they experienced an increase of energy and clarity. I've only been taking it a week but I actually had to take two naps this week when I've never had to do that before...so I am experiencing zero benefits from the pills. I have an underactive thyroid for which I've been on synthroid for 15 years. I take the pills 5 hours after taking my synthroid so they don't mix but I feel nothing...and my appetite has not changed at all. I will continue to take them for the next 3 weeks in hopes that my review will change.<br/><br/>Update:<br/>I received an email from customer service. They refunded my money based solely on my review. I will continue to finish the rest of the product in hopes that it will start to work. Refunding the amount I paid was a very nice gesture which was totally on them. I didn't ask for one.
 Did nothing for me
 No noticable difference
 Sufficient help for a complex problem.
 This is my second time ordering this supplement and I really do like it. I’ve tried to submit a review before but it was not up to amazon standards, I’m trying again this way. Although I like the pills—The reviews here are false. The company offers free bottles for positive reviews on a social media site and amazon allows it. I’ll post this on Facebook myself if this doesn’t work. Let’s see if this way works.
 Been taking this for about 3 weeks now.  So far, I've noticed I feel generally better, and my skin isn't so dry and flaky. This is worth it just for that!
 I loved these, feel a bit off without them! I don't know if they're meant to do this but I didn't need my anxiety/depression medication. This made me feel happy energized and bubbly. I really felt the same still got hungry and lost no weight though but emotion wise I loved this!
 Good!
 none
 Great product.
 I would recommend this product, it certainly helps with energy, I have not seen a significant difference in my weight tho, but maybe that's just me, maybe it preventing me from gaining more weight. This is my 3rd bottle I have bought, plan to buy more when it is finish again
 Didn't work
 Great product and great service! Noticed improvement within about a week and a half, just felt better in general! Re-ordered before I ran out!
 They don't work but they refunded everything thing
 Happy with it!
 This made my body fluctuate really badly
 I could not tell that it did one thing and thus is the problem. How do you ever know that it works. Made no difference at all. Not like having a headache and taking a couple of tylenols and the headache goes away.
 I’m not sure if this works or not because you cannot read instruction because it is sooo small even with magnifying glass!!<br/>Do your marketing people even think about seniors that can’t see as well!
 I bought thyroid support a few months back but I waited to write the review to have some history with it before posting.  There is a clear difference in my mood, energy, and focus after taking this product.  I usually will take one with breakfast as it helps set me up for the day.  I have not tried it mid-day or later, but I can say that it has a smooth, non-jittery effect overall.  I will be re-purchasing this product when I run out.
 I have been taking thus for three weeks and I feel great. I have energy for the first time in years. I have already recommended it to several friends. I will defiantly be ordering more.
 I feel energized throughout the day and sleep well at night! Good product. Great price!
 This product has changed my life. It has giving energy that I haven't had in a long time.
 I've gained 15lbs from this product in less than 1 month.
 This is a terrible product it caused severe diarrhea and vomiting.i can't believe I paid money to feel this bad. I don't understand how it could have so many good reviews
 So I got this stuff December 14th. I took it as directed for 3 weekend, didn't feel any changes in energy levels or have any weight loss. So I quit taking it for 4 days to see if I felt any different, and nothing. So in my experience this was a waste of money.
 No noticeable difference. I have taken for over a week now. Will continue to take, because I don't have 20 bucks to throw away.
 Love this product! I feel the difference in my energy levels. I use about 6 products from this company and love them all.
 Taking this for a week now. Don't feel any different. Was hopeful after reading all the great reviews. I will give it more time and finish the bottle since I paid $20 for it. Will Update my review later.
 I just ordered my second bottle. I've definitely noticed a big difference in my energy levels and my cravings and stress levels are reduced. Great product and would highly recommend for anyone that feels stressed out!
 DON'T take this! A total waste of money! Does absolutely nothing!
 Ï love the thyroid support. It works great. Ï was having trouble with brittle nails and the thyroid support helped to harden my nails.
 Don't waste your money
 Amazing product! I have suffered from thyroid issues most of my adult life but not seriously enough to warrant medical intervention. This product did just the trick and has helped me with my sluggishness and feeling tired all the time.
 I didn't notice any health changes after using this product.
 I really like my thyroid support. I'm overall feeling better with more energy.
 This product just didn't work for me, however, when I contacted the company asking for a refund they were extremely helpful! I received full refund within two days!
 I just love it...It gives me lots of energy all day long and then when I'm ready for bed I sleep great
 Unfortunately I noticed no change in my hypothyroidism symptoms. Onto trying a different brand.
 Didn't really notice any benefits from this product.
 I wanted to feel what everyone else felt while taking this. It's been almost a month and I don't feel much of a difference. Maybe I need to take it longer? Not sure.... Wish I had better luck with it.
 No change, no energy, no weight loss.
 Amazing customer service!
 I purchased this based on the reviews and stated ingredients, however I haven't felt any different after taking this supplement for about 9 days.  Actually I had to decrease my dosage from the recommended 2 capsules to one per day because 2 made me feel very jittery. My hands and feet have been swelling since taking the supplement, which I did not have an issue with previously.  I wanted to return the product, since it says 100% money back guarantee but was blocked by doing so through the amazon site.
 I was able to stop my prescription thyroid after taking this for a month!
 Sadly, didnt work for me. In fact most days I was more tired. Glad it worked for most people!
 Made me jittery and gave me brain pulsations
 Working well for me so far (just started to use it). Shipped quickly and item was in great condition. Thank you!
 It's hard for me to be sure how well this product alone is working. I started 3 vitamins at the same time. I could still use some energy. I struggle with that daily.
 Awful, stinging sensation in my throat when I take these!  What is in this product??!!??!  I highly suggest you don't buy this.  I threw it out!
 Didn't like how it made me feel so I stopped taking the product.
 I saw zero weight loss and very little noticeable energy change.
 I thought it would help me more it has helped but not with the lil weight gain I have just guess I hoped for more than I got but continuing just to see if I get better results after more
 Bought this for my daughter.  She seems pleased with it.
 Great supplement!<br/>I have more energy!<br/>I highly recommend!
 took as directed and seen no results
 This product had zero effect on me. I think all the high reviews are BS
 Do not buy this product! Does not work. Missed return by a day an can’t receive refund. Stuck with almost full bottle. Waste of money. Zero stars if I could
 Not quite what I thought
 I'm using now and so far it is helping with the bags under my eyes
 It didnt work for me.
 Great product! Kept me awake and helped my attitude at work and promoted me to God! Now I'm immortal!
 Said to find it did not meet my expectation
 I diagnosed with Thyroid Problem 2 years ago. I heard from a friend about this product and it boosts my energy. I just order my third bottle. LOVE IT.
 No aftertaste! Not as tired lately and at least 2lbs off w/o exercise; no cravings either!!
 Product made me more tired.  Will not continue use of this product.
 I must have bought a placebo bottle cause it's been a week and I feel no better. I feel no different at all. Disappointing.
 Product had no effect on me.Complete waste of money , Do not buy
 Thanks
 Was advised by my doctor to avoid this product as it can cause more damage than good!
 Love this product! High quality ingredients. I noticed a difference in my energy and overall well being. Time to order more.
 I have noticed an increase in energy.
 Will purchase again!
 My hair started falling out in handfuls for two weeks now. I had taken this supplement about a month.
 Absolutely love this product! I feel so alive! It is the perfect additive that I needed to give me that extra boost for my thyroid to get moving!!
 This is a very good product! It does what it says I'm not tired or sluggish anymore I would recommend this product
 I'm on my third bottle. It does provide me with some clarity and energy. I notice when I haven't taken it that my energy is lower.
 This item did not do anything for me.
 I'm on my 2 bottle and haven't noticed an improvement in energy or mind clarity.<br/> I eat mindfully &amp; exercise by hiking &amp; lift weights 4 to 6 days a week.<br/> I'm going to try 1 more bottle and see if that helps.<br/>I still get sleepy or lethargic by 12 or 2pm....<br/>I've eliminated  sugary foods &amp; white bread carbs to avoid sugar high &amp; lows
 The customer service has been exceptional. I can’t wait to try the green tea extract!
 Tried this for a month. Really did not notice any change and it did not help in weight loss.
 I had an adverse reaction to the supplement. Did work for my body .
 provides great blend
 It might be a good product, if you don't have a autoimmune disease. I have psoriasis and it made it flare up something awful. When I looked up the ingredients, it said ashwanga is not good for you if you have a autoimmune disease.  Live and learn i guess...
 Was very excited to try this product. However, I was terribly disappointed.  Quit using after a few weeks because this product cramped my stomach so badly and made me sick.  Shouldn't have ever veered away from Gaia's Thyroid Support supplement.
 Best thyroid support!
 Very happy with the results of this product. Feeling more energetic. A++
 this seems to be just what I need  it gives me the get up and go I have been lacking for a while.
 Great product. Good service. No issues whatsoever
 So far so good.  Haven’t been taking it long enough to say more
 Not what I expected.  I started to getting weight again.  I want to suspend my suscripción.
 Good stuff to
 Shipping is fast and accurate. Quality is also good deuh. Currently taking so definetly effect ~ ~
 I have used it for 2 months without noticing any improved energy and I haven't lost a pound
 Felt awful and experienced nausea, bloating, and anxiety. Would appreciate a refund!
 It was excellent.  The results were real and i have so much energy now.
 I am so ready to try this product..I can already feel the energy coming and the fat leaving!!
 Loved it! I have truly felt more like myself than I have in a long time!
 thanks
 Just ordered my first bottle last week.  Hoping it does everything it says!
 Great product
 I've taken this product for a month. Haven't noticed a big difference but will take for another month to see if it helps. Had an ultrasound in June that showed calcium on thyroid so know it needs help &amp; support. Will have thyroid checked in a couple mons to see if this problem has been corrected with this products support. Will review again after its checked.
 didn't really feel anything. just like the neuro-peak.
 I didn't notice a change
 Gives me headaches
 It's too soon to tell, but I do like the product and ease of taking.
 I had great experience with this supplement. Would purchase again!
 I have hypothyroid unfortunately i still have fatigue and this has helped alot!
 So I started birth control in July, the Nexplanon to be specific. It had my hormones so unbalanced it affected every aspect of my life, including work, family, and sex. I was always irritable, tired, hungry &amp;mean and then some. After reading reviews and doing some research, I really believed this would be a cure to my problems, so  I decided to give this supplement a try. I started the supplement about 3 weeks ago.. I was soooooo disappointed. It didn't help me at all. If anything, I was more irritable than ever due to the constant headaches, nausea and painful acne I had. I'm 25 and never have had acne in my life. I wasn't exactly happy to start having it now... I knew I needed solutions! After realizing the birth control had made me an entirely different person I made an appointment to remove the BC. I'ts been out for 6 days now. My gyno said the hormones would be out my system within 3 days..Since discontinuing the BC, I still have very painful acne which comes in clusters, constant headaches and nausea.I'm going to continue taking it for one more week. If I don't see change I'm flushing these down the toilet....
 Have not been able to tell a difference. Will update after second bottle
 Great product.  I have been using it now for a month.
 Great product. Gives me lots of energy
 good quality
 So far so good :)
 Just started using
 This product just didn’t work.. it did no good
 Great product.  I have lots more energy.
 This product has really helped with my energy levels n weight gain.
 I suffer adrenal fatigue, low DHEA and hypo thyroid. Taking doctor RX for each. Fatigue, hair loss and weight gain is my biggest three issues.<br/>I hope to at least see an increase in energy level first then improvement to hair and eventually weight loss.<br/>Day two - no improvement to energy.<br/>Will update feedback later.
 I received the product quickly.  No change as of yet, but I am hopeful.
 Made me feel good, engaged in more physical activity
 This has been working really well for me.
 This has helped me with energy and weight loss,  I recommend it 110%!
 It gives me good energy throughout the day.
 Didnt like the weight gain
 I bought this for my wife. She has hyperthyroid disease.  This actually made her feel worse....dizzy and headaches.<br/> I am re-evaluating this because this was a non-refundable item but after seeing this did not help my wife this company actually reached out to me to offer me a refund. You don't see many companies who will do that now-a-days.  Hence the Five Stars is for outstanding Customer Service.
 just started 2 weeks ago<br/>need more time to see result
 did not like at all
 Excellent works well😍
 Love these, gives me lots of energy.
 Great product
 
 Love this product!
 Love t
 Excellent
 I love this stuff
 What a waste.  This stuff is a joke.  It did absolutely nothing but take my money.  I was not happy with my purchase and my money is being refunded.  The company cares about their products and wants their customers to be satisfied.
 best stuff ever
 Have used it for almost a month now and unfortunately haven't seen a difference.
 First of all, if you expect this review to be full of the wonders and benefits of this supplement then move on.  I am not a medical professional or a diet/supplement guru.  Far from it.  I'm a 50+ super obese insulin diabetic female accountant.  I have more medical issues then you want to hear about.<br/><br/>What I will tell you is why I bought thyroid support with iodine and why I will or will  not continue using them.  If that's  what you want to hear, read on.<br/><br/>Full Discloser.  I bought this off a discount site I look at.  Not because I wouldn't  pay full price (I have for other supplements) but I'm cheap and whenever I can get something I'm already using or think I will benefit from, sign me up!!!!  This in no way influenced my review of this company's products.  In a way, it makes me harder in the review as I want to make sure I am "unbiased and honest". Now that is out of the way, back to the review.<br/><br/>I take Synthroid for my thyroid and I have a lot of other conditions as well.  I've actually had this bottle of supplements for more than 2 months but I didn't start taking them till 2 weeks ago.  I wanted to make sure my endocrinologist was ok with me taking them.  He was, so I added it to my regime.  (Warning - Lecture/disclaimer here.  If you take multiple medicines and/or supplements, please check with your doctor or pharmacist before starting amything new.  Even supplements can cause drug interreactions)<br/><br/>I added these to my large list of supplements I take in the morning with breakfast.  The first couple of days I was slightly queasy but chalked it up to  forgetting to take my ulcer meds over the weekend before I added the new supplement.  By mid morning I would be ok but have heartburn on and off.<br/><br/>Three days in and I was running late to work took my meds but didn't eat much of a breakfast.  I think it was a slice of toast.  By the time I got to work I barely made it to bathroom to throw up my toast.<br/><br/>This unusual for me so I decided to stop taking the thyroid support for a couple of days and see if i felt better.  I did, the nausea and heartburn went away.  I waited till the weekend and tried taking the supplement (2 caps per meal) again. Immediately felt bad.  Stopped taking it again and felt better.<br/><br/>I don't know if I would react this way to any brand of thyroid support supplement or if it just this brands it mix of vitamins that were interfering with my stomach.<br/><br/>Overall 3 stars.  This may work for some people and from the previous reviews it is.  It's not going for me as it upsets my stomach
 Love it
 Horrible product. Made me feel terrible.
 I have had a slow thyroid most of my life.  It took a long time for any doctor to finally notice it and put me on thyroid medication.  At first I was on levothyroxine for years.  But then I started having side effects so I switched to Nature Throid because it fewer fillers.  Every time I have my T3 &amp; T4 checked it comes back normal.  But I have not felt normal for years.  Tired all the time, hair falling out, can't sleep, can't lose weight, etc.  I was on Amazon one day and looking at natural thyroid medication I came across "Thyroid Support" and read the reviews.  I thought I would give it a try to see how I would feel.  I'm very sensitive to medications and have to take things slowly because I'm afraid of side effects and want to see how it works for me.  Everybody's body chemistry is different and what works for one person may not work for someone else.  Well the first day I took 1 pill and no side effects - so that was great.  But I didn't really feel much difference.  The next day I took 2 pills and holly cow it worked great.  I have so much more energy, hair stopped falling out and I sleep so much better.  These pills have changed my life and I will continue buying them.  These pills are extraordinary!!!!!
 Wow!! Though the product was not for me, the customer service was great...better than most companies who have terrible customer service.This company really loves their customers!! So, I would recommend giving this product a try.<br/><br/>Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one’s courage.<br/>-Anais Nin
 I have almost completed my 1st bottle.  I have not seen any changes with hair loss yet which was my primary reason for trying this product.  I would like a 2nd bottle to confirm whether this product works as I expected to balance my thyroid.  Please send me another bottle!
 Great customer service, product seems pretty good just started using it. Just check the ingredients before using due to their old formula having gelatin in it, but seller is very prompt to correct any issues.
 After taking this thyroid support supplement for a few weeks I was able to get off the prescription medication!!  So far my thyroid is stable.  Feel free to email me again. I would be happy to keep you updated.  I love this product!  Thx. -- Angela Shay
 After taking one capsule, I experienced gas, pressure, and indigestion.  This was followed by diarrhea, bloating and cramping.  Tried it again two days later and experienced the same thing.
 Almost two weeks taking this and nothing happens, I fell the same, this seen to be another “scam miracle pill”. Honestly, I’m tired of these products with fantastic reviews. I quit. Do you want to feel better? Go to a doctor, period.
 I have been taking this for about a week and a half.  After the first couple of days I experienced some more energy but now I am jittery and having other intestinal issues.  I am going to stop taking them and try something else.
 No difference
 I have hypothyroidism and was extremely tired very recently and had gained quite a bit of weight.<br/>I didn't neccessarily want to go back to the doctor and get re-rested. So I tried this. Definitely do not feel as tired as I was and along with diet and exercise have lost some weight
 Did nothing for me. A rip off
 Don't waste your money on this product.  It does work.
 Did anybody receive a bottle like this? I'm scared to take it .. it doesn't look legit.. nor does it have dosing instructions or ingredients? :(
 Edited update....Unfortunately, this didn't work for me, but the company gave me a refund. So, I'm happy!
 it causes irregular heart beat, it may lead to Afib...could not take it
 First bottle and i can notice results i no longer feel sluggish and tired. It has boosted my energy and i feel great!
 I do not see any benefits
 It didn't do anything to me.
 returned it. Did not work for me
 Took for two months, per package dosing instructions - zero effect. Disappointed.
 Will update
 Don't waste your money.
 Ok
 ok
 Love it, it works! I feel like it gives me a ton of energy
 Unfortunately this product didn't work for me. I had a horrible allergic reaction to something in the product. It ended up costing me a visit to urgent care, a prescription medication, multiple over the counter meds like Benadryl and eye ointments due to the reaction. And it cost me a day of pay at work because I wasn't able to go because the reaction was so bad. I expect full money back. My eyes are still healing. On day 16 of the eye reaction. It's horrible. Make sure you know what you're buying on the Internet.
 Did not work.
 I wish I could return these but they won't let me ....before you can even try to Swallow  it down the smell comes through the capsule and then if you can get it down your throat you'll be lucky are usually don't have trouble swallowing pills these capsules are very flimsy a lot of them are already broken I have no clue if  this produces good results but I most likely never will because I can't even get the pills down for poor product 🙁
 This product came with both seals broken so I did not have the chance to even try them
 I can really feel a difference in my energy levels! Love it!
 After taking these pills for just a few days, I felt more energetic &amp; lost some belly fat. Highly recommended  !
 good company excellent supplement
 Triggered my seizures.Should write a warning to persons who have epilepsy.
 Good effects for the first 2 days, then felt like a train wreck after 3 and stopped taking it. Head aches, weird depression like symptoms, inevitable doom. Did not get results I was expecting based on reviews. I have a full bottle anyone want it?
 This stuff was AMAZING!  I have had thyroid issues for awhile and up until recently, I have put off being consistent on investing on the supplements I need to keep me thriving.  I have not taken any type of thyroid supplements in over 6 months and I've been experiencing fatigue, brain fog and all that stuff that goes with having a weak thyroid.  I took this supplement as soon as it arrived and WOW I noticed an improvement right away, I was pleasantly surprised, because I've never tried this brand before.  It also helped improve my mind clarity and focus (I'm text book ADD) which was an unexpected added bonus.  This product will be on my "can't go without" order list now :)!
 This product made my heart race and made me really sick with nausea
 like it
 This product made me feel so dizzy! I only took it 1 time then threw it out! It might work for some people but not me!
 This is not helping me at all. It doesn't give me energy. I still feel sluggish and fatigue in the afternoon. It does not help with energy and it does not help with losing weight. This was a waste of money.
 I was suggested by a doctor to find some Thyroid support with iodine. Tried this brand and I finished the whole bottle taking it every day and just did not feel any difference. I was looking for getting a little extra energy but nothing has changed. I don't think they did anything.
 Sadly, it did nothing for me
 Followed the instructions on taking for a month and did not notice any change or benefit from it.
 Paramedic for 31 years, Emergency RN for 27 years - Western medicine is killing people, I self diagnosed by experience &amp; research - My Hypothyroidism causing Hypertension (HIGH BP) regulated with Thyroid support. Normo-tensive - even passed pre-employment physical ( 3 days ago BP 134/86 ) w/ flying colors. I can NOT say enough about this product !  Natural, non-pharmacutical, non-trackable way to promote thyroid health !  AND stay off the radar screens of the insurance Co.s looking to deny benefits or financially rape you for "pre existing conditions" or " high risk conditions "  when you see a physician, get branded with a Dx (diagnosis)  and fill an  RX ( prescription).  I was a Deputy Coroner for 5 years - trust me when I say everything is discoverable. Who do you know that ISN'T on Synthroid for hypothyroidism ?  I'M NOT.  I also have more energy, less tired as well... try it or stay slave to Big Pharm and empty your pockets.
 I took this to my doctor and he says there's no ingredient in the products that would help with my thyroid. Will return.
 Sorry reviewed wrong product
 I know this is going to sound crazy, but the pill exploded (or something) inside of me and I had smoke come out of my mouth and nose and a burning in my throat and nose.  Happened this morning after I had been taking these for a couple weeks.  I'm going to try to return them and will never take them again.
 This is a great supplement. I was feeling tired all the time. I could not concentrate. My-1st Doctor wanted to do surgery. My 2nd Doctor wanted to hold off on the surgery. I spent 15 minutes with him and got a bill for $360.00. The surgery would have cost thousands. This Thyroid Supplement is great. I am getting back to my old self again. I have a lot more energy now and just bought a new treadmill. I lost over 10 pounds and absolutely feel great.  I also lost 11 pounds.
 Not impressed.
 Wow! after trips to the doctor tests after tests two docs wanted to put me on meds for life and refusse too,so I went to local natural herb stores and got advice on what would help my thyroid and bought many diffrent products and nothing was working except mega foods went back to docs to take another test from 7.6 went down a bit so I read on zhou thyroid support and I bougth to test out and wow after a month  of takin this I went back to docs after 3months test now it went down to 3.4. After that I email  the company and told them  what store can I find this  but not sold in stores .i told him i wanted more and wanted to make sure it doesn't go away from amazon and I was nervous buying from amazon the company called me direct and was very nice and helpful  so I feel confiedent I will be buying from amazon zhou thyroid support for a long time thank you for this working product godbless mike
 Though i haven't actually started using this product, the ingredients make it all natural. Excited to see what it'll do for me!
 Waste of money. Doesn't do anything. Placebo effect most likely with all the positive reviews, either that or they are paid to leave positive reviews. I'm all truth. This stuff doesn't do anything. Do not waste your money!!!
 Bad  health risk
 This Zhou Nutrition Thyroid Support is absolutely the Best Thyroid Supplement that I have ever used. I have tried other Thyroid Support Supplements but nothing Worked. I was Tired all the time, gained weight and could not sleep very well at night do to my Hypothyroidism. I thought nothing would work until I found Zhou Nutrition Thyroid Support Supplements.<br/>After a week of taking them I could not believe how much better I was feeling.<br/>I started to have more energy and I wasn't<br/>Tired like I was with those other Thyroid supplements. I even lost some weight which was a surprise to me because it seemed that the scale was stuck on the<br/>same number. So something in these pills are working !!!!!!!<br/>I am so so glad that I found the Thyroid Support Supplements from Zhou Nutrition. The added Iodine I think really helped. I am never going back to those other Thyroid support Supplements.<br/>I'm sticking with this Company and you should too. Their the Best and they have the Best Product.<br/>I was not paid to say these things.<br/>When a product actually works like these pills did I just had to share it with people who are suffering with the symptoms of Hypothyroidism like I am.<br/>So order a bottle today and try it. You won't be disappointed.<br/>From: A loyal Customer from now on because they really work.<br/>THIS PRODUCT GETS 5 STARS FROM ME !!!!!!!!!!
 I tried it. It's just a vitamin and mineral supplement complex. It won't do anything for you unless you are deficient in one of the ingredients. Most people in developed countries aren't unless you have diet restrictions. Save your money and go eat some vegetables.
 BS!  don't waste money on this.
 Did not lose weight
 My mom started getting  this for me because my aunt raved about it. I have had thyroid problems since I was 17 and I am now 41. I take armour thyroid as well as Tri-iodine by Terry Naturally which you can also purchase on amazon.  I started at the low dose  but now am on 12.5 mg. I am Hashimotos and I know they say you shouldn't take iodine but if you suffer from thyroid problems like me you know that you have to self care and know your own body and I am iodine deficient and I've been tested with this combination of drugs my doctor says that my tests have never looked better and I feel the best I've felt in a long time my hair isn't falling out my skin is not dry and I feel good. I'm not saying that my combination is going to work for everybody but these are some good hints and this stuff is one of the better things I've ever tried plus that tri iodine has been amazing as well. I hope this can help someone. Switchig to Armour Thyroid made me feel a lot better as  as well.
 I am 32 years old and in good general health. I work out at least 3-4 times a week and try to eat healthy. So I was surprised to learn I have low thyroid levels at my physical check up earlier this year. I was told i am a part of the 30% of women who lose 30% of their thyroid in their 30s. So I guess it is just a natural process. I was prescribed the lowest level of levothyroxine but I do not like medication and wanted to try a natural supplement first. So I purchased this thyroid supplement because of the great reviews it had.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this supplement just doesn't work for me. I have been taking it as recommended for 3 weeks now and I've noticed that I have been feeling more sluggish than usual. I usually am a go-getter and make sure that I make time to workout even a little bit every day. But these past few weeks I noticed that I have a harder time getting out of bed and getting motivated to even go to work. My exercise has slacked the past two weeks because I just feel so tired all the time. I was hoping this supplement would replace having to take medication, but unfortunately, once I am finished with this bottle, I will just have to take the levothyroxine prescribed.<br/><br/>In short, the supplement didn't do anything to help with my energy level. In fact, it did the opposite. My thyroid levels after doing a blood test were not improved. I won't be buying this product again and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else with hypothyroid.
 I had been taking another thyroid supplement from Natural Factors for a few years, it was a great price, made me feel like a normal, functioning person, etc...but it, seemingly, vanished from existence. So I tried another supplement from Gaia. It was ok, better than nothing, but 2x the price and didn’t even work 1/2 as well as my other one. So I tried taking, in 3 separate pills, the 3 active ingredients from my original supplement. I might as well have taken nothing at all. I was so wiped out by 3pm that I wasn’t sure how I was going to get through the rest of the day without collapsing. Thank god I found this one because I feel back to myself again. It’s a little more expensive than what I had been taking, but it has A LOT of really great extra ingredients, making the extra cost completely understandable and it’s worth it. I can’t thank this company enough for this product. I was at my wits end, trying to take care of my kids, my job, my life. I’m back to functioning like I should. I get up and feel awake and continue feeling awake and focused through the entire day. I would HIGHLY recommend this.
 This is my WILL NOT LIVE WITHOUT vitamin!! I take as directed on bottle, My thyroid has been doing well. I'm able to control my hair lose, weight problems, fatigue or feeling of drained by lunch, also regulated my body temperature.
 I do not know if it is helping or not yet as I haven't even been taking it for a month! When I am taking it longer I will let you know!
 Be careful when consuming these capsules! One of the ingredients is cayenne pepper. Evidently there is some cayenne dust left on the capsules which can end up in your windpipe (trachea) and cause coughing and irritation. Don't breathe in when you place them in your mouth, and wash them down quickly with water.<br/>I plan to remove all the capsules from the bottle and blow them off with compressed air, and also clean the bottle.<br/>I have not taken these long enough to report on any health results.
 I took this as described for 3 weeks, skipped a week (Thanksgiving got me off track) &amp; now I'm finishing the last week. Haven't really noticed a huge effect, though I am on l-thyroxin. I just wanted to take something to support my thyroid &amp; help with Hashimoto's disease. The effect could be dampened somewhat by my not actually taking the pills, but adding the powder to my morning protein shake. I HATE taking pills, I take enough already. Anyway, I'm buying another bottle &amp; giving it a try for another month.
 I have taken this supplement  for a month combined  with  a good probiotech, and magnesium supplement.  I have dropped 8 lbs, and I have a lot of energy.  I get up at 6am and I go until 8pm when I finally  have time to really stop. I  do home school with my daughter, working 3-5 days a week, and I coach  volleyball everyday.  I can honestly  day I feel better  then I have for a very long time. Thank you so much.
 I'm at the end of my 1st bottle &amp; whoa I feel different. My thyroid  levels are always OK but at the edge of low so I thought I'd give this a try since I like using as many natural supplements as opposed to the Rx I already have to take for my mirad of illnesses.<br/>Having fibromyalgia I'm always tired &amp; feel sluggish. After the 1st week I started noticing I wasn't as tired &amp; could do more stuff than I normally could around the house. A couple weeks in &amp; I noticed weight loss too to my surprise.<br/>I'm hooked! And happily surprised to find a product that does what it says.
 I took one tab a day since I’m rather small. I noticed that I have more frequent BM’s, the swelling in my neck went down and I don’t feel as fatigue or anxious as I normally do. I don’t have abnormal T3 or T4 labs however I do have TPO antibodies/Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. I don’t think I lost actual weight, however the bloating in my abdomen and swelling in my face has started to decrease, so I think the 4lbs of weight loss is related to water. I was on a low grade antidepressant and had possibly had ADHD due to fatigue and brain fog so have had been on adderall in the past with terrible side effects. It’s not a miracle pill but I’ve been taking it a month and can tell a difference. Pretty sure it’s not a placebo effect given my neck and swelling. If things take a turn for the worse I will update my review. I only took off a star because the ingredients weren’t as direct, you can’t use this if you have a shellfish attitude.
 I waited a week before writing my review. I wasn't really sure how long it would take to start seeing results. In most cases vitamins/medications need time to build up in your system. Today is exactly 1 week since I've started taking the supplements and I am noticing a major shift in my mood and energy. I started taking 1 a day just in case I had a reaction but I'm currently taking the recommended daily dosage of 2. I am not having any more energy crashes during the day and it sometimes makes me feel like I have drank an energy drink without the jitters. I have struggled for YEARS with chronic fatigue, weight gain, irritability and skin problems. I've had my thyroid tested several times with results always being within the normal range. I can't judge on whether or not it's making me lose weight since it's only been a week but I will update my review if I notice any changes there. Also note...I am also taking the DHEA (Zhou Brand)  and Evening Primrose Oil supplements (store brand) and I can honestly tell you. I feel like my old self again. Like I am in my 20s again. They are helping me tremendously and even helps balance my hormones. I feel wonderful!! ( I had been taking the primrose and DHEA for a month before I started the thyroid support with no noticeable changes)
 I've struggled with issues related to low thyroid for years. I have cold hands and feet, am cold most of the time and easily chilled when others are warm and comfortable. I also feel fatigued, even in the morning when I first wake up. I've had my thyroid function tested three times and always end up borderline, so my doctor won't give me a prescription.  I am actually going in again this week to get another test done.....  Fingers crossed!!!!<br/><br/>Anyway, I decided to take matters into my own hands with this thyroid support supplement from Zhou Nutrition. I chose this particular brand after doing quite a bit of research and am happy to report that after only 10 days of regular use, I am already starting to notice a difference. Suddenly, I feel like I have more energy and I don't feel chilled anymore, even though we are in the midst of a cold spell where I live. I will continue to update my review as my condition improves with the use of this supplement
 Like many others' statements, I too have been suffering from unexplained weight gain, lack of energy, skin issues and hair loss. I had labs done and was told thyroid was "within normal range" I had very high hopes for this product after reading so many positive reviews. Unfortunately, this supplement is not for me.  Beginning with the first dose (I took 2) I have been plagued by unbearable headaches.  I increased my water intake thinking that might help.  On 4th day, I only took one tablet, headaches continued.  By 10th day, I decided it must be due to this supplement, as headaches are not a usual occurance for me.  I stopped taking them 2 days ago and have not had a headache since.  I am disheartened as I was really hoping this supplement would be beneficial to me, however it was not.  I am ecstatic for those that have had positive experiences with this, but I will not be taking them anymore.
 I've dealt with thyroid issues for most of my life, and I've learned a lot about what the thyroid needs for proper function. This product provides the vitamin, herbal and mineral support that is needed for consistent thyroid health. Along with the minerals Zinc, Copper, Iodine, Magnesium, Selenium Manganese and Molybdenum, it provides Vitamin B-12, which is often low in people with thyroid disorders. Cayenne pepper helps to increase a sluggish metabolism, and Ashwaghanha provides a soothing anti-inflammatory effect.<br/>  As I've spent many years studying herbs and nutrition, I was excited to receive a sample bottle for review purposes. Supplements can vary in quality, so I was careful to make sure that this product has the USA and GMP factory seals. Well made product!
 I began taking this product the same week I begin taking the 1 Body Adrenal Support-Cortisol manager, I believe the ingredients in both this product and that product go very well together to help me regain and maintain energy. I will be copy and pasting the same review on the other product mentioned in this review, I will definitely be buying both of these products again! This product came with an offer to receive a free bottle through their website, I have not taken them up on their offer yet, but will be soon.
 So I want to start out by saying I actually don't have a thyroid. At 22 years old I had a goiter and had to go in to get an ultrasound, the ultrasound showed a nodule so I then had to go get a biopsy done and it came back with cancer! So, they moved fast to completely remove my thyroid. Before they removed it, it functioned "perfectly" words from my doctor. I had energy all the time even if I didn't sleep the night before. After getting it removed, not long until my energy was pretty much scarce to be found. I struggled with doing daily things like getting out of bed! I'm 25 now and so tired of having little to no energy! I have to take my thyroid meds every day! Well, I decided I'd add this to my daily meds, hoping maybe it could help make a difference. It did! After 3 days of taking it I noticed an energy jump where I didn't have to take 2 naps every day which is hard when you have 3 kids. I can go all day cleaning my house, taking care of my kids and gping to bed around midnight without feeling like I use to where I was the walking dead. I am so happy with this purchase! It has been a blessing! I would absolutely recommend it to others!<br/><br/>*I RECEIVED THIS ITEM FREE OR AT A DISCOUNT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY FAIR, HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW. ALL OPINIONS, THOUGHTS AND WORDS ARE MY OWN. I HAVE IN NO WAY BEEN COMPENSATED BY THE MANUFACTURER, DISTRIBUTOR OR ANY OTHER ENTITY BEYOND SAID DISCOUNTED OR FREE ITEM*
 I really wanted to like this and write a review about how amazing it has been, but it just hasn't.  I haven't had any negative side effects from it, but haven't felt any different since starting to take it daily a few weeks ago.  I'm sure it's not hurting, but I can't justify purchasing it again without noticing some improvement in my energy levels or ability to focus.  Disappointed, but will continue my search.<br/><br/>Update 2/272/2018:<br/>Wow!  I may not have been impressed with the product like I wanted to be, but I am incredibly impressed that I received a refund without having even asked for one as well as an offer to try another product of theirs free of charge.  This kind of integrity and business ethic is so rare anymore that I'm am truly shocked...and so grateful!  Thank you, Zhou Nutrition, for operating your business with such ethics!
 I have been taking this for four days and my main concern was to boost energy . The first and only effect I have experienced with this product is relaxation, a very Xanax induced calmness and ability to sleep through the night. After googling the ingredients it turns out that Ashwagandha is a very powerful anchient Asian herb used in reducing anxiety and depression. Now for all the reviews that have said that this supplement has given them and energy boost and focus I find extremely hard to believe. It's exactly like taking Xanax for me, it's a downer, it relaxes you, reduces anxiety and helps you sleep. Not sure if I will take any more as I do need to stay awake at work.
 Waste of money for me. I took it for the first time and it was too big. It got stuck in my throat. It was horrible! It took me days to get it down. I tried to open it and mix it with juice. The stuff on inside the capsule is not just spicy, but it hurt to try to drink it. I never took it again.
 Again, I thought I'd reviewed this already.  So - I got this product at a greatly reduced rate for trying it.  I am a regular vitamin taker, a 35 year hypothyroid/thyroid replacement taker. I did not notice a great difference in using this product as far as energy level or weight reduction.  I think the act of taking the pills themselves were a good reminder to eat better and be more active.  That said, do not take these on an empty stomach or before going to bed.  They are pretty potent and tended to give and after taste.  On an empty stomach and if lying down after taking them, I got heartburn - which I never suffer from.  Good luck in finding a healthy balance in your life.  These might be just the tonic you seek!
 It's rare I actually review something, but I had actual kidney pain and hematuria using this.  Couldn't figure out what was going on, went to doctor and was advised to immediately stop taking this supplement.  Threw the bottle out.
 Really wanted to like...just didn't notice any difference after a full month of taking pills :(<br/>Company followed through with money back guarantee though!
 I was diagnosed hypothyroid a few months ago. I was prescribed Synthroid and find that it seems to make me feel a bit fatigued and also cannot take the generic version. I decided to try this supplement to see if it would help with some of my symptoms. I am finding that it definitely has so far.
 I wouldn't write a review unless I was really  experiencing a difference. I was told I had a sluggish thyroid about 10 years ago. And for the last two years I have been feeling awful. Weight gain, depression, low-energy. I don't want to be on pharmaceuticals so I thought I would give this a shot. for the first for five days I felt terrible on the supplements. They made me very tired, and more depressed.  I decided to take them at night because I was sleeping so much during the day. Then eventually about a week into taking them I started to feel wonderful. I switch from night to day because I noticed I was waking at night on them. I haven't lost any weight,  But I feel a lot more energy. The best part about the supplements for me is that I am no longer depressed. I have been depressed for most of my life and I have tried many different antidepressants. I stopped trying pharmaceuticals and went for more natural things that have been more Helpful. I have never found another supplement that works on my depression as much as these do.
 I've been tested for thyroid issues in the past and they never found anything, however, they always came back to it matching all my symptoms. I finally decided to try something. After researching many products, I found this one. It took about  3 days for me to notice a bit of a difference ( I was quite skeptical) but after about a week, my energy was definitely coming back. I did lose a bit of weight, but attribute that to the raise in energy. My moods are also much calmer. So far, so good. I will continue using and highly recommend to at least try if you think you may be having (even slight) thyroid issues.
 JOKE
 I changed my rating from 2 stars to 5 as without prompting or request, the founder of Zhou Nutrition quickly provided a full refund for this product, and sent an email of apology about this issue. This company has proven to have phenomenal customer service and while I did not have success with this Thyroid Support, I am confident that other people will.<br/>I am truly thankful for the prompt and considerate response on behalf of this company. I would absolutely recommend Zhou Nutrition to other people.
 I had noticed some mild symptoms associated with thyroid issues. I have been eating healthy but my metabolism seemed pretty slow, I've also noticed some hair and skin changes as well. I already take a probiotic each day but once I added the thyroid support I started to notice a change in my symptoms. My skin had developed an orange peel texture in the T zone area of my face and after a few weeks I've noticed the inflammation is disappearing. My metabolism is back on track and I feel great, have lost one jean size.
 Honest review. I Tried 1 bottle and did not feel a difference, I kept taking my RX levothyroxine as well. Because of the reviews I will try maybe about 2 months of it and see what it does.
 This Thyroid support,  along with all of the other products made by Zhou are top notch. My son first did research and was so pleased with their products.  It's not just the product you take,  it is about the ingredients used and how they are processed.  We feel confident when taking Zhou products.  We can both feel a difference with them.  We use this thyroid,  Ceylon,  horney goat weed, dhea, &amp; water pills. (Only I use the water pills lol) they also give quantity discounts!  That is awesome! We love these products and would encourage our friends to use it too!
 I purchased the product, and it didn't work for me, so Zhou Nutrition refunded my whole purchase.  WOW!  While this particular product didn't work for me, I would not hesitate to try other products from Zhou Nutrition.<br/><br/>Their customer service is TOP NOTCH!  I'm so impressed with how caring this company is.
 I have been having issues that relate to thyroid but I would prefer not to be on any medication. I have been taking the Thyroid support for about  2 weeks and I can definitely tell it is working. I am not feeling as tired, sleeping better and my nails are even better.
 I have been purchasing this product for a couple of months, it is very helpful for maintaining my weight, health and energy.<br/>I am feeling much more energetic since taking these capsules.<br/>I am taking both capsules in the morning, as was recommended by other reviewers.<br/>It did take almost a month to feel consistently more energetic.<br/>I am so impressed with my energy level after getting on this.<br/>I just wanted iodine, but decided on this one instead and I'm glad I did.<br/>I've already bought a bottle for a friend.
 This was a very interesting experience.<br/>I decided to look for some energy boosting vitamins and saw this as #1 suggestion. After about 2 weeks I realized that I am not sleepy and tired during the day and do not need to nap anymore. This was a very nice change because now I could do so many more things during the day than I used to.<br/>Definitely recommend giving it a try if you like me experiencing low energy and sleepiness during the day.
 I've been taking these supplements for 2 weeks now and the only thing I'm experiencing is extreme flatulence. I have noticed zero improvement in mood, energy, and weight loss. I'm very bloated and experiencing stomach problems. It also affected my menstrual cycle, I've been bleeding for almost 2 weeks now with no sign of it stopping.
 I have only been taking this supplement for two weeks but I have noticed improved energy levels. I tend to get very tired in the afternoon and usually require a few cups of coffee to make it through the day but lately I have been able to skip the coffee and feel fine. An added bonus of this is that I sleep better especially since I no longer have to caffeinate in the afternoon. The supplement is somewhat pricey so I took one star away but its cost would not prevent me from purchasing the product again. I would recommend this to anyone who might have a sluggish metabolism or anyone who may need a little extra clean energy to help sustain them throughout the day.
 Made me feel awful. Constant headache, gave me a sore throat and upset belly. Even tried taking just one a day, but still made me feel off. Not taking anymore.<br/>Edit: after writing my review, I was contacted by the customer service and was issued a refund. It is very appreciated, as I really wanted to try something to help. Thank you.
 I started taking these about a month and a half ago. I have hypothyroidism and while all my tests says it is regulated I wasn't feeling like myself. More specifically I was tired ALL the time, no matter how much sleep I got. When the doctor told me my thyroid meds were at the right level I knew I needed to try something else to help with my exhaustion. It doesn't happen right away, but I would say I have felt a noticeable difference in my energy levels. It's been an improvement and I can't be more happy about it! I plan to keep using these!
 Ive been taking this (4) days now and have noticed no results at all.<br/><br/>I am using this for focus/weight loss as it states. I will post an updated review around the one week mark.
 Great supplement. If you need extra energy boost then this is it. I have been taking it twice a day. In the morning and evening some time before my workout. So far i noticed improvements in my rep count.
 Didn’t know you aren’t suppose to take with prescribed Synthroid medicine. Don’t recall the description telling me that either. Costa too much to return too.
 I have been using this product for just under a month, but already I have noticed a change in numerous things: my mood, my weight, my alertness, and maybe I'm just hoping here, but the amount of hair on the top of my head.  The hair thing was the not the reason I even bought the product in the first place, which had originally been a supplement to my workouts with the intended purpose of losing a bit of weight.  But, I have noticed that my energy level has increased, and now I am awake from sun-up to post sun-down, no naps, no rest time needed.  My kids are enjoying the benefits, that's for sure.  No more "sitting around daddy."  I've gotten everything I wanted out of this product, and I will be a return customer.  Thank you Zhou.  Keep it up!
 I was hopeful these would give my thyroid the boost it needed. I couldn't really say that they helped or hurt. I didn't notice a difference one way or the other.
 Second day taking these and I feel horrible. I have a horrible head ache, dizzy and a bit jittery. I wasn’t expecting this feeling at all!! I was so looking forward to trying these after reading all these great reviews but i guess they are not for anyone../
 I actually think these were working but they gave me immediate terrible constipation that took days to resolve. I gave them a second chance and the same thing happened. Unfortunately I won’t be able to finish them.
 I’m just starting to add this to my morning routine, i will admit i am still in the first stages of seeing a change. But I overall have been having any negative side effects and i am excited to see what is to come. The pill is a little larger.
 I started taking this twice a day and I first noticed that my metabolism was running a lot more efficiently. I normally have a hard time losing weight even when I'm cutting my calories way back and while I'm taking this I am actually able to lose weight with dieting. I also feel a lot less sluggish/tired. I forgot to take this supplement for a few days while I was out of town and I noticed that I was a lot more tired and just felt less like myself all around. When I was back on the supplement, I felt better. For me, this is a daily must-have!
 I was given this product for free in exchange of an honets review. I order this for my mom, she wont be seeign her doctor for another month I will be writing back with feedback from my mo and her doctor. Packaeage looks legit, looks good is a big bottle
 After trying many different supplements and diets, I am so pleased with this thyroid support blend.  It makes me feel alert and energized without any jitters or crashing.  I forgot it on vacation and after 2 days could really tell the difference.  This has become a staple in my supplement line up!!
 Friend recommended me to try and so far ok. It help my fatigue after taking it, but didn’t help me loose weight. I have hypothyroidism.
 Didnt help improve my thyroid function.  If anything my thyroid was worse.
 I noticed absolutely no difference in taking this supplement. Really was a waste of money.
 I have been taking this and feel a lot better. I notice I am also starting to lose some weight I initially gained after being diagnosed with hypo/hoshimotos. I don't feel as lethargic and miserable, it seems to be helping me get my groove back. I take this along with the Energy &amp; Focus supplement and now I feel like a whole new person in comparison to the sleeping every chance I got/ mood swings.
 Amazing! I've had thyroid problems since I was 19 and I don't feel like prescription medicine works. So I decided to try this and definitely felt a difference! I love the ingredients too!
 I have tried every supplement on the market for energy &amp; mental clarity with little to effect. After taking Thyroid Support for about a week, I noticed a huge difference! Even more so when I ran out. I highly recommend this product@
 No matter how much sleep I was getting I was always dragging through the next day! I searched the way I had been feeling &amp; underactive thyroid popped up so I figured since this is an all natural booster for your thyroid, I might as well give it a shot! Glad I did, I'm finally feeling awake &amp; alert throughout my day, especially in the mornings! I take it right away in the morning with a full glass of water before getting ready for work &amp; I'm focused all day! It's made a big difference in my days, especially my work days. I will continue to use this product!
 I have tried several products to promote prostate health. Many of the products have cost me three times as much as this one. After using this product for about ten days I noticed a significant reduction in my need to get up during the night for bathroom runs. This product really works and I've tried just about all of them. Purchase with confidence!!
 Is this what normal feels like??? I absolutely love this stuff! If your suffering from fatigue or low thyroid hormones you will love this stuff! I honestly forgot what it felt like to breeze through the day and not get so completely exhausted by 2pm that I needed a nap. Highly recommend!
 Not real strong for me. I took this because my other brand was out.
 I've felt much better once taking this supplement. It's great because you get all the necessary thyroid management components in one easy supplement.
 After about one week of daily use, I did see a marked improvement in my targeted symptom. For the longest time, I've had the issue that, no matter how much sleep I got, I still woke up exhausted and craving more sleep. My therapist suggested that it could be a thyroid related issue, so I decided to try your product, since my thyroid had been checked twice within the last five years, revealing no issues
 Getting older and needed a boost. This helped!
 I've been taking thyroid medication for hyperactive thyroid for about 4 months and started taking this supplement about 15 days or so. Feel pretty good so far and no negative side effects! I take it in the morning with breakfast and that seems to work well. Can't wait to see the long term effects!
 I did notice better focus and felt more energy but put on 4 pounds in a week so stopped using it. I thought it might help my levels that are never right with my hashimotos but I can’t risk gaining even more weight.
 gave me a headache..
 Whew! After two days of taking these, I am dizzy, my head hurts, I am exhausted and have alot of pain, especially in my low back. I bought these at a grocery store but I am going to try to get a refund.
 I think it’s working?, only been a month.
 My dr has told me that i needed to start taking thyroid medication. I hate taking prescription drugs, asked her if i could find something more natural. This product has helped control my thyroid, my dr is very excited and so am i. All natural.
 Great quality product, I really think it makes a difference in how I feel.  I've reordered several times from this company and plan on reordering again.
 So far I like this supplement. I feel better and more energetic, and I haven’t had any side effects. I’m only towards the end of my first month taking it, so we’ll see how I feel after taking it awhile longer.
 It made me very sick.
 Zhou Thyroid Support has really helped me since I started taking it. My hypothyroidism has made me feel sluggish and depressed but I feel much better now. I hope that my next bottle will help even more.
 I had been having some dizzy spells, but after taking these for a couple of weeks, they are gone!
 This product was wonderful, I have always had a little thyroid imbalance and this has allowed me to lose a little excess weight without thyroid getting in the way!
 Definitely felt an improvement in my mood and sleep patterns as well as overall energy levels. Didn’t help with my weight though which was what i was hoping for after reading other reviews as it’s what i am struggling with the most.
 I was very disappointed to discover this product contains SOY even though that was not disclosed in the product description.  Most people with thyroid issues are advised to avoid soy products as it can interfere with medication. Unfortunately I opened it and took one before I noticed.
 Good product. I noticed after taking it for about a week that my normal fatigue was much less severe. Ive now been taking it almost a month and have felt great.
 Wonderful product. Easy to take and works well
 I like this product. It seemed to work - although I would like to use it longer to be sure!<br/><br/>http://chickensbunniesandhomeschool.blogspot.com/2015/04/natural-thyroid-support-supplement.html
 I have been taking these for a about 3 weeks know, I have had my thyroid removed and take replacement hormone for life, I feel like my energy level is up which is good because I always feel tired . So I give it a 5 star.. I am liking it alot. I was given these free thru amazon to try their product So thank you for the product.
 This helped with my focus and energy, but if I take it at night I have problems sleeping.
 Didn't see any weight loose, but I can sleep much better than before. SO I am still taking it daily. Hopefully  Ican see weight loose in the nearly future.
 I really wanted to like these and was hoping it would help. Unfortunately after finishing the bottle, i've noticed no difference :/
 Product is great!  Give me energy!
 The package arrived in a timely manner and was wrapped very well. I have used this product for a while and I am thrilled with the reaults. I am no longer tired. I have so much energy. Taking this product keeps me off prescription medication. Very pleased.
 This product is wonderful. Before I had many days with a foggy brain and I found it hard to focus at work.  Not anymore! Now I feel like like my old self and I feel like I am getting what I am needing for my thyroid condition.
 I have had great success with Zhou products
 Wonderful customer service and great products
 Feeling better after taking supplements for three weeks now. More energy, less head fog. Hoping to feel better as I continue supplements.
 *Edit* although I saw no results in my energy levels, this company has amazing customer service. And I must applaud them for that.
 I've taken this thyroid support for two months now. Two pills every night before bed. I feel rested &amp; ready to go in the morning. Not sluggish anymore. I feel my digestive system is now working how it should. Will continue to buy this product.
 Great product.....I can feel the difference when I take this regularly. I suffer from hyperthyroid and like to take more natural products and this has worked for me :-)
 I just started taking this product.  The change for the better has been dramatic.  I feel more energetic, clearer in mind and am able to lose weight more easily.  Clearly, Zhou Nutrition knows its stuff!
 I was not sure these pills were making a difference until I stopped taking them for a few weeks. I felt listless and had no energy. After a week back on them, my energy is up and my outlook on life is back to upbeat, energetic, and normal!
 I've been taking this product for nearly a month now and I'm not disappointed. I noticed a difference in my energy level within 1-2 weeks. This product is effective, just give it time to take it's course.
 At first I was skeptical of this product, as I have tried others without much success. However within the first week of taking Thyroid Support, I started to feel better, had more energy, &amp; am less moody. I've even lost 6lbs! I'm finally starting to feel like my "normal" self! Thank you!!
 Two words. BUY IT.<br/><br/>You’re welcome.
 Amazing product....... Wil continue to use forever has made such a difference in my skin and hair loss.... and lots of energy
 I've been taking this for almost a month and I feel so much better. My tests for thyroid problems were negative but I have all the symptoms. Will be continue to take.
 This product is what it claims to be. I am very happy with the service. Very polite and fast delivery. So far so good. I like it so much that I have already ordered a second bottom. Thank you for your excellence.<br/>Sincerely... Cathy
 No
 No side affects to date. Have been taking for almost 3 weeks.  No weight loss either.  Seem to have more energy.
 So much more energy now. I can actually get through a day at work without feeling like I need a nap.
 Just started taking this 2 weeks ago and can already tell a difference in my energy. I will definitely continue using this
 So far I feel the difference since I took this vitamin and I started two weeks ago. I feel a lot more energetic and healthier.
 AWESOME! I feel more energized and happier. I love it. Knew I had thyroid issues; it just didn't show up in my tests. This is the treatment I needed
 Awesome product. Great customer service!!
 I feel like I have a little more energy in the afternoons while I am taking this.
 Easy to use, just once a day. Glad to have all the support I can get.
 Review for Zhou Nutrition, Thyroid Support with Vitamin B-12<br/><br/>**Note: I was given a sample of this product and asked to write a review of my opinion of the product**<br/><br/>Suggested Use: (2) Capsules daily preferably with meal or as directed by a healthcare professional.<br/><br/>Full disclosure, I have Hashimoto's Disease, which is a thyroid disease.  Though I am not on prescribed medication for my condition, I do have obvious signs of thyroid disease, such as low or nonexistent metabolism, low energy, and even problems with focus and memory at times.  I should also note that I have not had any of my thyroid or other panel levels tested since trying this product so my review of this product is based solely on my person feelings / experience after taking it.<br/><br/>I prefer natural health care verse prescription treatments when possible.  So I was excited to try this product.  After receiving my bottle of Thyroid Support I read the back panel for any “red flags” so to speak.  It should be noted that this product contains Iodine, Shellfish, Selenium and Cooper.  Though I have no issue with any of these products personally, the health profession jury is still out on them.  However with that said, the dosages that these are presented in this product are both within all general recommended standards, unless you have a known allergy.<br/><br/>Now for the meat of my review…I really like this product.  I take a daily multi-vitamin and higher levels of vitamin D and vitamin B12 then most and I still have struggled with energy and mental focus.  I noticed the difference with this product within days of taking it.  I also noticed the drop off when I stopped taking it.  I didn’t notice any bad effects from this product other than, as I said the obvious noticeability when I stopped taking it.  This is a product that I will be ordering for myself now that my trial sample is completed.<br/><br/>http://reviewedbycresroller.blogspot.com/
 Great! Felt like I had more energy and helped me drop a few pounds too.
 This product works great I felt less tired and sluggish. No side effects at all
 Since I started using Thyroid support I have more energy and I sleep better.
 I feel better<br/>My metabolism seems better from using it
 Excited to have finally found something that helps my energy and focus!
 Felt improvement after taking a few days.
 I'm trying this as a supplement in conjunction with my synthetic thyroid as my doctor likes to keep me on the very low part of "normal".  I'm hopeful it will help.
 I have more energy and I can sleep all night!!
 -- Not sure if this actually works.  The bottle is very modern and I love Zhou's label design, but after using this for over a month (my second time using), I am not sure there are any benefits.<br/>-- Will probably not repurchase.
 Came recommended by my Nutrition Coach!
 I am so happy I putchased this. It has done wonders.
 This supplement really helps me feels better
 Still taking my first bottle, but I like the natural blend of vitamins and herbs. Hoping it will help with metabolism and the pills are not hard to swallow.
 This product works well with my regular thyroid medication.
 Does what it says it’ll do.
 Seems to help
 This product is amazing!  I got my thyroid checked at the end of September and started taking this product.  I just got my thyroids rechecked last week (early November) and my thyroid has improved by.5! It has helped me to feel less sluggish and has given me some more mental clarity as well!  I am very pleased!
 I fill with more energy have lost a few pounds
 I love it!!
 Great product!!!
 This contains soy, and soy is terrible for your thyroid! Seems counter productive if you ask me.
 am starting to feel better already
 Great product!
 ok
 This has been fantastic support to my regular med.  I have noticed a difference in my brain fog and mental alertness.  Makes my days a lot easier.
 A natural, holistic way to deal with prostrate health.
 Great results with this product where my energy has increased! Highly recommend!
 Great company and great product
 Good product
 Didn't notice any difference at all.
 Help feel better
 I have hypothyroid, mine is considered dead. Is this item to help me
 It made me feel better. I know what I was missing now.
 Didn’t work..... upset that I expected it to work, was really hoping, been dealing with weight issues for a while and though this was my ticket out of that problem.
 Do not take Iodine if you have Hashimoto's Thyroiditis. It is contraindicated.
 REALLY DIDN'T NOTICE A CHANGE!
 I have been faithfully taking this product and can tell I have more energy &amp; hormonal issues not bothering me like they used to. Added benefit is I have asthma &amp; ingredients in this have helped with this as well! Will keep taking this product!
 I’ve been going through an energy drain for years.  I’ve been tested multiple times for possible illnesses  but each time my doctors tell me all is normal and specifically nothing wrong with my thyroid, though it seems I have almost all the symptoms of an under active one.  It gets worse every year but every test shows normal levels of everything.  My energy and metabolism boosting vitamins recently underwent a formula change and I’ve been desperate to find something to give me the energy needed to get through the work day.  I tried new vitamins, ginseng, acupuncture, an new herbal booster that was highly recommended, but nothing changed.  Based on the reviews, I decided to try this, but based on my history, I stayed skeptical.  I felt nothing on days 1 or 2.  On day 3, I experienced only a very slight energy improvement.  On day 4, it kicked in and every day since, I’ve been seeing more improvement.  I used to need a full cup of coffee, 12-16oz of diet coke and 3 mugs of green tea throughout the day in order to just complete an 8-hr shift.  I’m only on day 8, but I no longer need this amount of caffeine.  ½ cup of coffee seems to be enough.  I continue to drink tea for the health benefits but don’t feel the slump if I skip the tea.  It’s so nice not to have that urgent need for caffeine.  I’m sleeping really well and am fully alert in the mornings even before my coffee.  I’m more active in the evenings so walking my dogs has become fun again and after the walks, I find myself cleaning, vacuuming and just naturally finding things to do to keep my body moving.  Nothing dramatic, but I’m not just poured out on the couch in front of the TV like I was just a couple of weeks ago.  I don’t feel that caffeine high, but I’m able to focus on my work whereas before I was struggling to stay focused and was starting to miss deadlines because I just didn’t want to deal with things.  I’ve also notice an improvement with my mood.  Not super giggly happy but just a general feeling of well being.  I take one pill in the morning with food and another at mid-afternoon.  It’s only been a week so I’ll update this post when I’m a little further along.
 I have had celiac disease for a few years now and I always thought it was what was making me feel so sluggish all the time. For the last two years I felt like I was running on 50% energy, if that. I'm 25 years old, visit the gym daily, eat healthier than most, I juice fruits and veggies daily. I should have been in excellent health but still felt drained all the time. I was notorious for napping once, sometimes twice a day. A co-worker of mine suggested I look into thyroid problems, so I did some research, talked to my doctor and found that I am more susceptible to thyroid problems because of a lack of immune response caused by the celiac.<br/><br/>Upon searching for thyroid vitamin supplements I found this product. It had excellent reviews and it wasn't too expensive. I figured I'd give it a shot, just to see if it made any difference. Used amazon prime and got it in two days.<br/>Took one capsule immediately. Having experience in the field of psychology I was very aware of the placebo effect so I remained skeptic of any immediate sensations. After a couple of hours there was no doubt that I was feeling exponentially better than I had. My body no longer hurt, the sluggishness was gone, I didn't feel weak anymore. I doubled my work out time and still didn't feel exhausted afterwords. It was a night and day difference.<br/><br/>I've been taking one tablet twice a day for about a week now and my life has changed dramatically. I've gone fro 0 to 60 in a matter of days, my energy is back and better than before. I hadn't realized just how foggy my mind was until I started taking this supplement. I was in a constant depressive haze, when I didn't have work I spent hours laying in bed drifting in and out of sleep, unable to muster up the energy to enjoy my life.<br/><br/>Having no experience with any similar products I cannot say that this product is one of a kind, although I can say that it reacted extremely well to my body and produced amazing results. I urge you to do your research too, but upon reading these reviews I think you will find it obvious that this is a superior product for those with thyroid issues.
 I started this a couple months after I was told that my thyroid levels were low and needed medication to help raise them. I was still feeling sluggish, tired, no energy and having a hard time stopping the weight gain that is associated with this diagnosis. This supplement helped me stabilize this and give me more energy as time went on. Recommend trying this!
 I tried this several months ago.  I really like the increased energy and lost about 10 lbs.  When it came time to reorder,  I found another thyroid brand with a cheaper price.  They're all the same right? Um..no.  I gained the weight back and I was back to no energy again.  I won't be trying another brand again.  I highly recommend this brand.
 I love this, gives me energy and helps with brain fog.
 As usual this company doesn't disappoint. It clears the head from all the anxiety and thoughts.
 I love how this wakens me right up. I can tell when I do not take it and make sure I take it as soon as I can. I am definitely sleeping better, I am more energized in my day to day and I feel so much better. My doctor put me on Synthroid for my thyroid and the side effects were horrible. So I bought this to try it and it is so much better than I expected. My only tip is to make sure you take with a meal. I did not do that one morning and it made me very jittery! I know it is not a hormone replacement, but I feel better than I ever did.
 I have hoshimotos thyroiditis and have been on the same does of synthroid since I was 18 (currently 28). I've been having hypothyroid symptoms the past 2 years but my tsh is "fine" So no changes to my treatment have been made. I'm exhausted and frustrated so my dad originally ordered this for me to give it a shot. I was willing to try anything and glad I did. I'm not going to lie, I haven't had some of the incredible results described in other reviews but I've noticed a difference in mental clarity and energy levels. I'd sum it up this way: I can't always tell a difference when I take it, but i can definitely tell a difference when I don't. This is my 3rd bottle and will continue to purchase. I also like that they're capsules  (large, like a vitamin) and there's no weird taste that ends up "burping up" later. Will continue to take/purchase
 I have been using this for 11 days. I am a great deal overweight, which I know is probably the main reason for my lack of energy. However, I am pretty active seeing that I have a 2 year old and work at a home improvement store. No matter the diet I follow I suffer to lose weight ever since I had my gallbladder removed. I started taking these and lost 4.5lbs in 3 days. I can't say that the pills caused the weight loss, but they definitely gave me more energy after about 4 days of taking them. It's completely different than energy pills or energy drinks. I wake up earlier, and go to bed drained due to being more active. I was doing clothes the other morning at 8am! These pills are my lifesaver. I'm no longer groggy and depressed. I feel like I did before I had my daughter.
 Struggled with hypothyroidism for over twenty years, probably more but it went undiagnosed. Had numerous heartbreaking miscarriages (twelve) and weight fluctuations during my lifetime and hypothyroidism was definitely one of the pieces to this puzzle. I started using this in late September 2017. I saw it on a lightening deal and started reading reviews honestly. It intrigued me and Im not one of those people to be intrigued by pills or “remedies”.  I had been taking prescription diet pills (two different types) which I had success with in prior years. However this time around I saw no results until I added this supplement. I am not grossly obese but wanted to lose about 30lbs and keep it off. Also I want to add: I’m not ever going to review something because I am paid to or get something free or discounted! Those reviews make me feel like I’m chasing my own tail- essentially they drive me nuts! So...moving along. As of today...I have dropped about twenty five to thirty pounds (maybe slightly more by now even no joke) by adding this to my diet and exercise regimen. I was spending about a hundred and fifty dollars a month just for my two prescription diet pills and thats with a manufacturer discount card-gulp! I have now stopped taking them and strictly use these. I found that if I take two in the morning and one on the afternoon that this works for me. I never feel hungry either! I still eat healthy as much as possible- salads mostly-but also exercise daily-lots of cardio when I can otherwise adding extra steps or stairs on days I have to skip workouts due to a crazy life. Long story short...I will never go without this again! I love it! I dont feel as tired or just plain out of it and lost those irritable days. I definitely feel more motivation and the craziest thing for me is my hair isnt falling out like it used to and I am coloring it monthly lately! I highly recommend this product! Zhou’s customer service is top notch too! I sent a message a couple weeks ago because my third bottle came and had some damaged pills which probably happened during shipping and they simply sent me a new bottle. I appreciate that because not many companies care about their customers once they get their money! Even twenty dollars a month is an added expense so this is important to me. Thanks Zhou for your service and excellent products! I also ordered the green tea last month but as of now I am not so sure I will take that daily as I was feeling headaches which may have been related to the added boost. It’s too soon to tell so I am NOT bashing that product! I just dont know if this was the cause but felt it was important to me tion because it was happening. Regardless, great products and I will continue to find a way to make them work for MY body. I recommend this product and you have nothing to lose by trying it. They have their money back guarantee so its worth trying it! It totally is working for me when nothing else does.
 I have bought a total of 6 of these but still no results what so ever... makes me suspicious of the reviews to be completely honest. I wanted to write a review after the first one but thought maybe I should trust the reviews and maybe I just need to try the product over a longer period of time instead of just one bottle in order to get the results people are talking about so I made sure I tried that before I gave it the bad review.<br/><br/>Maybe this will work for others or maybe the reviews are total BS but I can say it made absolutely no difference for me so I will not be buying any more going forward.
 I can't get over how well these work for me. For the last 2 years I have been rehabbing a sports injury. Normally I'm very active, healthy and heavy into roller derby, skating for fun and weight training. I've been a gym rat since I was 14. I'm 38 year old female. I never had weight issues. During those 2 years of rehab, I maintained my weight even at lower pace of exercise. I also received a serious of 13 steroid injections into my joints. I firmly believe these cortisone injections screwed me up. It's difficult to prove, because I didn't see my doctor for lab work until I had already been taking these pills for 2 weeks. I had gained 21lbs in 9 months- and no, I wasn't pregnant. My SI joint has been rehabbed and strengthened. I'm cleared by my sports doc to get back to it! Except... I had zero energy. I could muster up enough to go to the gym or work for a couple hours and then I had to lay down. It was bad, just unloading the dishwasher, I would have to lay down. I would go to bed early, sleep like a rock for 12 hours and still have to take naps to get through my day. I hated the way I felt. Sluggish and gross. My skin was dry, hair falling out, etc.<br/><br/>My diet has always been spot on, clean and balanced. I use food as my fuel and medicine, not an addiction like most Americans on SAD diets. Being a farmer, I raise and grow most of what I eat, organically. Clean.<br/>So why the sudden weight gain and lethargy? Hard to say for sure.<br/>But I'm 3 weeks into the bottle and my life has changed. "Feel like your old self again", is an understatement. I feel like a new and improved version of myself- I feel the way I have always wanted to feel. The energy, focus and stamina. I get so much done during the day. No jitters, no side effects. I can literally feel the weight flying off of me, just from resuming my active life again. On my second week on the Thyroid Support, I had labs done. My doctor called and said all of my labs are stellar. He said he hasn't seen anything so perfect in a long time. Cholesterol, liver and metabolic panel, stellar. I don't think I can attribute my good labs to the thyroid support, but I do know, this stuff works!
 Zhou supplements!! I have been using supplements my entire bodybuilding days. I don't recommend many products , but this stuff is the truth! It took a few days to really load up in my system but once it did it was an amazing clean energy all day long. 5 stars Zhou!! I am a customer as long as your company is around. Can't wait to try out more of your products! Very interested in the boost elite for testosterone boosting and well as your energy supplement. Again awesome job with Thyroid Support.
 I have been taking these for three days and I am barely able to stay awake after taking them. I hoped it would get better, but no luck. I'm glad it worked for so many people - but these are not for me!
 I've been taking this and Water Away for the last 2 days. Even the first day was a huge difference. I actually got good sleep for the first time in weeks, my mood improved drastically, I woke up much easier, am more focused, and have energy throughout the day without jitters. Between this and Water Away I've lost 5 pounds in the last 2 days! Doctors have been trying to figure out what's wrong with my thyroid over the last few months and tests keep coming back normal or inconclusive. This product is the first thing to actually give me some help!
 I LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff.  I've been cold in my extremities for about three years or so now, give or take a year.  I know it has to do with my pre-menopause symptoms which started about six years ago.  I take Progresterone Cream to balance out the PM symptoms, but it made me go from having hot flashes to cold flashes (or at least that's what I called them).  However, it was worth the cold flashes if it meant I could sleep and not be totally pissy on a daily basis.<br/><br/>Like many other people that left reviews here, I also got my thyroid tested because I couldn't lose weight, and my doctor also told me I was fine.  But when I found this product and read the reviews, I realized I had all the same symptoms as everyone else.  So I ordered them and began taking them once a day.  (I would have done it twice a day, but I always forgot to take them.)  The first two weeks I was on it, I didn't notice any cold flashes, but I thought it might have to do with it being warmer than normal where I live and me traveling to Arizona during that two weeks (which happen to fall in June).  However, as soon as I got back, I forgot to take them one day and by the afternoon, I felt like I was chilled to the bone.  Not even cuddling under the blanket was enough, and it was 77 degrees in my house.  I took a hot bath and while in the bath, I suddenly remembered the supplements.  I have been on them ever since and I now take two at once in the morning to make sure I get enough, and I haven't been cold since.  In fact, I've been quite warm and the temp in our house has stayed around 75.<br/><br/>As for weight loss, I don't know if it's helping or not.  I'm taking supplements for weight loss that I know have been helping me lose weight, and that was before I started taking these.  Still, I'm more awake when I take these and focused, and I love that I'm no longer cold.
 I have been taking these for about a year now and I look and feel like a completely different person. I did not really notice a difference at first, but since I had set up auto-delivery for the discount, I kept taking them as part of my morning routine. I never noticed any negative side effects, but after about 1-2 months everyone around me noticed the weight loss.  At 40, I had just assumed that weight gain and aches &amp; pains were a part of getting older. I was always active, but as I started to slim down, I increased my workout. It is very rewarding to see that the hard work is paying off.  After about 4-5 months, I had lost over 40 pounds and gone from a size 14 to a size 4. The changes were so dramatic, I went in for a full physical to make sure there weren’t any underlying health issues (none were found). People at work stop me all the time wanting to know what crazy diet I found. I did not really change my diet. I still eat a burger and fries at least twice a week and pizza every weekend. I do exercise more, but mostly due to an increase in energy. I have analyzed my eating habits and exercise routine in an effort to better understand why I lost the weight, but the only consistent change has been this supplement. I have kept the weight off for over 6 months and I feel years younger.
 Can't say as I notice any difference.<br/>Updated 5/3/17 - After receiving a personal email from the company, I feel badly for only giving them 3 stars initially.  Their customer service is top notch!  They truly believe in their product and they try to provide the best experience for their customers. I will order another month to see if it helps more. I realize all people's bodies are different. Thank you for caring about your customers and I really appreciate the excellent customer service.
 I lost five pounds so far but I also started taking fiber pills and changed my diet with these. I agree with other reviews when it comes to the happy feeling I don't know why that is but I do feel more chipper on these. Even though I haven't lost tons of weight I do believe they've taken part in keeping me from gaining any more which before no matter what I ate the pounds slowly kept stacking up. So I'm happy with them and will buy more. I have these a few weeks before I wrote this review.
 First I want to clarify I did NOT receive this as a promotion.  I found it on Amazon and bought it.  My story: Ever since i hit puberty I have been very large woman. I have been on every diet, every exercise plan out there.  I have had several thyroid test done by my Primary Doc and nothing ever showed up. I eat normal with normal activity,  Last year i hit 400 lbs, i went to a weight loss clinic to get some Phentermine (becuase my Primary refuses to perscribe this to me of her own belief that all i need to do is eat healthy) anyway, Phen works for me, i can drop weight fast with Phen, but of course when i stop it comes back when i stop. During this visit to the clinic they ran a blood test that is more thorough then the ones most Primary Doctors run and found my Reverse T3 level is inactive. So they put me on Phen and a thyroid support.  Weight Loss clinics always want you to come back once a week, i dont have time or the money to pay 25 a week to them so i read reviews on this Zhou and said what the heck! Lets try it.  When i ordered this i also ordered Apple Cider Vinegar vitamins and Milk Thistle and started taking all 3 in the morning.  3 weeks later I am down 3 lbs and I did not change a thing I was eating or any activities. Normally I can gain 10lbs a month.  Honestly I have to eat healthy and exercise just to maintain 350 lbs!!! I do not know if its all 3 combined or just this thyroid support that has helped but i am not stopping any of them!!!  Good luck to everyone i know the struggle is real, especially when you know you are eating less then your 150 lb friends and gaining weight, something is wrong and nobody believes you.  I bought this when it was 21.00 now its like 96.00 Amazon needs to get there act together!!
 I started taking these two days ago and I’m a little confused.... I do feel better as far as energy level but boy oh boy I need help with my bowel movements.... haven’t gone since I started... I was hoping this would help me in that department but as of today it’s making matters worse ...<br/><br/>Update... just weighed myself... gained e pounds ... I’m done with this stuff .... lowering my rating as well<br/><br/>Going to give it a couple if more days and see how it goes
 Didn’t work. Just gave me horrible headaches. I’ve been taking these for several days now but I will now stop. I wanted so badly to love them and I went in having complete faith, but the headaches are too much. I have not changed anything in my daily routine other than these so I know that they are not working out for me. Bummed :(
 I started using this product when I was 1st diagnosed with hypothyroidism. It works great in combo with my medication. I recently stopped using the thyroid support and immediately noticed my sluggishness and other symptoms returned! I love this product and definitely helps!!
 I am 77 years old with a family history of thyroid problems.  The majority of female members of my family have had their thyroid removed and are on meds.  I began having symptoms of thyroid dysfunction ( I am a nurse ) but did not want to subject myself to the surgery and having to take strong meds daily, so I decided to try this.  Hey !  It works !  My energy level is back; up, my hair is no longer thinning, and all symptoms of thyroid dysfunction have disappeared.  I could not be happier.  As an OR nurse for 35 years, my philosophy has always been that 'I DO the surgery, not HAVE the surgery'..........(smiling here) .  This item is truly wonderful.
 This supplement really makes a difference for me.  I have been using it for some months now and when i run out i just keep coming back to it.  I take an arsenal of supplements, all very specific, never really go for the supplements that have a bunch of diff stuff in them as my body will reject most.  I am very in-tune with and sensitive to listening to my body and i just cannot ever take an all inclusive supplement.  However! i feel that this particular thyroid supplement is just right for me.  I have, over time, taken the following as separate supplements; B12, iodine, magnesium (i still take that separately), zinc, selenium (acupuncturist's and natural dr's  have always energy tested me and my body was always in need of selenium), and then there are other items that are specifically good for the thyroid (and adrenals...etc) that i have also taken over the years like, schisandra, ashwagandha and kelp.  So to find such a nice array of supplements in one AND for my thyroid AND my body accepts it, i really liked that.  When i run out or stop taking it for a while i REALLY notice a difference.<br/>I take a lot of supplements and quite frankly i get tired of taking them now and again so i like to take breaks.  I have learned there are two things i cannot take breaks from and that is my supplements that affect my thyroid and adrenals.  I constantly struggle with my adrenals and with issues from my thyroid in particular like energy.  I take two caps and preferably in the morning as i get such a natural, consistent flow of energy throughout the day that if i take these too late in the afternoon i cannot sleep at night because my body just isn't ready for bed (and i'm talking about still not tired at 11:00pm).  So for me it allows me to be my normal energetic self throughout the entire day, right into the evening.  It helps with my mood as well, makes me feel like i want to tackle my day, it's like you get your drive for life back.  Does it help my hair, i have never been able to tell a big enough difference to comment on.  The other major thing it helps with is my cravings for carbs and my appetite, i'm not sure why it does that (have to do some research) but i generally do not eat sugar or carbs of any kind.  When i don't take this i feel like i am 'hungry for something' and when i do take it that feeling totally goes away.  Usually when i feel that hungry 'cannot get satisfied' feeling (which is different from a cannot get full feeling) i try to think back on which supplement i stopped taking for a while and sure enough, it's my thyroid supplement so then i immediately start back on it and am reminded of how i need to be consistent with taking this particular supplement because of the other benefit of energy.  For my body, what is interesting to me is that i can also get those same cravings and lack of energy, when my adrenals are off balance, stressed, that's why i must address both my adrenals and thyroid at the same time because they can affect each other. That's why i feel this is a perfect accompaniment to what i do for my adrenals because i can have the very same symptoms that result from under functioning thyroid AND adrenals.<br/>I just turned 49, am peri-menopausal (grandmother) and try to stay ontop of issues like, hormone inbalance, energy, nourished adrenals &amp; thyroid so  they function well, manage stress, and tons of powerful antioxidants along with high doses of Vit C as well as female issues as i get 'younger' (laugh - at least that's my mindset anyways).  I am not getting older i am getting better at taking care of myself as i turn another year, year after year!  This product is a staple in my supplement arsenal and i will continue to buy it.  I just bought my third bottle this week.
 I have been taking supplements for almost a month. I just order my second bottle.  It takes at least 3 months to fully see if all symptoms have improved. In just the few weeks I have noticed that my hair shed has lessen. I have more energy.  My sleep has improved. I do have more energy and no more brain fog. I am no longer cold all the time. I am able to sweat when I workout. I will get my labs done when I have finished my 3rd bottle. So far, I am pleased with the product. I will give an update once I finish my third bottle and get my labs  done.
 Love, love love this stuff. I do have a thyroid problem and I Take this 2 hrs after and it gives me energy ,I have less Cravings, I noticed I eat less. In all honestly I did not chance my diet at all ,but with less Craving i have lost 3 lbs(in a month),  I don't see it ,but my scale and friends/family definetly noticed..my scale has not moved in yrs. Haha. One  prob for me is 2 tablets, like it said on the bottle  makes me jittery . So I take one and it's perfect, and it lasts longer :) definetly I'll be getting it again.
 I must admit that I was very apprehensive about using this product.  However, after reading many of the reviews, I decided to give it a try.  I am elated that I did and the product really works.  I can get up and be energetic when I want to..and...at my leisure be able to rest without feeling the restlessness, anxiety, and overall mood irritability😇 YES!  When I want to!!  This product really works and you are hearing it from a skeptic.  Be sure to eat a little something before taking it as that can stop the jittery feeling that some of the reviews suggest.  Also, take only the amount that is recommended daily.  Really good 👍stuff !
 I was taking this daily for about a month and I ran out. I did notice that I slept better, and I had more energy, but I wasn't sure if it was in my heard or if Thyroid Support was making a real difference. When I did get a 2nd bottle, for no apparent reason I just didn't take it. I definitely noticed I don't sleep, and when I do sleep I don't feel rested when I wake, and I'm always tired. It took me a couple of weeks to figure out what changed. As it turns out, this does work! I've started taking in again and now I'm back to good sleep and energy throught the day. I don't know how I got along without this. I haven't lost any weight, but I will start an exercise program with all this extra energy I have.<br/>If you don't feel rested when you wake, and you have no energy I recommend this!
 Excellent product and amazing customer support/service. One of the best companies I have ever seen in terms of addressing product concerns and making sure customers are satisfied. My first bottle seemed to make me irritable but the second one had no such effect-unsure of the reason. I have left my original review below but changed my rating as I very satisfied with the purchase.<br/><br/>Angry?? Notice if this product makes you irritable or angry. I had to stop taking it after 3 days because I found it had a very clear affect on my frustration tolerance. I am not sure which ingredient might aggravate (pun intended) this effect but it was pronounced for me. I should note- I took nothing else-no other supplements that may have caused an interaction effect.
 I read a lot of reviews prior to purchasing this product. It had a lot of positive feedback from customers, so I was very excited. However, I've been taking this for 2 weeks now, and the only thing I have noticed is that I am more tired during the day. The main reason I got this was because the description said it would help you wake up with more energy and you would feel more rested, however, I don't have as much energy as before, and my focus and metabolism don't seem to have improved either. A bit disappointed, but I understand that there are a lot of factors that help this work, such as body type, exercise, and so on. Wish I had as good an experience as others here, but I guess not.<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/><br/>I was contacted by the founder of Zhou Nutrition and was given a refund for my purchase. I feel that my experience from this company is very valued, and that the customer’s experience is definitely the first priority. I have seen that their other products have been given great reviews, so I will try those out to see if they are better for my body type.
 I am female who has struggled with a slow metabolism, family history of thyroid issues, sluggishness, always tired, and hair loss. While these are classic symptoms of thyroid issues doctors have refused to give me medication to regulate my thyroid because I constantly bounce back and forth between normal and abnormal test results.  A few months ago, I took matters into my own hands and started this supplement.  After 10 days, I could really tell a difference in my sleep and energy levels.  After my third bottle, I could really feel the difference.  Now if I miss a dose, I feel sluggish all day, which I never want to happen again.  I recommend always taking this in the morning for day long energy.  After several months, I am symptom free and my hair has grown back.  I am a regular Amazon customer and I was NOT compensated in any manner for writing this review.  I just wanted others who have felt like me to known there is something more natural that works.
 I was really setting my hopes on this to increase my energy. I took it at the same time every day until I finished the bottle. The first five days were incredible, I really felt more energy and didn't even feel like taking a nap in the middle of the day like I usually do. After those first five days I started feeling like my normal, tired self again, despite taking the supplement at the same time every day. I wish this had worked better for me.
 I only have my right thyroid now since my left one was removed due to a neoplasm which cannot be determined whether malignant or benign.  After 2 years of not taking any thyroid supplements or thyroid medication, my TSH level went from 2.52 to as high as 6.27 and my doctor wanted me to start taking  levothyroxine in August.  I asked her to retake my blood samples after 2 months because I didn’t want to start taking medications, once you’re in it, you’ll have to take it for life.  Since August, I’ve been taking this thyroid supplement religiously every day and there are times where I can’t but resume it the next day or whenever I can.  My TSH level was rechecked in October and went back down to normal (2.91).  And again, after 2 months, I had my TSH level rechecked again (December), and it’s still normal (2.74).  I am happy with the results.  I do take Maca capsules along with this supplement.
 I have been taking the Thyroid Support Complex daily for the past month with a handful of other vitamins (some weight loss, some supplements) and daily yoga. And yes, i have lost weight! Thus far I can't say definitively if my metabolism or energy level has been boosted by this particular product, but I have had 0 negative side effects! The vitamins are not stinky like some others, and easy to take.<br/><br/>I will write more in a few months when I can properly identify the effects of this vitamin. i've been told it takes about 6 months to notice results with both supplements and prescriptions. no complaints so far!
 I have struggled with hypothyroidism for many years and have tried EVERYTHING--chiropractic, medication, supplements, dietary changes, etc. Some things have helped make life livable but I still have been looking for more help. When I saw this, I figured that the worst that could happen was that I was out $20 with no difference in my life. I didn't notice much of a difference until after about 2 weeks. One day I was at the gym and I didn't get exhausted, and even felt powerful at the END of my intense workout. I couldn't figure out what made the difference for a few days and then I had another excellent workout. Finally I realized that this supplement was the only thing different in my lifestyle. I have been taking if for 2 months now and it has been YEARS since I have felt this much like myself. My husband even notices a big difference. I haven't had the weight loss that some other users have reported, but I feel so much better than I've felt in years, so I'm still giving it 5 stars. I highly recommend this supplement! I have it on auto-ship now.
 I bought this product after I read so many positive reviews, I have grave's disease and have been very hard, specially after so many medications and so far I was feeling awful, I am glad I got this product because I start seeing improvements of myself such as energy and practically feeling alive. I still taking my meds but I also take this pills and has made a difference on my body, thank you for this product and I will be continue to order in the future
 I bought this product because it contains no soy in it. That was my main concern. Soy attacks the thyroid, and I sure don't need that. I take thyroid medication, but wanted a reliable supplement, so I found one that I thought would be perfect. Found out after purchasing, it had soy in it. I tossed it. This one, however, has all the ingredients I need. And no soy. Wonderful. On the first day I took this, I could tell a difference. I was in a much better mood, my mind seemed to be alert, and I felt 100% better. Yes, in just one day. I am going to keep buying these tablets, since they do what I need them to do.
 I bought this because of undiagnosed hypothyroidism. I've almost finished my second bottle,  and have lost  ten pounds with no change to my current diet, which is ketogenic. Before taking this supplement my weight loss was very sluggish, about 1.5 pounds per month, even with diet and exercise, and I suffer from numerous other hypothyroid symptoms. I thought I'd try supporting my thyroid function before going on heavy meds, and see if I can get my body working right naturally. So far so good! I'm not freezing anymore,  I'm actually heated up, have more physical and mental energy,  my skin isn't as dry, and I've lost a good chunk of weight. All I'm waiting for now is to make sure hair loss has slowed. I'll definitely keep buying this product,  and have already recommend it to a family member.
 My husband and I started taking thyroid support a few months ago, then added the energy and focus to the daily routine. We ran out of the thyroid support and noticed a huge decline in our energy and motivation. We got a new bottle and both have perked back up to our extremely motivated selves.  Just to give you a grasp... my husband would sleep until 10, 11am everyday and then take an hour to get up and going, now we take the supplement 1st thing in the morning (7am) and feel beyond ready for the day.  I have a very active career and his is full of focus... we seriously could not imagine our days without it. Also, neither of us have thyroid issues, it just gives wonderful healthy energy.
 I've been taking this consistently for 3 weeks.  The reason for my lack of energy is that I am Pre Lupus and perimenopausal. I felt like I "might be" feeling a little more energetic so I attributed it to the thyroid support but I still have VERY limited energy. I cleaned the house the other day and felt sluggish for a couple days.  In the past couple weeks I have felt like my anxiety has been worsening.  This is because of the heart palpitations and pounding especially at bed time.  (I take the supplement in the morning). But today it hit me!!! It's this supplement that is causing this symptom.  I know this because I'm very sensitive to everything.  I get heart palpitations from Ginseng and even just plain black tea.  Once I saw that this had added supplements like Ashwagandha Root I pretty much knew I was going to have problems but took it in hopes something would work.  I'm going to stop taking it.
 This has worked for me when nothing else has. I fell on the border and my doctor refused to give me any advice on something to help me and another doctor that my insurance don't cover told me about this so I've been using this for a month now I've got perk back, I'm feeling happier, more energy, not as tired, I sleep better I just feel better. This is now my second bottle I'll be a forever user of this product.
 This is my second time purchasing this item. I have noticed I am so much more energetic and able to think clearer and get things done. I will definitely continue to take this and recommend to anyone who feels fatigued, tired and like they just can’t get going like they used to
 I was a little weary of this product because it does contain a full daily value of iodine. I've had both my iodine and selenium levels checked. I'd also recommend a T3 check before starting this supplement, too. All of my levels were on the lower end with my T3 just high enough to be considered normal range. I feel so much more energetic when I take this. I'm sure it's because my t4 is converting to t3 better. This supplement is great! This is also the only formula I found with methylated B vitamins.
 I was so excited to try this product after all the reviews. I’ve been taking levothyroxine (synthroid) to treat my hypothyroid for over 15 years. I have also been off and on with Zoloft and Adderall to treat anxiety and my inability to focus.<br/><br/>It’s been just about a month since I started taking these pills (two every day in AM) and while I feel a little more regulated, I haven’t experienced anything too drastic. I don’t struggle as much waking up in the morning and I’ve been going to the gym 5x week. No weight loss but could be due to working out (fat converting to muscle). I do sweat more at the gym than I ever have before and I’m not always cold which is nice.<br/><br/>So far the changes, which are all positive, have been subtle. I look forward to continuing with this product to see if I notice anything else! Just ordered bottle #2!!
 I haven't quite finished my first bottle of this product, and due to taking many other supplements with some of the same ingredients, haven't even been taking the recommended dosage, but I can honestly state that, so far, I have definitely noticed an increase of energy, and focus. I have had my thyroid tested many times for a few yrs now, and although have had all the symptoms of a low thyroid, it has tested on the low side of normal. I decided to give this product a try, based on the many positive comments. I am happy to be able to add mine to the list. Have ordered my second bottle, and intend to take the recommended dosage, to see what happens.  Will update this in a mo. or so.<br/><br/>I am adding this update to my previous review, to say I have not only finished my second bottle but am now on my third, and will continue to be a regular customer, and advocate for this product. I stopped taking this prior to ordering the third bottle, to make sure that the energy And well-being I felt while taking this wasn't just "in my head ". Am happy to report that after just three weeks, I was more than convinced, at least in my case, that it truly helped.
 I've utilized several natural thyroid support products through the years. It's important in maintaining balance along the way as our bodies adapt to integrating light (ascension) and our thyroid is a huge part of the overhaul/cleansing process that occurs. I find that this supports my own Physical LightBody easily. Highly recommend to all that I teach and to those seeking natural thyroid support as the body upgrades at such a high rate now.
 I fall into the category of having many of the symptoms of hypothyroidism but it does not warrant prescription medication. I've found since I've been taking this product that I have more energy, I sleep more soundly, and it also helps stop a craving for sugars/carbs, which is helping in weight loss. I also like the fact that it's OTC. I've bought this more than once and intend to continue taking it.
 I have an over active  Tyroid  and it gives me the strangest feelings so next week I'm gonna be put on medication but for the meantime I need to ease the  symptoms. The first night I started taking these I could feel the  symptoms starting to fade especially my heart beat started to slow down a little and I could feel more relaxed. My  appetite  felt more under control and my  a anxiety tone down. It's great stuff and I was told I could still take it with my  regular thyroid medication.
 I’ve only taken the product for three days now. However, with each passing day I feel like my energy has gradually increased. The first day was barely noticeable, on day 2 I noticed my focus was higher than normal. Then today I felt amazing, my thoughts are clearer, I feel more focused than average, and I really do feel stronger than normal. I’m even driving faster because there’s this rush going on inside me that I haven’t felt in years.
 I normally don't leave reviews but this product really has impressed me. I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism and hashimoto's disease a few years ago. I take levothyroxine daily and still don't feel "normal" though my levels are "normal". This product has really made a difference for me. I take it about an hour or so after my levothyroxine and I have noticed more energy throughout the day! Not the energy drink/caffeine type of energy, but more of the "I dont feel like I need to take three naps a day" kind of energy. I also noticed it helps me digest food quicker as well and has reduced my appetite somewhat too. I will definitely continue taking this supplement! Great product!
 Well I didn't notice an improvement after finishing the bottle but I'm hoping that's because I need to address an underlying issue first. I did a lot of research before making this purchase and the ingredients and company are among the best that I've found so I don't want to jump to conclusions and discredit them. They have amazing customer service too so I definitely still recommend them!
 This product does work, and within an hour I am a diferent feeling person, for the better.  My body starts feeling great and my mood.  I wish I could take one pill a day, but my budget only allows one every other day, thus with that usage, it still makes me feel exceptional.  I take it in the morning, 30 minutes before any coffee or food, maybe with lemon water, and no other suppliments, so I have tested this for 3 months.  Fully recomend.
 Definitely staying on this, consistency is key.  I take 97.5 grains of Nature-Throid for over a year and also have been taking this product now for over three months and it is working! I have hypothyroidism (for 22 years) and totally disliked what synthetic meds were doing to my body. Understand that if you take synthetics, most work to assist thyroid hormone production where as the animal sourced product provides the hormone. The decision to change was one that I researched and thought out carefully not overnight.
 Well you guys, I can tell no difference after taking these for a month,.think I'll stick to my vit c &amp; Lysine regimen and exercise more, and hope for the best. Glad the thyroid support seems to help others as the reviews state. The delivery of the product wss fsst though.UPDATE-THEY REFUNDED MY $, DID'NT HAVE TO EVEN ASK. GLAD TO SEE THERE ARE COMPANIES THAT ARE TRUE TO THEIR WORD! CUSTOMER SUPPORT IS EXCELLENT. BECAUSE OF THIS WILL TRY THEIR OTHER PRODUCTS IN THE FUTURE.
 My thyroid has been ALMOST hypo. I'm unable to receive medicine because my levels aren't low enough by .02!!! Obviously just because it's in the normal range, didn't mean that it's normal or optimal for me. Normally, I can go to bed at 8pm.. Sleep in until 930 and STILL need a nap during the day. There's days I would be so tired it literally hurt to move...I've been struggling to keep off extra weight (I put on 15 pounds in the 2 months I was being tested for my thyroid)... I've gone through one full bottle already and can truly feel the difference! My energy levels are up..I can stay up later and wake up earlier and still get things done during the day! My head is more clear even (I get fog brained). I don't have a scale to notice a difference in weight.. But I do notice my pants fitting better as well :) all in all, it works wonders for me!
 I've for years struggled with issues that when you google all are Thyroid related, so each year at my Dr. appt they check my Thyroid and say it's ok.  After 4 years of constantly gaining weight, losing my hair and other issues, I decided to try this and see if it did anything.  I've been using this for about 3 months, and I feel better, have lost weight, my hands/feet aren't soo cold!  It's working for me so I'll continue it!!
 My doctor said my thyroid levels were high. She wanted me to start taking zinc and selenium (sp?). Seen the great reviews and thought I would give it a try. Very happy I did! I have been taking it for about 3 weeks (one a day) and will definitely order again. P.S usually I get the cheapest vitamins I can, now I know how "real" vitamins work
 This is the first thyroid support supplement that I have tried, and I am very happy with the purchase. I noticed an increase in my energy and mood almost immediately. I find that I am less hungry during the day and have a lot fewer cravings. I sleep much more soundly at night and have been able to remove the need for melatonin at night. The seller was very good and provided a lot of information for the supplement. Would buy again, highly recommend this product.
 Very pleased with the increased focus and energy this seems to provide both my wife and I.  Seems to give me more energy to keep on keeping on, without spikes and slumps like you get with caffeine.  My appetite is increased as much as my metabolism - noticably so, which may be a down-side for some but encourages me to eat more throughout the day which I need to keep me going on the farm.
 Likely not a typical result. I suffer from hypothyroidism and took this product and now have hyperthyroidism and also had a bad reaction where I began to sweat profusily and had a rapid heart beat...then began to get cold and clamy and had some signs of vaso restriction in my extremities...after a few minutes the symptoms subsided. Truthfully I think it reacted with another supplement. I would use this with extreme caution as like any supplement that's not regulated by the FDA we never truly know what is in a product and how much.  Please be very careful using this and other supplements especially when combining more than one product.
 I take this in the morning and afternoon and definitely notice an increase in my energy throughout the day.  It is gentle on the stomach and causes me no issues whatsoever.  I also have had no trouble sleeping while taking it.  It also does not give me any jitters like many so called "energy" supplements do, many of which I took one time and could not continue taking.  I have never officially been diagnosed with a thyroid problem, but was interested in the product to get more vitamins and increase energy throughout the day.  Those with those conditions may notice more substantial results or more of an energy increase than I have, however, I certainly can notice a difference if I've forgotten to take it.
 Purchased this after going through chemo. I had experiencing sluggishness and just overall issusing pointing to an under active thyroid. My Dr ran blood tests and my levels we infact on the low side but not low enough for a percription. So, I turned to finding an herbal support. So far this is just what I needed. Within the first week I could feel a difference. Iam feeling better during the day and getting more done! I will buy this again for sure!
 Good product but I am not sure it helps those who have a thyroid condition.  After reading the reviews I opted to purchase it with the hope of assisting with the weight loss as my Hashimoto keeps sending me on a roller coaster of weight gains.  I would still recommend it for the ingredients that it consists of; but for me, it's not proving what it could do.  I wish a better outcome for others.
 I have been taking this supplement for about 2 months and I love it. I put it on subscribe and save to make sure I always have it! I recently lost weight due to an illness and this has helped me maintain my weight loss with diet change.  There are no jitters involved with the energy that I receive and I’m waking up in the morning with my feet ready to hit the floor. I take the pill with breakfast and dinner, the two times a day I’m least active because I’m usually working or winding down for the evening. I gave some to my 73 year old grandmother and she enjoys them as well.
 Didn't see any effect what-so-ever. Didn't do anything taking the recommended dose on the bottle daily.  Used it until the bottle was empty just in case something magical happened but it didn't.  Buyer beware.<br/><br/>Update: 07/19/2016 - Customer service refunded my money for this product since it did not work for me, so I am upgrading my review to 3 stars since their customer service stands behind their product. It may work for you (as others have stated).
 I have been having trouble with super low energy, mood swings and weight gain since my Hysterectomy last year and have tried a few different supplements but have not any any luck until trying this one, So far it seems to even out my mood , I dont have as many hot flashes and so far seem to be slowly losing some extra weight. I highly recommend trying this product
 Added: I am incredibly impressed with the customer service of this company. Without question they refunded my money and expressed their regret that I was not happy with the product. While I would not reorder this particular product again, I would certainly try other products from them.<br/>I  wanted so much for this product to work but I honestly can't tell a difference. I experienced major intestinal "issues" for the first week (probably the reason others reported weight loss) but that went away after a week. No positive effects to report.
 This has helped my Hashitmotos so much!  I still have to take T3 and T4 meds in the AM but this supplement really helps with my energy if I take it in the afternoon along with Vitamin D, Biotin and my Water Away supplements.<br/><br/>Added - This has become one of the most important components of my regimen.  I cannot tell you how grateful I am to have this supplement for my overall wellness, mental alertness, energy etc.
 I've suspected I have hypothyroidism for some time now - sudden breakthrough depression, brain fog, fatigue, trouble sleeping, weight gain. While I still intend to see a physician for a diagnosis, I purchased Thyroid Support to see if it would help my symptoms. I figured that if it did help my symptoms, that would confirm that my suspicions of hypothyroidism weren't crazy.<br/><br/>For about three weeks now I have been taking two pills a day, as per the label instructions, every morning - without fail. I started to feel improvement within 2-3 days. The earliest improvement was that I slept deeper, and didn't experience brain fog. Within a week, my depression had lessened and I felt more emotionally stable- I'm sure the improved sleep helped. I also had more energy and felt less 'demotivated', especially in the evenings after work when I'd usually just want to sit on the couch and do nothing. Sitting around and doing nothing isn't "me", but it's been my default for the last year or so while I wondered if I had hypothyroidism. So you can imagine my excitement when I found myself doing everything I wanted to do and accomplish (basic tasks like laundry; or cleaning off and redecorating the patio, overdue projects at work, etc) without having to talk myself into it or frowning and sighing the entire time.<br/><br/>I will say that three weeks in, the results feel like they may have plateaued a bit, but I still feel much better than I did before - especially with regard to the 'brain fog'. I think it's normal to experience a plateau if not some kind of stabilization of results. I'm getting used to sleeping better, having more energy, and thinking with more clarity, so it's not as much of a shocking difference now that I'm used to it. I do not think this is (nor would I encourage this as) a replacement for prescription hypothyroid medications like Levothyroxine or Synthroid. But it's definitely a valid, legitimate supplement - I think the iodine and selenium are probably among its most effective ingredients. If you're on the fence about whether or not to try it, I urge you to try it. I didn't expect it to have such a fast impact on my mental clarity and focus, or the quality of my sleep. Very impressed.
 When I noticed that I had all the symptoms of hypothyroid, I reasoned that I could either spend $125 for a consultation with a doctor, or I could try this for 6 months. I chose to try it. I’ve gone from barely being able to make my bed to climbing mountains again. These herbs, along with diet recommendations from Anthony William (Medical Medium), have given me my life back.
 I really like this product. I have used it consistently for about 3 weeks and I definitely have so much more energy which is great for running after a 1 and a 3 year old. I used to HAVE to take a nap daily just to make it to 9pm but this definitely gives me the boost I need to stay awake and alert all day and into the evening. No jitters and no crash. I also notice I sleep much better and wake up refreshed and ready to start my day. I am just a little disappointed that I have not lost any weight on this alone but the energy almost makes up for it. I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism 11 years ago and I have been struggling with lack of energy and severe brain fog until now. I ordered a second bottle and was also sent a complimentary bottle from the company. All around great product.
 I love this supplement! I have hypothyroidism and thankfully, I have found a great doctor who is willing to address my low free t3 with direct t3 medication. However, it was still just slowly making me feel better, so I felt that I needed some extra support. I used this stuff for about a month and I'm now on my second bottle. I feel awesome when I take this! It makes me feel balanced...not jittery at all, and with plenty of energy and a balanced mood. I lost a couple pounds as well without even trying! And I have been able to maintain it with ease. Before, I would gain weight just looking at food! I will be a lifelong customer.
 My husband and I wanted to like this SO bad. We read tons of reviews and were immediately sold so we bought two bottles for us both to try. We have been taking it as directed for over 3 weeks and haven’t noticed a single difference. Very disappointed.<br/>*Updating my rating to 5 stars because although the product didn’t work for us, the company is amazing. They completely refunded me without me even requesting it. They also sent a very nice email. I’m extremely impressed with their customer service!
 I've been running on low energy for a while now. I've tried everything: testosterone boosters, maca, minerals... And while they did bring some changes, I still felt really slow, sluggish and my mind would be foggy most of the time.<br/><br/>After I did some reading, I came to the conclusion that I might suffer from a low thyroid. Being a do first, ask questions later type of person I ordered this bottle, and boy oh boy was I surprised.<br/><br/>The first time I took this I had so much energy that I felt like I was on drugs or something. I just started doing things randomly, things I avoided because I didn't have the energy for them. My mood was through the roof, I became a lot more optimistic, I have a lot more energy and my mind is a lot  clearer now and I have no problems with constipation.<br/><br/>After using this supplement for 3 weeks I can safely saw this is one of those supplements that actually lives up to the hype and I would definitely order it again
 My hair started falling out for no apparent reason. (Im a woman so not going bald!) My doctor did bloodwork, all thyroid levels were fine so I was not prescribed anything, just referred to a dermatologist. When I looked into sympotms of underactive thryoid, I had many symptoms besides just the hair loss.  I decided to try this supplement since it had such great reviews. I hoped it would help my hair loss, but also thought it might help my fatigue and low metabolism.  I've used it for a little over a month, and my hair has stopped falling out. I havent noticed any difference so far with other symptoms however. I di still plan to continue taking it since it has helped with the original reason I started taking it.
 This is my second "follow-up" review.  I tried this product for 1 month because I suspected I had thyroid issues.  After one month, I have not noticed a significant change, but I have ordered another bottle to give it more time.  After taking it one month, went to Dr. who concluded my thyroid is low.  Hoping to have better results after another month of using this product.
 I just finished taking this for a month and it was like I took nothing.<br/><br/>Revised edit: I am changing my original review on this product simply because of the wonderful customer service that Zhou Nutrition gave me. I did not ask for a refund nor did I complain to them about this product. However they gave me a complete refund after my original review was posted. I really appreciate their awesome customer service!
 Bought this two times now.  I feel better each day for taking this.  I have had Hypoism since 1984.  It has given me energy where I hadn't had any before.  The only downfall is ....it is more expensive than regular vitamins.  That is double the amount of other ones.  It suggests 2 of them a day.  I take one.  It helps so much with the fiber and sending you to do what you need to do to feel better.  I really love this product but I will continue to buy and use it with one pill a day.  Too expensive the other way.  But it does do a good job in making you feel better and less tired and ready for your day.
 I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis 5 months ago, and was put on Levothyroxine Thyroid hormone replacement, but I had the severest side affects they've ever seen, so they put me on Armour Thyroid, which is a more natural form of hormone replacement, and came with lil to no side affects for me... but I was still feeling extremely fatigued and weak... so my dr suggested I find a Thyroid supplement to help increase the effectiveness of my meds, and after days of research, I settled on Zhuo Thyroid Support. I noticed an immediate change in my energy level and my overall feeling of well being has done a complete 360... so without a doubt, this supplement is a God sent, as its changed my life and I refuse to ever be without it.
 No changes or differences yet :(<br/><br/>Edit: They were very sweet and emailed me an apology for not seeing any changes. I really appreciated that and it made me feel really valued because with a thyroid disease it already makes some of us feel depressed and vulnerable and to have someone genuinely care that the product didn't assist in some way made my day a bit brighter. A BIG than you to Jeremy Anderson for that.
 Edit: I changed this rating from two stars to three. This is due to Zhou customer service. I received an email (one that was genuine in my opinion) stating how they were sorry to hear it didn't work and that I was given a full refund. I did not contact them and did not ask for the refund, this is customer service at its finest.<br/>An extra star for customer service as it is deserved.<br/><br/>Not sure how I feel about this product.. I want to say it didn't work for me as it gave me some wicked fatigue and bouts of fighting to stay awake.<br/>I know of ppl that have benefited from this but it did not help me and made things a bit worse.  Everyone is different, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. I don't feel my experience should reflect the quality of this supplement. It helped two of my friends, I'm the exception.
 I have been looking for something that would bring me more energy. I have a defective thyroid a 200mcg of synthroid. Knowing all this I was looking for something to help me get going. I started taking this product and I got a slightly different result than expected, my energy level was better but still not great. The thing is I always had like a fog around my head, this is now gone and I am more focused. For me when I forgot to take it after two days the fog was back. I would recommend this to anyone who needs more focus and some energy.
 My second month shipment is just about to be delivered and I'm going to continue taking this product. Two months ago I was absolutely exhausted to the point that I could hardly even put one foot in front of the other or climb a flight of stairs without being out of breath.I have tried other products and they did just did not work, since taking these consistently I have noticed significant Improvement in my energy levels and  have even been able to start exercising again.
 It didn't work for me but Zhou expressed concern and was very helpful and kind when they learned of my experience. Gave me a full refund when I didn't even ask. Made me feel dizzy and weird. But they aim to please, so if you aren't satisfied or it doesn't work for you they are more than understanding.
 I have been taking two a day for a couple of months now. I take one in the morning and one before bedtime. I think they have helped me in several ways, but I can say for sure that they greatly reduced my hair loss. I used to lose a large handful of hair every day in the shower when washing and conditioning, then more when I combed and brushed my hair. I couldn't believe I still had hair in my head as much as I would peel off my hands. Now, I only see three or four strands. I think it took about 6 weeks to really see a difference.<br/>I will continue to take this supplement; I am a 49 year old female. Keep in mind that every person is different and what worked for me, may not for you.
 I don't know which herb I reacted to, but tried this 3 separate times and it made my heart race and gave me a headache. Can't use.
 I've had thyroid issues, and have been miserable dealing with fatigue, low metabolism, and weight gain. I believe in the holistic approach and have been researching to find the best thyroid support. I spent weeks of reading on the ingredients that help support thyroid function, I've tried many products --and thankfully, I found Zhou Thyroid Support. Within 5-10 minutes of taking the 2 pills in the morning, I felt so much better! My energy was back! However, after running out, I failed to reorder and thought that perhaps it wasn't the pills that were making me feel better, so I went without for about a week. My sluggishness returned and just felt so fatigued, just awful. I reordered the bottle and received it within 2 days. I took my 2 pills and within minutes complete recharge. I learned that its the ingredients in the pills that have helped me, and I will not go without this bottle again. I don't know if others will have the same positive response, but I can say if you are tirelessly looking for some relief, give these a try! They're helping me feel so much better!
 I never show up with thyroid deficiency from medical tests, however, being over 50, this product feels good for me.
 Been taking these for 3 days and for 3 days I have a horrible headache. I did notice that I had a bit more energy, but this headache isn't worth taking anymore.<br/>*edit......<br/>This company has a beyond fantastic customer service department. I did not ask for a refund and was not expecting one. They read that the product didn't work for me, due to terrible headaches, and they refunded my order amount. This is not the norm for companies, so I would highly recommend trying this product
 I had high hopes for this supplement, but the word Bladderwrack kept going around in my mind over and over and I wasn't far off. After two days of taking this I ended up with a bladder infection, I got a uti. I'm really disappointed and it definitely does "wreck" your bladder!!!<br/><br/>Thier customer service is amazing so I raised my rating to 4 stars from 1 star.
 Helped a little bit with energy but wasn't what I was looking for. I'm a little disappointed that it didn't work for me like it's worked for others. The customer service is the best I've experienced on Amazon so far, after being unhappy with the product, the seller immediately refunded me for the product, wished me well, and was all around very helpful in my search for something to take for my thyroid. Good customer service goes a very long way.
 i am not big on reviews but extremes should be noted. I was tremendously surprised by this product in a positive way. Here is the story: done blood tests in Jan 2017 and thyroid TSH was high = 4.84. My physician wanted to recommend prescription but i said i'll try supplements first. I used this product. I did not feel better, more energetic; all was BAU until i repeated the tests in May where the same test was smack in the normal range 2.7 There was nothing different in my routine therefore i am convinced that this supplement made a BIG positive difference; Well done Zhou Nutrition
 Since I've been taking Thyroid Support I notice I have more energy and that my slow metabolism has improved.  While I was on a diet and exercising, I had better results in the past and I believe it was partly due to this product helping to increase my metabolism and keep my energy more stable.  Once I lost the weight, I have continued to take this product as I believe it is helping me to avoid some of the cravings I once had and continues to keep my metabolism revved, helping me to maintain my weight loss.  This is a great product
 I have to say these make a huge difference. I have hypothyroidism and even though I’m on the correct meds I still get extremely tired even after small meals. I usually need a cup of coffee around 1:00 just to get some energy but these vitamins seem to do the trick by themselves. I take one with lunch and one with dinner and I feel a lot more energetic. No side effects, they go down easy with water and taste like a typical vitamin. I recommend them for anyone with thyroid issues. They’ve helped me a lot.
 Gave me severe headache and elevated blood pressure. Contacted company for refund. Company has great customer service. Had refund in a couple days.
 Been taking these for a little over a month, one pill a day at first, then two a day after a couple of weeks. I am 41 and have struggled for a long time with dry skin, brittle hair, fatigue and sleep issues. Most women in my family are hypothyroid, but when I would get tested, my thyroid work up was always normal or on the lower end of normal, so doctors never gave me synthroid. I have to say that it’s not night and day, but my fatigue has decreased, my skin is less dry and my sleep has been better. Going to stick with these and see if they make a larger difference long term. I take them with food and haven’t noticed any bothersome side effects.
 This is an excellent product...I have always had a slow THYROID FUNCTION...<br/>and a swelling of the gland that is manifesting as big double chin...<br/>When I take one or two of these capsules every day, I feel so much better...I have much more energy..<br/>easy elimination, and a 40 to 50% reduction of the swelling of the THYROID GLAND...<br/>thus a much smaller double chin...<br/>and even though I am on 100 mg daily SYNTHROID prescription medication...<br/>taking this product really really helps me tremendously...<br/>Thank You Zhou Nutrition Company....I will now look into your other products...<br/>I am soon to turn 69..a senior woman way deep into Menopause...<br/>this product will be part of what I take every day...<br/>I highly recommend this product....
 I love this product. I've been using it for over a year. When taken as instructed it works! It helps my body function better, helps with cravings, gives me focus and helps me use the food I eat for energy instead of turning to fat. Side effect is that I've lost about 50 lbs.
 I took it for about 10 days..energy level was great, felt would wonderful, but the horrible headaches that followed were not worth it. Headache every evening. Really bummed.<br/>Update: Got an email from the company, they refunded my money without asking! This is great customer service! Kuddos to them!
 Made a  noticeable difference for me. I have hypothyroid and take prescription thyroid medication. When I began to add this to my daily routine, I noticed a difference the first month! I actually have more energy now and have finally started losing some weight that I have been trying to lose. Coincidence? Maybe. I don’t know, but it made a difference when it was the only thing that I changed my diet.  I ordered a second bottle as soon as I ran out.
 I like this stuff a lot... it hasn't necessarily given me "insane" amounts of energy like some - I believe it probably works differently in different people - but it very DEFINITELY cleared up the constant "brain fog" that I felt, and that alone is amazing and worth it to me!!  I do feel like I have some more energy perhaps because of or in addition to the brain fog going away.  Definitely recommend this product.
 This product is a must for all Americans. We are iodine deficient. I feel so much better. My thyroid is working much better. Thanks again Amazon for having great products!
 I have tried other similar "thyroid support" supplements. This one makes me feel the best out of all of them and seems to be working wonders for my metabolism. I have borderline hypothyroidism. It's not low enough yet that I absolutely have to take medication, but low enough that I experience some symptoms. This has improved my symptoms drastically.
 I have been using this product for nearly 2 months, and have already noticed a difference in my energy levels and the occasional brain fog that I believe is a result of low iodine consumption, since most of our foods are largely lacking in this ingredient. The other ingredients equally complimentary. I highly recommend it.
 Only within a couple of days was I truly impressed with how this product makes me feel! I am processing my food faster not within days and days. My energy is up, I don't have that feeling of 'needing my coffee' as soon as I get up. I'm only about a week and half in and loving having my body feel good! I really just wanted to try a good thyroid supplement as I have always had issues with my weight and steady control of appetite, never diagnosed with a thyroid condition but I am loving feeling better every new day.
 Almost finished my first bottle. So far I have noticed an increase in energy, slight decrease in food cravings, and some weight loss.  I do not weigh myself but I have notice almost a size drop on both pants and shirts.<br/>I workout moderately and have a physically demanding job. I also watch what I eat but I’m not fully committed to that lol. Willing togive this product a 3-6 month trial.
 I can feel my body burning more energy as I work. I don't necessarily feel more energetic, but I do feel like I have more endurance whilst also being warmer.<br/><br/>I find that it's easier to fall asleep at night and wake in the morning.<br/><br/>Finally, my appetite seems more stable. Rather than craving a few big meals, I find numerous smaller meals are more satisfying.
 I took this product for a week and it gave me a headache every day afternoon. I switched back to a thyroid support supplement from another vendor and the headaches stopped. I plan to contact Zhou and request a refund.<br/><br/>Edit: Although the product did not work for me I got a prompt response from Zhou and a refund. This is good business and I won’t hesitate to try one of their other products in the future.
 Thyroid issues are new to me.  Due to having to wait for a specialist I wanted something to give me relief from some of the symptoms. I can honestly say that my condition did not get worse which is a good thing.  I did finish the bottle and will consider using again if I do not get an appointment soon.  I heard Thyroids and get pretty bad.
 I’ve never been diagnosed with thyroid problems, but I recently have started having issues with my heart rate. I bought these supplements because I have heard if your thyroid is out of whack, it can cause episodes of SVT. I haven’t had any episodes since I’ve started taking them.<br/><br/>The capsules are fairly large with a not so great taste, but that’s won’t stop me from taking them everyday. Just drink a lot of water :)
 As soon as I received this product I started to take and I did notice some weight loss. I am a very athletic person and I workout every day. As far as energy I did need a boost by taking Hydroxicut powder that you would put in your water. I would take that in the mornings. This thyroid support did help but I would still get sweaty and hot in the mornings without doing anything (it’s annoying). It does work for my loss of weight.
 When I first started these I felt a little energy boost. However I started getting excessive hair loss after about a week. My hair was coming out in clumps! Nothing else was new in my diet. I actually feel a breeze on my scalp the hair became so thin, in such a short period of time! I don’t know if it is a side effect or just a reaction my body had. I stopped after approx 2 weeks. Sad because I did feel more alert. Now I am praying the hair loss grows back.
 I gave this product a full month to see what benefits I've discovered. I can say that I sleep very well at night due to this product. I didn't notice any engery boost. However I did notice I've started to remember small things that I would forget, like where's my keys, or where did i put such and such. The number one thing I've notice was I could sleep through the night and for me that was perfect.
 After reading the positive reviews and seeing that the Zhou Thyroid Support seemed to have most of the recommended vitamins/supplements for Hypothyroidism, I decided to give them a try.  I took them for three weeks but didn't notice any difference (energy-wise or weight loss) - in fact, I actually felt more bloated during those three weeks although I can't be sure if the bloating was directly related to the supplement.<br/><br/>So I've gone back to taking Nature Made Vitamin B-Stress Complex which has many - not all - of the same recommended vitamins for Hypothyroidism (e.g. Zinc &amp; Copper) as well as Vitamin C.  I like the Vitamin B-Stress Complex as I have more energy and it seems to improve my overall mood.  I'm also taking a daily Selenium supplement as well as a weekly (high dose) Vitamin D supplement.
 So glad I ordered this! I have not been to a doctor for tests, but suspected hypothyroidism due to experiencing many symptoms, as well as having several close family members with this. I was mainly starting to feel very tired, anxious, having negative thoughts and have gained about ten pounds suddenly.<br/><br/>Since taking this for almost a month, I can say that I feel so much like myself again. I am ordering another bottle right now. If you are unsure, try it. You will be so glad that you did.
 After months of combining with Levothyroxine for my hypothyroidism - I have to say it helps. My TSH levels are medically sound (between 1 and 2) and have been since I started the medication (before that I was registering a 5), but I'm still lethargic and find myself self medicating with tons of caffeine and even then I'm still tired. But it was actually worse before I started taking Zhou's thyroid support.  I keep buying it - I noticed when I stopped using it the lethargy was stronger. So I recommend people give it a try but with tempered expectations and obviously don't substitute it for real medication, supplement it.
 I wanted these dramatic results that everyone else reported. My husband and I both tried taking this for 2 weeks, he has an autoimmune disorder I don't. Within 4 hours he was literally crashing. Like couldn't keep his eyes open crashing. So he stopped and I tried taking it and ironically had the same result. No increase in energy or overall well being but hours later felt like I was shutting down. Save your money.
 Thyroid Support tablets are outstanding! I have found I have much more energy and less fatigue than I've had in several months. These have made me feel like living life again instead of just existing. I plan on continuing taking these forever.
 As someone who suffers with almost impossible to treat hypothyroidism, diet change, and ZHOU supplements really have been helping control the pain, the fatigue and autoimmune side effects.<br/><br/>Feels good to just be a person again instead of a zombie.
 definitely worked like described.  No longer have cold hands and feet in the summer; my appetite is decreased.  Before taking this, i CRAVED sugar/sweets after eating...even when i was stuffed!  After taking these for about 3 days, I had only a desire to eat GOOD things:  veggies, fruit, sugarless snacks.  Didn't want ANY junk.  Lost 15 pounds in 6 weeks.
 Okay I can't say I understand exactly how these work but they do!  I was practically starving and exercising every day and couldn't lose a pound. By the time these came I've given up on dieting but still figured I'll try these and maybe try dieting again at a later time. Well, I'm eating what I want, taking these everyday and losing weight! Started these about 6 weeks ago and I'm down 8 pounds without dieting or exercising. No side effects, not jittery. Like I said I really don't understand it but really glad I found these!  😊
 I started taking this four months ago as I was having heart palpitations and other symptoms that I believed were related to abnormal thyroid function.  My basic thyroid tests came back within normal range but all my symptoms indicated low thyroid function.  I decided to try these and boy what a difference it has made in my life.  No more symptoms and I feel like a new woman!  I would highly recommend these to anyone that suspects thyroid issues.  Don't always believe what your PCP tells you. Those basic thyroid tests do not always catch issues with your thyroid.
 I haven’t done any blood work recently so i can’t say whether it’s placebo or if it’s really working. But i have felt more sustainably energetic during the day. My skin seems to be less rough as well. I will continue to take it to see if i notice any other changes. I will be seeing a doctor within 4 weeks to have a full blood panel done. I will have to update after that visit to see what it shows
 I did not experience increased energy on this but I think it may have helped somewhat with focus.  It's hard to tell.  When I first took it, I had some weight loss but that leveled out on week 2.  I have no idea if that was due to the supplement or just coincidental.  I took it a full month but am not taking it now and feel no different (not better or worse).  It may be that it just doesn't work for me but it certainly doesn't have anything harmful in it so it was worth a try.
 It's hard to know for sure, but these seem to be helping with my overall energy levels. I'm severely hypothyroid, and even with synthroid I find my energy levels low, so I take a variety in fitness supplements to help.
 I have been taking Thyroid Support for a little less than a month. I have found that they are effective and am going to keep using them!  I typically feel a mid-afternoon slump and have noticed that they help me keep my energy levels even. I also don’t have food cravings as much as I was experiencing. I have been struggling with early 40’s hormonal challenges and am feeling that this is also helping me get this under control. I highly recommend!
 I couldn’t tell a difference. I suspect my thyroid is low but I’m always on the lower end of normal when checked so Dr never does anything about it. I have to say that I did not have my thyroid tested while taking this product but as far as energy or weight loss I really couldn’t tell any difference.
 I started taking this about three weeks ago, I have hypothyroidism and ive been on levothyroxine. Due to all the symptoms I have day to day i thought this would be helpful. The first week of taking this i felt great, like I finally found something that worked!!  It was awesome! Then the second week my energy level started to go down, I figured it was just leveling out but on week three i drastically got SO tired so much so that I couldnt keep my eyes open I'd fall asleep sitting up. I felt like a zombie, and just completely horrible. Im so tired I can't even stand it. Im really disappointed,...i got my hopes up and now I feel worse off then before I started taking these. Its awful feeling this way and having no control over it.  I hope that ons day soon something does help but this backfired :( . Its really unfair. For some of u that it did work for,well congrats, im happy for u, u deserve to have ur life back.. Unfortually for me I guess I'll keep tryn..
 Seems to be working so far. I'm taking this for low body temperature  (95 on average) but totally normal thyroid tests. When I'm taking this, my body temperature raises to like 96, 97. I'm hoping if I keep taking this, I'll finally have a normal body temperature.<br/>Side note - I took this once a morning after drinking with friends. I normally have terrible hangovers, but I actually felt pretty good after taking these.
 Have been taking this going on for 2 weeks now and no difference what to so ever. I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism over a year ago and since then have zero energy. Was really excited to give this a try and have it actually work. Definitely not the case.<br/>*Update, the company reached out to me based on my review. I was shocked by their sincere generosity. They offered me a full refund and to be able to try a different product. You rarely see this customer service anymore.
 I was fighting staying awake and figured it was my thyroid.  After taking this the first time I felt like my old self again.  I didn't want to take any RX meds.  This was the answer for me.  However, I know that everyone reacts differently and do not know if this will help others as it does me.  I cannot be without it.  I was considering going homeopathy but this is my answer...
 I followed the instructions and after almost a month of use,  don't see any difference.
 This supplement is amazing. My husband and I opened a moderate sized gym in the last year and thus got to experience the joy, frustration, and stress of such an endeavor. Needless to say, our adrenal glands were taxed which led to hypothyroidism for me, and my husband was feeling the drag from it. I think this supplement is an awesome alternative to the synthetic hormones if you suffer from mild hypothyroidism or are dragging from stress.
 I use this along with my Levothyroxine and I believe its helping. Even with the Levo, I was taking naps during the day - now that's not happening as often. I do still take naps on certain days, but I wake up at 5am and work a 50 hour work week and I have 4 kids, so on certain days when I'm running around like crazy, I think my body just needs to recharge and that's normal.  I'm going to continue to use this product.
 I've always been lethargic and even though I had and overactive thyroid, once it was treated I still feel tired all the time. I am on levoxothrine but am always looking for ways to boost my energy. I found this and tried  it for a month and felt no difference. It didn't seem to help at all. I guess I'll keep looking.<br/>5 stars for the company for issuing me a refund since the product didn't work for me. Great company!
 I noticed a difference in three days. I take a compounded thyroid medication but due to some recent life events, I was feeling down and packing on the weight. I added thyroid support and I'm starting to feel like my old self. The fuzzy brain has pretty much disappeared. I'm on my second bottle and I plan on taking this as long as it is made. Great product, I highly recommend.
 Made me very jittery....I've changed my rating of this product. Even though it did not work for me is not saying the product would not work for other's. I have no thyroid so I'm reasonably sure that was the reason for feeling jittery. Thanks Zhou for the refund. Nice to have someone stand behind they're product....an ole grunt
 So I bought this about 3 weeks ago. I have so much more energy, I have been happier. Before I was always tired, I could wake up at 7 and  need a nap by 9. I no longer need a nap to get eveything done. And I dont need multiple cups of coffee either. I have not lost weight but I have been eating less. After dealing with symptoms for years this is the first time since my daughter was born I feel like me again.
 This supplement is an addition to treatment plan for a mysterious illness. What typically sounds like it could be thyroid, turns out to test normal during labs, but symptoms remain consistent. Adding this and a thyroid supplement have both added to some improvement in health, but we also obtained a synthetic thyroid hormone prescription to run empirical testing to see if thyroid may actually still be the root cause. Most doctors will prescribe a low dose in absence of abnormal tests and then monitor for symptom reduction. Overall, it has helped and we may be back for more. It is challenging to determine which ingredient or supplement adds most heavily, but this is a mission we've sustained for too long. Easy to swallow and safe for most consumers, every bit of help is welcome.
 I have hypothyroid symptoms but my levels are within the range of "acceptable". I started taking this because I hoped to address the root cause rather than just start injecting replacement "thyroids". This product contains all the supplements the thyroid uses. I take it every morning. I can feel the difference...mainly in how exhausted I would feel. I am on my third bottle.
 I took these for a couple of weeks and noticed no difference. I think the product quality and company are fine, but supplements alone can't really make a difference. It's cheaper to just take a multivitamin.<br/><br/>Edit: I am adding a star onto my review simply for the amazing customer service. They processed a refund for me after I posted my review and I didn't even ask for one--just simply because they didn't work for me. A+ service!
 This specific mixture is the best I have seen, in my opinion, for energy support. Not only does it have vital trace minerals that are crucial for the thyroid - copper, selenium, iodine, magnesium - but it also has adaptogens like ashwaghanda.<br/><br/>I developed a terrible hormonal imbalance a couple of years ago do to a vegan diet and which I am now trying to reverse. Acne, rough skin, anxiety, worse moods during menstruation, are all symptoms I had to deal with and this vitamin has definitely helped my body get back on track.<br/><br/>Being able to take all these crucial and powerful nutrients in one pill is great.
 Two months in of only taking half the recommended dosage (so only 1 pill) and it does seem to help with my energy and keeping hands and feet warmer. Had my MD check out the bottle/ingredients and said it was okay to take too!
 I have been taking these for the last 2 weeks. I do feel like I have more energy. The best past is I went to have my blood work done this week and my thyroid levels are good this is the first time in a long time. I take 2 pills along with my Synthroid 200 mcg. I hope to see some weight loss soon.
 Amazing! Feeling great w/this product. Starting with just one 3xday. Goal is to keep my system manufacturing its only with just a little outside help. Not sure if Ive lost any weight related directly consuming the product but weight is down.<br/><br/>Can't say enough good things about my experience with this product. I purchased based on reviews alone so no offers or anything in exchange for my review.<br/><br/>You can trust this is my actual experience.
 I decided not to post a review on this product, Thyroid Support Complex With Iodine, until after a week of running out of it, just to make sure that it wasn't something else in my system that was making me feel so GOOD!  Before taking this product, I felt like many of the other reviewers of this product - low energy, brain fog, blah mood.  Within a couple of days of taking this, I noticed I had much more energy, focus, memory and more pep in my step.<br/><br/>For me, taking one with breakfast (often a fruit smoothie) and again one with lunch (from veggie dishes to gluten free pizza) gave me the same steady flow of energy all day.  I suspected it was the TSCWI, but to make sure that it was the TSCWI that was making me feel so good, I finished the bottle a week ago and I can honestly tell you that my energy has gone back down, along with my focus, memory and mood is starting to drop as well.<br/><br/>Time to reorder more!<br/><br/>I'll follow up in this review after I finish my next order of this product.
 I didn’t see a difference using this product. Just didn’t work for me.<br/><br/>Update: Great customer service. I received a refund for the price of my purchase. Thanks so much.
 The first bottle seemed to work but i bought the second one and I’m guessing my body just got used to it but it isn’t working and now I’m more tired than ever...i can barely stay up past midnight anymore :-(
 Overall I’ve had a boost in energy that’s been more stable throughout the day.  I feel less foggy and Lethargic and so far it’s only been a moderate increase l.  However I’ve only been taking it for a week and I’m optimistic that with continued use it will make a big difference, just not been taking it long enough to see what difference it will make.  Hopefully 5 star review is pending I will update.
 I really wanted this to help with my low energy. It did absolutely nothing. I finished the whole bottle hoping one week I would feel more energy but no.<br/><br/>UPDATE The company did give me a full refund. They are very attentive about the feedback they get on here, so with a money back guarantee it's definitely worth trying out.
 Was told I had Thyroid-itis and was so tired all the time. I order this to see if it would help as the doc gave me no med assist. I am proud to say I have had a marked improvement in energy and believe it or not less hot flashes YEA! Next visit to the Endocrinologist I showed him what I was taking and he studied it and told me the minerals would be good for me. Great product!! Thank you so much Zhou Nutrition!
 I was told my thyroid was slightly underactive but not necessarily enough to get on medication. I decided to find a supplement that would support my thyroid. I spoke with a nutrition counselor and she recommended all of the supplements that these capsules contain. I've been taking them for months and I feel like I have more energy and I've lost a little weight. I would definitely recommend them!
 I am 2 weeks into my first bottle of Thyroid Support Complex With Iodine. I have an overwhelming feeling of wellbeing and I am getting better sleep than I have in years. I don't notice any extra energy but I feel great. I would rather sleep thru the night than have more energy. I had my share of anxious energy over the years, so zero complaints. I am so happy that this product helped me!<br/>UPDATE:::: I am on my third bottle and I feel like It makes a big difference in how I feel each day. I waited a while before ordering my third bottle and noticed right away that my throat can sometimes feel swollen and swallowing becomes more difficult, when I don't take it daily. I still continue to sleep better and feel less stress when taking these pills.
 I read the reviews and they were positive, sayimg that the people lost weight,  had more energy etc. So i bought a bottle.<br/>As a control, i changed nothing about my daily life and after 1 month and all pills, no noticeable change in metabolism or energy. At the very least i was hoping for something to be noticed but unfortunately there were none.<br/>They were nice enough to refund me for the product
 Well-formulated product.  I have been weaning off prescription thyroid medicine because the cost is rising and the results are diminishing.  This supplement seems to give me similar relief from hypothyroid symptoms....and priced more reasonably than my copay for the prescription drug.
 I did not know I had a thyroid problem...all I know is I was real tired and after being back to eating the atkins lifestyle where I always lose weight and maintain it I was gaining weight. I was constantly tired and unmotivated.  My carpel tunnel was real bad. I ordered these not really looking at the thyroid part but the energy. Within 3 days I felt the change!!!! I then looked up under active thyroid and had ALL of the symptoms. Not only do I feel more optimistic and energized but the scale has going down again as well! I will definitely being taking these on an ongoing basis!
 I purchased this product about a month ago. I only have a few days left to finish the bottle. I can definitely tell the days I take this from the days I forget. I am thinking clearer, have more energy and just feel better overall. I will definitely be purchasing this product again.
 I was hoping for good things from this product, but sadly these did nothing for me.<br/><br/>Update: I am happy to say that Zhou Nutrition's customer service has made good on their product despite my initial review, and has given a full refund to ensure 100% customer satisfaction on their part, and indeed they have done that.
 I was told about thyroid support complex with iodine by my son.  He had a low thyroid report.  He took this product and started feeling better in a short time.  He had some symptoms of anxiety and brain fog and that has been helped considerably.  We seem to have a similar body chemistry so he told me about the supplement.  I don’t have low thyroid but started taking it anyway, as I also had some anxiety and brain fog.  I now feel more focused  and  symptoms of anxiety are negligible.  So needless to say I think it is a good product.
 Repeat buyer of this fabulous product.  Id run out for a few days and could totally tell the difference; decreased energy, sluggish feeling, bloated, and hair loss (just enough to see several strands when id run my fingers through my hair).  This will be the third bottle Ive bought, with many more to come.  Excellent product!
 I'm just now entering my third month/third bottle of the thyroid support, and thus far, it has worked great for me. The most notable effect, and the reason I tried it, is greatly improved sleep/rest. I battle with anxiety that usually results in sleepless nights and exhausted mornings. Since I've been taking the thyroid support, I have been falling asleep much easier, sleeping well throughout the night, and generally feeling much more rested the next day. Seems like a really great product.
 I had high hopes with this product given all the rave reviews. I took it consistently for a couple of weeks just to notice I am breaking out. My breakout was gone in 2 days of me stopping these pills. Be cautious of this supplement if you have breakout issues especially.
 For a while they worked but I ended up having medical problems weeks after taking them because of the hormone change resulting in me being hospitalized. If you don't need thyroid support medication do not take.
 I love this Thyroid Support Complex With Iodine by Zhou!!!  If you have thyroid problems and symptoms of your thyroid not working like it should but it isn't showing up on your blood work by your doctor I highly recommend this supplement.  It is a great blend of vitamins that support your thyroid.  This is my go to supplement I take it every morning.  It REALLY helps me focus and function my best when taking this on a regular basis and if I miss a day by mid afternoon after feeling a bit off, I realize I didn't take it.  I've been using this supplement for almost 2 years now and I will continue to do so.  Thank you  Zhou for this wonderful supplement!!! 🙂
 I felt horrible on this stuff it made me moody and gave me a headache I had to stop and tried again in case it was a fluke but same thing...
 So I been taking this supplement about a week so if things change I'll write another later<br/> So far I haven't noticed any benefits. I'm still so tired I have hypothyroidism so I was hoping this supplement would help me with energy mainly. I know it's not going to be a miracle pill and help me drop a bunch of weight but I figured if it helped with energy I would be more motivated to hit the gym or something.. I read the reviews before purchasing and ppl stated it helped alot with energy. So far I'm not getting that benefit. Maybe it just takes a little bit. We will see. If it does then I'll update the review to reflect that. I'm giving it 3 stars for the fast delivery though ordered it and had it the next day was super fast
 It took 3-4wks to kick in but well worth it! I actually lost weight but now I can't find it at a reasonable price to purchase again 😔
 I dont have a thyroid due to Graves disease. I am on life long thyroid pill.  I have no energy I ordered the thyroid support and it has helped with my energy level I will post updates as I continue to use it
 I love this product!  I normally do not write reviews, but I am so happy with this product I wanted others to know about it.  I have a problem taking thyroid meds because of the side-effects of every medication I have ever taken.  I am on my third bottle of Thyroid Support and I am really feeling the positive effects of it.  I absolutely would recommend this to anyone with low energy and thyroid problems.  It works!
 I bought my first bottle, I was a little skeptical, but I got weighed in at the doc 2.5 months later, 14 lbs down! I was so excited! Wasn't sure if it was this or another medication I was on. So I took a month off...nothing lost. :-( back on my 2nd bottle and I'm awake in the morning,  don't feel the need for an afternoon nap, and feeling great! I'm sold on it! Even better, it's affordable!
 I have been on Synthroid for almost two years.  I'm still not myself.  My doctor  changes the dosage every once in a while to see if that helps.  I have decided to try other avenues.  I am a healthy, athletic person, who needs my energy back.  I tried this product, and have felt a little better.  I gave it four stars because I am not sure how much is the placebo effect.  I am going to purchase a second bottle to monitor how I feel, energy and mood wise.  I recommend giving this product a try and seeing how it works for you.
 The iodine in this product caused symptoms of hyperthyroidism. I lost too much weight. My periods disappeared. Lost my boobs and butt. Was always tired and irritable. Lost hair. Texture of hair and nails changed. I tried this for about one month and-a-half. I stopped immediately.
 I took one capsule this morning as my first dose &amp; within 30 minutes or so, I was feeling more energy &amp; wanting to get things done instead of wanting to crawl back in bed - I take care of my 70-yr-old sister 24/7 &amp; have been overwhelmed w/ her care so was looking for something to give me more energy &amp; wow what a feeling!
 I really wanted to like this product after reading so many amazing reviews. I was hoping this was the key I needed to help jumpstart getting my hormones in line. I’ve been taking it for 3 weeks and I’ve noticed a huge change in my stomach and bowel movements. My stomach is constantly bubbling. And my bowel movements have significantly changed and not for the better. I was hoping that would change but after 3 weeks it hasn’t changed back to normal.
 I like this product. It's one of the only thyroid formulas I've used that combines all of the elements supporting thyroid health that I've noticed a significant difference with. It helped me be alert and energetic without several cups of coffee to get through the day and even helped me lose weight. I've been trying homeopathic and natural methods for hypothyroidism for years and am happy to have found an affordable option that combines many things I was taking seperatly.
 Sooooo it's only been a weekend since I started using these supliments and I already feel a huge difference.<br/>I am 29 years old and I had my first baby last year. My pregnancy was super hard. I had every symptom in the book and even developed preeclampsia. I ended up having an emergency c-section at 30 weeks and ever since then my body has felt 65+<br/>Im having a hard time loosing the last 10 pounds so I can be back at the weight that I was before I got pregnant. I was constantly feeling exhausted at the end of the day, and finally when it was time for me all I wanted to do was catch up on stuff on my DVR and sleep. I was NEVER a couch potato but I didn't realize how bad I became until I started taking these.<br/>It's not a gittery feeling like a 5 hour energy, and not like drinking coffee. I was specktical but willing to try anything to help me out, and I couldn't be more happy with the way I'm feeling. During my sons nap time I actually went for a run with my ankle weights like I use to, and felt great.<br/>If your feeling like I was definitely give this a try!<br/>I'm excited to see where I'll be at with my weight in 2 weeks from now. My only regret is that I didn't find this before summer started.<br/><br/>P. S.  my husband even noticed that I had a pep in my step :)
 I purchased a different thyroid supplement prior to this brand, finished the whole bottle which is about a month’s worth. I didn’t feel any difference, was still always tired and lethargic. So I decided to buy Zhou Nutrition brand and within the week I felt the difference! I have more energy and not tired all day. Now, I added this to my monthly Amazon subscription to make sure that I’ll get this every month!
 This is not an instant cure. It took me a week of taking it twice a day to notice. However, I have been feeling less bloated and have more energy. I like the natural ingredients and feel it was worth the money to try it. I will be buying a refill!!
 I took a chance on this and I'm glad I did. Usually when I buy vitamins I feel the difference after the first bottle but I felt the diffrnce right away. Felt more energy and didn't leave no after taste and doesn't make me nasueas like other vitamins.
 I started feeling very jittery and restless a few days into taking these supplements. I feel like I can't sit still, I can't really focus because my mind is racing and it's an overall anxious mood.<br/>I have Hashimoto's, have taken other similar thyroid supplements and haven't had this reaction so I'm not entirely sure what specific ingredient(s) is causing it.<br/>Will discontinue use.
 I have been taking this for about 2 weeks and can already tell a difference. The nurse practitioner I see recently recommended me start taking Iodine and it was hard to find, brought in my bottle of Thyroid Support and she took a picture of it so she could tell other thyroid patients since I have had such success with it.
 Since I started taking thyroid support, I have noticed a difference in my energy level. I have been more alert and on top of my daily routine. I have noticed any negative effects from this medication.  I would recommend this to anyone feeling blah.
 I’m not big on leaving reviews .... But let me tell you. Since I started this product I feel AMAZING !!! I can not stress that enough. It’s only been almost two weeks, but being a sufferer of PMDD and knowing when I should start my crazy and how it suddenly has not happened shows me This pill works !!! I literally just picked up a script for BC because i’m sick of feeling like this... 33 with my tubes tied and here I was about to start birth control. I don’t know what in these did it, But it’s working... Give it a try
 After taking it for a couple of weeks, I have noticed that I sleep better and I am not as fatigued and I feel hungry went I don't eat more regularly, and my energy levels are much better than before.<br/><br/>I like the product so much I am going to subscribe to the Amazon subscribe and save program so I always have this supplement on hand.
 I couldn't tell any difference when taking these tablets. The only thing I noticed while taking the bottle was I seemed to sleep better, and deeper.
 These gave me terrible headaches!  It was the only thing new I was taking. Once I stopped taking them the headaches stopped. I decided to try one more time to be sure and the headache was back. Lasted all day and through the night. That was enough. Glad I came to review today because I imky have 3 days to figure out how to return them to get a refund. Such a pain to go through the hassel of returning an item but I guess it has to be done.
 I have tried several  natural thyroid support products. This is by far the best. I felt more energy immediately without any of the jittery feeling sometimes associated with these products. I definitely recommend this product!
 I have been Using Thyroid Support. for about a month.  During this time I have decreased my Armour Thyroid by half.  I am very happy with the product and will continue to use it.
 Bought these due to my under active thyroid. You don’t no something is wrong with you until you feel what’s missing. These made me feel great gave loads of energy and hopefully when I get my thyroid checked the nodules will be gone
 I first purchased Zhou Boost with satisfying results If you know what I mean. A friend recommended I try a thyroid support supplement so I went with Zhou. 2nd day taking their Thyroid Support Complex and I must say I have more energy, both mental and physical. I'll stop taking it for a few days to test placebo effect, but I really have not felt this overall-energized feeling in years. I think it's good stuff. So far I'm satisfied and impressed with Zhou products.<br/><br/>Update 4/21/17 I quit taking this after a week to test placebo effect. Short Story: I'm back to taking it daily. Makes me want to work out and Ive lost some weight Yes! I recommend the product.<br/><br/>Update 5-2-17 / I've got an 8 day supply left. With my low sodium diet and some exercise, I have lost 12 pounds since taking these. I must say I have more energy and alertness. I'm glad I found this. These make you feel pretty good and feel motivated to do more to lose a few pounds. Zhou products deliver. Will buy more.<br/><br/>Hope my review helps you!
 I wasn't sure about this product at first, since I do not suffer from a thyroid condition, but I'm glad I decided to order it! It took about 3 weeks of taking 2 pills a day to feel the full effects of the energy that this product provides, with no crash effect afterwards. I highly recommend this product if you are looking to boost your energy levels. The company is great as well as I received an email shortly after receiving this product to ensure that everything arrived as ordered. Thank you Zhou! I will definitely be ordering more!
 I've had issues with my thyroid for a while now but I don't want to take prescription medicine. My blood results we're never too bad so it wasn't that big of a deal. But I did still always feel very tired and cold all the time. These supplements are a great alternative to prescription medication. I still feel a little tired sometimes but they have greatly improved my energy and mood. I would definitely recommend these.
 I've taken this product for about a month now and notice a significant difference in my energy and focus. I've even had people say that I look thinner. I loved it so much, I've signed up for the monthly  subscription. Try it!
 Highly recommend if you feel chronic fatigue/exhaustion. I take these In combination, with ancestral supplements liver and it has done wonders for my energy levels. I can’t function without them.<br/><br/>Highly recommend for those looking to boost energy without drinking copious amounts of energy drinks and other bad things.
 It's been a week and I keep waiting for the energy boost, as many of the reviews mention. Up to now, I have not felt any effects.<br/><br/>Edit: The customer service earns ZHOU an extra two stars.  Without requesting a refund, they promptly issued one.  I am a fan of their other products (specifically the BOOST ELITE) and would not hesitate to order from them again.  They truly have a 'money back" guarantee.
 From the very first week I noticed my energy levels went up. I used to sit to watch a movie and fall asleep quite often, but not anymore...when exercising the same thing happens...more stamina, more endurance, longer work outs. Highly recommended....however try not to follow the FDA recommended daily dosage of 200 mg x day but increase it to at least 600 mg x day, every other day. This will provide best results. Bromine contained in bread and other flours, inhibits iodine absorption...so be less indulgent with bread and pastry.
 Really love this product, took it dor 2 months, then i try another from different company, but same concept. And this is better. At the 4th day i felt with so much energy and healthier. Really recommend this product. I havent posted ant comments because i wanted to really take time using it and compared it with another one.
 I am on my second bottle! I love this stuff! I was trying to lose weight, and it's getting harder as I get older. Someone suggested I try it. In the first month, I did lose weight. Now it's so much easier. My thyroid was so sluggish. I'm a lifetime user from here on out. I'm going to try DRIFT OFF next. Thank you for a great product!
 So , I really wanted to love this but, it has been a few days of taking it and I got three big pimples ( I never break out and I am 47) , also after taking it I get a weird stabbing<br/><br/>pain for a few hours. Well back to the drawing board........ grrrr I really needed a good iodine supplement.<br/><br/>Update 1/13/19.  Been taking this 4 days one pill a day and lost clumps of hair in shower today , needless to say I will write this company bc I want my damn money back .
 It made my hair fall out
 I got this thyroid support because I was having infrequent heart palpitations and wanted to see if it was an issue with my thyroid. Although this hasn't  stopped the palpitations, I feel a need to keep taking this product. Every time i start weaning myself off it, I find a negative mental mood shift starts to happen. Since l haven't made any other changes, I feel like this product has something in it I need.
 I have definitely noticed a difference in my energy levels, my skin and hair. I love to exercise but always struggled with having the energy due to thyroid problems but this definitely helped quite a bit - I actually am able to exercise everyday now. Not sure if this is due to the supplement but my appetite has slightly decreased which is good since I was always hungry and feeling sluggish.
 This has helped with my energy levels and insomnia. I fall asleep easily now. Thyroid meds made me feel horrible and I stopped taking them. Once I found thyroid support complex and started taking it regularly I saw a improvement in my skin texture, energy levels, anxiety, insomnia, and my hair doesn't fall out as much. It's great! Will defo recommend.
 Trying to get off chemical based thyroid medicine.  Starting slow with one and my prescription medicine for one week and then trying to replace with just the Thyroid Support Complex.  Hoping it helps me loose some of the weight gain along with better eating and exercise. I will update my review in a month and let you know how it's going.
 It worked as described but after about two weeks it started to break down my immune system; went to the doctors to find that out; which caused an infection in my mouth.  I ended up losing weight within the first week of taking it but have changed to another pill which levels aren't as high.
 I had a bit of a sore throat after taking this supplement for 5 days and I can't really rate this product since I am taking Levothyroxine and I figured  Thyroid Support  would give me more energy or make me lose weight this didn't happen. Maybe this works for others it didn't work for me sorry I had to give this one 3 stars.
 DEFINITELY helping to reduce hot flashes even more than its predecessor Maca.  I take 2 capsules of this daily along with a drop of GH's nascent iodine because this has co-factors that assist in the assimilation and effectiveness of the iodine.  Those random gray hairs seem to have vanished.  Overall, it seems to help reduce a few of the annoying symptoms I was experiencing, namely, hot flashes and the onset of gray hair.
 Doctor keeps saying my thyroid is border line but doesn't want to do anything. It's been an ongoing issue for years.  Finally found something that is working!  My energy levels are up and I'm feeling so much better.  My concentration is back.  I didn't get the almost overnight response my sister but mines been a steady improvement that I'm fine with.
 I took these capsules every single day for an entire month and felt absolutely no difference whatsoever in either my energy level or focus.  I followed the directions to a T and took 2 capsules a day with a meal and never missed a dose.  Maybe they work for some people, but they definitely didn't for me.  What a disappointment and a waste of money.
 I have had a thyroidectomy a few years ago and just haven't felt myself since. I am so glad I found these supplements. I've only been taking them for about a month and I feel a huge difference!  I don't feel exhausted anymore. And I feel "awake". I am so glad I gave these supplements a try.
 I love this product. The first time I purchased it was in September 2016 I loved it so much I got it again in October 2016. I didn't order in November or December and saw a huge dip in my energy level and mental awareness. I couldn't stay focused and was back to always forgetting things like I did before I started taking this product in Sept. So I re-ordered only issues is the label on the bottle looks different and so do the pills inside. I'm wondering if seller can contact me on the reason for this...<br/>Other than that I would recommend this product.
 My thyroid has been all over he place since having my son and I have been zapped of energy and just overall feeling yucky as a result. Since I’ve started taking this, I have had so much more energy and don’t feel like I’m sick all of the time! I have yet to have new blood work done, so I can’t speak to how well it functions for correcting my thyroid issues, but I for sure feel a whole lot better, so that alone is golden!
 Since I began taking this a couple of weeks ago, it seems to be helping me with more consistent energy levels. I feel stronger and more energetic. I am taking other supplements and eating a healthy diet too, so that might be partially responsible. But I recently started exercising because I actually feel strong enough and good enough to work out (just walking and light weights for upper body), which hasn't been the case for years. So I am pleased with it so far!
 I struggle with my thyroid every day for the past 20 years low energy hair falling out confusion fogginess. I started taking this and then about a week later I really started feeling a boost of energy and feeling overall better with health. I'm always skeptical when I read reviews I'm so glad that I tried it for myself and you should too
 I had my doubts at first. Started using and didn't see any change in the level of energy I had in the first week. Now I'm going on third week and I feel super happy all the time and energized. I'm actually gonna order this again. I'm weigh is also decreasing. I'm now planning a more healthy diet plan each week. One thing though it is making me super hungry all the time. But I'm very active at work so I now sweat a lot because of this supplement. I'm loosing weight people.
 Friend recommend this to me I have thyroid problems slow weight loss lack of energy. She told me her daughter had success. I feel a differnce not as tired and I am dropping weight and body fat weekly. Great at to my keto diet and ordered other products from this company recently. The prices are very affordable as well.
 I've been taking thyroid support for several weeks now and have already lost 8lbs and have a ton more energy! I'll definitely be keeping these as part of my daily routine. I have hypothyroidism and have struggled to lose weight for years. It's so awesome to finally find a product that works for my specific needs and is all natural!
 So I would recommend you talk to your doctor first before taking these. They can be really helpful, but if nothing is wrong with your Thyroid, or your Metabolism this will do nothing for you. Once I told my doctor I was taking them to help me lose weight I was instructed to stop taking them until they can find something wrong with my thyroid. Long story short my thyroid is fine and these were a waste of money.
 I have been using this product under the suspicion that I have thyroid issues, although my blood tests reflect no problems. I have used this product for several months now and slowly, changes are taking place. My Raynauds doesn't flare up as much. I'm not cold all the time. I sleep better.
 Okay, so.<br/>Where to start...<br/>Pros- I lost weight, it gave me energy...<br/>Cons- threw my menstrual cycle out of whack, gave me horrible acne for the first time in 21 years (I'm 21 and never had an acne problem, my boobs became so sore I thought I was pregnant, gave me horrible HORRIBLE headaches, made me irratible....<br/>The list goes on and on.<br/>I am dumping these in the trash. I only took them for 2 weeks and I just can't continue to torture myself.
 I do not test as anything amiss with my thyroid, but I have many of the symptoms. I do test as very high with cortisol, so I think that it was interfering.  I have been taking this for about a month, and lost 7 lbs, and have a little more focus.
 I didn’t feel any results until about a week after I started taking it, but I was amazed that my body aches and joint aches were almost gone. I had more energy and felt so much better. I just finished my first bottle and will be ordering more. My clothes were even fitting better and my pants are looser around my waist. I can definitely feel a difference after not having the Thyroid Support for a few days. Great product!
 Didn't notice any difference at all for me - and it gave me headache every day I took it.  Might work for someone else, just didn't for me.<br/>However, the company did provide me with a refund, so great customer service deserves the 4 stars rating!
 Four and a half stars:<br/>Pros:<br/>~ I have had ALOT more energy (I have energy for every aspect of my life now, finally!)<br/>~ I have been really happy (My husband has said many times over the last few days, "you are in such a good mood"<br/>~ My appetite has been down, so I haven't been snacking (I have been so busy cleaning the house that I have to actually think about when I last ate. I'm not hungry.)<br/>~ I sleep so good through the night<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>~ I sweat ALOT, considering my energy is awesome, I cannot really complain about this.<br/>~ After 3 days of taking this without my Levothyroxine, my hands and feet were cold again. My husband thinks my body is getting used to this.<br/><br/>I am 31 and 10 lbs overweight. Ive lost 20 lbs this year (January 2016- January 2017) from a very healthy diet and ALOT of cardio. I couldn't seem to lose that last 10 pounds so my husband recommend that I try something like this. I am really glad I did. I have had hypothyroidism for 7 years and go in for bloodwork every 3 months. I take 75 mcg of levothyroxine. I am very anxious to see how my labs are when I go in  in about 2 months. I will post an update.<br/><br/>I gave 4.5 stars because I wish my old symptoms didn't come back (feeling cold, sometimes sleepy and the snacking). Other than that, I love this and would recommend giving it a try, it doesn't affect everyone the same way.
 I was taking Ashwaghanda and it was working great. I found this and thought maybe I would find better results with added benefits. No. It's done nothing for me. Matter of fact....I'm very tired. All day.
 Did not work for me at all - actually made me feel more exhausted and tired. I have hypothyroidism and did not work for me one bit. I sent it back. Ask your doc before taking these types of supplements as they may do more harm than good.
 I do sometimes get very tired, but I am extremely active so I’m not sure if it’s related to this... but man, oh man, my acne went crazy! Huge cyst and so many new ones daily. All on my chin, meaning it was hormonal. So, I stopped talking them for a couple of days and skin got better. Started up again, because I like the positive things this supplement offers. And yup. My gross acne all came back.
 My energy has been sluggish and I've been extremely tired.  I had a sneaking suspicion that my thyroid had something to do with it.  I've been taking this for about 5 weeks and I've definitely felt an increase an energy as well as my weight decreasing, which is always a good thing!!  Love this stuff and will keep taking it consistently.
 Thyroid problems heavy plague both sides of my family. So I am trying this out in hopes this can help me be an exemption. Been taking these for a week and half. Feeling a lot better than I used to. A better mood and more energy. I also feel like I’m actually shedding weight when I work out now.
 Didn't work.  Waste of money.  Don't waste yours.
 Terrible!! And like other reviewers have said, headaches everyday, total loss of appetite and after about a week in, all I wanted to do was sleep! Sorry!
 I have been struggling for years with low energy and brain fog.  I am currently taking synthroid; however, have seen minimal impact to my energy or clarity.  I came across this product, read the reviews and thought I would give it a try.  I was surprised and thrilled to actually feel a difference in my energy level and thought clarity!  It has made a significant difference in my day to day life.  I would highly recommend giving it a try.  It's the classic, you didn't know how bad you felt until you start feeling better.
 This is a great product however it wasn't strong enough to prevent going to Synthrax. Hoping to get my Thyroid in order and return to using it because it has a great combination of herbs, etc. I found I assimilated it very well when taking a digestive aid otherwise I burped it. Strong and powerful with no allergic reaction problems for me or my daughter.
 I really like the way this formula makes my girlfriend calmer and much less stressed out since she started taking this. Her moods continue to improve and are much more steady. My girlfriend has been diagnosed with hypothyroidism and this product works better than her prescription thyroid medicine that does not seem to do much for her.. I am so glad I bought this for her.
 So, I've only been using the product for a couple weeks so I haven't yet noticed any weight loss. However I will say that I take the supplement when my energy is low and it gives me the burst of energy I need to get through my day without making me jittery.
 Blood test shows that I have hypothyroid status which was associate with IBS, dry skin, lack of energy, bad sleeping.  I am using Thyroid support Complex with Iodine for one month and see fist positive changes after first week. I start sleep whole night, have more energy during the day. My skin became less dry and I start to tolerate more food. My doctor suggest 4-6 month term of using this supplement and we will check my thyroid status. I will update my review with result.
 I love this supplement! I'm already on a thyroid prescription but this gives me an extra boost that I really need. I've been taking this for a month now &amp; I can say I've had a noticeable change in my energy. I take it mid morning &amp; I have sustainable energy throughout the day.
 I tried these as a recommendation from a friend. I have Graves disease and Hashimoto's (Graves is currently in remission, but Hashi's antibodies are present with normal thyroid function) and I can say I definitely feel better taking these. I have more energy and don't feel so tired or sluggish. I'm not a caffeine drinker so I can also say, I don't notice any "wirey" feeling like that whatsover. I'm pretty pleased with them so far!
 I am peri-menopausal and recently read that the fatigue, and general lack of energy usually ascribed to "peri-menopause" was typical but not "normal," but rather the function of a sluggish thyroid - and should, therefore, be renamed "thyropause."  So, I ordered Thyroid Support, and the fatigue is gone and I have more energy.  The pounds haven't started dropping off, despite diet and exercise, like I have read in other reviews, but I am grateful to have my energy/life back.
 The value of this product has been in my improved mood, sleeping better at night, and having gained no weight over the holidays. I have been taking Synthroid 75mcg for over 20 years. For the last 2 years the doctors say the bloodwork results are not giving reliable information, sometimes too high and sometimes too low. I started taking this thinking it might even out these swings that I have definitely felt prior to taking Thyroid Support w/Iodine. I feel this product has given me the boost I needed.
 I have been tiered and sluggish for month now, I was looking for a magnesium supplement on Amazon and came across the 'Thyroid Support' Within a week I felt better!!!!! :)<br/>I didn't buy it for weightloss but I feel like I have lost some weight (I don't have a scale at home) big bonus 🙌<br/>Will pursue again!
 Out of Rx &amp; between ins so tried this to get me by &amp; it does pretty good. Helps alot with most thyroid issues so far, ordered a second bottle!
 Really impressed with this supplement and I'm happy I stumbled upon this brand. Thyroid Support has all the ingredients suggested for my blood type (O-Negative) in one capsule. I take it along with Ginger/Turmeric and feel more energy.
 Nope, just didnt work for me and I work out 4 days a week! Nothing special about this product.
 These really help with cravings and you just genuinely don't feel as hungry when taking these :)
 I've finally found a produce that where my energy is up full throttle, sleep is sweet again, and: my hair is growing back. My bodily systems are starting to heal and work harmoniously again. I am very happy with this produce and will continue to use it.
 My husband suffers with thyroid issues, he is not high enough on the scale to receive a prescribed medicine.  He suffers with extreme tiredness and forgetfulness, etc.  He has been taking this supplement for quite some time now, and wow, it has really given him focus and energy! He forgot to take them for two days during his time on them, and really was exhausted.  If you have thyroid issues, this supplement should be your go to!
 I love this product and this company!  Customer service is excellent and they take a personal interest in your well-being.  The product works for me.  I have more energy and overall just feel better when taking it.
 I have bought it twice already. I have hypothyroidism and I take syntroid but it was not enough. I take my prescribed medicine in the morning and at lunch these pills. I noticed change like in a week.
 Reading the reviews it seems to good to be truth. But we have been taking this for about a month and a half and we noticed within the first 10 days that we sleep better, have more energy and- although we made diet changes- the weight loss was amazing. We have this now on  subscribe and save
 PLEASE SEE THE ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW****<br/>As I stated previously in my review my DR wanted to wait until I could be tested again for Hypothyroidism before he prescribed any medicine.  In the meantime I found this product and began taking it.  I went back to the DR 4 months later and my numbers were in normal range.  My DR was visibly confused and rechecked the original lab work.  I then told him that I had been taking this supplement because it's just not my personality to sit around and wait.  He was so happy, he is a DR who actually believes in supplementation and natural ingredients if they work for the individual.  He went on and on about how happy he was that I didn't wait for him to prescribe something and took my health in my own hands.  I cannot say enough about this product.  Not only are my numbers good I feel great, like the description says I feel like I'm back to my old self.  ****Disclaimer I did receive one bottle free after the purchase of my first two bottles****<br/><br/>I ordered this product after being diagnosed with Hypothyroidism, my doctor likes to wait one month, retest and then prescribe the meds.  In the meantime I decided to try a supplement because the diagnosis explained so much that was going on with me.  Such as tiredness, dry stools, exacerbation of my eczema and depression.  I began taking the supplement (at the time it was the #1 seller on Amazon) on 12/28/2015 and the first thing I noticed was that after 3 days my stools were back to normal.  I've been slightly less tired and my eczema seems to be healing.  I think this is a good product and ordered a 2nd bottle after reading the reviews for other similar products that were also top sellers and had now even taken the #1 spot.  I also like that this product is made in the US.  I hope over time this supplement will provide more relief of my symptoms.
 I just finished a whole bottle of the Zhou Thyroid Support and am happy with the results. I have a very sensitive system and am allergic to many things, but this supplement did not cause any allergic reactions. I was originally just going to buy Ashwagandha by itself but saw an ad for this product and read all the positive reviews and decided to give it a try. I have not been diagnosed with any thyroid issues but am under a lot of stress and can benefit from taking this supplement as a precautionary measure, as thyroid issues do run in my family. I will buy this product again. I have nothing negative to say about it.
 This really worked for me along with my levothyroxine.. I have hashimoto's thyroiditis and im always sluggish and fatigued this product helped me.
 I cannot adequately express the improvements in my mood, energy, clarity, focus, and metabolic processing this little green pill has made.  Hashimoto's Thyroiditis is NO small matter even with a T4 prescription!
 My wife and I both started taking these we are highly active and spend most of our time crashing. They have given us both a good boost on energy and i feel like i wanna hurt people less on them (:
 This product is AWESOME! I don't think I could go without it. This really works very well and will give you a boost of energy and just make you feel better overall. It also seems to help regulate your sleep cycle. This is one of the finest products me and my family has ever used.  I can't recommend it more highly!
 A little more than two months ago someone drew my attention to the fact I was having symptoms relating to my thyroid. I have several family members stuck on thyroid meds for life so I wanted to try supplements first. This product had what I was a looking for and great reviews so I gave it a try. I am so grateful I did. In the first week on it my double chin and round puffiness in my face disappeared. Even my husband noticed. In the same week or two I noticed my energy levels had increased and my mind was not as foggy. These things had been creeping up on me and I didn't notice, or attributed them to aging, so when they left I felt absolutely amazing.<br/>When I don't chase it down with food I end up with one or two peppery burps that remind me to grab a snack.<br/>I highly recommend giving it a try. I am so thrilled that I did, it is making a great difference in my life.
 Boosted energy and is available at a great price.  Really prefer a more natural easy to boost the thyroid rather thsn taking a perscription medication!  Love the Prime option so when I realize I'm low I can have another bottle in just a couple days!
 I am very happy with this product, I feel more alert and vibrant. I also take Armour Thyroid medicine. My mom and my 11 year old daughter are both taking one a day(other vitamins contain some iodine already). Found out about Armour and low Iodine from 2 different women's magazines, not doctors.
 I have been taking this supplement for about a week or two, and I do think I've noticed a positive difference. At first I only did one pill to acclimate myself, but now have started the full serving size of two pills. I feel like I have more energy (even after a long day), am more alert at work, and have less soreness/fatigue. The shipment arrived in the expected ETA, and I even received follow up emails from Zhou Nutrition. So far, my experience has been good, and although I'm not a doctor I would recommend this product for anyone with Hypothyroidism/Hashimotos, Fibromyalgia, or Chronic Pain Syndrome.
 I love this product I begin taking. 2 capsules. Twice a day. I open it and sprinkle the powder on my food and it  starts to work  less than a week. I highly recommend to anyone suffering with thyroid disorders
 thanks to You Tube and Amazon I'm not a slave to my money hungry doctor and his 500 dollar office visit and semi-annual blood test! Take this product and change your diet, watch Dr. Bergman's videos on thyroid and love your thryroid and it will love you back!
 After 2 weeks useing it started to feel differently, no more sleepy and tiredness no matter how many hours you sleep. A bit weight loss and today finally woke up well rested after 7h of sleep and before my alarm amazing 🤓
 I could tell an improvement but I will need to try for another 30 to 60 days to know for sure &amp; to what extend.  Was going to try a different brand but will stay with this one long enough to see how well it works.  I know natural products can take awhile b4 you see maximum results.
 This is exactly what I've needed to get back on track with the thyroid support I need. I was taking it until it got packed for a move. Was full of energy for the move, but a few days after stopping taking it, I felt a loss of energy. Well, it's back out of the boxes and I am taking it again and starting to feel better already.
 I use this product every day. Along with my regular thyroid prescription. I find it has helped regulate my levels and help me daily. I have a allergy to seafood and fish but I can take this with no problems at all. I would recommend if tou have thyroid issues.
 I took this supplement and loved the energy and focus and general improvements like that. But it made me snore. I thought I was going crazy or had a sinus infection. I spoke to a doctor who said that yes, changes in thyroid function will lead to apnea and snoring.<br/>I had not heard of this. So buyer beware.
 Zhou products are very good and the company is great to work with!  Everything was just as expected.  I added this to my routine in search of weight loss and appetite management but I didn't notice a change in how I felt.  I don't fault the product.  Weight loss is just very challenging!
 I've been taking a thyroid support supplement for years to boost an under-active thyroid. When I went online to order from my usual supplier, their website was down, and I was almost out of product. I was so happy to find this supplement on Amazon! It seems to be working well to keep my thyroid up and running!
 I take a prescription for an under active thyroid. When I brought this to my Dr's attention she was skeptical but stated "it's all natural,  we can give it a try". My thyroid is no longer "leveled out" it's in gear! I love this product, I feel better than I have in 4 years!
 the day i received my Zhou Thyroid Support I took one that night. the next day i woke up feeling great. No kidding. I have thyroid nodules and we have really incompetent medical care in our small community so i thought I'd give it a try since finding a really good endocrinologist is next to impossible unless you can afford holistic care. I also have MS and thought that was why i was feeling so bad for so long but this product proved otherwise. I ordered my second bottle last night. I would recommend Zhou thyroid support to anyone with thyroid issues. In fact, I already have. It's just a matter of them listening.
 This arrived on time, and the pills aren't too big, they go down easily with no smell or taste. Those are the main positives. I've used this product for about 2 weeks..2 pills every day except one day that I forgot. I do seem to be eating less, I can go longer without having the urge to snack in between meals...I feel fuller for longer. What I'm really looking for is the promised energy gain. Can't say I've seen a change in that aspect but I will report back when I've used the product more consistently. No complaints, just waiting for more of an effect over time : )
 My thyroid was cancerous and was totally removed a few years ago. The replacement meds often leave me feeling very tired and my brain is foggy. This is what led me to try Zhou’s thyroid support. It has made a tremendous difference!!! My brain feels so much clearer and I have much more energy! Thank you for an excellent product, I will be purchasing again.
 My thyroid is low, but not low enough that the docs want to prescribe medication, so I've tried this to help.  I haven't had my thyroid retested, but I do feel like there's been some progress in my energy levels, which I'll take any day of the week! I'll continue using this.
 This stuff is amazing!  I've been taking it for a week along with DHEA. What a difference. I truly feel like my old self!  I have energy but not like a caffeine jittery energy. I am focused during the day and and sleep well at night. Just don't take it too late in the day. This stuff is gold!  Even improved mood!
 Very happy with this product. I have been taking it for about a month, and have ordered my second bottle. I have not lost weight (sadly) but I have been sleeping better and my hair feels amazing! Energy level has gone up a bit. I will let you know about changes after the second month. I have recommended this tho several friends.
 I really was hoping these would work for me after reading all the positive reviews. Unfortunately I experience the same side effects as a few others. I get headaches and dizziness within an hour. Makes me feel weird and tired. I was hoping these side effects wouldn't last long. I am only 4 days in but all 4 days I felt the same after taking them. Oh well just wasn't for me.
 Zhou thyroid support seems to be just what I needed to kick-start my sluggish thyroid and improve my health over-all.  So happy to have found it.  I've been taking 2 caplets daily for 4 months and am very happy with the results.
 I was recently taking a diet prescription and when I quit it (only was allowed on for 3 months) completely stripped me of all my energy!! I decided to try thyroid supplements and seen this had the best reviews! I gave it a try and am not long tired!
 This bottle has restored life in me again. I haven't checked the scale, so I don't know if I've lost any weight yet, but I feel amazing.
 have been taking this for 6 weeks now- and for the first time, my thyroid function was in the upper range of normal! i am taking these in addition to the levoxyl, so hope to cut down on the levoxyl dose.
 First of all: I have HYPERTHYROIDISM/GRAVES DISEASE and didn't exactly purchase this because of the reviews considering hardly anyone says specifically what thyroid issues they have. So it's trial and error for me. After 1 month I can say this about my symptoms: Maybe 1 or 2 heart palpitations (that's excellent), no excessive sweating, and have been sleeping well ( although I have a baby so when I sleep I sleep hard). My hair was falling out by the clumps but I've noticed in the second month of these it's falling out less and less. I will continue to take these instead of medication from the doctor and instead of 20 other vitamins and herbs each day. Overall this product is helping my symptoms and I would recommend it.<br/>Update: After 2 months of using this my hair is growing back! Zero heart palpitations, and sleeping well. Also my look better than they have in awhile.
 Tried it for awhile and so far didn't see any difference at all with it. I was mildly active and dieted as best as I could, but I guess it just wasn't for me. I even gained some weight surprisingly since taking this and so since have stopped taking it. Still have mental fog and fatigue though that could be due to other issues as I suffer from bad seasonal allergies; however, I know I'm suffering from low metabolism as well. Perhaps my thyroid isn't the problem, but this was still worth a shot. I'll have to try something different.<br/><br/>EDIT: Terrific Customer Service<br/>I was pleasantly surprised when the company responsible for this product provided me with a full refund! Its part of their Money Back Guarantee. (I'll admit that I was ignorant of this). As a result, I've decided to change my review to a full 5 star because not only do they have a money back policy, but they have honored it - and in such a short amount of time too; not all companies are this sincere and steadfast. Even though this product did not work for me, it seems to be working for plenty of other people and it deserves the five stars for the excellent customer service alone.<br/><br/>Thanks Zhou Nutrition!
 I'm giving this five star based quality. I have only use for a few days, so I have not seen any changes yet. However, I would order again as this has the supplementation that every thyroid patient needs.
 After reading quite a bit about low thyroid and also selenium deficiency, I decided to give this a try.  I am 60 and a teacher and have found myself really dragging at the end of the day - just coming home and feeling profoundly exhausted (more than the usual "teacher exhausted").<br/>Supplements usually need to be taken for several months before results are seen, so I've just been taking two of these each day without any grand expectations.  But about two weeks after I started, it dawned on me that I was no longer feeling that deep tiredness that I'd been struggling with.  I feel more alert and my energy stays very even all day long.  And when it is time for bed, I can fall asleep quickly and deeply.<br/>I'm ordering more - I'm very happy with this product!
 Tried this product for three months with no noticable difference in energy or weight.
 I was feeling very run down with incredible brain fog, so I looked into supplements to help as I had a deadline coming up and needed energy. I purchased this product after reading the reviews and info about the thyroid. I'm so glad I did! This product is AMAZING, I am sleeping better, waking up refreshed, and maintaining great energy throughout the day. My mood seems better (perhaps because I'm not fighting exhaustion all day) and I'm finding both mental and physical labor to be a breeze. I will be using this wonderful stuff for the foreseeable future.
 I purchased these Thyroid Support Complex supllements for my partner due to her thyroid issues and her lack of energy.  She noticed an increase in her energy levels the very same day she started taking them which I think is awesome. She noticed that her energy levels gradually increased every day she took them for the first 5 days or so. She currently takes synthroid(prescription thyroid medication) and we wanted to try her on something else that is more natural and healthier and this is doing the job. Thanks Zhou Nutrition!!!!!!
 This is a great product that does what it says.  I was having problems with low thyroid, low energy, poor sleep quality and after taking this product, I feel so much better.  I would recommend this product to anyone.
 I bought this supplement because of those great reviews.  I only took this supplement for 5 days but I got headaches and dizziness.  And plus!  All of sudden I gained 4 pounds!!!  I just asked for return this item.
 I do not see the benefits everyone has been extolling. I am going to try the liquid version next time. No burst of energy, clearing of brain fog.... Disappointing.
 I have been more than pleased with Zhou Nutrition's Thyroid support, noticed a marked improvement in my health, this isn't an isolated incident either, I have been a fan of Zhou Nutrition's line of products for more than two years,  best bang for the buck!
 This definitely helped with energy and overall just not feeling bleh. It also helped some with swelling I have from arthritis, which isn't at all the point of the supplement but hey! I'm happy for it! Have recommended to a couple of family members with thyroid disorders.
 While I have only taken this supplement for one month, I have noticed that I am waking up with more mental focus and not so groggy. I have suffered with hypothyroidism for twenty years and have never taken anything like this. Happy to have found it!
 Thank you for making this an option!<br/>On my doctor's recommendation, I  began taking this 3 months ago, while at the same time slightly increased T-3-- and have been feeling good!  Thank you for making this an option for us!  I've recommended it to several others who have ordered it.
 I am still on my 1st bottle, waiting for the brain fog to left but  I am hopeful. It has helped some with energy, I have ordered my 2nd bottle.
 This thyroid support is super. I feel great taking it. The heat from the cayenne is only noticeable in the beginning which is a welcome relief for my sensitive tummy. I like that it's all natural from the seaweed capsule to the ingredients.
 I have a complete thyroidectomy so this pill doesn't last long. I do get spurts of energy but I crash after. Works better than coffee. It's only been 2 days of me using this product so maybe using it longer I will see a better result.
 Great product.  Within a couple weeks I was feeling the difference. I will continue this product and Have been telling people about it in my thyroid support group.
 It is so uncomfortable that you need to take too many supplements (like four or five) This complex with iodine has it all for support. Feel good and only one twice daily. Amazing.
 I take this and a few other supplements. This brand is my favorite and I continue to buy their products. Sense a difference and no issues with the digestion of it or burping up the taste. Commuted to this brand now, love all their products.
 Not impressed at all. The bladderwrack shouldn’t be taken by mouth. This just really didn’t help me at all.
 Since starting the thyroid supoort I have noticed an increase in energy and my hair isn’t falling out like it was. I have been on thyroid medication for years and am no longer taking prescription medication. I was only taking one a day but increased to two!
 I was skeptical about trying these pills at first. There were lots of good reviews that helped me decide in the end. I am not sure if I instantly felt a difference but since taking these pills I am more awake and focused. For as long as I can remember, I have tried everything for energy and nothing worked. I would recommend this product.
 Okay, so I'm now going on my third bottle of this stuff and so far so good. I would absolutely recommend to anyone.  But, the strange thing that I want to embarrassingly mention is that because of my hormones being out of whack, I might have a period once a year. I don't know if it's coincidence or not but taking this supplement has maybe balanced something because I've had 2 periods now. If you aren't having any periods either maybe this will help you too? I don't know if that's what has restarted them but I have to suspect.  Awesome stuff if so.
 I have struggled with my weight since i was 12 or even younger. Just a month ago I can across this product and though let’s give it a shot. I have family history of thyroid issues. So about two weeks in I noticed my energy was way up and I wasn’t dragging through the day. By week three I was noticing a dip in weight. Ok not a bad start. Well onto week six and I am steadily loosing weight about 2 pounds a week. I can’t complain about that. I am yet again beyond thrilled to have found Zhou and all of their wonderful products
 Too soon to tell if it's working. I'm only halfway through the bottle. I took another brand of thyroid support and while I didn't lose any weight it gave me an overall sense of well being and I felt stronger while working out.
 I’m still finishing up my first bottle... But, as a mom of 4 young kids and a busy lifestyle, I found myself more tired than i feel I should be! Like, well beyond normal mom fatigue. Anyways since giving this a try I’m happier with my energy levels. I still want to get my thyroid checked but this is beneficial in the meantime!
 I'm a healthy young woman who eats well and exercises, but I get big cravings for food, even when I'm full. I also tend to crash around 3pm and crave carbs. I read online about overactive thyroid symptoms and decided to give these vitamins a try. it's only been 2 weeks but I'm actually impressed by the change. My energy is sustained throughout the day and my overall mood is much more positive. Now I notice when I forget to take my vitamins. I haven't lost any weight, but I'm very happy!
 I had been taking this for a month and felt like I had so much more energy. I ran out of the pills and had not had time to reorder. About a week later I realized I was tired all the time and couldn't figure out why. All of a sudden I realized I had forgotten to order my pills. These pills really do make a difference, I don't think I'll ever stop taking them.
 This is great stuff.  I take it daily to help me remain alert yet sleep better.  I also have a better time with the cold weather--low thyroid can be part of the problem if you're always cold.  So glad I found this!
 I have been taking this for a few days now and it is not a placebo effect.  I really do have more energy.  I have not had any stomach upsets or headaches.  I take one in the morning and one in the late afternoon. I am going to continue to use this product.
 Having studied up on on vitamins and nutrients that are good for a healthy thyroid and energy production, this formula seemed to hit a number of them.  After having taken in for 5 days I definitely find a nice energy buzz within an hour of taking the recommended two capsules.  I definitely do recommend taking them on a full stomach, nothing short as I seem to get a slight nausea if not.  Other than that, no negative side effects.
 I really like this product. I've been taking this for 8 weeks now (I take only 1 caps a day instead of 2) and I do believe it helps me to feel better (I'm hypo) because my constant fatigue has been significantly reduced and I have more energy.
 I have hypothyroidism and bought these when I felt like my thyroid levels were off. Now they didn't help me lose weight. But as for the energy level, yes I didn't feel so bogged down. UPDATE: turns out I had mono on top of everything and these pills kept me functioning and working.
 I’ve been using this for about three weeks now and my hair has completely changed. There’s no longer hair at the bottom of the shower I don’t feel it says dry anymore the fitness has totally changed. I’m  so thrilled!  I also feel like I have less brain fog.
 This was the first one I bought because amazon reviews gave it five stars and the first dose I noticed my energy levels go up. no more afternoon naps
 I had energy and my feet were not freezing anymore. Halelula. In your face hypothyroidism
 I’ve been using this consistently for 3.5 weeks and I don’t feel anything.  I am sure it works for some people but not for me<br/><br/>UPDATE:  I just received an email from the CEO of this company and they issued me a full refund.  I will say that was not what I was expecting and what amazing customer service!  Thank you so much.
 I haven't seen any weight loss since using this but it has only been a month.  I have noticed a difference in energy level and ability to sleep soundly through the night. So I will try another month and see if it continues.  Would recommend giving it a try.
 I love this stuff! I have suffered from extreme fatigue and hair loss since having my children and I have noticed a remarkable difference since starting this a couple weeks ago.
 Although I like the ingredients in this supplement, I've not noticed anything after several weeks of taking it. I will say that Zhou Nutrition seems to be very eager to please its customers and gave me a refund.
 Re-ordered it so I could take it longer it's hard to tell about thyroid and how it works in your system after prescription thyroid before to help me control my weight and my energy I will give it some time  to take a fact I think it's going to work I'll let you know later
 I have been using this product for about a year and can honestly say that I have more energy and feel more alert than in previous months. My general well-being has improved and my fluctuating levels of tiredness have also improved as well as my quality of sleep. It is a relief to feel more like me again!
 It's been a month since I started taking this and I am still as impressed! With the first pill you will notice a boost in your energy. It's been a lifesaver with a busy school schedule and I make sure to never miss a pill!
 I love this stuff! I feel more energetic, awake and focused during the day.
 I have purchased a 2nd bottle of the thyroid support because it worked for me. I now have improved energy and I can feel that metabolism has now kicked in a little faster than before which is helping me with my weight loss. Overall I will keep purchasing this product even when I reach my ideal weight to maintain my energy level and metabolism. Thank you Zhou Nutrition.
 In about 3 days,  and immediate difference in my energy level. I found that I was more energetic, more focus, and just generally with more clarity. I highly recommend this item to everybody not just for weight-loss but also for general life happiness
 Full disclaimer, I don’t have any known thyroid issues. I bought this because it claims to increase focus and metabolism and I’m almost 50 years old and could use a little help with both. I did not experience any effects from this supplement.
 In just a few days, my energy level increased, I no longer have to take a nap in the middle of the day! My circulation has improved significantly, I no longer have cold hands and feet.  And best of all, because I am sleeping better, due to regularly taking this product, I am alert and can better focus on tasks art projects.  I highly recommend this Thyroid Support product, I am happy with the physical and mental support it has added to my life.
 After starting on these I find that I have steady energy. Not the jitters or that useless energy feeling. It even helps me get up in the morning.If you have mild anxiety before starting the day it's also helpful for that. Of all the OTC stuff I've tried this is one that actually works.
 My sister-in-law has been taking levothyroxin for years. she lost her insurance so she was unable to get a refill. She tried this and says she feels 1000% better. She’s continuing to take this and doesn’t want to go back on the Levi! ( consult your doctor! IM NO DOCTOR)
 Ordered my fist bottle based upon the great reviews, have been taking it for less than a week, and ordered my second bottle today to ensure I'd have another on hand. I've struggled with lethargy for years, so much so that making plans on the weekends has been challenging as I'm often just too exhausted, and running on caffeine. Weight up and down as well. Can honestly say I've noticed an appreciable difference in energy in just the last few days, and that in itself is pretty amazing. Will continue ordering, and absolutely recommend.
 Even though I wasn't diagnosed with thyroid issues, I have all they symptoms of thyroid. I started taking these almost 3 weeks now and I can definitely tell a difference in my overall well being. I am confident with these supplements that I now have them auto shipped.
 This product is amazing, I am 54 years old.  I have chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, IBS, Palpitations and other unexplained maladies.  I have been taking this product for almost a week.  And I am starting to feel clean energy.  My mental alertness has woke up, the brain fog is subsiding.  I have tried everything for the last 30 years.  I highly recommend this product.
 i have noticed a slight improvement in my energy but none in the thyroid function.  I will keep taking it.
 I take synthroid but it doesn't always allieviate my symptoms completely or give me back the energy I need to function. This product does give me my energy back.
 Bought it and after a few days of taking it I have absolutely no complaints. I do have more energy and sleep much better and do not feel sleepy throughout the day. Blood pressure is great, my mood is more consistent, and even lost a couple inches off my waist.<br/><br/>As someone with hypothyroid issues I also noticed that my neck (where I have two goiters) has become noticeably smaller. There is an amazing change in my body temp because I no longer feel cold in my fingers and toes nor do I have the semi-tingling feeling either.<br/><br/>Great buy for anyone needing an extra boost with thyroid health.
 I have a extremely slow metabolism and thyroid problems run in my family.  I decided to give this a try.  Two easy to swallow capsules a day and I have noticed a change after a few weeks of use
 i do take a prescription and was hoping this would help compliment it but I dont feel any benefit! dont waste your money.
 These Thyroid pill work really good, I am still taking them, I have no problem with them, just how good they make me feel
 So far so good!  I feel a little boost of energy in my day to day and have found it easier to wake up early in the morning.  looking forward to trying this over a few months to see how it affects me.
 I have so much more energy after taking this supplement for a month!! The first couple days I couldn't sleep at night (even though I was taking it first thing in the morning). But now I sleep better than ever. I highly reccommend this product. I've even lost 5 pounds and I'm the kind of person no matter how much diet and excercise I could never seem to lose weight.
 I'm on my 2nd day of this. I'm not so sure about energy yet. I can say it has somehow magically stopped my cravings. I don't need to stuff myself to handle life. Anxiety, depression were 2 big triggers for me. Yesterday, my first day and today so far, I am not obsessing about food. So, I'll say so far I'm satisfied. Shipping was fast.
 I just ordered my third bottle! Since I started taking these I have more energy and feel better all around!
 I was on Armour Thyroid medicine but my Doctor passed away. So the new Doctor didn't like that medicine nor did he believe I needed it. I became sluggish and bloated. When I found your product life became good again.
 I love this stuff! I have hypothyroidism and have not been able lose weight since before my diagnosis. This product is like magic. I am losing weight! Its amazing!
 Product is as described and did arrive promptly. I really believe this product works. After 3 days i have felt a renewed sense of well being. I feel more motivated and i really feel like my metabolism has kicked up a gear..GREAT PRODUCT. Ordering me a few more bottles
 Just re-ordered my 3rd bottle of this. It has given me a boost of energy during the day, and I've been sleeping great! I don't have diagnosed thyroid issues, but I've been feeling great on these pills. Give the a try.
 My doctor recommended me a thyroid support, didn’t said the brand, so I practically guest....but it works, I take every day 2 pills at lunch time, so I Feel better, with more energy, less tired.
 This is a great product.  I take two a day as directed and eat a healthy diet and I have finally started to lose weight.  It does everything it says it will do.  I am very happy with this product.
 I was taking this along with my lexo200mg I'm down to my last three pills. I just realized a few days ago how so much better I feel.  This product has changed my life. I'm amazed how I feel so much better taking this product. I have more energy, my bones don't ache like they were.  I will be ordering it again.
 It's ok, I feel this is a product that would need to be used all the time to work like its supposed to, the cost is more than I'd like to pay, therefore I won't purchase on a regular basis. So chances are it won't be used on a regular basis.
 I started taking this when I wasn't able to take my liquid iodine. It's really been a life saver! When the depression, anxiety and tiredness starts to hit and I am out or when I am not home this really brings me back around. The other ingredients besides the iodine are very important to the thyroid.  The only negative is that it contains soy - how much it doesn't say. Considering how thyroid friendly all the ingredients are I am surprised to find soy. But so far, so good!!!
 After 1 week of taking my hair has stopped fali g out and my fingernails are stronger. I take a million supplements and often get vague resulta, but this will be one of the 3 Ill never live w out!
 While all of my thyroid tests come back normal i i have a lot of the symptoms of a thyroid disease and have a thyroid history in my family and having a trusted supplment i can take fo help helps ease my mind.
 My energy level has increased and I feel like my metabolism has picked up!  I lost a pound and a half in one week and am hoping to continue with this in conjunction with eating better (this helps me make better choices because I see it is now possible to lose weight with a product)! Thanks to Zhou Nutrition for making something I can recommend with no hesitation!
 I like all the thyroid support ingredients.  I was purchasing many separately to address my hair loss issues. I’m only a half bottle in, so it’s too early to tell if it will help.  I do like other products from Zhou Nutrition.  Great company.
 i have been on prescriptions for my thyroids for a few years now and NO i did not feel no were as well as when I started this product. Nature is always the best rout to go unless you really are in need....
 I fee this has helped a lot. I have actually lost some weight coupled with fasting and eating right but I know this contributed as well.
 After reading all of the amazing reviews, I though “what the heck”?  I’ve almost finished my first bottle and I can honestly say it has improved my energy, which in turn has improved my mood!  I’m in Sales and have noticed a positive difference in my sales numbers, I get more done during my day, and have actually been eating less. I don’t have cravings for fast food and sugar like I used to, even salty treats can’t temp me. I look forward to what my next bottle will bring and highly recommend giving it a try yourself. It took me about two weeks before I noticed a difference, so hang in there.
 After years of staying the same weight, after starting these supplements, my weight is falling off. I feel like I have a new lease on life! Happy, Happy.😊
 I can't live without this. I now have it on auto delivery.  (I have never liked anything enough to put it on auto deliver)
 Taking this product has made such a difference in my energy levels. I am really impressed with this product.<br/><br/>Chris
 Did not work for me. I’ve been suffering from hypothyroidism for over 15 years. I saw no change in mood or energy with this product 😔
 I felt a real lift in energy and motivation without the buzz. Not a big change in weight yet, but i will use another bottle to see.
 Increased ability to focus, more energy, over all just feel better withinva couple weeks.  Also I only take 1 pill daily with my other regular vitamins. Definitely recommend if you haveca medical thyroid disorder. (taking in addition with  prescription medication)
 this product help me have the energy of a normal person vs the sluggish always tired person I was. It doesn't "give you a buzz'" nor leave you feeling jittery. I believe the next best thing would prescription thyroid medication.
 I have suffered chronic exhaustion for 18 years. Doctors claim there's nothing wrong with me. I decided to try this. The first day I used this I was able to fold the laundry by myself! Hopefully I will continue to improve.
 I really noticed an increase in my energy and my desire to workout. I also lost 4 lbs the first week I took them and continued to lose about 2lbs per week after that. I was working out but not much was happening before I started taking these. I will order again.
 I don't know why it helps but it does. I take it with my thyroid medication and frankly, I just feel better with it. I still have bad days, just not as often. Even when I have bad days, they aren't as bad as they are when I don't take the supplement.
 Thyroid is a very important factor to balance besides regular exercise and diet. This is the real deal and I recommend it.
 Didn't have any negative reactions or anything but I didn't notice any benefits either. I'm giving 5 stars because they offered a complete refund and were fabulous to work with. I wish all Amazon sellers were like this! Thanks!
 I love this thyroid supplement. I purchased this particular Thyroid Supplement for all reasons advertised.  I can truely say it works..I needed to have that extra energy boost with out the ribbed up stuff in other products. .don't give up you must remember to take more than a few bottles in order to see like weight loss etc., it will come and well worth the money. I have used several other thyroid supplements in the past;  but, now I don't switch or give up..go ahead you might even find you sleep better I did.
 I have taking it every morning for a month and I’ve definitely seen improvements.  I lost 6 pounds without doing anything else!
 Upset my stomach , Had  no hassle with a refund
 Did not notice any changes, although that could be because I am getting plenty of what this product offers already (as opposed to it being a poor product), but no way to be certain. Likely will not finish the bottle. I will say that the company seemed to have good customer service and works to keep you as a customer.
 Great product! Unfortunately not for me.<br/><br/>UPDATE: Although it didn't quite work for me, the company went out of their way to fully refund me due to my frustration.<br/>5 stars for great customer service! Will try other products and am hopeful results will be different.
 I've been using Thyroid Support Complex for about 2 weeks now and have noticed an increase in energy level and focus with no side-effects. Hoping through continued use, that it'll help me increase my metabolism.
 I received the product on time. I’ve only been taking it for a few days but I’ve already noticed a difference. I have more energy and I feel more alert. I’m looking forward getting more results from taking this product.
 product did not work for me and always gave me bad headaches
 This really works I’ve losy 10lbs in month and I have more energy. Plus it’s not just iodine in this. It has all of the minerals we lack. I gave some to a friend that is very over weight and he lost 5 lbs in one week. He’s totally hooked too!!
 I'm normally not one to use supplements, but since Hashimoto's broke out, I have been having problems focusing despite the fact that my hormone levels are under control (taking Synthroid). Definitely talk to your doctor when you're on any kind of meds before taking supplements! I've been taking this and the Neuro Peak for little over a week now and the results are stunning. The brain fog is gone, I can think straight again, and my focus is back. I'm happy! (Note: I'm not taking it for the purpose of weight loss, so I can't comment on that, but my general well-being has significantly increased since I've been taking it)<br/>Edit: Almost a month in and still experiencing the positive effects, so I switched to a subscription.
 I have always had a really slow metabolism and I've always thought that maybe it could be due to my thyroid. I strength train 6 days a week and do 20-30 min of cardio 5 days a week. I normally only eat bad on the weekend. You'd think with this strict regimen and this level of activity that I'd have the metabolism of a teenage boy. WRONG-O. But this stuff right here... amazeballs. I take them with breakfast and they are an essential part of my day. My mood is great, I can eat like a normal person without guilt and I sleep like a kitten. Don't get me started on the energy level, I don't even need preworkout anymore! I will be saying "Shutup and take my money" again and again. Thank you Zhou Nutrition for this life-changing supplement.
 This has definitely helped boosted my energy and level of tiredness.  I have been taking it for 3 months and my immune system has also made an improvement too !  I will be staying on this !!!! Thank you :)
 WHen taking this supplement, I feel more energized, alert, and less sluggish. Very helpful. Not sure if it as helped my thyroid functioning though
 I take synthroid for thyroid related health issues, and this supplement is a great addition to my daily regimen. Although my body didn't respond to this supplement fairly quickly,  I  now notice increased mental alertness and increased energy levels.  Also, the support staff at Zhou nutrition were very helpful in answering my inquiries regarding this supplement.
 A great product. I shopped around and found that most thyroid supplements have identical amounts of vitamins and minerals. I did like that this one uses the methyl- form of B12. I've found that if I take the pills with a high fat meal/snack, I absorb the minerals better and feel amazing!! I've been known to take an extra when I'm particularly foggy/stressed, and it gets me back on my feet every time.
 I did not notice a significant change, but then again, I only had a bottle. Most meds and supplements need 90 days before getting the full benefits. I would, however, give 5 star compliments to their amazing customer service’s promptness and politeness. Thanks!
 I have a difficult time waking up in the mornings (often wanting to stay in bed until 1-2 pm, despite getting plenty of sleep).  I also felt as though I didn't even have enough energy to do simple tasks throughout the day.  This product has definitely improved the condition.  I am taking it along with DHEA.  I feel more at ease throughout the day (less impending-doom stress feelings).  Along with this, look into adding some adrenal support herbs if you have similar symptoms.
 My husband and I are both trying this. He has a diagnosis of low thyroid and I have some of the symptoms. A friend is trying another brand and having some improvements so I went on Amazon and researched and found this brand. So far I notice that I have some decrease in appetite and feel like an increase in sustained energy. I'm also taking a great mineral supplement and the combo may be part of the improvement. I am using this for improvement in metabolism, weight loss assistance, hair growth and possibly improved mental clarity. Will have to wait until I start my next round of classes before I can see if there is an improvement in concentration and memory :-)  My husband works the midnight shift and says his clarity and energy are more reliable now too (on the mineral and thyroid support combo).  This formula has more of the key ingredients and additional ingredients compared to my friends formula so I'm hoping for continued improvements.  She is having new scalp hair growth but it took three months or so for that to be noticeable. We are on month two so time will tell.
 I think the thyroid support works great and notice a sluggish difference when I haven't taken the daily dosage. As I am taking the supplement due to a family history of thyroid issues, hoping that it will prove its worth in the long run. Please continue to make natural/vegan products that actually work!
 First off, I don't suffer from any hormonal issues like hyper or hypothyroidism, so I can’t comment on mood highs, lows or crashing. My mood is normal and has been the same since starting this supplement which is good news. I was interested in trying this though because I currently have large thyroid nodules and wondered if this would somehow impact the growth which was pressing into my throat. I’ve been taking this product consistently for 20 days now and actually can say that the effects seem to be promising. My hope was that the effect would be immediate and that I would see a significant difference but that’s definitely being naïve and it’s clear that this will take time. Over the first week I saw no noticeable changes, the pills were inconvenient increasing my daily pill count from 3 to now 5 since you will take 2 a day to meet the daily serving. Over the second week I took them daily as recommended and didn’t really focus much on if they were improving my thyroid but I believe it was. Now about 20 days in I have noticed what seems to be small reduction to a large nodule and in general feels softer (like a raw chicken breast instead of a hard baseball). Before it was very hard and pronounced when I swallowed but now it seems to have some “give” when I swallow if that makes sense. I’m going to continue this supplement for at least 6 months to see where it takes me and if the results continue to be good then I’ll definitely continue to take this for as long as I can get it.
 no extra energy, I haven noticed a thing and have been taking it for 2 weeks. But was amazed the company made it right without any hesitation , I will more then likely be trying another one of there products at some point as they where so great about everything!
 Very happy with this product. I've been taking Thyroid Support for about 3 weeks. It makes a tremendous difference in my energy and clarity. I have not yet had my thyroid tested, but in reading around on various causes of weight gain and brain fog, I began to suspect that I was struggling with hypothyroidism. I thought I was just having symptoms of aging, but this has been so effective in giving me back my energy, clarity, and overall sense of well-being that I feel like now I SHOULD go have my thyroid checked by a doctor. Taking Thyroid Support has been a very inexpensive way to test this theory, and the results have been outstanding. I'm not happy that I may be walking around with undiagnosed hypothyroidism. But I am happy and grateful that I found a supplement which is effective in combating its symptoms. I really began to feel restored by the third day of taking it.
 I'm actually surprised at how well these work and for a great price! My mood, menstrual, and skin has improved within a week of using these. I was hesitant to try but I'm glad I took a chance!
 I have much more energy since using it but my monthly menstrual cycle has been delayed and now stopped since I started using this product. I love how energetic I was but I am single and surely not pregnant, and no periods since then. I had to stop the product to get my period again...wonder why?
 Love this product!  It's helping me to give me more energy.  Between the RA and Hypo-Thyroidism I battle fatigue a lot and this is helping me to have more energy each day.
 I haven't noticed much in the way of weight loss, however it has given me back some energy and has made me less moody all the time! It was getting to the point where I didn't want to be around myself and something had to be done. Within a few days of taking this I noticed I was getting some of my playfulness and love for life back. I'm almost done with my 1at bottle and will absolutely be ordering some more!!
 I love how much more entergetic i feel on this! It also helped me switch from my prescription to this!
 I haven't noticed a significant difference yet, but it isn't hurting anything. The bottle says I need to take it for 30 days to notice a big difference. I currently take levothyroxin and have added this for thyroid health. I saw another review that someone's hair stopped falling out so if that happens for me, I'll be thrilled!
 Working great for the short time I’ve been using these!
 I've been using this product for several days and feel less moody and more energetic. Less hungry too. I'll be ordering again.
 I tried other thyroid support supplements, but I am back to Zhou! I have Hashimoto's and struggle with fatigue and metabolic issues. I do feel a difference with this thyroid support. Will continue to buy!
 I love these! I have slept much better and have had such an easier time waking up in the mornings since being on these meds. I have lost about 8 pounds in 4 weeks with no diet or exercise changes. I’m also noticing that if I take them with lunch instead of breakfast, they prevent me from crashing around 3 o’clock.
 This product did nothing for me. It's not a replacement for thyroid medication.
 Can't really tell a difference. I was hoping to have some of the benefits others experience. Worth a try. But didn't work for me.
 Did not help me lose weight.  If anything at all, I noticed maybe a slightly *increased* appetite. I do want to say though that Zhou Nutrition has excellent customer service and they aim to please their customers and stand behind their product 100%.
 I bought a bottle 4 weeks ago. It says it may take 3 weeks to tell a difference but I could tell in a week. I had been feeling like I had no energy to do anything but by the end of the first week I was feeling better and every week has been getting better. Just ordered some more.
 This is an Awesome product!! Gives you energy and helps immensely with hair loss. I highly recommend it!!
 This gives me tons of energy without feeling jittery. I am able to exercise for an hour after a long work day, and I don't get sleepy at work. My only advice is to not mix it with lots of caffeine.
 Had such high hopes, especially given the price &amp; reviews. While I'm aware you have to take some things for a while in order for the body to adjust, 10 days was all I could possibly do. Oh man, if you like being groggy and sleeping like a rock, these are for you! I slept more and felt like a zombie the entire time I took these. within 30 minutes of being in my system, all I'd want to do was sleep. upon waking, there was a general cloud of sluggishness that followed me around all day. Tried taking them exclusively before bed to see if crashing immediately helped, but to no avail.<br/><br/>They also caused gastric symptoms. like it felt as though a knot ball was in my stomach and my appetite disappeared completely. the thought of food was a full blown turn off the entire 10 days and for a few after. Ended up losing 3lbs (which, while nice, was really unnecessary as I'm a healthy weight).<br/><br/>overall they were a waste of money in my case.
 There was little to no difference with or without these pills.. That being said I've given the remaining pills (2) to the science department at my college and I have asked that they give me a breakdown of just what is in the capsule. I was contacted by. Zhou in regards to giving me a refund as part of their guarantee but that was 2 weeks ago and I keep getting told to ask Amazon who in turn tells me to ask Zhou. That was one week ago. Still waiting on my refund and communication between Zhou and I has been very poor. No actual C.S. here.
 I purchased this after being diagnosed with PCOS as well as starting a keto diet.  I was losing hair and had heard that iodine can help (especially with PCOS).  I took it and immediately started to feel less fatigued and noticed my hair no longer thinning. I'll continue to take this with my daily supplements.
 Every product that I have purchased from Zhou Nutrition has been outstanding. I finally feel that I have found a company that I can trust for my health. I believe that the Thyroid Support, along with a couple of other products they carry, has been critical in helping me feel more refreshed in the morning with energy throughout the day!
 Take it in the morning! Adds to your focus and regulates the thyroid for better sleep. I've had significantly better nights rest since taking it. Subscribed.
 One of the best thyroid support supplements I've purchased. I feel much more motivated and clear-minded. I started feeling pretty cranky and under-motivated, this partnered with L-theanine and 5-HTP have made me feel so much better.
 I've been really happy with this product, not only is the brain fog gone, but I'm also not living for sugary garbage any longer- or craving it. My thyroid levels are phenomenal, I have energy back and I'm finally feeling more like a human rather than a starving zombie. Highly recommend
 This product has improved my wife's disposition a great deal so we keep using it.  My only request would be to use a smaller capsule.<br/><br/>Thanks for your help.
 I been drinking this supplement for a month now after I was diagnosed with a nodule in my thyroid so after reading the good reviews I decided to give my thyroid some extra support. I do feel more energy so now I’m walking and watching what I eat. I have lost I bit of weight but is not dramatically like 2 pounds now that I’m eating healthier. I’m more focused and happy.
 Im not even sure if i felt any changes but i decided to order another one so what the heck
 I really love this supplement. I've been taking this for a couple of months. I have much more energy throughout the day and more mental focus. I have a surgery coming up and I haven't been able to take them the last few days and DEFINATELY can tell.
 I quit taking synthroid and started taking two pills a day. A month later my doctor said my thyroid tested normal. Couldn't be happier to be taking something with great natural ingredients.
 After taking this supplement for about a week, along with American Ginseng, I started waking up at 6 am very refreshed and rested. (Lately l was so tired, couldn't wake up) I will take at least 6 weeks to update my review. Thanks.
 My doctor was concerned that my thyroid levels were low from Lithium side effect. Started supplement for three weeks. Blood test revealed I was now in the bottom range of normal. This product is part of my daily vitamin routine. Retesting in two months...
 I suffer from hypothyroidism, and my energy levels were very low. I noticed a marked difference in my energy and even my mood the first few days. I am on my second bottle now and I can't say enough good things about this Thyroid Support Complex.
 This product has changed my life.  If I could give it 100 stars, I would. Highly recommend it to anyone who has an underactive thyroid. My quality of life has totally changed. I suffered from extreme fatigue, mood swings, inflammation and severe body aches. ALL of my symptoms are GONE. I am a lifelong customer now. I feel very grateful I found this product; I can enjoy playing with my kids again!!
 I feel so much focused and happier when I use this product. I can definitely feel the difference when I forget to take it. I just hope they never change the ingredients. They seem to be the perfect blend for me.
 Had blood work done showing my thyroid was low... I didn’t want medication before I tried a natural sopplement. After 8 months on this supplement, my blood work is back to normal range!
 This is a great alternative to prescription in my life. I didn’t enjoy the feeling my medication gave me and after reviewing others, I decided on this product and happy I did. It seemed to take about a week but I must say I do feel the difference and will continue this daily. Thank you Zhou for this great product!
 I find this is an excellent product. I would much rather take this, with all the natural ingredients, rather than a thyroid medication prescribed by a doctor!
 Ordered it for the first time and it helped very quickly with energy levels. Beware, you will clean house :)<br/><br/>I am also getting off the thyroid meds and just send for 3 more bottles so I don;t run out. This product<br/>will remain a staple in my house.
 Definitely felt a difference! I went on vacation and forgot it and could feel how much worse I felt! Definitely a product I will be incorporating into my new fitness routine and health goals.
 Thyroid issues run in my family. Grandma, aunt, mom... My symptoms scream thyroid issues, my family HX screamed thyroid issues but like other reviews, my test came back fine too! I started taking these and found a boost in energy. Helped with memory for sure! It makes sense to take a vitamin that takes care of some thyroid symptoms than a regular vitamin that doesn't!
 Boosts thyroid function
 Great product. I definitely have more energy. Second bottle should arrive next week.
 Anyone getting a bloated gut from this supplement? Love what it does for my brain fog and energy...but I’m<br/>Noticing my gut seems awfully bloated since taking it..
 customer service is great! The product works, however I only noticed a slight difference.
 These were really great and I noticed a huge difference within a week of taking them. My energy was up and my cravings were down. It’s a little bit pricey for me to buy monthly, which is super disappointing because it helped a lot.
 Seems to give me more energy as I have not changed any other aspects of my diet and my energy levels are definitely up. A bit of advice: take in the morning - it does affect my sleep if I take it too late in the day. I will continue to take it and can't wait to see if this assists my thyroid.
 Take 2 before I go to work..Wow!! Gives me so much energy for the whole day....It's like Zoom Zoom!!!
 A truly amazing product.....my Dr told me to try a thyroid support I tried a few and they were ok....but when I got this one it changed my life for the better....I recommend this to everyone who needs thyroid support...buy this product....
 I take this about a hour after my levothyroxine and it has helped up the potency of my prescription. No side effects and I am awake and efficient at work.
 I feel so much better when I take a thyroid supplement even thou the doctors have said I have nothing wrong with my thyroid. When taking this I have more energy and all around feel better!
 I have been using this product for 6 mo.. I have seen a difference in my body.  I have lost weight and no more fog...Thanks for making this....
 Didn't do anything for me.
 I started taking these supplements about a month ago and they have really helped increase my energy and metabolism! Obviously along with diet and exercise but I have noticed a huge difference in my body since starting these! Definitely recommend to at least try a whole bottle
 Caused bloating and unwell feeling. Only took for 2 weeks and decided I related the feeling to this product. Been a few days of non taking and the bloating stomach issues are getting better
 Great product! I can tell a difference in just a month! I’ll definitely order again!
 All the nutrients I need in one supplement. Thanks Zhou for making it easy! My energy  has increased and brain fog has diminished since starting this....
 I used to have boundless energy before I got hypothyroidism. This supplement has restored a lot of my lost energy. I have been using it for about a month now and I can actually feel a real difference. I would recommend it.
 I have been taking this supplement for two months and could not be happier with it. I ended up doing subscribe and save so that I never run out. I take antidepressants and anti anxiety medication for my MDD and GAD. But I still felt tired and low on energy. I don't know that I have a thyroid issue but I have always suspected it, however I don't think you have to have one to take this supplement. It improves my mood and energy tenfold. I take this in the morning and have basically weaned off my caffeine fueled lifestyle that left me feeling wore out by the end of the day. I can't recommend this product enough.
 Definitely feel a lot better on these for my underactive thyroid rather than my prescription meds.
 EDIT:I was issued ba refund no questions asked! Worth trying!!<br/> I wanted to like this! But something makes my heart beat fast and make me jittery! :(  I only took one capsule, because I know to start slow, and took it with food. I am very disappointed!
 Great product but it takes a while to be shipped sometimes for some reason. Since most of the time they're arrive the next day after being ordered the day before and other times it takes about a week to get them in my mailbox. But otherwise the pills work I actually feel more energized and I'm not as tired or worn down as I was before.
 I definitely felt more energetic with this product. I got headaches the first few days but that passed. If I missed a day, I could tell the difference in my energy level. Got lots done on the days I took the product! Don’t take it late in the day or you may find it hard to sleep. 😊
 Really seems to be helping my overall energy. I really like this product.
 I was looking for something to try to give me a little more energy. My thyroid medicine didn't see to be doing enough to keep my energy up, yet when tested, my levels were "ok". This has helped. I take it in the morning as some of the other reviews mentioned to do. I would recommend this product.
 This stuff is awesomeness in a bottle! I take along with my synthyroid for hypothyroidism and it seems to help where the thyroid hormone replacement stops. I didn't take for four days at one time and could feel a noticeable drop in energy!!
 I'm a 54 yr old woman who is a vegetarian. My daughter bought this for me for mothers day. It really made me feel myself again. I lost some weight, had more energy, i wasn't so fog headed. I stopped taking after my first bottle and I felt horrible. Even went to the doctor cuz i thought I was having a heart attack. So the last week I've been taking them again. I will keep taking them as long as i can. Thank you for this thyroid support. I love it
 I decided to purchase when I came across this on one of the lightning deals and because we have purchased other products from this company with no problems. I have had symptoms of hypothyroidism for the past year but the tests come back just above the lower end. I read all the reviews and decided that since there was so many positive reviews I would try it. The first 2 days I dropped almost 5 lbs (which I thought was a little too much) and an extra pound the next day. I felt like I finally had all my energy back and thought these were working. It's been a week now and everything has drastically declined. I feel dizzy, nauseous, tired, gained the 6 lbs back, and have been getting bad headaches. Maybe these just don't work for me but I figure I shouldn't have so many side effects still. Sad to waste money.<br/><br/>**update**<br/>I was contacted by the company and they had excellent customer service. They were professional, showed excellent grammar regardless of the some other complaints, and courteous. I'm changing my review to a 3 star because regardless of the side effects I experienced, the product came on time, there were no broken capsules, and overall it seems to be a good purchase for those that have no problems.**
 Careful...you may find yourself runnyng to redt room.  Just did not help me but everyone is different, so might be ok for you.
 While this product may work for some I didn't see any benefits.
 I’ve been using this for a little over 3 months and love it.  I previously took Raw Thyroid, but I find this much more potent.  I noticed I don’t feel tired as much and I have more energy.  Will keep ordering as long as I keep feeling this great!😀
 I have just purchased my next 2 bottles of Thyroid Support Complex. I cannot believe the difference this product has made relative to energy, brain fog, and quality of sleep.  I have the energy to exercise again.  Thank you!
 I have been on it for a month now and so far no weight loss, although I run 3 miles a 3 times a week at least and I am so active on gym. thats plus I am still tired all the time??
 I'd recommend buying it if you're on the fence like I was. After the bottle is gone and you don't have it anymore you really start to notice what it was actually doing for you.
 I have been taking levothyroxin for 25 years, but still struggle with hypothyroid symptoms, even with my TSH in the “normal” range. I purchased this after reading all of the reviews.  I am almost finished with my first bottle, and I am feeling much better. My energy is up, I can focus better, and sleep better.  I convinced my mom to order as well.
 This works great!  I was extremely fatigue from metal toxin illness that effected my thryroid and adrenal glands.  Once I started taking<br/>this, I felt much better.  I take daily and have my normal energy back and can handle work again.  Awesome supplement!!  Life saver!
 Couldn’t tell any difference taking this for 2 months.
 Originally I was using another brand of thyroid supplement, but it was out of stock, so I ordered Zhou instead.  I noticed a big difference between products.  With the Zhou brand, I have more energy and mental clarity.  Plus I love that it is non-GMO.  I have not and will not go back to the other brand after trying this one!
 Great product so far, I have noticed a little more energy.<br/>Being I suffer with hypothyroid, I will continue to use thyroid support. Try it, you won't be dissapointed!
 I bought this to add to my prescribed weight loss medication (phentermine) because after 2 weeks  the medication was no longer effective. This thyroid support supplement (along with a balanced diet and exercise) has been helping me lose weight. I will be purchasing it again.
 I have been using this for a month and have found that I have more energy and  will continue to take it. I have a delicate stomach and I have not had any issues with this product.
 I ordered 2 botttles and had high hopes but I just finished one and I can't tell any difference. I had my TSH test 3 months ago and last week and it was the same. I will take the other bottle and see.
 After two weeks of using this, i seem to have more energy, seem to sleep better, and dont feel as cold.<br/>After two months of using this, i can still make the same claims. Definately worth it for me.
 I'm on my third cycle due to Dr. recommendations  (2nd cycle on this brand) - my energy levels have increased for sure.
 So far so good. I take two pills instead of 8 of my other ones.
 Great product, I will be ordering again.
 I feel good since I started these, i can feel a difference in my energy. I also get "brain fog" really often and I do think this is helping with it. I also started taking b12 so I'm not sure which is making the change or if it's a combo of both. I'm receiving a second bottle so I'll update in another month!
 I just received these a few days ago, so I will re-review once I've finished the full bottle, but I do want to comment to say a few things that I was curious about before taking these. They are pretty large pills, however, I have no trouble swallowing them (I'm not super great with swallowing large pills, so this was definitely a concern!). Also, I quit coffee last week, and the first few days (before I received the pills) were rough, but on taking these, I feel like I have fairly good energy. No brain fog. Not sure if it's the pills, or getting used to not having caffeine. I don't feel jittery or sick when taking these. So far, so good! I'll update these once I'm done with the bottle!
 I didn't experience any uptake in energy. However, the President of the company sent me an email and issued me a refund. That was very impressive.
 I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism a year ago. I will try any and everything to have more energy and increase my metabolism so I was thrilled when I came across this supplement. I am almost done with my first month and plan on reordering for at least 2 more months because that is how long my dr said it should take for me to notice differences. So far, so good!
 Has taken about a week to kick in, but my activity level has increased and appetite decreased
 I am so greatful that i bought this.it helps my hypothyroid a lot like a miracle tablet to me.i would recommend it and deffinitely buy for more.thanks
 I have all the symptoms of thyroid issues but always test negatively at the doctors office so based on other reviews I decided to give this a try.  So far I am a believing this can help me.  I feel my symptoms a little less and I hope with continued use, this will continue to help and make me feel better.  I think it is definitely worth a try!
 These gave me that extra boost without making me feel jittery or nauseous. I would highly recommend them.<br/>Their customer service was EXCELLENT, answering your questions very fast!!!
 I am  completely pleased with this product. I noticed changes within the first week of usage. My energy has gone up, sleep is slowly improving, my hair and nails are even getting better. I chose this one over all the others not because of the lower price (which is actually a bonus) but because it was an Asian product. I knew it would be quality . I am definitely sticking with this. Thank you so much for being such a great product.
 I haven't felt a difference in taking these with my energy levels or focusing. If that's what you are looking for, don't buy these.
 I feel so much better after starting this product. I've now ordered 3 bottles of this brand and plan to stay with this particular product.
 I have used other thyroid supplements for years but this is the best one I have ever used.
 I read all about this product, got it and am taking it and will reorder.  I am trusting I did the right thing!
 My energy on it....great! Off of it.....wow! Awful! I can wake up in the am and not feel like garbage now!
 Seems to be fine. I gave it a 4 star because I haven't gone to the doctor to confirm.
 This has truly been a life saver! After the first couple of days, I noticed a difference in my energy level and my mental clarity! After almost a month, I can't figure out how I ever got through the day without it! It is like I got my old self back again!
 They said they would refund me on all three I purchased and haven't seen it yet. This was two weeks ago. Now three weeks update. I will change my rating to 5 stars if I get my money back.
 I have been taking this fir about three months now. Havent noticed a huge difference, but i am sure it is helping more than i can see.
 I've been taking the Thyroid Support Complex capsules for just about 1 month...I'm feeling better and more energized. Haven't had my blood drawn to see the clinical effects however hoping there will be an improvement.
 This has helped my energy level.  I'm not as sluggish as I was before.  I feel more calm and focused.
 I am only on my first bottle but I can tell a difference. I am taking one capsule a day for now. My thyroid numbers are low normal so the doctor won't treat. Im just trying to see if a little bit of support will help.
 So far so good! The product seems to be getting things fired back up!  No bad taste, no bad side effects reported here. All good.
 This product is amazing. I have been to specialist and repeated dosage and med alters to get my thyroid disease under control. When it's not-I feel like the walking dead. I tried this abt a year ago after researching some suplimenrs hoping it would help. My sister referred me. She swears by it and her &amp; I won't go without it now either. Take it consistently. I take mine early in a.m. 5sh.
 I took for 30 days and did not notice any differences<br/><br/>**update** received a full refund.  Thank you.
 Started  taking this a few weeks ago! I noticed more energy right away &amp; lost 2 pounds the first week 😀 Great product
 LOVE IT. THANK YOU
 Great product! I’ve been on it a month, and it has helped improve my lack of energy due to hashimoto’s. Hoping it continues to help!
 I have been taking the supplement for a little over 3 weeks now. I have seen a positive difference so far, I would recommend the product.
 I've tried several iodine supplements and have been relatively unimpressed.  Ran across this here on Amazon, read the reviews and decided to give it a try.  I took it for a week and noticed an immediate improvement in my energy levels.  I stopped it for the following week just to verify that the effects were related to the supplement, and my energy level returned to its previous state within 48 hours.  I've been taking it since and am very satisfied with the product and price.
 Have been taking medication for Hypothyroidism for the past ~5 yrs.  This supplement has made a distinct improvement in my energy &amp; moods.
 Great product and fabulous customer service! Will buy it again
 Wonderful product. I've made this part of my regular morning routine. It has made quite a difference in my energy level. &lt;3
 I take so many vitamins and supplements on a daily basis that I don't usually see a difference when I add or take away a particular product.  I noticed a difference right away with this supplement.  I had more energy and just felt better.  I don't take feeling better lightly.  I have struggled with hormone imbalance, insomnia, hypothyroid, and a whole host of other problems for over ten years now.  So when I say a supplement made me feel better, I truly mean it.  For the last 10 years I have felt as though I've been pulling around a giant anvil while carrying a 50 pound weight on my head.  With the right balance of nature thyroid, progesterone, testosterone and this amazing supplement, I finally feel normal.<br/>I have been taking thyroid support for over a month now so I know it's not just a placebo effect.  For the first two weeks I took two a day, then I dropped to just once a day.<br/>In my personal experience, I couldn't take it late in the day though.  If I took it later than 6pm, I had trouble sleeping at night again.  There were a few days that I forgot to take my morning vitamins/supplements until dinnertime, and I didn't think it would be a big issue to just take them,  Those times I laid awake all night.  I now take my nature thyroid by 6am, and my thyroid support at 10am and I feel normal.  For me, that is the highest of praise I can give!
 Is working
 Used this product as directed and didn't see any benefits.<br/>UPDATE: seller stands behind product and gave a refund.
 I have seen an increase in my energy levels. Exactly what I needed.
 Started noticing an increase in energy as soon as I began taking these and do not need to have as much caffeine throughout the day.  Have not seen any weight loss but will take the extra energy wherever I can get it!
 absolutely love this, I believe that this has really enjoy life much better
 So far, so good—no weight loss but more regular sleep/wake cycle.
 Fantastic!  I have tried others, not satisfied with any of them.  Zhou Nutrition has the Best Thyroid Support on the market, I noticed the difference within the first week.  I have more energy now and my hair brush is not filled with hair each time I use it.  Thanks for making it available on Amazon.
 This product is the only one on the market that has helped me control my thyroid issues.  Since taking these pills six months ago my energy level is up and my weight is stable.  I totally recommend this product.
 Works!! I have More energy, no need to take daily naps. Beware of missing a few doses, you will begin to feel like your old run down self. A must have product.
 I personally didn’t notice a difference. I honestly even forgot I had bought and taken these lol
 Thyroid Support gives me the extra boost I need need in the morning and afternoon...I definitely notice when I skip a dose! These green caps are part of my daily am/pm vitamin ritual. I'm proud to say I only take natural supplements--- no meds of any kind!<br/>Thank you : )
 I've used this supplement for 1 month and will purchase again. I've felt less lethargic and my metabolism has improved.
 I was struggling with skin issues of unknown origin: hives, itchy rash and sudden onset hot flashes.  My Dermatologist suggested that the symptoms could be related to Thyroid function, so I tried Zhou Nuttition Thyroid Support Complex...within two weeks, all of my symptoms disappeared.  Highly recommend this product!!
 I will continue taking these supplements, they help a great deal with my energy levels. Lately I was experiencing afternoon burn outs - by 3 p.m. I had to make myself walk around my desk at the office, to stay awake. A couple of weeks after taking Thyroid Support, I noticed a great improvement. My diet and exercise regime remained the same prior and after taking these, so I attribute the increase in energy to these supplements....they work for me.  No more yawning mid day!
 I can't say my energy went through the roof but I will say it has helped me in other ways that are of a great relief so I am happy with the product.
 this is exactly what I needed to help with my borderline hypothyroidism. It helped me feel more energized, had less hair falling out and my skin wasn't as dry.
 Really helps, I have used this for a couple of months. It has increased my energy, better mood. I take three a day before meals. Wish there were more in the bottle because it works so well combine with neuropeak for increased results. Love it! I'm even sleeping better!!!
 Once I stopped taking my synthetic prescription I began taking your thyroid support. I have not had any thyroid problems in the past 45 days. I went for lab work and the results were at a normal range. I truly support this product!
 Love this.  Taking 2 bottles now. It's great. I can def tell my energy level is so much better😊
 Since taking I have noticed a definite increase of energy,  naps now are far &amp; few which is great...Also has helped some with heavy brain fog,as well as helping a bit with  muscle aches...Was so upset as I ordered 2 bottles, and the bottle I was using accidently fell into my kitchen sink while washing dishes &amp; had to throw the whole bottle out as all capsules got wet...:(  Just reordered 2 more..  I have hashimotos, this disease is horrible, but this supplment has helped me have some better days.
 This is a great product! I have more energy in the late afternoon, and am able to sleep soundly all night. This is huge for me, as sleeping has always been a struggle for me.
 I dont know what is in this supplement but ot caused me heart palpitations for a week.<br/>Be careful and research where these products come from....
 Very happy with this product. This is my 2nd bottle and I will continue to reorder.
 If you think you have thyroid issues or have issues....... don’t self treat. Lesson learned
 Didn't really notice any difference at all
 This must work because before I started taking it, I was on 75mg of synthroid for an under active thyroid. My thyroid is now overproducing, so my doctor lowered my doseage to 50mg.
 I felt a change the 1st day of taking..omg..i am 2 months post partum and just didnt feel like myself at all..ive been having some very low lows since the birth of my child..i was desperate..looking for something..anything to help me get back to normal..i am day 3 of taking this and i have not felt this clear..this centered..this balanced for a looooong time..give this a try folks
 This is my second bottle and I feel like it's helping. I feel less tired and to be honest I think my hair has stopped falling out so bad.
 I take thyroid medication daily and regularly tested for correct dosage. Even though nothing has changed in years what has changed is how I feel. Wake up in the morning and feel great, as the day progresses, late morning early afternoon I start getting tired and fatigued. Someone told me about THYROID SUPPORT so I thought I would give it a try. Well it has worked great right from the start, more energy less tired and no fatigue or brain fog feeling. Yes I recommend this product.
 This was ship fast and came in appropiate packaging.  Its not a miracle cure but seems to work. I would purchase again.
 I've only gone through one whole bottle, but I did notice a difference in my energy, and mood. I've been taking Levothyroxine since I was like 8 years old, and my levels have been all over (especially with 2 pregnancies) but since taking these, and having blood work done recently, my levels have greatly improved. Definitely reordering more!
 Great product. Just ran out and I can feel a difference. Helped boost my energy level and feel better overall.
 Love this! Take with the green tea extract. More energy
 This has silica, which makes my back really hurt. I have degenerative disc disease and it aggravates my condition. It did help with weight loss and energy.
 Awesome product and company!  I used to always feel tired, sluggish, and lethargic at work.  I tried multiple avenues to gain energy but nothing seemed to work.  I decided to try the thyroid support and everytime I take them I have energy all day. I'm so thankful for a quality product that actually works!
 Been using for a month, I have noticed more energy - waking up easily and early and energy until I go to bed.  Not jittery.
 I love this Thyroid Support! Such a great combination of powerful ingredients. I have struggled with low thyroid for years; however, when tested it is "low but within normal range" and my physician won't treat it. This natural alternative has been exactly what I have needed!
 I so wanted to come back 3 weeks later &amp; exclaim that this worked for me... but it didn't.  That doesn't mean it doesn't work for some, I'm just not one of them.
 This is a great supplement to have, I notice a difference in my energy and will be buying more.
 Haven't actually noticed any benefit from taking these for the past month.
 Just started using it but like the way I feel so far. Have some more energy and less of an appetite.
 Helped me feel more at balance and energized
 This stuff is awesome! My doctor looked at the ingredients and approved of all of them.
 I totally noticed a difference after just one time of taking this product!! It really does help!! I struggled with brain fog for years, but after taking this I don't anymore. I'd recommend this to anyone with thyroid problems and or brain fog.
 I have been taking this product for two weeks and I have noticed an increase in my energy level and I have noticed my skin is less dry.
 Seems to give me more energy. Forgot to take it today, and I felt more exhausted than usual. Don't seem to have any negative side effects from it.
 I'm new to the hypothyroid world but this supplement is great, I really feel better!
 Took as directed and it had no effect.
 I think this is helping, but cannot be certain, as I have been taking a variety of things daily.  However, overall I feel an improved sense of health, and less fatigue and pain so I will keep this in my daily regimen.
 although i didnt lose any weight with it, it did help me sleep better for a little while.
 i had originally gave this product a 2, but after the customer service for this product got in contact with me, i'm going to give them a higher grade, because they were so nice to work with.
 I wasn't able to finish my bottle of this, but the customer service is top notch. This really is a no risk purchase. You have nothing to lose trying out this brand!
 Great for thinning hair. Who knew?<br/>Started feeling great almost immediately.
 This is exactly as promised, I had less of an appetite more an energy. After 1 month I went done one pant size... I have tried many others and seen zero results. This works
 This product line is awesome.  I just started to use some of their other products and now this.
 I do feel some better but I am gaining weight like crazy and I am very bloated. Must return product its been two weeks.
 Awesome product! Went in skeptical but after just a couple days I could feel a difference in my energy. Unfortunately I ran out last week and before my new order came I could feel the difference. Energy was low, tired in the morning as if I had not slept. So glad new order came today!
 Amazing products! Gained lots of energy and able to workout joyfully.  My thyroid is now under control. Thanks
 Haven't used it long enough to see a difference, but no side effects. Quality product
 Very happy, very good product. I noticed more energy in just a few days. I have reordered and will continue to use.
 This product really helps. I don’t know if I have a thyroid issue but I do know that since I started taking this I feel more energy, less lethargic and have lost weight! I would definitely recommend
 Noticed no change in my thyroid function. Neither liked or disliked. May have been a waste of money?
 Love the supplement! I'm Off my thyroid medicine!! This was the answer and a synthetic drug!
 I have light thyroid issues and started looking for some of the supplements to help. After 2 days I had more energy than the past 3 months.
 I gave their hair product a shot and broke in a rash, they happily refunded my money. The rash went away and gave their Thyroid product a chance as well and same results, a rash. Ugh I can't catch a break!
 Have been taking these for a about 2 weeks and feel no difference :( was hoping to see some benefits by now but the product seems to work well for others. Gave 5 stars for customer service they seem to be very understanding! Thank you for the pleasant transaction.
 Bought 2 bottles. Gave me a lot of energy but made my hair shed and fall out. Really disappointed.
 Great product! Gives me more energy, better sleep and more focused mental capacity! Will buy again.
 I'm on my 3rd bottle!  Increased energy, and I sleep better at night.
 I feel like a new person. No falling asleep in the afternoons! This is an amazing supplement to my normal Armour Thyroid dose.
 Definitely feel better using this!
 I have energy again. I take prescription meds for thyroid, but still tired all the time. This did the trick for me.
 I just started taking this 2 weeks ago and it has given me energy. I can now get back to walking 2-4 miles a day and working out 3-4 times a week.
 Easy to swallow, no after taste. I noticed a marked improvement in energy after around 2 weeks. Will buy again.
 Amazing!!!! I have be vigilant in taking my thyroid support.  I have noticed the difference in my mood and energy as well.
 Quality product. This is very good, opened the bottle and the strong pleasant smell let me know this is not watered down generic stuff. More energy and focus since I started using it. Five stars!
 I have been struggling with lack of energy and weight gain since having a partial thyroidectomy 2 years ago. I am on a super low dose of levothyroxine and my blood work always comes back normal even though I still struggle with symptoms. thyroid support has changed my life.  In one month of taking feel so much better- more energy and motivation to work out again.
 This has helped me out tramendesly. I don’t feel as tired and I have more energy.
 I just feel better when I take the two capsules daily. I have more energy and I am more clear cognitively.
 I have a lot of the signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism, however my blood tests come out okay. I have not been tested for Hashimoto's, but I'm suspecting I'm somewhere in that direction. So, I thought I would give this a try based on the reviews. I normally sleep between 7-9 hours and still wake up so tired that after I get the kids off to school, I would fall asleep on the couch for another couple of hours. I just never seem to have any energy. I also need to loose weight, which nothing seems to work. I started taking the Thyroid support and within a couple of days, I noticed a huge difference!! I sleep better at night and I no longer nap in the morning. I have the energy to actually do my household chores and get things done. I also notice that I think more clearly. No brain fog. It really has been nice to feel a lot better - more normal and less sluggish. I take 2 caps in the morning with breakfast. They are large, but go down fairly easy considering their size. I'm happy to have found something that actually does do what it says. For some people, it is also helping them loose weight. It's not doing that for me (just another thing that didn't work for me weight wise), but the other benefits I get from it make me purchase it again. I'm on my 3rd bottle now. The symptoms I have for hypothyroidism are a little better, but most importantly for me is my energy level and clear thinking. It really is helping!!
 Have been feeling much better since taking it
 I was diagnosed as hypothyroid and then had half of my thyroid removed when they found a possible cancerous lump on it. Since then, I was on thyroid medication that wasn't working. After my dr changed practices, my new dr then took me completely off thyroid meds ?!? I decided to try something on my own. I tried this thyroid support for one month. I wasn't sure if I felt a whole lot better but as soon as I ran out, I could definitely feel the difference. I felt like complete crap without it. I'm not on my 3rd bottle and I've been feeling like normal. I'm not napping all the time like I was. It makes me feel better that I'm only taking vitamins too and not medication.
 Great product! I'm feeling better and am excited to see future results!
 Definitely gave a boost to my metabolism and energy, and I look forward to seeing what more than a month can do.
 I suffer from adrenal fatigue, and a terribly sluggish thyroid. I took these, along with an adrenal support supplement. I ran out of the thyroid support about a week ago, and I'm coming back for more. I can absolutely tell a difference between my energy levels, mood, and ability to lose weight. I didn't even realize how good it was making me feel until I ran out!
 Does not work for me near as good as others.
 Works great! My brand fog is better, I am sleeping regularly. I have half moons on my nails :-) . Will definitely be a regular customer. Haven't seen major metabolism changes yet but I haven't really been excercising either. But will hopefully start now that I am not always exhausted.
 When I bought this product I've been very skeptical about an immediately effect. But I was pleasant surprise when it started work in two days. I feel more energy, no more all day tired and depression. My skin and hair become better every single day. My friends told me that I look fresh and much younger. Highly recommend!
 Did not work. Update they did give me a refund and I do appreciate that  what doesn't work for me doesn't mean it want work for u.
 I really like this supplement. I was taking iodorol, with extra supplements. I like that this has more things in it, and the dosage is easier for me to tolerate, it’s not as strong. At the higher doses I was having a lot of detox symptoms and needed to take a break and do a kidney flush. Now I do a week on and a week off.<br/>I have diagnosed nodes on my thyroid that I’ve been able to feel when I swallow for about 4 years. I haven’t been able to feel them since taking this intermittently. I don’t know if it’s related, but nothing has made them better before this. This is my second bottle and I will buy again
 I give this 5 stars after about 2.5 weeks.  I take other stuff for my lack of thyroid, one being prescription.  I am trying to get to as low as a dose as possible &amp; my doc just recently lowered it 25 mcg so i think this is helping.
 The best ingredients and works! I feel so much better. Thank you!
 At 75 I was havings where it just seemed like someone pulled my plug, and doctor could not give me a reason so I decided to try increasing my worth by trying thyroid supplements and it seems to be doing some good, as I have had two of these days in the past 2 month compared to several a week before.  I intend to stay on them for at least 6 months and will go from there.  It's hard to get out there and ride and take care of horses on a pulled plug, and that is my life.  Thanks
 I've been on this for a month and have noticed it's given me energy but I haven't lost any weight on it. I am good about watching what I eat (on a gluten free diet- intolerant to all gluten) and run/walk 3 miles a day 4-5 days a week. I'm hoping the longer I'm on this product, the better it makes me feel and the weight begins to come off.
 Wanted to like this product but it didn't work for my body. Felt more energy but had to stop after only 2 days. I had a horrible headache, GI issues, irritability &amp; constant thirst. Good ingredients just not the right combination for me.
 Amazing!  Can't say enough about this product!  I felt a huge difference in my energy levels literally overnight. I started to take it as part of my treatment for Hashimotos. So happy I came across and tried this product.
 I have realized no change, either positive or negative, while taking these.  The only change was in my bank account.
 I went to the doctor in April to have blood work done. When the results came back, it said basically said my thyroid was bordering low. The doctor said this can change and wants to retest. Well I have a family history, including my mom, who has problems with her thyroid, so I decided to go ahead and start taking something. I wanted to see if this would have an impact on my levels when I went back to retest. I haven't retested yet, but I have been taking this for about month now. I am just about finished with my first bottle and I'll be reordering.<br/><br/>I purchased this particular brand based on the ingredients. Among them Iodine, Selenium and Kelp, known to aid your thyroid. It says it gives you energy and I did notice a pep in my step but nothing significant. I have however lost a little weight. I don't know if this is related to me taking this supplement or not, but that's always a good surprise.<br/><br/>I looked at many thyroid supplements on Amazon before purchasing this brand. Based on the ingredients, number of capsules to take, price and other reviews on Amazon, that's how I made my decision.<br/><br/>Overall I just feel a bit better. It's hard to explain really, but I do think taking this supplement has something to do with how well I've been feeling lately. I highly recommend giving it a try.
 Exactly as expected!
 This product did absolutely nothing to help me.  Save your money.
 I try this product because I read all the good reviews honestly dint help me for nothing I buy the energy and focus by mistake but dint help me at all and ether this one .
 Haven't been taking very long, but have already noticed more energy,and sleeping better,good stuff!  Will be ordering more.Take 2 in the morning. Every morning.
 Very happy with the results. Worked within 2wks for me.
 Only gave me headaches..saw no improvement in any aspect after trying for 2 months faithfully.
 Trying to run a half marathon doing body building as well.  Helping me keep my gains and not crash my t3 doing lots of running works about as good as cyotomel
 This has worked well for us so we continue to purchase and take it. Thanks for a good reliable product!
 I haven’t had any negative side effects. I’m giving this time to see if there is any improvement. So for now it’s a 4.
 I suffer from several autoimmune diseases, so I thought I would give this a try to kick start my thyroid and to help me feel better. I'm sleeping much better and have more energy throughout the day! I can't wait to see the long term difference it makes!
 Did nothing for me...….might for others, but I will not buy again.  :(
 This works wonders for me. It gives me more energy and surprisingly helps with my moodiness as well. Great product
 Almost finished with my first bottle and haven't seen the results I've hoped for as others have. May order another months worth before stopping, can't afford the monthly fee on a product that doesn't work for me!!
 Felt no difference.
 Easy to take with morning and evening meal. Jury still out on whether it makes a difference.
 I have suffered with low energy and weight gain for the past year. This has been a God send. I've lost 10 pounds in the past 2 months and even have enough energy to join the gym!
 This product contains zinc, selenium and copper which are needed for the thyroid gland to function. A daily multivitamin like Centrum containing A, C, D and E vitamins is recommended, but at least the needed minerals are included in this supplement if you do not take a daily multivitamin. I wanted to try it in lieu of the smallest dose of levothyroxine. So far, I do not experience the mental fog that comes on when not taking anything at all.
 I have tried numerous products and out of them all....this one works great!  I'm excited to continue taking this product!
 I have taken this for 2 months. I feel no difference.
 I take this in the morning for a little energy boost and it helps wake me up and get going for the day. Just wish that boost lasted all day!
 The brand is top notch but this product made me feel weird everytime I took it, I hope it helps others but this was a bust for me.
 I saw and felt no difference in taking these.
 Got this for the wife. She says it increased her energy. I am a supplement junkie, and I checked the ingredients in this product before purchasing. It's legit, no harsh stimulants or weird herbal junk. It's worth a try if you have borderline hypothyroidism.
 I started using it, thinking it'll give me more energy and help me control the weight I've been steadily piling on. Well, it helped some, and it even helped suppress my appetite. But then I noticed I was gaining weight - not sure how that works ( I'm pretty healthy - I lift weights, eat right, no soda, etc.), so I won't be using this, anymore.
 Unfortunately, this product made my husband and I both very tired.  We discontinued taking after a couple of days.
 I love this product in 3 weeks I lost 5 pounds and I feel better
 Okay, let me start out with stating I was NOT sent a sample to review. I paid for my bottle of Thyroid Support. I'm thrilled with how much better I feel. I am not one to take vitamins. I never feel any better or any worse when I take them, so I don't feel compelled to take them. Not the case with this product. I actually feel better when I take this. I'm not talking miracles. I mean, I light didn't shine down on me and all my symptoms disappeared when I started taken them. No, nothing that dramatic.  The difference is more subtle, but there is a difference and it is enough that I've subscribed to have these sent to me every month. I've never subscribed to anything like this before, but I want to make sure I don't run out of them.<br/><br/>A little background about my health issues... I have Lupus, Fibromyalgia and CFS. My doctor says there is nothing wrong with my thyroid, but she didn't test my F3 or F4, so there could be something going on that she doesn't know about.  But then again, maybe there isn't anything wrong with my thyroid. Regardless, these almost make feel normal. My Fibro Fog is not so acute, and I have much more energy.  Again, these are not a miracle vitamin, but they are helping me, so I'm going to continue taking them.
 This has seriously helped me! I can feel a big difference between when I take these and when I don't.
 I didnt think think this would do anything but I was wrong.  I feel more engry thru the day
 This product is awesome..<br/>It gave me lots of energy...
 I really like this product. It's given me more energy and my skin is not as dry. I ve almost noticed I m not as achy and I m sleeping better. My thyroid was somewhat low and it was explained to supplement with foods but I decided to try this product. Definitely give it a try if you re having issues.
 Have been taking it for about two weeks and I can tell a difference in my energy level especially in the afternoon when I used to crash. My husband also takes it and says it is helping him too.
 I'll need to purchase more of this soon, really helps me.
 I am on my second bottle! I haven’t noticed any weight loss but my energy level has increased dramatically! I’m going to continue to buy this product
 I love your product it works I am pleased with that's why I bought it again cuz it does work I feel better I have more energy I feel healthy and do thank the people who made the product and I will continue buying it again thank you
 I've been using this for several months now. There is definitely a difference in my energy and I'm more focused. I still use my levothyroxine but at a lower dosage.
 I started gaining energy.
 I love these.  i have thyoid problems and the medication doesnt make me feel good at all.  These natural supplements make me feel entergized and great.  I have taken these several times within the last 2 years and love them.
 The first three days I didn't feel anything. But the fifth day i was full energy and i felt my metabolism was up. I started back working out the kids without getting tired. Plus im a truck driver i was seeing a little weight loss too. Thr right product i been looking for.
 I love this product!! I decided to give this it a try after reading about the thyroid and some things that can happen with your body when it isn't functioning correctly. So was browsing Amazon and this product came up, so I took a chance. Just ordered my 3rd bottle. The biggest change I have noticed is that my insomnia has totally disappeared! I take one with breakfast and one with dinner (I wasn't sure when to take them/or if they should be taken together or not). I have noticed a slight decrease in the amount of hair I lose when I was it, but not too much of a change there at this point. And no change in losing/not losing weight - has always been hard for me and still is at this point. But I'm going to continue taking this twice a day, might eventually move down to once a day, but want to keep going at twice a day for now. Love sleeping though the night finally again!!
 This works better than the other type because of the iodine.  My droopy eyelid is better!
 I can't say enough about ZHOU Nutrition. Top quality products, beautiful packaging and excellent prices.
 I'm taking Levothyroxine for 10 years, my hair dropped really bad now. So I would like to try this thyroid support. I just tried it for a week. So far so good. No side effects. As other supplements,  I think need to take more bottles to see the result.
 I bought this supplement because I have 3 thyroid nodules that I wanted to shrink.  After reading different reviews here on Amazon, I decided to try it.  After awhile I noticed that my larger nodule is smaller, which was what I was aiming for, and it could be that the other nodules are smaller as well but they are too small for me to detect a difference by touch.  Interestingly, my overheating virtually went away (I still get a little warm when i drink coffee!).  Before I started taking these, I was getting hot flushes multiple times daily and now I hardly ever have them at all.  I would definitely recommend this supplement.<br/><br/>Note:  I was contacted by Zhou Nutrition and they sent me a free bottle to leave a review, which is great because I love the product.  Thing is, I'd been using this supplement for a few months before they contacted me so my review content is not influenced by the free bottle.
 no more night sweats and seldom do I get hot flashes now
 just left a review I wanted to put 4 stars not five because verdict still out like I said does help me focus better
 Amazing product. Really does help with energy and mind focus. Will be buying again.
 I used the product for its metabolism booster capabilities. It gave me headaches daily. I drank water to see if it would alleviate the issue, but it did not. I had to stop taking it after 10 days.
 Didn't see or feel any difference.
 Sadly I am one of those people where these pills affected my stomach. I was barely on them two weeks before I threw in the towel.
 I like the fact it gives me energy.. I watch my 2 year old grand daughter.  I noticed that I can focus more on projects and get them done.  So I would purchase again.
 I have been taking a 1/2 dosage (1 pills a day) for the past weeks or so. I have noticed some changes in my energy levels and concentration. It's not a miracle pill so don't expect that but it does help. I'll definitely continue using this product.
 I very much appreciate this product. Affordable yet effective. On my second bottle.
 huge pill.. didnt notice energy difference or much of anything
 Has seriously improved my energy levels, weight management and confidence!
 Just finished my first bottle and will be ordering again. Definitely has helped with my mood and energy.
 Needs to be taken daily as a "build up". It does help a little with energy.
 Once again, I notice nothing in terms of helping my low-thyroid problem...due to low=thyroid, I am gaining weight - despite not eating anymore than ever....I am not a big eater, yet, I am gaining weight, retaining weight around my stomach and dont' feel comfortable in my own skin anymore!  I was always 115 lbs. and felt good about my body...now, I shrink from wearing a bathing suit as I have a belly (which I am convinced has something to do with my thyroid)....Never had this issue before i hit menopause!  Ugh.
 Love it!! I have more energy through out my day, have less brain fog, and have lost an inch around my waist without changing my eating habits at all.
 So far so good, I feel better after taking this thyroid support on a daily basis!
 My sister recommended that I try this product after I had noticed many symptoms of hypothyroidism. So far I've bought two bottles of Thyroid support and have noticed a major  increase in my energy level. Also many of my symptoms have completely disappeared or have dramatically decreased.
 I have been using this product to help get my thyroid functioning better. My thyroid functions on rhe low end of normal, and I was tired of being told "oh, its fine". Its not fine when you feel frustrated with weight loss... I digress. This helps me from craving sugar and salt. Its great! I use it everyday, for months. I have noticed that I have more energy, and more focus.
 Quality company and hope it's helping. Hard to say with thyroid. Know it has  the ingredients  that are helpful anyway
 I love this supplement, has what I need. I keep reordering it. Nice to fine a thyroid supplement that seems to work.
 I have not had this much energy since I found out I had this issue. Along with a change of diet it does provide the required micronutrients. I had my dietitian check it out and she approved.
 It seems to give me more energy, and I definitely feel like I am sleeping better
 helps in bad areas
 This works exactly as described. I have more energy. I am not feeling hungry all the time and when I do eat it is much less. I get full and feel satisfied. I have lost a few pounds and it has only been a few weeks. My focus seems improved.
 Good product!
 This product is great! I noticed a great difference within my energy, and over all well being. I will take it from now on!!
 Not really sure if it made much of a difference or not, but I would not go so far as to say it was not helping, and probably did not give it enough of a chance to really help.
 Fast shipping. I think it was really helping. I plan on ordering another bottle. I need to give it a little more time to be sure.
 Have to take continuous other wise  Not helpful
 Made me break out. When I quit taking I. Learned right up
 I had similar symptoms as described, so I thought it was wise to give it a try. It has worked for me - might be placebo - in my permanent feeling of being tired, so I'm rebuying. But remember this is no real medicine and it's not intended to cure any disease, so if this works for you like it did with me, please go visit your doctor ASAP.<br/>I also have to say I've gained a bit of weight while using it, but I believe there's no real link with the medicine and my weight gain.
 great, has everything to support your thyroid
 This product works really well. I’ve noticed that with some diet changes I’ve finally been able to lose weight. Would definitely buy again and recommend.
 Really like this product so far. I take it in the morning to get everything going and they dont upset my stomach or anything. I havent been taking for a very long time to see long term benefits but will update my review as I do.
 I personally didn't find any extra energy, but in all honesty, I have other health issues that could be the reason.
 Iodine source needed.
 daughters TSH levels went down.
 will continue use---I feel this is working for me with thyroid function
 Made my heart beat too fast and left me sleepless.
 Definitely makes a difference for me. I stopped taking it for a few days just to see if my body needed it, and after two days I started getting sleepy in the afternoons. This is good stuff, if your body needs it.
 I really like this product.  Am a chronically tired person and I definitely felt less tired and that I had more energy.
 I can't tell if it did anything. I don't think it did.
 I have tried many supplements and have not had the results as i have had with thyroid support. My energy level and overall mental clarity i give the credit to thyroid support. Being a veggie capsule is a bonus. No upset tummy after taking on an empty stomach. I recommend anyone to try this supplement.
 I've only been taking this for a Lil over a week and I've seen a big improvement with hot flashes and night sweats. Can now cut out 2 herbals because of this. I'm estatic. Plus i'm sleeping better at night. Going to sleep quicker.
 So far, so good.  The one thing I have noticed is that I definitely have a bit more energy and wakefulness.  Thank you for this good product.
 Excellent Product I feel so much better while taking this
 Have been taking Thyroid Support by Zhou Nutrition for about 2 weeks and can definitely tell a difference in the strength of my hair. Have had better sleep, and have felt less sluggish. Seems to be working great so far! Will highly recommend this great product.
 Seems to be helping somewhat? Hard to tell so far.
 I was skeptical at first but I have taken this for 3 months and it has really helped me with my weight loss and I feel great! I take this with green tea and the DHEA and so far it's all working!
 A supplement that support the thyroid... I have tried many different types of supplements that directly or indirectly make attempts to increase weight loss. A supplement that increases thyroid function is one that makes sense to me.<br/><br/>The most substantial change that I noticed when taking this supplement was an increase in natural energy... Other reviews also focus on the energy gained from this supplement. The energy that I felt was not a jittery, unfocused type of energy that one usually gets from caffeine. It is a different type of sustained energy and stability... i.e., no crashes during the afternoon. I take one with breakfast, and two with lunch and dinner each day. I also take green tea supplements as well, mostly for the caffeine. However, the combination of the thyroid support and green tea supplements leaves me feeling really, quite good. Additionally, I lost about 4-5 lbs in a week in combination with mild dieting and carb-counting.<br/><br/>The biggest drawback that I have found with this supplement is that it negatively affects my digestive system and regularity. The effects of taking the supplement (and not taking it, as well) present themselves in the bathroom, unfortunately. My rating takes this issue into account.<br/><br/>Despite the side effects, however, I just ordered my second bottle today. Even during the most stressful weeks in my work, I don't feel run down or depressed when taking the thyroid support. I have yet to find another natural supplement that does such a thing.
 Helpful
 Great product. I think it has definitely helped with increasing my energy levels. If you miss a day you will notice feeling more fatigued.
 Results aren't all in yet but i certainly have more energy!
 I saw no change while taking these.
 This really seems to help with my hypothyroidism. I take it at breakfast and lunch in combination with my morning prescription. It helps my energy level. When I ran out I noticed the difference.
 I had zero energy and had been slowly gaining weight and unable to lose it. Thyroid Support has increased my energy. And I hope it helps to lose a few pounds. I am on my second bottle and I am happy with the energy it has given me.
 I have been taking the supplements as directed since I have received them. I have seen no difference in the way I feel.  After seeing so may positive reviews I was hoping these would help me but unfortunately nothing.<br/>Update:  I decided to update my review. As far as product I can still only give 2 stars but was contacted by Brittney this morning stating since the product did not work for me I would be issued a full refund. This all occurred within a 24 hour period. Its nice to see that a company doesn't leave you high and dry and actually sticks to their promise.
 Thyroid test done by my Doctor before and after taking product showed no improvement.
 My mood is so much more balanced as I near the end of my first bottle. I haven't noticed any weight loss or other metabolic improvements yet. But the change in my demeanor is dramatic. Just ordered a second bottle.
 Great product! It gives me the right amount of energy needed to go about my day without the jittery effects.
 I've been taking the supplements for only a few weeks now and thus far no noticeable change. I am going to try the supplements for 2 full months and then review again. My husband is also using the supplements and reports increased energy!
 Did not notice if it did any good.
 I've been using this product and so far, it's working well for thyroid support. I'm sure that with continued use the results will get better. I have more energy than before and I'm mentally more focused.
 I definitely have more energy and less brain fog when I  take this in the morning.  Also, I've only been taking one a day instead of the recommended two a day. I'm excited to try one in the mid-afternoon to see if I notice more affect.
 This is probably going to be a long review, so I apologise in advance.  I have had my thyroid checked several times by my doctor over the past few years to see if I have issues because I have all of the symptoms. All tests came back fine, but I decided to try this anyway. I have been taking it for four days now, and things have improved. I sleep better (stopped taking my nightly ambien), and wake up less groggy. I seem to have less brain fog and am more alert. I also have more energy and don't crash in the afternoon. I do still have my morning cup of coffee, but gave up my daily salted caramel mocha at starbucks. I just didn't feel like I needed that caffeine jump start after a couple of days on this. I weighed 235#s the morning I started taking this and this morning I weighed 230. I don't believe in magic weight loss pills, but I do feel these are a great supplement. I don't eat as much because I'm just not as hungry and seem to get full faster. I'm hoping this will help with my extremely painful monthly issues if it is balancing out my hormones. We will see! I would give it a try if you have the symptoms but no diagnosis. I figured I would try it out, because what did I have to lose but a few mochas worth of money? That's my two cents worth.
 Saw no results
 Notice diffrnce with my energy levels.
 Didn't really help me
 just simply love it.
 I've got 4 autoimmune issues. I feel so much better taking these supplements. Much more energy, and for the first time in years I want to exercise.
 I take this at noon with lunch as I take thyroid meds at 3am. I’ve noticed that I’m not as tired and have more energy
 I think this product works better than some of the others I’ve used. Seems to be more comprehensive than the iodine only supplements. They offer a free bottle for your review, but this is my honest opinion.
 I love this supplement. I was taking most of the ingredients in it separately. Being able to take it combined in one pill makes it super easy and affordable.
 I found this to help with clarity &amp; energy.  Definitely recommend it.
 So far I have experienced increased energy and wellness with my thyroid problem with the aid of this supplement. I will be continuing to use this as it realy seems tohelp with my thyroid problem I have been having hypothroidism
 I purchased this supplement product due to a hormone imbalance, and was losing my hair. I've been using it religiously for 2 weeks, and I've already notice an improvement.
 I have notice a bit of a boost in my energy after about a half a bottle. I plan on continuing!
 I read lots of good reviews and was very hopeful but although it gave me good energy I also had horrible headaches with it.  I also have been taking  Water Away by the same company and am having lots of success with that.
 Liked the weight maintenance. Hated the anxiety. Well worth it!
 I have been using thyroid supplements for several years.  I find that the quality of many manufacturers are good...  including this one.  I will purchase again.  I like that this one has iodine in it as well.
 I used this to restore adrenal function after quitting caffeine. I have so much more energy since starting.
 I noticed a difference right away after starting this product.  I found I had more energy.
 I like this product because it does help with my energy levels. I haven't seen any weight loss yet but I have the body type that shrinks a lot before the scale numbers and I am noticing I'm getting smaller.
 I'm a 46 year old female, and many people in my family have hypothyroidism, so it runs in the family.  I was cruising right along, feeling good, eating healthy, exercising regularly, and keeping up with the kids.  Then about a year ago, boom, I broke out all over with eczema, digestion went to crap, got a fullness/strangling feeling in my neck, then landed in the hospital with pericarditis and extreme fatigue, and dropped 15 pounds.  Thyroid tests and ultrasound are all normal, they say I'm not in menopause yet, a colonoscopy found I have collagenous colitis, an autoimmune panel showed I was borderline for something .... what is up with all this inflammation in my body all of a sudden?  Started on Renew Life probiotics (alternating the 200 billion and 80 billion), went 100% gluten free, got an Everly Well food sensitivity test done (showed I am abnormally sensitive to 27 different foods!), started on Epstein Barr homeopathic drops by Professional Formulas, and started on Thyroid Support Complex.  After three months, it all seems to be working.  I just recently finished the meds for the pericarditis and instantly got a little patch of eczema and tightness in my neck, but that seems to be subsiding now, hoping it was just an initial response to coming off the anti-inflammatories.  I need to repeat the autoimmune panel soon.  I'm hoping to stay with natural remedies to avoid an avalanche of autoimmune problems, wish me luck!
 Noticed a big increase in energy for about 2 weeks then it seemed to go back to how I was. I guess it cant hurt to get the vitamins..Will try again.
 I have noticed a diffetence in the way i feel . Need to use it a bit longer to tell if it is doing what i need.
 Ok, I am on day 3 of this supplement and so far, I do feel a slight but more energized and focused. Will give it some more time and update my review accordingly over time.<br/><br/>Ok. Finished a bottle of this and can definitely feel a difference in my body. More energy, better sleep and more pump in the gym. A slight warning, though. Be sure to take these with food, as mentioned in the instructions. Took it on an empty stomach once, burped about 20 minutes later, and felt the flames of hell coursing thru my nostrils, most likely from the cayenne pepper in the pills.  Coughed and sneezed for a bit thereafter. Other than that, this is good stuff. Buying another bottle now.
 I have noticed an immediate difference since I've added Thyroid Support Complex With Iodine to my daily regimen.  I have hypothyroidism and have taken a prescription med (Levothyroxine) for many years.  Since adding TSC not only do I have much more energy, but I have lost a few pounds that didn't budge prior to adding this supplement.  I am a very satisfied customer andI highly recommend this product!
 I couldn't tell any difference
 It came in just in time . I have to say I'm really excited to see how this works ! I've seen so many good reviews . I will be a customer who will continually buy if this works well for me ! From the looks of it , it most likely will . Super excited !
 So far it seems to really help. I'm really happy with the supplements!
 I feel a definite difference in my energy levels. I will give a full review in about eight weeks. I think it takes time to get full results from any supplement..
 I need support in speeding up my metabolism and a needed energy boost.  Encouraged by results over past 4 days.
 A+
 Great product!
 I take Thyroid Support daily! I had a physical recently and my numbers were better than a year ago! Great product!
 Absolutely love the thyroid support even though my thyroid was borderline I can tell a big difference while taking this. Will defiantly buy more.
 I bought this product due to good reviews, however I noticed no change in my lack of energy.  I was kind of hoping for a miracle
 Bought 3 bottles so far. I can feel a difference and definetly think it’s worth a try.
 Have recently started taking these, can say I notice a bit more energy so far. No bad taste. Also does not make me feel nauseous at all like most supplements do to me. Will definitely keep taking them.
 These are average supplements. However, the  company is subpar I was told I would receive a complimentary bottle if I wrote a stellar review, that was 3 months ago.
 Great purchase with good results.
 This stuff is amazing!!! This is my first time ordering this product and I will definitely be ordering again!!! Since taking thyroid support I have more energy, and have been in great spirits, I absolutely love this stuff, I also have noticed it helps with my crazy appetite as well
 no vi ningun cambio
 This is my first go with this and so far so good. Will purchase again
 Overall good. I feel I need to continue the supplement longer than a month to get a better feel, however no negative side effects thus far.
 It did give me energy and  Focus,  but my hair started falling out.  So I had to stop.
 Satisfied with my purchased. Got extra energy. Thanks
 Little pricey for the quality
 Great product! I actually felt the health benefits of the support this product provided my hypothyroid. A natural clean healthy renewal of mood and energy!
 Didn't notice anything
 I am on my fourth bottle now. I am convinced it helps.  A little more energy plus some weight loss.  You can't go wrong taking it.  I have Hashimotos and feel better.
 This is an excellent option for thyroid support. It has all of the essentials for a balanced approach to improve thyroid health.
 It seems to be working perfectly for me. I will keep buying it!
 Nice to have found a product that provides all natural support to my thyroid. It’s really nice to know that with this support, my metabolism is working efficiently. Highly recommend!
 Been using for about 2 months. I have hashimotos disease and I have noticed a difference in my tiredness. I will keep up and see where it goes, since Im wondering if it may be a placebo affect. However I do feel a bit better.
 Didn't see a big difference in when I took it or not.
 This product brought my energy level back  to a level where I can be involved in life the way I want to be.  My end of day fatigue seems to be greatly reduced.
 Within 24 hours, improvement in many regards.  Obviously a well researched product.
 I don't really feel any difference to be honest... (3 weeks use)
 Seems to be working. after only a few days I have more energy.
 I haven't noticed a difference.
 didn't do anything for me.
 I have Hashimotos and I noticed a marked improvement within a few days of taking this regularly. It was most apparent when I accidentally skipped a dose. I take it 2x/day with food, breakfast and lunch. My "brain fog" has lifted significantly. This is the most obvious improvement for me, and the symptom I noticed the return of first. This is not intended to replace prescription thyroid medicines, it is intended as a symptom abatement, and to that end it works beautifully. I have more energy, so I'm able to exercise, which compounds the benefits of the pills. My overall health has improved in this way since beginning the regimen. I'm very happy with the pills. As far as I can tell, they are helping immensely, but as I said, this isn't just because of the pills, I've also been able to make lifestyle changes with the help of the pills. Because of this, I'm not sure how much of my health improvement is because of the medication and how much is because I'm not laying around on the couch all day feeling like garbage. Either way, though, I'm happy and I'm ordering more. I haven't noticed any decline in their efficacy over the course of the month, either. Some herbal remedies only seem to work for a week, these are not like that at all.<br/><br/>I've recommended these to friends with thyroid issues, whether or not they're on prescription meds. I can't speak to how well they work for people who are using them to help them lose weight or whatever, only to their effectiveness for people with actual medical conditions who need relief. I am seriously overjoyed to find something that brings back my ability to think clearly. I thought I would be in that fog forever, and being able to be free of it is priceless. Anyone who is living with that symptom, try this stuff now.
 I was experimenting with thyroid problem. I did not notice a change but that is me.
 Highly disappointed. Bought some for myself and son, who lives away from home, and neither of us noticed a difference in energy or any of the other supposed good benefits. Total waste of money.
 Love this product! It highly improved my energy level when taken with my multi vitamin.
 I like this especially for my hormone balance. It helps my focus especially.  My thyroid feels in check when I am in this and my metabolism feels back to normal.
 For anyone who has had problems sleeping, I am sure you can appreciate my comments here.  For the first time in many, many years I am getting a good night's sleep. In the past, I had never had dreams and now I do, which is an indication of sound sleep.  So I am very grateful for this product!
 Works great
 I love this - felt better than I have in years!
 I no longer have that mid afternoon slump! After dealing with Hashimoto's for 8 yeats this is a welcome change!!
 I read all reviews for this product . I ordered because of the positive reviews This product does exactly what review  said .I will be ordering again.
 My energy levels have definitely increased since I began taking the thyroid support.
 This works better then my prescription meds. I lost 10lbs in a week. I am able to fall asleep easy now. I have a bit more energy. Its only been 4weeks though. I have Hashimotos and this is whats helped me the most. Doctor approved it.
 Purchase this product to give my thyroid some type of balance. I took it as suggested and after a month I felt no difference!
 No complaints !!!
 I have taken a multitude of Thyroid Support from different brands and vendors. I have to admit that ZHOU NUTRITION THYROID SUPPORT COMPLEX WITH IODINE, works EXCELLENT!  This brand and product will be the ONLY brand that I will use forever. My mental temperment, body temperature and Fingernail &amp; Hair growth have greatly improved in quality/texture/length of nail &amp; hair. I went from looking like "Dill Pickles" from the RugRats to Diana Ross with my hair.  My fingernails are so long and hard that most people think I'm wearing artificial nails. I actually feel normal. I'm no longer wearing turtleneck sweaters in the summer time. My diet is vegetarian/vegan and even with that adjustment my body temp is normal, nothing out of the ordinary like before. I will buy this product and will continue to add the rest of the ZHOU Family supplements.
 I was hoping this would be helpful but it wasn’t . I wanted to be consistent but only gave me headaches really bad. I couldn’t even go to work because the light was bright . Not recommend
 I've been taking it for a month with no results, I really wanted to work.<br/>Not sure if I'll try another month
 This helps me throughout my day.  Lots of energy
 Very happy with this product. I already feel better after a few days, and my sleep has improved.
 I bought this because I loved the Calm Now and Focus supplement by Zhou....this one did not disappoint. I actually use less of the other 2 supplements now thanks to this one. It really does make you feel like your old self.
 My wife has taken the first bottle fully. She has not seen any results yet in terms of weight loss. But we’ll continue for couple more months and see. 1 month may be too soon.
 After gaining 41 pounds in six months in spite of a rigorous workout regiment, I went looking for help. Doctors told me nothing was wrong with me, but I was still gaining weight, still depressed, and still couldn't function properly. I found this and in three weeks, I have lost 10 pounds and my energy is back. This stuff is great!
 Good stuff. Helps with tiredness and weight loss
 I had added few supplements including this supplement. Looks like the formula is working. I would recommend this product and would again purchase it.
 Fantastic product. I tried another kind and i didn't feel as good as when I took these. I'll def be changing back.
 Felt more energy after trying it for one month after
 If you are hypothyroid and looking for something to get more energy this may help. I had a bit of increase in energy. Others raved how much it changed their energy level I did not notice a huge change.  I would suggest trying this, I do believe I get some benefit from taking this.
 Researched Iodine deficiency and decided to buy this product. Happy with it.
 excellent product i feel energetic but sometimes hungry. . but overall i recommend it especially for someone who's having to work a lot. . another experience but it is for me only as hypothyroid patient it is really made a difference. .. thanks
 Fist time I take a supplement that really does what it claims! Thrilled to have found it
 Just bought this product and have been using it 4 days now. On the third day I noticed a huge difference in energy! Normally on my days off I use it to catch up on rest and sleep and get a few errands done. This time I did errand and worked on the house all day! Even had energy to teach my preschooler his letters. I was extremely skeptical but after reading the reviews I decided to try it. These work so great I bought a bottle for my mom and my sister will be ordering some too! I was not compensated in any way to write this review, but feel people should know about this great product. It especially helps me because I have an 11 year old and 4 year old and can finally spend quality time with them rather than just resting. Love this product and will be ordering more!
 I was skeptical about ordering a product like this online.  However, I showed the information to my doctor and he said it should be okay.  I'm glad I bought it.  Having hypothyroidism, I do feel sluggish and tired at times.  This product seems to give me a little boost, especially later in the day when I need it. However, I don't feel jittery like I would if I had caffeine. The pills are medium-sized green capsules, but are easy to swallow.  I haven't had any stomach discomfort.  Instructions show take with meals, so I take it after I eat.<br/><br/>All in all, a great product and I would recommend this to anyone with hypothyroidism.  This does not replace the Amour Thyroid prescription I take, just acts as a supplement.
 I was really impressed with this product.  I had great energy and had a lot of mental clarity.  Going to order again!!
 Energy levels up and focus improved!
 ONE WORD AWESOME!!!!
 My daughter and I have been using the thyroid support for about a month. I have noticed a slight increase in my energy level and am confident that it will continue to increase. Already received my second order.
 Lots more energy and weight is starting to com e off finally!! :D
 A+ customer service
 Did not notice any kind of difference at all. No negative side effects, but no benefits either. Will not be buying again.
 great stuff. a week after starting i feel fabulous.
 This product has really helped me. I was taking Synthroid for many years but not until I started taking Thyroid Support (and switched from Synthroid to Naturethroid) did I really start to feel myself again. It helps with energy, reduces foggy head, improves concentration. Overall just makes me feel more like me without a cloud over my head! Highly recommended for people with low thyroid symptoms.
 I’m only about 2 weeks in, but I have noticed my focus and stamina has improved already. I’ve had no negative side effects at all. I’m looking forward to see the extended support this will give me.
 I did not notice a difference with these pills.
 This product is awesome it helps me focus and maintain my thyroid issues. It gives me natural energy that last throughout the day!!!
 Arrived quickly ... as described.
 I have been taking Thyroid Support Complex for about a week now along with an extra iodine supplement and a b12 supplement. I have noticed a slight increase in energy and have lost about a pound and a half. I assume that with more time on these supplements I will continue to see great results.
 Honestly these did nothing for me and will stick with my regular Andrenal support supplements.
 After trying numerous thyroid supplements this one has definitely helped me.  My symptoms have improved and my mood is better. I wpuld highly recommend this
 I really feel that these work for my overall fatigue and well being.
 I absolutely love this product! Not only has it helped me regain lost energy, but it also has strengthened my nails and my hair is thicker! I highly recommend this product and I will keep using it daily.
 As advertised, great quality. Feeling more energized and focused.
 All I can say that this product works especially the energy that I am getting from this supplement.  Thank you so much. I love this product. You cannot go wrong with this product.  Give it try and you won't regret it.
 I have low thyroid but not low enough to get on medication so I thought I would try this product. I have been taking this for about 2 weeks now and I believe I have more energy. I don't seem to be as tired as I was.
 I'm a clean water and trust by just taking this once a day really helps balance my energy throughout the day. No more ups and downs - plus it's reasonably priced! Great!
 not sure if this does anything.
 This product had exactly what I was looking for in a supplement with no ill effects as long as it was taken with food (I felt a little strange if I didn't eat first, but no serious side effects). I took this in conjunction with a vitamin D supplement, and felt my energy levels stabilize after a few weeks.
 don't know about this, did not notice much change when I was taking it...
 Returning this
 Very happy with this product! Have noticed my energy levels improve through out the day, and feel more focused. Would definitely recommend.
 I have been taking these pills for a little over a month now, and overall I am satisfied and will continue to buy them. I have felt an increase in my alertness and I do not feel the overwhelming need to collapse into an afternoon nap like before. I would not however, go as far as to say that these pills are all that is needed to treat hypothyroidism or that I am 100% "my-old-self". I have been taking 2 pills in the morning, they are fairly easy to swallow, but I find it necessary to be sure to eat breakfast after I take the pills or my stomach feels upset.<br/><br/>11/29/16 Update:<br/>I stopped taking this supplement for a few months, thinking my symptom improvement was probably the result of a placebo effect. However, after being off them for a while the fatigue and brain fog returned. I resumed taking them and within a few days was already feeling much better. I have taken these pills for about 6 months and in that time I have not noticed any metabolism increase, nor any weight loss; but it has done wonders for my energy levels and mental clarity.
 With hypothryoidism, normally I am very tired when I get home from work. I noticed within days that I felt better and more energy to do things well into the evening. I never felt shaky or jitterish like some other thyroid supps. Great product.
 Works great. gives me a lot of energy.
 Great product, will continue to use daily.
 I have hypothyroidism and this seems to give me more energy than just taking my Rx thyroid meds.
 Seems tolerable.
 Just took once so far.  Will be taking more though as I noticed a slight increase in energy.
 Really good product
 Sorry to say this did nothing for me.  That's not to say it is a bad product, just that it didn't help me and my fatigue problems.  Other people may have different results than I did.<br/><br/>Edit- As I said above, this product may not have helped me, but that does not mean it won't work for someone else.  The vendor, Zhou Nutrition was very professional and provided great customer service by contacting me and giving me a full refund on the product.  They stand behind their products and want to be sure their customers are completely satisfied. I am adding an  additional star for the excellent customer service.
 This product has really helped me have more energy, the ability to focus and I have even lost some weight since I started taking this. For anyone who has hypothyroid, you know what a miracle that is!
 Amazing product.  Have been living with hypothyroidism for 20 years and have faithfully taken synthroid.  Only take 1 capsule a day. Brain fog is lifted.  Energy restored
 Works. No bad effects. Repeat purchases.
 This product is wonderful! I don't really like to leave reviews but this is the real deal. I have been using it for a week and Lost a few pounds. I don't feel hungry all the times since taking it, and have so much energy now. If you have hypothyroid, give a try. I give it four stars because I don't like taking big pills. Great product!
 1 week of usage and works effectively. Lethargy gone!!
 Did not see any changes
 not sure how effective need to take longer
 Haven't used this long enough to see a difference
 One month in a think it’s helping a great deal to start to give me back a great deal of energy and overall feeling of well-being. I’ll be excited to see how it does 2-3 months out I think it may help even more.
 Within a month of taking this supliment I have lost 10lbs and feel much better. It seems to have help with my digestion as well. Definitely would recommend this product.
 I can say that since i started taking these pills, I have felt better physically and emotionally, and no more stress!! I can also tell you that I have noticed my clothes are looser!  I will keep taking!
 These products are great.
 I was looking for something to help boost energy and metabolism.  SOMETIMES I felt extra energy.  Almost jittery at times.  MOST of the time felt no different.  OFTEN times got stomach discomfort and diarrhea from the supplement (as I've read some other users experienced).  I ate with food as suggested, but didn't make a difference.  I'm probably allergic/sensitive to one of the ingredients.  I threw away half the bottle. I'll keep looking for something else.  UPDATE (10/21/16).  I was contacted by Zhou Nutrition and offered a 100% refund. This company has great customer service, however this product just wasn't for me.  I am now trying (and really like) their Green Tea Extract.
 Excellent quality product. Not waking up in middle of night any more. Feel more rested. Hope to feel more and more great impacts of supporting my thyroid with this supplement!
 Din't see the diference
 Did good for me, though not great. Still looking for the one, but if I can't find a better priduct, I'll probably get more
 Purchased this because I have an under-active Thyroid. I was hoping this would get it moving. I take this twice a day, with food, for about a month now and haven't really noticed anything; no increase in energy, metabolism, etc. I already eat healthy and am very active. I don't think I will purchase again.
 Effective Thyroid Support with Iodine. Worked for me.
 I've only been taking this for about a month. Not sure if I feel a difference due to other issues I am addressing at the same time, but I know I do have hypothyroidism so, I am going to give it more time.  Sorry I couldn't give you readers a definite answer yet!
 After a few days of taking this I felt more energetic, in a subtle, not hyper way. Maybe due to to vitamin b, but it also helped with moods
 I ordered this product because I was desperate to find something that would help me get back to my old self - the one who wasn't fuzzy headed and exhausted all the time. Thyroid issues run in my family and it's very difficult to get a doctor to correctly diagnose hypothyroidism or Hashimotos using the World Health criteria vs. the US criteria, which leaves a lot of people with thyroid symptoms without the correct diagnosis and struggling. Several doctors have offered me anti-depressants except I'm tired with no energy and fuzzy headed, but not clinically depressed so what's the point of taking something that isn't going to address the actual potential cause? I've been taking this product for just about 4 weeks now, and here's what I've noticed:<br/><br/>My first week in, I noticed I woke easier in the mornings. For someone whose normal morning mode is a complete inability to think or do much of anything until they've drank coffee for a good hour, that was interesting. I still need my coffee, but I'm clearer headed upon waking than I have been in years. By the end of my first week, I noticed my quality of sleep had improved and I actually felt like I was getting sleep, vs waking up feeling like I hadn't slept at all.<br/><br/>My second week I noticed a change in my energy levels during the day. I was struggling with an afternoon slump every day at work where I would fight not falling asleep at my desk. It was literally every single day that this was happening. It occurred to me during my 2nd week that my energy levels were sustained during the day, and I wasn't nodding off. First I attributed it to how busy I was, but it's continued and I've been able to get through the day without that extreme exhaustion, save for 2 days right before my cycle started, but even that was not as bad as it normally is.<br/><br/>My third week in, and my husband has commented how much more engaged I am when I get home from work, where I used to be so exhausted I couldn't think straight, let alone hold a decent conversation. I also noticed there's far less hair fall out when showering and styling my hair, and my nails which were heavily ridged are starting to smooth out. My energy levels remain at an even level, and I'm finding it easier to focus during the day without being so fuzzy headed that I have to stop and re-think what I'm doing. This is huge since my job is very demanding and requires being able to bounce between multiple major projects with frequent interruptions constantly.<br/><br/>My fourth week I'm holding steady with my energy levels, sleeping better and waking easier than I have in years. I can have normal conversations with my husband after work, and I've been able to take on more home projects that I wanted to do but just couldn't get up the energy for. My metabolism had previously slowed to a crawl - I was able to jump start that by following the Ketogenic diet and while that was great for dropping the weight, I also know me, and I'm bad to stick with a diet for any length of time. I'm not strictly following the Keto meal plan any longer, but remarkably, I'm also not packing back on the pounds like I feared I would when I went off the rails. Mind you, I'm not eating a ton of processed foods or junk, and it's easy for me to say no to bread, so that helps, but still...this is the stage where my metabolism would have reverted back and I'd have seen a weight increase of 5 pounds by now. Nope, still maintaining my weight.<br/><br/>As with any supplement, I'm leery of it's claimed effects and I was really hesitant to try this but desperation won out. Now I'm kicking myself for not trying this sooner. I'm hopeful that over time I'll see even more energy and benefits since it seems like the effects accumulate bit by bit, at least for me. I will absolutely continue using this supplement since the difference has been night and day for me and I cannot imagine going back to how I felt before this.<br/><br/>UPDATE 11-16-2017<br/>I am still using the Thyroid Support Complex and am STUNNED by it's effectiveness. I'm still reaping all the benefits, clearer thinking, stabilized energy through out the day, better sleep, no weight gain (and I realize this is not a weight loss product, but anyone with thyroid issues knows that weight gain and losing weight is a huge problem with a sluggish thyroid) - all in all, my life has improved tremendously. Hair fall out has decreased significantly and my hair is starting to feel thicker again, the nail ridges are almost completely gone, and my tolerance to cold has improved immeasurably. (normally I'm constantly cold) Another surprising (but really awesome) benefit has been the return of my libido, which thrills my husband to no end. I don't see myself ever stopping this supplement, it has given me back my life.
 Only taken for a month. So far so good!
 I actually noticed a difference in the way I feel! More energy and more focus!! I take it everyday and will continue to do so!!!
 It's only been a week, I haven't really noticed anything different about my energy levels. I will update my review in another week or so, hoping there are changes I can report.
 Noticed nothing. Used the whole bottle. Very disappointed.
 So far I have been happy with my purchase.  I cannot truly tell how well it works as I take a few other supplements too (a few other Zhou products included).  That being said, their Customer Service is great and the product seems to be of very good quality.
 Great product.  I was feeling very tired and had no energy<br/>Thyroid support has helped a lot  Have been sleeping better<br/>Just ordered second bottle
 it was ok
 I just finished my first bottle and so far I can say that I do feel some additional energy from using this.  I hope the results continue to improve as I continue to use it.
 I purchased a bottle of Zhou Nutrition Thyroid Support Complex w/Iodine a little over a month ago.  I'd started missing periods and experiencing menopausal symptoms, i.e. hot flashes, night sweats, tiredness. A friend told me it might be a lack of iodine in my diet.  Of course I was skeptical that a single pill could help solve my issues.  But, I wasn't getting better with just my B-Complex tabs alone, or other tablets I'd bought to cure my ailment. I went to Amazon and searched for something that had thyroid support and came across Zhou Nutrition and decided to purchase it because of the great feedback folks were giving.  All I can say is WOW!  These capsules really work for me!  No more hot flashes and night sweats And they worked so quickly, with zero side effects. I didn't change anything else in my diet or exercise routine, but simply added the Zhou Thyroid Support and I feel like a new person.  I highly recommend this product to anyone experiencing similar symptoms.  It's the real deal. I recently purchased another bottle. Thanks for a excellent product.  Don't change it!
 Works so far!
 I have used this for the last month and am very pleased.  I feel so much better.  Thyroid mkeds alone just do not seem to work for me and this has really helped.
 I have and interactive thyroid. If I could give it 100000 I would. I feel so much better and feel I reclaimed my life back. My mood was the biggest difference! HIGHLY recommend
 I have noticed a difference in my energy levels almost right away. I don't seem to have the mid-day crash either but I have also added the Energy and Focus in 2 times a day. Love these supplements!
 Excellent results
 They work! I went back to the doctor and my thyroid levels where perfect! The doctor was surprised!
 Seems to work just as well for me as the more expensive supplement I was using previously - three cheers for a budget friendly supplement!
 It is an excellent product.  I plan to continue using it.  Thanks
 I haven't been taking it long so I'm not sure exactly how well it works. The price was right and I've been impressed with the company so far.
 Well, it didn't do much for me, but that just may be me.  Reading the ingredients list, it looks to be an excellent product.
 I'm a person recovering from a concussion and I just want to inform you that this is a Great product. it does help with mental clarity and focus.
 I feel a difference in my energy and thyroid.
 Love love love this product. I have only been using the product for about two months and i have lost 15 lbs as well as gained my energy back. Told friends about it and now their trying it too.
 Im 32 years old and just recently tested my iodine level to be very deficient.  after about a week of taking this i noticed a difference in my body.  More energy, more clarity and less inflammation.  My iodine levels have slightly raised after a week.  Felt like i was detoxing on this.  Great Product
 I have only taken this for a couple of weeks,  but I seem to feel more awake.
 Firstly I will say that I haven't been diagnosed with a thyroid problem, instead I felt after talking to other's with thyroid problems and researching that many of my symptoms fit and felt that trying a natural supplement that simply supports the thyroid was safer than a medication. For a long time I have felt foggy, tired, unmotivated, bloated, my nails/hair lifeless, unable to stay warm or warm up once cold, itchy and generally unwell.<br/><br/>The product itself says take two tablets daily, preferably with meals, so I began by taking both pills at night with dinner. By the second day there was a huge difference in energy - I was up and moving, doing things that I had been planning for awhile but never having the energy to do. It wasn't only energy, but also just feeling better and more motivated, my attitude was uplifted.<br/>However, after about four days of this I felt that maybe I was having a little *too* much energy at once and felt it was better to do one tablet in the morning and one in the afternoon, so as to have a more even coverage. I have been doing this for a little over a week now and feel enough energy to get things done without as much of a crash afterwards. I also feel less bloated and I feel it is easier to concentrate. I still feel cold (which is party hereditary as well), however I don't feel it is as difficult to get warm and there have been times when I've actually felt overly warm (which is very strange for me, who generally has kept my room at 80).<br/><br/>I have not felt any side-effects that I can directly contribute to this product. I have felt slightly light-headed or gotten a very mild headache around the times that I take this capsule, but it doesn't last for long and dissipates readily.
 To be honest with you, I didn't feel the difference.
 Shipped fast and seems to help with energy level.
 Works fine no side affects account #113-5206308-546229
 A good product, although I haven't notice any change in my metabolism and have been using for a month.
 Pretty much like other supplements that are also out there. if you need a supplement, I suggest you first talk to your doctor to find out what they'd recommend. I do not add salt (iodized or not) to my diet, eat few eggs and little fish, so I take an iodine supplement. Since I also have to take a D3 supplement and taking this required taking two pills, I think I'll go back to my old D3 w/ Sea-Iodine. One pill a day, for less cost.<br/><br/>UPDATE 6/9/2017: I was surprised today to receive an email from Zhou Nutrition offering a refund.  Zhou Nutrition gets an additional star from me (from 3 to 4)  for its obvious concern about its customers!
 Not sure it made a difference, but worth a try!
 Didn't really see a difference. Full star for customer service. May try a different supplement
 ok
 I have been taking this for 3 weeks and it has already made a difference just recently this past week. Im more clear headed I feel calmer and relaxed, I'm also not so tired. As for losing weight well its only been 3 weeks but I look forward to seeing what else it will do with longer use.
 So far so good
 Been taking for over a month and haven't seen any big difference. Regardless I do feel I have a bit more energy.
 Love this supplement. I will definitely take this for as long as I have thyroid problems. Really helps to feel more normal. :)
 I have hypothyroid and these pills did wonders i had more energy and lost weight. i need to rebuy again I'm on my normal meds but these just help me feel better over all.
 Very~ Very~ Good
 I've been taking for about 2 months and am happy with the results.  It took about a month to really notice a difference.  My thyroid levels come back normal but I still have many of the symptoms of hypo.  With Thyroid support, I feel like I have gradually been waking up and am able to get off the couch.  I am able to get more things done in my day even without a pressing deadline.  I've even found the energy and desire to make it to the gym again.  Looking forward to seeing how things go over the next few months.
 Had no affect at all.
 I'm almost through with my first bottle but I don't notice any difference yet.  I might purchase 2nd bottle though to see if it takes some time.
 Took it for almost a  month and don't notice any change but the company did return my money so they do care if you receive results. Every body is different so it may work for you.
 I've been on thyroid medication for over 20 years. I've tried other natural thyroid medication, but I ended up returning them and bought Zhou Nutrition Thyroid Support again. I wondered why I started gaining weight while trying those other brands and figured out that Thyroid Support had actually worked. I'd recommend this to everyone!!
 we will see when I go back to doctor
 You can find cheaper ones with same quality and more quantity on amazon
 I have had a thyroid problem for over 10 years! This product is amazing and has really helped me! I have tried everything to get my energy up and it gives me that extra boost that I need during the day!
 Received product on time, and just as described. I have an inactive thyroid, and bought this product to help me.
 I'm not sure if its mental, but I feel more energy when I take them
 I have been told that my thyroid may be a bit off. my blood pressure is a bit high . this seems to help both . I will keep taking this and see what happens . happy so far . I would suggest this to anyone in the same boat as me .<br/>thanks<br/>rdb
 I liked that it sped up my metabolism right away . I lost a few pounds in a few pounds.
 First time user and excited to try it!!!
 I've been using for about a month, I do see a small difference in my waistline. All the products offered by this company are amazing! Thanks Zhou
 I have been a fan of the Zhou Nutrition products. Good value, high quality, and good ingredients.
 I brought them hoping to feel better but instead found that they actually made matters worse could not take them for more then two weeks.
 Just found out I have a under active thyroid.  This seems to help, but will also be seeing a doctor as well.
 I feel more energized since starting this product and I'm not starving all day long. It seems to help control my hunger and I sleep deeper at night. I take it in the morning with a banana and the benefits last all day.
 Thyroid Support really helps me feel better. I have recognized a difference in my energy levels and my overall well-being since I started taking this a little over a month ago. Very pleased with this product!
 These vitamins have really helped me feel more regulated and maintaining my weight management. They don't hurt my stomach and digest easy. Glad I found this Thyroid blend!
 Love it!
 Love it
 Have tried for a couple of months now in addition to my other supplements. Seems to give me a little more kick in the morning which is much appreciated.
 After using this product for about a month, I didn't feel any difference. Moreover, it sticks to my throat on the way down unless I eat it between the meal. I am not sure if this product makes any difference.
 I found no benefit to this product.
 I can’t tell anything from taking this supplement.
 Good product
 I love this supplement....I feel so much better....haven't lost any weight but haven't gained any either. All the other symptoms went away.
 Seems to be working. I feel better
 Good product.
 it works
 Felt more energy throughout the day. No crash or side effects at all. Absolutely love this stuff!
 I just started using this. I am not sure if it's working yet. I am on week 3. I haven't noticed any positive changes yet other than maybe it's making my finger nails grow super fast.  Not quite what I was looking for but it could be doing something. I haven't changed much for good or bad and am packing on some pounds.  Possibly causing weight gain? I don't know.  I realize things like this take some time to kick in so I'll  maybe give it more time.<br/>*Even though I didn't ask for a refund Zhou sent me one based off my review. They really believe in their product and will back it up. I increasing the rating to 4 stars based on their customer service.
 I took this twice and had heart palpitations like I was going to have a heart attack.
 This product has been great for me.  It has relieved my symptoms and I have been able to stop my prescription.
 I cannot say it has helped me drop weight, but it definitely keeps me going everyday. Something else that I really have to agree with many of the reviews I read while doing my research and helped me decide to order these pills is that they really work at keeping me focused. No more of that "brain fog". I can keep my mind on what needs to be done and accomplish a lot more.<br/>The first few days have me a little of headache but it later disappeared, I just took one pill a day until my body hot used to them.<br/>I'd definitely order these pills again.
 I think this is working pretty well for me! I'm 8 months pregnant so I'm only taking 1/2 of the regular dose just to be on the safe side. But I feel like mentally I'm a lot more clear and I'm not just wandering around in an exhausted fog wanting to plop down and take a nap, despite getting very little sleep at night. I can't wait to try a full dose after I deliver and see if it makes even more of a difference!
 Works good, lots of energy.
 Been taking this product for a couple of weeks now, but I don't feel any different. Will keep taking it to see if it just takes a while to see results.
 seems to work to speed up metabolism, noticed sweating as side effect though.
 Excellent thyroid support! I feel more energy and focus. I definitely will continue to use this product.
 No magic pill, but If you take it consistently, you will notice a difference. I don’t feel so sluggish anymore, keeps me with the right amount of energy and focus.
 It has helped with my mood, energy, and body temp. I also feel like I am sleeping better and I feel more rested. Has eased a lot of my menopause symptoms. I will continue to use this. Really like the way I feel.
 Love this product, it really works!  I have much more energy and feel great!
 Excellent product! I can feel my throat muscles start to get stronger which must mean that it's working! thanks so much! will be ordering again
 Loved this! I take it with my prescribed medication and it makes me feel great!
 Absolutely LOVE how much better i feel after just a week !!
 I can certainly feel a difference with my energy levels and even my mood since taking this supplement.
 I've had this product for a little while now. At first the changes were very subtle. Easily overlooked. But then I started noticing I wasn't as tired and I just overall felt good. This is a good supplement. I would buy definitely buy it again.
 Did not notice a difference
 Like having all herbal product
 I'm diagnosed hypothyroid and take synthroid daily.  I asked my doctor about this supplement and got her approval.  I've been taking this supplement for a few months now and was taking one very similar to it before.  This product helps me with energy and I feel like it's helping relieve some of the symptoms of hypothyroidism.
 I have only taken one month so I am still new at this and too soon to tell.
 Prior to starting your supplement, my thyroid tests came back low and had been low for a long time. I was being retested every couple of months. Rather than starting taking a drug, I decided I was tired of being tired and look at thyroid support supplements on Amazon. Purchased Zhou and started taking it. Well, my doctor want to run the test again and THIS time my thyroid was solidly in the normal range. Doctor was very happy and told me to keep taking the drug. I told him I had never been prescribed any thyroid meds. He couldn't believe my thyroid had improved on your supplement but it has. I feel better and I like that works for me!
 Wife has gone off thyroid. Will see how this support works
 I have a dead thyroid and this has helped so much to level out  my out of sync cycle
 I never realized what nutrients and vitamins would be missing when I moved overseas. I can tell you that the negative difference it took on my body is now starting to reverse due to taking Thyroid Support by Zhou Nutrition. I take this along with Zhou's Vitamin D3 with K2 supplement. I am currently located at a place where there is a lack of sunshine and it wrecked havoc on my health. I couldn't hardly get out of bed! After taking Zhou Nutrition and the Vitamin D3 with K2 I am getting back to my normal self! I missed myself! Haha. My brain is starting to be more clear and above all...I am getting my energy back! I also like this product due to it being Non-GMO plus the fact that they allow a third party to test their products instead of doing "in-house" testing on quality! WAY TO GO ZHOU!  :)
 Great product! I was suffering from extreme fatigue and resulting weight gain. I started taking this before I went on medication for my thyroid. I have continued to take it along with it because when I initially stopped it, I could feel the difference. Both are working great for me.
 Love these I fell so much better!
 Great product! I feel great without the jittery feeling
 After completing the whole bottle I didn't notice a difference
 Doesn't work, made me constipated!
 I took Thyroid Support for 30 days. My increased energy and focus can be attributed to my lifestyle changes which include another order of Thyroid Support. Thank you, Zhou Nutrition.
 Great product! Feels great to have more energy, decreased appetite and overall well being. Will definitely  continue to use this product!
 My Thyroid lab work is improving because of this amazing product.  I will continue to use and recommend to others as well.
 helps me to have more energie
 It's only been a few days, but I am feeling more energy already.
 I took it for a week and it gave me terrible headaches everyday.
 So far so good.  My energy level is great.  My hair has been restored from its thinning spread in my crown.<br/>I've  had no  unpleasant  experiences with the supplement.
 Great product!
 Wonderful product!
 Very helpful supplement. Within days of taking it, I've had more energy and less brain fog. I just feel better all together.
 Such a amazing product so much energy
 Gives me energy and I love it
 I've been using this for several weeks, I think it's working, I have more stamina to work out and I feel like my metabolism is on fire, when I work out now I sweat so much more.
 More energy, better focus, less hair loss.  I really like it, I'm on second bottle! Can get up and workout now.
 I have been taking this for about 2 and a half weeks. Was hoping it would help with my tiredness, but I've experienced no change. Would not order again.
 I was completely satisfied by my first order and on second bottle now. I usually take it with lunch and it provides extra horsepower to finish the day strong.
 Definitely noticed enhanced mood!
 Thank you!
 So far...so good.  Only used it for 3 days now and I definitely feel better....not sure if I "look" any better though!
 Thyroid protection
 I see the need for it I believe it give me a better bod
 I feel so much better after taking these!
 Did not help
 I started taking this about 2 weeks ago. I am hypothyroid but remain very active. My energy levels still weren't where I like even after taking synthroid. I added this to my regimine and my energy levels are back! I've already ordered another bottle. $20 a month to feel like myself again? Yes please!
 I had been taking a different thyroid supplement, but it was about $15.00 more a bottle.  I tried ZHOU's thyroid support, and it works just as well.  I decided to "Subscibe and Save" to save even more.
 I have noticed I feel better!
 I got Mono 1 year ago. Felt very tired and fatigue all of the time.  No energy, and depressed.  I am on the second bottle and it it amazing.  I feel so good and even my my mood has gotten back to normal.  I am also sleeping better. Don't have to take a sleeping pill.  I strongly recommend it.
 Made absolutely no difference. Not sure about how legitimate this product is.
 I love their products!!!!
 Loving this product so far. It's a must try. I have energy and im starting to feel better after just 3wks.
 Very good for smooth energy! Took it b4 football practice gave me a good boost woth better mental clarity
 Great product. Has lowered thyroid numbers based on blood tests. Awesome.
 Taking lots of supplements and changed diet, so feeling better with more energy. Like the natural ingredients in this.
 Excellent product. Would buy again.
 I feel more alert and energized.  Took a few days to really feel it.
 I was trying to lose weight for the past year but I plateaued until I took this supplement, it gave me the energy I needed in the mornings as well! such an awesome product
 Gives me extreme heartburn. Also packaging is not as pictured.
 It helped me a lot, I got labs results and it’s improving my levels.
 It is for my wife and she thinks it is doing a good job.
 High quality product. I’ve taken it for about a month and have seen some improvements in my thyroid symptoms
 Still wrapping up first month but it's helped me thus far &amp; I hope to see results at next doc visit.
 Love the thyroid supplement. I've lost a whole pant size while taking these. No exercise or diet
 I have hypothyroid condition. I do not use chemical drugs . Have been using a natural product for years. Decided to they this and love it. Notice a boost in energy and weight loss.
 This seems to be helping my thyroid issues.  My doctor said he could physically see my thyroid was enlarged, but it tested at the very top end of the healthy range.  He said that medication would be a last resort and suggested I begin taking a thyroid support supplement with iodine in it.  This fits the bill and I feel better after just about a month of taking it.
 only been taking for 2 days but so far so good.
 Increased alertness.  Energy.
 Bought for my sibling she has more energy now.
 Easy to swallow, but i haven't noticed any difference in my blood test or overall feeling yet.
 I've been on this for a month and so far I feel like I have a little more energy and focus. I'm hoping that I will be able to stop taking my levothyroxine soon so I will update this review after I have taken this product for a longer time.
 I didn't notice any difference.
 Very pleased
 I really, truly love this stuff. I can feel the fog creep back in if I go a week or two without it, so I always try to keep a bottle around. Glad it exists!
 This really works highly recommended
 I haven't been using it long enough to speak to long term results, but definitely felt a surge of increased energy after starting.
 This stuff gives me a little boost, not a huge difference, but enough to make it worth buying!
 very good .thank you much!!!
 Excellent product saw results immiedately
 My mom said it was good.She doesn't feel any uncomfortable at present.So far so good!
 Exactly what I've been looking for - affordable iodine/thyroid support. I saw the benefits within a couple days and will continue to use daily! More energy, just an overall great feeling.
 I have lost 5 pounds and the only thing I have changed is adding this.
 This medication changed my life, I feel very energized and my overall health had improved a huge lot!
 I just ordered my second bottle. I have an increase in my energy levels and sleep quality.  No change in weight but hoping to see results soon!
 I didn't find this to be effective at all. I've separately bought some of the supplements that this product contains and found them to be effective on their own.
 Been using this a month now and I love it. I can now stay awake past 8 pm and get up more easily in the morning.
 This really helps me.
 I started taking it because my FreeT3 levels were off but my physician wouldn't give me medication because my TSH was normal.  I have several symptoms of hypothyroidism including weight gain, cold hands and feet, tiredness, hair loss and even producing breast milk.  I am 42 years old and I am NOT pregnant.  It has helped with tiredness and weight loss.  I have been taking it for 3 weeks and I have lost 9 pounds.  I am also exercising and eating healthy. I am still experiencing the other symptoms.  I plan to continue taking this supplement and I will update after my next lab work is completed.
 Great find. I genuinely feel that I have more energy beginning about 3 weeks after starting this supplement. My husband is now taking it, too.
 I can definitely feel a difference since taking this.
 Finally something that works and my doc signed off on it! I hope you guys and Amazon keep up your relationship. This one's a keeper!
 Did nothing for me
 I see no different in my thyroid so only gave a three
 I've been taking these pills for a month now. I take them along with their tumeric. Since taking the thyroid support I've felt more energized, and I don't get the 'food coma' effect after a big meal. Very happy with this product.
 Amazing product!! I was always so tired and this helped wonders with my alertness and decreased my desire to sleep away the day!!
 Incredible product!  Just two pills a day, my thyroid swelling went away, my energy came back, and sleep felt amazing once again!<br/><br/>For a supplemental answer to my hypothyroidism, I couldn't be any happier!
 I take this daily (in addition to my thyroid meds) and I feel that it gives me an addtional boost to my energy levels.
 I happened to run out of this thinking I'd be ok until I was ready to order the next bottle.  Well, I noticed that I was fatigued in the mornings, when previously I had been bouncing off the walls when the alarm clock went off!  So I now know that this is something that I need to keep in my system and keep on hand!
 I wake up feeling great!
 I Love this Product! I really don't like taking medications and I tend to look for a natural organic route when it comes to perscription medications. When I got my thyroid tested results showed that I was in normal range.  believe me when I say this it was in High normal range but there wasn't a need for a perscription. :)
 This product helped with fatigue.  About an hour after taking, I experienced an increase in energy and alertness with no weird side effects.
 This is awesome! I actually started feeling energetic and less fatigue within a week of taking theses.
 I have felt amazing after taking this while doing the whole 30. Anxiety- gone; fatigue-gone. I absolutely believe that this supplement is pivotal in my thyroid health!
 Wife say she feels better already, and I can see a difference also.
 I was looking for something to help with energy and my thyroid is a little off, this does help.  I recommend this product.
 This is  one of the best thyroid supplements I use and cost effected. It also helped with weight loss.
 Definitely improved my energy.
 I've been on these supplements for perhaps 3 months or so and have noticed improved energy.
 Stuff is awesome I feel more energized since I been
 I have been trying this supplement for a few months now, and I definitely noticed a boost in my energy and mood throughout the day. I definitely recommend trying it.
 What a remarkable product, has made a big different in my weight lost goals and training....
 I have tried several different thyroid supplements and this one makes a real difference.  I had part of my thryroid removed 10 years ago.  My thryoid function had been fine up until this past year.  It is starting to slow down, verified by lab tests, and I'd rather not go on thyroid medication so I've been trying different formulations to support it.  I definitely feel a difference with this product.  I have more energy and the 'off' feeling that I was having from the thyroid slowing down has been eliminated.  When I have forgotten to take the product for a couple of days then the 'off' feeling will come back and remind me to take the product.  That in itself shows me what it is doing for me.  Great product!!!
 Great product
 Maybe it's a coincidence, the placebo effect, or wishful thinking, but I've been taking this for 3 days, and I feel way better...
 Does give you extra energy
 Well ladies, and gents. I don't have a negative review of this product.  However, the side effects that I personally experienced is the reason for rating it 2 stars, I didn't have any internal effects but I did have external problems which to me are worse because it can be seen by everyone. My eyes swell so bad, my eyelashes were falling out and stretched the skin over my eyelids so big, now my eyelids have a little bit of a sag to them, and let's face it we all are trying to stay young for as long as we can. So please allow your Dr. to prescribed medication for your thyroid don't try over the counter drugs. Be safe there's hope for your thyroid symptoms.
 Does seem to boost energy.
 Didn't work!
 I was diagnosed with an underactive thyroid years ago and had been taking Armour Thyroid with good results until recently when the formula seems to have changed. Despite a re-emergence of my of the symptoms, my doctor refuses to increase the dosage. She does not like NDTs. I need to function and decided to see if increasing my iodine intake as well as adding Zinc,L-Tyrosine, Copper, Magnesium, Manganese, Molybdenum, and Selenium.  I've been using the product for about a month, and I'm a convert. While I can't say that I am doing cartwheels, I have noticed less joint pain, better digestion and a bit more energy. I hope I continue to improve. It is easy to swallow &amp; I did not find them to have any negative side effects or bad taste.
 Great product but it makes me gassy.
 Been using this for a couple of weeks and really feel like I have more energy.
 Very Good Product.
 It has really helped me
 Excellent.
 It has helped my wife. Will buy again.
 Great product! This has helped boost my energy level and I feel more clear headed. Definitely will continue to use this product.
 I started keeping a bottle in my purse because if I forget to take this in the morning, I have a really hard time concentrating in the afternoon at work. This stuff has really worked for me to alleviate that afternoon fog feeling. There is nothing worse than being in a meeting at work and not being able to recall facts to mind regarding projects I worked really hard on. I think so much more clearly now that I have been taking this product and feel like I can recall things to mind much easier than before. I was honestly starting to get worried about early onset Alzheimer's because of my absent minded-ness. After reading up on more symptoms of my low thyroid and finding this product, I was really happy I gave it a try. It has given me a piece of my sanity back. I was hoping I would drop some weight as other reviewers did, but I have not. I also struggle with PCOS and other endocrine issues in addition to thyroid so I am not really surprised, but was hoping. Oh well.
 Been taking for a month or so.  I seem to have more energy
 I love it. I have been taking for about a year to boost my regular thyroid med. and it works wonders.
 Cannot say enough great things about this product. I always do my research and read reviews before purchasing anything. Still I was skeptical. I suffer from Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. I started taking these a week ago. I feel great! They give me energy, help me feel more balanced and curbs hunger. Between changing my diet to plant based and taking these I lost 14 pounds in a week. Seriously. I know that's highly unusual (as someone who has struggled with weight for most of my adult life) but I'm gonna take it! I will continue on my health betterment journey and these are definitely included.
 The Thyroid Support  Complex gives me energy I never had before.
 2nd order...love it
 Good
 I have noticed a great difference since taking these supplements! Definitely recommend for anyone who isn't always so regular &amp; always feels bloated.
 Great product..and price! I have more energy than before and my appetite is decreasing.
 I just finished my first bottle.  I felt it cut down on my hunger too.
 I feel like a million bucks after a week on Thyroid Support!
 It actually is effective
 So farthis product seems to be doing great for me! I am sleeping better and have more energy as well as better outlook on life! Thank you!
 Fast delivery. Started using it and have noticed more energy, now I feel like I want to do more things. Very good product.
 Love this supplement.  I have noticed a big difference in energy level, sleep quality and overall well being
 I have a Hypothyroid issue and have been diagnosed for about 23 years now. I've tried many MANY different products like this and most of them really fall way short of my expectations. I've been taking these for about 3 months now and my moods feel better, my attitude feels better, I feel better. Not every product works the same for every person, most of us with a thyroid issue know this all too well. I would recommend these and if they don't live up to what you need then return them. My experience has been really good with them.
 Just started using this, about 4 days later I have more energy!
 doesn't seem to work too well...but i must stay consistent with taking it as well.
 Actually works. Does what it claims to do.
 Great product. Immediately noticed an improvement in mood and energy, and also dropped nearly 10lbs in the first 3 weeks of use.
 I have to say I was very impressed with this product. Within the first week not only did I notice a difference, but my Wife did as well. The only way I can explain it in words is that I was at peace with myself. I guess that would be the 'focus' part. I just feel great throughout my entire day. The price is very reasonable too. I will be ordering more with some others as well.
 Does what it says. After a couple weeks I'm noticing its perfect for long work days.
 I love this product and am ordering more. I can definitely tell a difference.
 While I was taking these pills, I felt great, my energy was higher, and overall health was in a better state that before trying.
 Since using this product, I've seen an increase energy levels and mental focus.
 i dont ever write reviews for products but i felt compelled to tell everyone how much better my thyroid is doing after taking this for only one month. I love that i found a healthy natural alternative to pharmaceuticals!!!
 So far, no noticeable benefits, but I've only been taking it for about 2 weeks
 This gave me a headache when I took it.
 Gives me energy and I feel much better.  Going to buy a second bottle.
 Good - felt better!
 This was not ok for me got more sick .thanks for my refund
 Good product. Keeps my thyroid balanced along with other natural supplements.
 I take it everyday and it seems to be working well. I have more energy in the afternoons.
 Noticed a definite increase in energy and less fatigue.
 This product is for a person who has a thyroid.  I don't
 so far seems to be helping my thryoid!!
 Great
 Has all the recommended ingredients for improving thryroid function.  Delivery was expeditious, and I have already started using it. Whatever my thyroid was lacking, this has filled the need.
 Great product helps tremendously. Can tell when you miss a day. Help energy and sleep!!
 I noticed a different in the first 10 days.  I will be ordering more.
 Great product will buy again . Helps with appetite and energy level .
 I've suffered with thyroid issues for 11 years &amp; this stuff gave me the energy I've lacked for so long. I would definitely recommend this product!!!
 Amazing product. Not telling you to use this instead of medical advice but my wife's thyroid was a little slow. This product made her feel better after one bottle. Amazing supplement.
 This is a fantastic product.
 I don't really feel a big difference...
 I was up late with insomnia and came across reading the reviews about the thyroid support and had positive feedbacks from so many people, I thought I would write my experience taking the thyroid for about a little over a week.  I take it in conjunction with the DHEA and have been sleeping like a baby.  I am less irritable and less anxious.  I have to say I'm really happy that I came across Zhou products!  I'm a believer.  Thanks Zhou Nutrition!
 I noticed a difference in my energy, focus, mood &amp; also helps me relax and stay asleep through the night. Very pleased
 I take 2 every day and love it. It gives me a lot of energy. When I didn't take it for a week, I could definitely feel it. I love it and cannot go without it.
 Products was okay! Didn't see much of a difference. BUT it could just be me.
 Absolutely love this product and will continue to purchase.
 I'm not sure if it has benefited me or not
 Wonderful product! Love it!
 Definitely improved my thyroid symptoms
 Love the energy it gives me!
 Thanks
 I like this, i have always had issues with my thyroid, and i have been put om prescription drugs in the past. That really didnt do anything for me. This is my first time trying a more natural alternative supplement, and i have to say im happy with the results. I didnt know what to expect l, but im pleasantly surprised. These gave me a burst of steady energy through out the day, with out making me aick or having a crash at the end of the day. They go down easy, and arent tok big so thats not a problem for me.  I take 2 caps everyday with breakfast and im set for the day. They give me energy, and focus and best of all boost my metabolism. I love these and i definitely do recommend them to everyone with thyroid issues like my self.<br/>Thank you Zhou Nutrition!<br/>I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
 Yes it does make you more bloated and gassy. I have been taking it for 3 weeks now, the only change I noticed are I gain more weight and when I take it I'm more bloated and gassy. I will try something else
 Has made my wife feel so much better than taking Levothroxine! Will definitely buy again!
 Lots of energy, good sleep quality, strongly recommended!
 I have noticed a difference in my appetite. That's all i wanted. Not bad
 Love it!
 Amazing product. I loved it so much, I'm getting it shipped monthly. Results after only a few days...
 Great! Will be reordering monthly.  I can't get through the day without it.
 I am feeling a bit more energy and will continue to take for another month to see how it goes.
 I have been dealing with low energy, exhaustion, and no gumption to want to do anything. I thought it was from my gluten allergy but it came back. They tested for my thyroid but only said I was low on vitamin D. After reading a lot of the reviews I just knew I had to try this product. It didn't take but just a day to start noticing the difference in my energy. I felt alive again! I have more energy for work and for house work! I actually can get out of bed without dragging and I come home with more energy to do stuff. This product has a lot of great stuff in it! Try it once and I know it will improve your life 100% Thank you for this wonderful product that has changed my life tremendously!
 I was soooo tired so I tried this.  Wow I feel more energy.  Definitely reordering
 It's been about two weeks since I ordered these and started taking them. I had tried a different brand before and that didn't work at all.<br/>So I purchased this one hoping it would give me better results. Unfortunately, I still don't feel any better. Looks like this stuff doesn't work me, I'm happy it works for others because from hyper to hypo I have experienced almost every single hypothyroidism symptom. And it sucks..<br/>But I haven't felt a difference, and I guess this product wasn't for me. I will continue to take the capsules maybe I haven't Gave enough time.  If I feel a difference I will definitely update. But I'm still always fatigue and tired and exhausted and this brain fog ain't no joke
 I've been using Thyroid Supporrt for awhile now and I noticed a difference right away. I have more energy and feel more like myself! I will never been without Tyroid Support!
 I love this. It has been a sure fire way to boost my endocrine system
 Took away that groggy can't think straight feeling
 Didn't notice any change.
 Love, love , love this product!! I feel better, more mental clarity and it's helping my weight.
 Feeling great since I started taking them👍
 So far so good! I do have more energy and am also watching what I it
 I have only been taking this for about a month but I can tell a difference in my energy levels. I love this product and would highly recommend it to others.
 Works great! i have more energy and my i don't forget as much anymore.  I am.  not so sure about the weight loss aspect, but overall it is a good product.
 Didn't want to take a prescription.  This provides great energy and relieved deficiency symptoms
 This product works good, it really gives me the energy I need. I have been taking it for about 3 weeks and will buy again.
 Seems to give me more energy when I take this
 I had to stop taking it as it gives me digestion issues, gas and bloating.<br/>Update: Great customer service, they issued me a refund.
 Ive been using this for the last few months instead of levothyroxine.  I'm  beginning to feel like my old self.
 I love this product and it really works I will keep using this
 I didn't notice a difference in my health immediately, like some others here have mentioned. However, I'm on the second bottle and just ordered my third. I forgot how great it's possible to feel! I haven't had so much energy in a long time. I used to be a little lethargic and wanted naps constantly. But now I can go all day. This stuff works.
 Sleeping better and feeling better everyday. Wasn't too optimistic when I began taking these but definitely can tell a difference.
 Seem to be good quality
 Mood was defiantly improved
 So far I really like this product and I plan to keep using it!
 but take with food.
 I bough this supplement few month ago and take every day or every other day one pill in the morning.<br/>its helps me to boost my energy and takes away weakness. I sleep well and feel good too.<br/>great product.
 I really like this supplement. It has helped my issues with my thyroid so much. My metabolism has increased. I have had the worst trouble with shedding pounds, and now i am able to lose them at a healthy pace.<br/><br/>I have always found a foggy brain, where I can't exactly pin point where I left something, or exact details of a situation and now this has helped a lot, and overall it just makes me feel a lot better.
 Love this stuff!
 This is a great supplement to help with a sluggish thyroid when you want a natural approach. I was buying all of its components separately for years, so when I saw this I was excited! Give yourself a boost!
 Really like this product.  Very happy with the results.
 Worked great. Felt better after taking it for a week and helped me with weight loss.
 seems to help with my energy
 This product is a huge help in balancing my thyroid. I won't be without it!
 I would order this product again
 Thyroid issues tend to run in my family (most of the women on my mom side have Hashimotos), but every time I'm checked for anything, I test fine. But I still have a lot of the symptoms. I was taking a supplement from whole foods, and it helped but there were ingredients I didn't want. I tried this base on the reviews and after taking it for a couple days I noticed a marked change in my energy levels and my mood. After one bottle I feel great and I'll get it again. I haven't lost any weight, but I do have the energy to wake up on time and take my dog for walks, so it will probably in the long run.
 I have been taking for a month and I do think they are helping. I will continue to take these.
 Good supplement at a reasonable price. What more could I ask?
 I love this product. It definitely gave me a boost of energy. I'm not as tired anymore. On my 2nd bottle already
 Zhou Thyroid support is great! I feel like someone flipped the switch from off to on when I started taking this. Zhou knocks it out of the park again!
 This product made me feel amazing! No more lethargy, irritability and constant hunger. Plus I have lost weight!
 Love the energy this product has given me!
 I like this product, it seems clean but I have not yet noticed any big difference.  Maybe I need to take it longer.  I will update this review if I notice any substantial changes.
 Life changing. It works great
 No sure just had it for 2 days.
 Pretty good feel like myself
 Was definitely skeptical and unsure if I had a thyroid issue but started taking it and feel better and started losing weight!
 I have only been taking this for a couple of weeks but it seems to be helping
 This product seemed to help me with my overall Thyroid condition.
 This is a great product! Works fast and I didn't have any side effects.
 Love the product
 Working for me!
 I ordered this bottle with no expectations at all. All I knew was I was feeling sluggish, lacked my typical energy, and knew I needed to find something to get me back to where I use to be. My bottle came in the mail, and I got excited that maybe finally, my life can get back on track how it use to be.<br/><br/>I can definitely say Thyroid Support definitely did what it was supposed to. If you're expecting a jolt of energy or expect your heart to beat to increase like you would normally get with a stimulate, then you're looking in the wrong place. Honestly, you're not going to feel anything but normal. I just went through my day as usual without the sluggishness I was use to getting. My sluggishness was bad...some times, I didn't even want to get up out of bed or even lift my arm in the air because I was that tired. Now, I was able to have a normal day. I thought to myself, maybe it was the placebo effect that was taking place. So I incorporated the vitamin in my daily regime and have not looked back.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a product to get you back where you were, then this is definitely the one to chose. The pills are easy to swallow and does not give any nasty after taste. I can definitely say my quality of life have gone back to where it once was.
 Wow.  Makes a huge difference in the quality of my day.  More energy and focus without being jittery or nervous.  Excellent results.
 At first I wasn't really sure the product was working until the second week in. My energy was up and I have lost 8 pounds. Loving this product.
 I have noticed a significant increase in my energy and mood.
 Extremely satisfied, met all my expectations.  Will order again.
 Still on my first bottle so don't think it's been real effective yet. May give it another bottle
 It helps a lot with my energy throughout the day, I used to be constantly tired ALL day and now I am getting through the work day without feeling sluggish.
 Have not seen any changes
 I'm trying to get my thiroid working again.  I think this product may be helping.  I just started using it.
 Definitely helped my energy levels 😊😊😊
 I immediately felt the difference with this product. Truly shocked by how much it truly does work.
 Lives up to its promises!
 This has made all the difference. My energy level has increased and I have been able to avoid synthetic prescription drugs to solve my low thyroid levels. Thanks Zhou!
 It's clearly helped my metabolism and energy level. I highly recommend it.
 I could tell a difference within a week of taking the product.  I feel it is a good product and will reorder.
 Noticed a difference within 2 weeks in overall energy, . had a little tenderness under the throat area now it's gone!
 I love it
 I tried this product as directed for 28 days with no results.
 This is part of my daily routine.
 it is a very good product! I love it ..
 I am finishing my last bottle, and I truly feel better as a result of taking these. More energy!
 I have Hashimoto's and this supplement has made a great difference for me!  It really helps my energy level and supplements the synthetic hormones I take daily!
 A Fantastic product and recommend it highly....
 Seems to work great!!
 I have had thyroid issues for 6 years.  I have hypothyroidism and would consider my thyroid to be non existent.  I continue to take my prescribed medication as it has taken years to get my levels somewhat under control but still do not feel normal.  I have tried many supplements to help with all the horrible side effects of hypothyroidism and have not seen any improvement.  When I started taking this supplement I only took one a day and did not see any difference, however when I started taking 2 ( the recommended dose), I started to have more energy and just felt better.  So I will continue to take these as long as it continues to help.
 Great product, I felt an increase in energy within a couple of weeks. I had half of my thyroid surgically removed years ago for some nodules - while my levels are always normal- I was starting to feel so lethargic and had migraines. I did everything I could-better nutrition, drink a ton of water, exercise... but I was still so low energy. I was getting so tired, I couldn't exercise or stay awake past 8pm. After taking for about 10 days, I noticed an increase in energy and my headaches are gone. Don't get me wrong, it's not like I'm bouncing off the walls now- just feel better over all and have increased energy. I'm going to keep taking- on my second bottle now!
 I've been taking it for a month but can already tell a difference!
 i week, no noticable chang... will keep trying.
 I am feeling better since I started taking this supplement. More energy!
 so far is working, but keep in mind that I'm doing a strict diet and exercise as well.
 I  just ordered my second bottle.  I like the ingredients in this product, and am hoping to see positive results!
 This stuff definitely worked for me!
 We will see if it works for me.
 Loved the extra energy
 I love these. I lost a pant size in 2 weeks after starting these.
 This is for my wife she says it's helping her alot
 Made me very ill
 I am currently hypothyroid and take armour thyroid.  In addition to armour, there are a variety of vitamins that are recommended to help your thyroid and reduce cortisol, including selenium, iodine, copper, ashwaganda...way too many to try to take individually.  I searched on Amazon for a fairly priced supplement containing all of them at the right amount - ex. Selenium should be 200mg.  Thyroid support by Zhou nutrition is a great price and gives me everything I need in one pill.  I have been taking it for 1.5 months, am very happy with it and will continue to take it every morning.
 After many years of knowing there is something wrong with my thyroid but all tests coming back fine My doctor recommended I try supplementing my iodine and selenium levels. She ran tests and both were very low. Initially I added foods rich in both but didn't see much change. After some research I purchased this supplement, I took them to my doctor and she was impressed with everything in them except the cheap version of B-12 used in this. After three weeks of taking this supplement my energy levels are returning. My weight fluctuations are less frequent, I am more tolerate to cold, eat less (I think my hunger was due to my body seeking the supplements it needed through food just a guess.) and I feel like myself again! I am back to regular exercise and loving it!<br/><br/>By the way, for all the people who gave this supplement a few stars because you took a whole bottle and saw little change. After a week I thought the same thing but my doctor explained it like this: Most likely your body has been so deficient that it may take awhile to get you to the level you need to be in order to feel a difference. You cannot expect to reverse years of deficiency in a month of supplementation.
 This is a repeat purchase.  I will continue to purchase this supplement  However, I do not take it daily as it's directed (2 capsules).  I add it to the mix I take. I understand the 'synergistic' blend but sometimes I am already receiving enough of one of the ingredients and it's a cost issue.<br/><br/>When I start something new, I will take it as directed to see if I like it and I feel it works for me.  I also, use muscle testing and  I respond positively and with need for this brand/supplement so that is why I include it in my routine.
 I am very pleased with the Thyroid Support, I have tried others in the past but this one gives consistent results.
 I have not seen any results but will try another bottle before I decide. According to other reviews I may need a second bottle to get the full effects. I have been fighting thyroid issues for years so it may take me a little longer.
 Good stuff
 seems fresh quick delivery
 I have two kids under the age of 4-- my 17-month-old has never slept through the night, and my 3-year-old has multiple disabilities. So yeah, serious fatigue and brain fog over here. But after two weeks of taking this stuff, I've found that I'm able to THINK again. Before, I went through my day like a zombie, accomplishing the bare minimum but never really getting ahead or making a difference. Now, I have the energy and focus to be productive. Perhaps the effects of these pills are psychosomatic, but even if that is the case, I'm fine with it because they're working.
 Thanks for the refund,didn’t work for me.
 Love this. I noticed a difference in my energy levels right away. I would recommend this product!
 Great product❤️❤️❤️
 I got the green tea with the Thyroid Support. The first time I started taking them I had gotten a headache the first day. After that I was fine. Then I stopped taking the pills because I'm so bad with pills lol but then I started taking them again and no headache that time! BUT both times they helped with energy. Usually when I get tired I would get super sick feeling the need to throw up. Ever since I took them, I NEVER feel that way anymore. Even now that I haven't taken them for some months already. Lately I've been getting more tired so will be getting back to them. I just bought different pills from Zhou and am DYING to try them out.<br/>And I sweaaaar I wasn't paid to write a good review lol. I'm just completely satisfied with my purchase.
 Works great.
 So far I love it!  Just started taking them at the end of last month.  Giving me energy and the iodine that my body needs.
 I recently started competitively swimming. I experienced low energy levels and started taking this. I immediately started feeling better and have more energy!
 Works great- gives me energy and suppresses my appetite.
 Just started taking! Will see how I feel. 5star feeling positive!!!
 Definately helps me sleep better and feel more energized
 Helps alot if you have hashimotos
 I wanted so badly for this to work in tandem with my Armour Thyroid.  I'm so bummed.  The reviews looked so good.  For me, a week or so into taking it I started to notice that my stomach felt weird, like it was in a big knot, and I was getting major migraines.  I also felt nauseous and a little light headed.  I honestly thought I was coming down with something since the flu is going around where I work.  I stopped taking this, just to test a hunch, and those feelings all went away.  I guess my body doesn't like what's in this product.
 I like the thyroid support since taking it my energy has increased.
 I do get a slight boost in energy, it is definitely helping!! Can't wait to see the results as I continue to take this product!
 A+++
 Knew it was a chance if these would impact the function of my hypoactive thyroid or not. They didn't. Nice that much of what I need for it (naturally) is in one pill instead of several, but given price will go back to my three natural supplements. Be very careful if you are trying to go off Synthroid with these as some reviewers stated!!<br/><br/>UPDATE: Wow, talk about customer service! After I left neutral review, seller contacted me with {an unrequested} refund the same day because of their money back guarantee. Given their service and guarantee I would readily recommend others who are hypo/hyper thyroid to try and see if it helps at no risk.
 So far so good noticeable difference in energy levels and hair loss. Will continue to use!
 Great product. Offers the thyroid support I need, in a natural product!
 I am very satisfied with my recent orders. Got a few of my friends following me as well since I spread the word. Thanks to the help from zhou nutrition.
 Love this product, my body has responded well to the thyroid support. My energy levels have improved and brain fog has decreased. I especially love the reduction in pain episodes.This product, for me, does exactly what is states it's going to do.
 It takes a few weeks to kick in but I feel my energy is up a good deal
 I've been using the Thyroid Support Complex for about a month now and can definitely tell a difference in my energy level! Prior to taking it I found I couldn't make it through the day without taking a nap in the mid-afternoon, despite having gotten 8-9 hours of solid sleep. After taking this for about 2 weeks I really noticed a spike in my energy level and love that I can now make it from the time I wake up until bed time without needing a nap and just feel more well rested overall. Would definitely recommend.
 So far not notice much difference yet!
 Had a baby #4 in August 2016, and I weighed a steady 165-170 lbs.  I had tried losing weight by running, watching what I ate, you know - the usual stuff.  But I'd gain and lose the same 2-3 lbs.  I purchased Heidi and Chris Powell's Extreme Transformation book.  You have 5 "high carb" days, one "low carb" day, and day 7 is a "clean-cheat" day.  Each day you eat 5 small portion meals (which, if you add "free" veggies like cabbage and cauliflower - the meals can get pretty big) and the last meal of the day is low carb.  For two weeks I ate this way and ran for about 15 mins 3x/week and dropped about 3 lbs.  And I was feeling good, but hungry.  (And now she gets to the review...) This magical bottle right here?? Game-changing.  I started taking these and BAM!  The weight started melting off.  Same diet, same exercise.  I feel great, and I have no side effects.  While I do not have a confirmed "Thyroid Issue", the supplements in these pills are helping me feel better and look better than I have in years.  Thank you!  (P.S. Peep the Sweet Sweat bands &amp; cream - I sweat like a pig around my tummy when I run, and it feels like I'm amplifying my results with it).  3 weeks with my combo method = 9lbs down.  Try it.
 Didn't feel any difference
 Great product. Really helped and felt a difference.
 Fantastic product, I have so much energy. Would buy again, love amazon!!
 IT WORKS GOOD
 TERRIFIC product!!<br/><br/>Helping me lose some weight and more energy!!
 I have not taken it long but it feels like my energy levels are increasing.
 It's great product totally satisfied
 Love this product! Great company!
 My hair is thickening and I feel better overall.
 I wanted to have more energy with the possibility of feeling like myself again. Would recommend this to anyone as a supplement.
 Balanced over all supplement
 Make it me loose weight , I recommended to some coworkers and they are happy too with the results
 Great product!
 Worked great!  I was able to concentrate better at work and didn't feel as tired after taking this supplement.
 100% recommend I love this product :)
 I haven't used it for long but looking forward to good results!
 Works great
 I wasn't as tired finally!! Something that finally helps get me back to sort of a normal!
 will be buying more
 My sluggish thyroid had me at my wits end.  I decided to try a supplement as a last ditch effort before I went on the traditional replacement therapy.  I wish I had done it years ago.  The swelling in my throat is gone, I have so much energy, and I even lost 7 pounds (in NOVEMBER!).  I take 1 pill a day instead of 2 because 2 made me grumpy, but otherwise I have had no negative side effects.
 My skin, hair,and nails are healthier and I have more energy<br/>highly recommend this product
 I tried some other products and this one definitely made me feel differently...getting another bottle!
 This has helped my energy level considerably.
 I haven't noticed anything drastic, but living in the Los Angeles area adjacent to Simi Valley Iodine is probably a good idea for all of us. Because the defunct Santa Susanna Field Lab and the multiple reactor meltdowns that occurred there.<br/>Radiation poisoning is a real and ongoing problem most are unaware until it is on TV, then soon forget out of sight out of mind.
 Great product and very fast service!  The product has worked well for me.  Highly recommended.
 Great support to my thyroid medication! Easy on my stomach also.
 Good stuff.  It helps
 Got it for my husband and he likes it
 The pills are worked really well to curb my apetite.
 Great product. I can tell when I don't take it. A little clearer head and entertainment boost.
 👍🏼
 Love this, the best product for thyroid
 I started taking this product to supplement my levothyroxine regimen. I read the reviews and was slightly skeptical that this product could be that good..... so far, it has been amazing! I feel more alert and energized. The brain fog of hypothyroidism has improved tremendously! I haven’t had any weight loss yet (it isn’t necessarily a weight loss product) but am hoping this product will at least continue to help with the energy to be much more active thereby leading to weight loss.<br/> I have only been taking this product for a few weeks so far l, which is my reason for the 4 stars instead of 5.
 Love taking this product..
 Great products and customer service!
 I have taken nearly a whole bottle and cannot see any good results<br/>Additional comment....customer service is awesome....I ordered this with the understanding it might not be what I needed but after my review the company gave me my money back...I will definitely be looking at their products in the future.
 Felt more energy. Worth giving it a try
 I enjoy, would buy again
 Not noticing any beneficial changes. In fact, I seem to be sleeping longer and worse since taking this stuff. It's been a few weeks. I'm confused as to what this stuff is supposed to help with.... oh well.
 Due to state budget cuts I found myself with no insurance and cut hours. I should be on medication for my thyroid &amp; wish that I could be, but now I'm not. This supplement is not a substitute for my medication. It has helped me feel better. It may just be a placebo effect, but I'm feeling better than I was a few months ago. I have tried other supplements for thyroid issues and this is the only one that didn't make me sick. No dizziness, no nausea.
 This supplement works for my hypo-thyroid sub-clinical (temporary condition). Just the feeling that I am "myself" again, no heavy drowsiness as other supplements I have tried did all give me. I almost got discouraged before I found this formulation.<br/><br/>The other products I have tried for a hypo-thyroid - I stopped all of them after my fatigue increased to the point I could not finish my day:<br/><br/>Adrenal Edge - Fatigue Support / Go Nutrients<br/>AdrenaForm Adrenal Fatigue Support / VH Nutrition<br/>Adrenal Boost Stress Response / Mountain Song<br/>Mood Boost / LES Labs
 haven't seen any noticeable results just yet, but I'm going to keep it up
 Great energy boost!
 These pills have worked wonders for me. I am finishing my 2nd month now and it's been a godsend. Pricey but it's worth it for how much better I feel.
 Seems to be helping. Great product.
 The thyroid supplement interacted with my synthyriod medicine and it made me more tired and less motivated to do things. I went to the doctors to test my tsh it was normal however I was experiencing Brain fog and lack of activity. I would recommend this supplement only if you are not taking any thyroid prescribed medicines.
 A great product that has taken the place of my prescription Synthroid!
 Taking this, my natural oils, and tumeric complex reduces swelling and inflammation.
 Would give it zero if I could. The label in the photo says iodine as kelp. The actual label says as kelp and potassium iodide. I have an anaphylactic shock reaction and an epipen for potassium iodide and synthetic iodine. I can only take kelp and natural iodine. I would not have hecked the label again because I already checked it prior to ordering but I forgot what was in the pills and glanced at it. Shocking! Really!
 excellent product
 Amazing product.
 Love it.  Noticed huge increase in energy. Just ordered my second bottle!
 Good so far
 Works well.
 Irritates my stomach
 about 3 weeks in and taking consistently. So far so good!
 Amazing product I started taking it and Day one I felt like a different person! I was always so tired, hungry, not focused and I gain weight in the past 2 yrs. Although this product has not helped me lose weight it definitely has giving me energy and focus and I'm less hungry. I feel more energized and less nervous. When I stopped taking it for like 2 weeks I felt horrible again and noticed the difference. I love it I will order more.
 I read many reviews before I buy this, with most people, it seems that the product is working, for my case, no changes at all, no positives or negative signs, i am using it daily since around a month, it did not add anything to my performance or my metabolism. on the other hand, the company really care, the contacted me when I bought it, and they offer their help and advises to make my experience great,<br/>so i think it is recommend to try, and even if it doesn't work with you, at least you provide your body with many important mineral,
 I really couldn't tell a difference in the way I feel.  Not what I expected
 Great Product
 Before taking Thyroid Support, my blood test results had given me reason for concern as there were several indicators of thyroid issues.  I began taking Thyroid Support with Iodine twice a day and the next time I had blood tests done, I found that everything had returned to the normal range.  I have also noticed that my ability to concentrate has improved, which is a big deal to me since I am in a very rigorous PhD program.  My weight had been fluctuating more than usual, but has now stabilized and remained constant.  Overall, I feel more balanced physically and mentally.
 I have a family history of hyperthyroidism and am trying to be proactive. My doctor isn't recommending medication yet but I was certainly feeling the effects. A friend recommended finding a vitamin support to help and this is the third I have tried. First was ok, second did nothing, but this product I genuinely see a healthy effect on my body! Everyone is different and your doctor should be aware of any issues you are having but this is a great support to me.
 Sorry to say it's done absolutely nothing .... I was really hoping.  No extra energy, no weight loss
 Loved this supplement.  I have had hypothyroidism for 6 years and recently went through a plateau with my weight loss.  Within a month of starting the supplements, I have lost 8 more pounds seemingly effortlessly.  I feel more energetic also; there's definitely something to this stuff.  It's the only change I made to my diet/routine.  I usually can't tell a difference with vitamins and supplements, but this one I can.  Just take it as directed...2 in the morning with meals. Enjoy...Thank you!
 Oh, heck ya!<br/>I have so much energy, I cleaned my house, my car, went to the grocery store, ran 5 miles and I am rocking and a rolling!<br/>What else can I say? I am buying more. I get things done, I have more energy and no side effects.
 This exactly what I needed to kick start my thyroid.  Great product and will buy it again.
 These pills made my head hurt wow I had high hopes maybe they are good but just not for me hold on and they gave me terrible gas now I will say that I have more energy and I feel a little more focused but the headaches are not good and the gas is hard to manage maybe I need to take without food Idk..Update:<br/>I received an email from customer service. They will be refunding my money so that is okay.They have good customer service maybe I will try another kind of there supplements in the future.
 this is just what I needed...feel much better
 I have been taking these for 3 weeks now and I feel better.  I still get a little tired but I'm less foggy, have better workouts  and feel like I lost a little weight.  I am only taking one a day in the morning but I might take it up to two pills a day on next bottle.  Hoping to see if continued results  or even get better.<br/><br/>20 April 2017: after completing my bottle, I tried something else and got zero results. So I reordered a bottle of thyroid support and saw results again.  Now I'll be taking this from here on out.
 Great
 Meh. I find no effects from taking a whole bottle of this. Of course unknown imported supplements are just that - unknown.Who knows what's in it?  I should have had more sense than to waste my money and perhaps cause physical damage by buying this stuff. I feel like an idiot for falling for this.
 Great product at a great price!
 Wife was having lots of weird things going on. I did some research and from listening to her tell about Dr. visits zeroed in on Thyroid Issues. Did some research and found this read several of the reviews and we tried it. its only been 1 month and the world isnt spinning the opposite direction yet. But she is getting relief form all the odd aches and pains. Hot flashes have backed off. I am waiting  patiently for the Mood Swings to subside. :)  It seems to be a decent product so far.
 This product is great has everything I was looking for in a supplement all in one pill!! I'm going to try it for 6 months and see if it helps my thyroid.  I am just finishing up my 3 month and so far everything looks and feels great!! My doctor knows I'm using this supplement and we both like the results so far.  This pill is easy to swallow and doesn't make me brup as some other supplements have.
 I love the ingredients in this product!  I have been on it a few weeks. Instantly I noticed an increase in my energy. I'm hoping as I take it That I can drop some weight. I have stayed steady and haven't been eating the best so I'm grateful for that!  I reccomend this product and I'm glad I found it. Helps to replace taking as many supplements!
 Really just a diaretic
 Love the energy it gives me.
 Absolutely great product and great company to deal with!! A very good experience and refreshing change from the norm! Thank You.
 It hepls me with my thyroid desease. It regularized my cicle. Excellent product.
 Thyroid Support with Iodine by Zhou does exactly what it says for energy and focus. I have a very under-active thyroid which makes me always feel like I have no energy and hardly any focus. I noticed immediately that I had more energy and not so tired. This supplement helps tremendously and I have already noticed a difference when I missed a dose while waiting for my second bottle. The only negative is that I wish the pills were more budget friendly but it's worth it regardless for the simple fact the product works.
 I took 1 bottle a few months ago to help with my sluggish self diagnosed hypothyroid symptoms. It did help alot. I didnt get around to re-ordering as it slipped my mind and Ive gotten busy lately. What I noticed recently is that my hormone levels are way off and my many of pms symptoms came back. I thought about what I had done different and why I hadnt had any pms for awhile and I realized it was because I had been taking this product. I re-ordered this product and hope to maintain my hormone levels once again!
 Works! I had to go down to one per day because I was getting flush but it did what it was made to do and did it well. I noticed a difference around the 4th day. I would buy it again
 Just got the pills on  Monday and the minute I got them I start taking them,today is Thursday honestly I don't know what is in this pills but must b Gold😁.I thought to wait more to leave a review but I am amazed and I can confirm what other reviewers said about not being tired anymore around 3 and sleeping better.Now praying that they will help me with my thyroid problem🙏🏻
 So far this has seemed to help with my energy levels.  Starting my second month on it next week.
 Maybe works for some people. I took them for a few days and they made me feel strange. I felt irritable all the time and not like myself. I quit taking them.
 Have suffered from hypothyroid for 15 years now. After a decade of medications for it and other health issues I grew tired of always pitting synthetics and other lab made products in my body. Not the way nature intended. Stumbled on these supplements on Amazon and have taken them for 2 months now. I gotta say they have improved my energy, sleep, and mental well being quite well. Can't say if they work as well as prescribed meds and still should get checked regularly but I could tell a big difference in me when I ran out and didn't take them for a couple weeks. The slow dragging energy, trouble sleeping and weight gain returned. Give em a try what have you got to loose?
 Awesome product!! It has helped with my energy and my focus. I have been taking this product for a month now and have lost 12 pounds and feel so much better. I have already ordered another bottle of this and will continue to use it as long as I get the results that I got this month. An added bonus is that I have had no side effects while taking this product like I have some of the other products.
 Helped me recover from my fatigue
 Not for me. Caused stomach issues.
 Update: I haven't taken this in about a week because I ran out of product. I just realized how crappy I am feeling without it. I didn't notice any weight loss, but I believe it to be because I may not have thyroid issues as I originally assumed. (can't lose a pound for the life of me after my third baby!) I do believe I may have some endocrine issues aside from my thyroid. I think if you know you are having issues with your thyroid, this could very well work for you. If not, it's definitely worth it for the energy and overall feeling of well-being this gives you.<br/><br/>Gave me extra energy, no weight loss.
 Scam do not buy
 Love!!!
 I definitely noticed an improvement.
 Unfortunately it did not work for me, but I don't think it was the product, but most likely my body chemistry. They very promptly refunded every dime of my money as soon as I gave this review, so I definitely have no hard feelings.  I do believe it works for some people, but unfortunately I wasn't one of them.
 This product has been a game changer for me. My family has a history for thyroid problems and Hashmotoes. I've personally not been diagnosed with a thyroid disorder but I've read it can be tricky to diagnose. I've  had so many test done and I'm under a RA doctors care. All they have done is diagnose me with a autoimmune disorder and pill me near death.<br/>This thyroid  support has made me feel so much better after years of being terribly sick. I'm starting to feel like myself again. My fatigue has about vanished. I've been taking it for 3 weeks. It did take about 10 days before I noticed feeling better. Ordering more!
 Works great
 it seems to be serving its purpose
 great
 I have vitiligo (white spots on my skin which don't receive pigment) and many forums suggest B12, copper and zinc as well as suggest that this autoimmune disease may be associate with thyroid problems. So, I thought I'd try some thyroid support;) I have to say I never really bought into herbal supplements in the past and now I'm hooked! I feel a significant change in my energy level, I'm more alert and I have noticed I've lost weight. It's too soon to say if it's impacted any of my white spots, but I'll update this review if it does!
 Perfect product, does really help.  Very pleased and fast shipping too.
 Updated 1/3/16- I increased a star just for the customer service. They have been amazing, responsive and supportive. It's great to see a company like this.<br/><br/>Original post- This product offered no positive change from when I started taking it. I actually gained weight. I have not changed any eating habits, exercise routines etc and increased weight since starting.
 I thought I would try this since I suspect my thyroid is a little sluggish. I was pleasantly surprised. I am almost through my first bottle. Such a nice sustained energy release. I never come home from work thinking I need a nap. I take in the morning after I put something in my stomach.  I sleep well. No jitters at all!  Highly recommend. Read the ingredients!  I just purchased my second bottle. I will be ordering this from now on.
 I saw improvement within two weeks.
 This is life changing!
 I tried this for energy, focus, and brittle shedding hair.  I finished the first bottle and saw improvements in all three areas.  I plan to add it to my line of supplements.  Note: It suggests taking with food and I highly recommend following that suggestion.  Taking on an empty stomach could result in nausea and other gastric un-pleasantries.
 would not use without talking to your doctor first could cause problems otherwise
 I have been feeling very lethargic, weight gain, and having pretty severe hair loss, etc.  Several people suggested that I needed to have my thyroid checked.  After some research, I became concerned and wanted to start doing something natural to help until I could get in to the doctor.  I found these and decided to give them a try.  Within a couple of days, I felt a MAJOR difference in my energy and I feel clearer, more focused, and more relaxed.  I highly recommend these.
 Excellent product,  great customer service.
 I'm sorry, I am on Heart Meds and it gave me chest pains so I couldn't take them.
 I am ordered this product several times and really feel like it helps improve my mood and tiredness. I have hashimotos and am always feeling like I am running on empty. I feel like this definitely helped to get me to feel more like myself.
 DIdn't expect this to work as I've been trying various forms of supplements such as this on and off for years but I have to say that this is the first time I've seen ACTUAL results take place after a few days. I had a number of thyroid related problems that diminished almost immediately. Creaky joints, muscle fatigue, and general lethargy started to vanish and I even lost some weight!<br/><br/>I don't normally right reviews for products like this and I can't guarantee that it will work for everyone but it truly worked for me.
 So far so good
 Good in the past but not now. When I tired this quite awhile ago there was an energy boost within a month but now it makes me sleepy. The reviews about counterfeit, expired cosmetics and supplements might be getting to me. Will still turn to Amazon for other products.
 I was reading about how the American diet is low in iodine. Dr. Christiane Northrup advises that women in particular need to supplement with more iodine. Read about how important your thyroid is and you may want to start supplementing too.
 Took as instructed each day.  However, I might as well have been taking a vitamin or placebo.  It did absolutely nothing for me.
 I definitely feel more energetic, though I still have that stubborn 10 lbs. Ot would be nice if it cost less, and I still have to get blood work done to see how it's Fe ting my thyroid, but if you're sluggish try it out. I'm going to do a tamarind flush to get the fluoride out, which can disrupt the entire endocrine system, not just the thyroid.
 I am really liking this! I have more energy when I wake up in the mornings, reduced appetite (I always felt hungry!), I feel less bloated (I don't know if it is less bloated or if I am losing weight, which could be a possibility), and I feel my metabolism speeding up soooo much! I feel myself NEEDING to eat at lunch. Food isn't a want anymore, it is a need... that in itself makes me feel healthier. My body is using my foods energy faster than normal so I am needing to refuel more often. Last time I felt like this, I was a young teenager! My metabolism started slow in way down at the age of 20. I just feel more healthy!<br/>(In addition to thyroid support, I have been taking vitamins:  b100's, D, Biotin, fish oil)
 Seems to be helping me and my thyroid just fine! Very happy with the product
 This product is excellent. I felt I had a sluggish thyroid for some time now. When I tried this product I immediately started to lose weight (clothes are much baggier) and am still losing. My brain fog slowly diminished and my mood is much much better. I have increased energy and I've noticed my belly fat is dissipating. I feel great! Will purchase over and over!
 I've been having some thyroid issues for a while so I decided to try this supplement. I've only been taking it a little over a week. While I haven't lost any weight, I do have some days with more energy. However, the thing that I've noticed the most is that my focus has improved tremendously. I've been very happy with this product.
 At first I thought this might work, but after following the directions for 3 weeks they started to irritate my stomach, I stopped taking them and after a few days my stomach felt much better.The packaging and delivery was excellent.
 This is a recap of a past review. My son takes Thyroid support for a year now. Changing his diet and adding these supplements has kept him from not being medicated with Pharma meds. Keep the natural ingredients Zhou and I see your company going a long way. I also use milk thistle for myself everyday and spirulina in powder form. Great natural ingredients.<br/>Thank you !
 In my present physical condition this item can do nothing.<br/><br/>I'm disappointed I can't return it.
 Decent and noticeable energy boost while taking these. I get things done and wake up in the morning without feeling awful. I thought these were fantastic but I ended up switching over to Doctor's Best High Absorption Magnesium instead and I feel better.
 I have ordered 2 bottles previous to the one I am on right now.  The label looks different and the capsules are a different color this time.  I figured they are just updating their look and using cheaper capsules and so I started taking the new bottle.  I have noticed I am once again tired all the time and have the old brain fog back.  Most of the symptoms this originally helped are back, it's almost like I am taking a placebo.  I don't know how to contact the seller and find out what is going on, but I'm not happy that's for sure.  :-(
 Love this product!
 I have almost finished the first bottle I ordered of zhou, and will be ordering more!! I have had depression, and weight gain and a horrible lack of energy.  This thyroid support from zhou has been a lifesaver! I have more energy throughout the day and I am not sleeping 9+ hours a day.  I have energy all day and am able to do chores after working a full day and still have energy to walk the dogs, and workout.  I am so happy with this purchase that I just suggested it to a coworker with similar issues!
 I used another thyroid supplement that didn't seem to be making a difference until I turned to this one. First thing I noticed was I didn't require as much sleep – I was getting up a couple of hours earlier than usual. That was a big and welcome change for me. I also began losing a few pounds after wondering why on earth I had been unable to lose weight considering how little I ate. I'm not in the habit of recommending supplements. Supposedly I'm still at the sub-clinical level which isn't even necessarily supposed to result in symptoms at this stage, but I like to be hyper-vigilant and will see in a few months if lab results shift. In the meantime, I will continue to use this particular supplement and probably from now on even should the lab results shift in my favor. Thyroid problems directly attacks quality of life issues. Very essential to me. After I had ordered their product a couple of times, I got an email: "Every review we receive is read by our team because it is the lifeblood for what we do....If you'd rather not, I understand. I appreciate you reading this far. With gratitude..." The wording was both civil and appropriate, which I liked. Other language in the email suggested to me that this company is people oriented and not just in it for the money. If the company remains this way, I will continue using their specific product and not try yet another brand.
 Good product and service!!
 Two bottles, with zero side effect... I have used several products from ZHOU NUTRITION  and have wasted my money. I will not buy from this manufacturer again.
 Didn't see much of a change. I looked up information about the product too and it apparently is not very good for you. Hmmmm...
 I suffer from Imsomnia ,I didn't feel any changes  the first 3 days after that I can tell the big difference  I'm able to sleep better.
 We have waited till we've gone through two bottles before writing a review. I have seen a positive change in energy and mood. No side effects witnessed, which is a good thing. I didn't see it as an energy booster but it did open up the will to get up and be active. Overall, I believe it's a good supportive product.
 Just within using this product for 3 weeks, I have noticed a huge improvement in my ability to make it through my 13+ hour days without feeling drained or taking a nap halfway through.  I also have been able to make it through the day with less cravings and my the quality of my workouts has definitely increased.
 I have felt so energetic in the morning when I take these. I am loving them so much I added them to my monthly subscription.
 I have been feeling fatigued and very irritable lately along with some lack of concentration.  I just started a new job and wanted to be sure I could keep up with the training. I believe this product has helped to re energize me! I am getting thru the training with lots of energy!
 Unlike the many reviews I've read I haven't necessarily noticed any dramatic changes since taking this supplement. I really want this to work as I feel I have a sluggish thyroid and always tired and unable to lose weight despite an active life. I completed my first bottle and was hesitate to purchase again but received a complementary offer to try for another 30 days. I will do so and if I see notable results with second bottle I will update my review accordingly.
 Have only been taking it a few weeks and while I have no noticeable increase in energy - I do notice that I am still awake at 10 PM...  One thing I REALLY noticed after a few days was less brain fog.
 I have been buying this for my husband for the past year for his hypothyroidism. It has done wonderful things for his health, he is less tired and doesn't gain as much weight as he would if he was off of his medication from his doctor. I love having this morn a chiral alternative for him as we are trying to stay away from Western medication.
 I have hypothyroidism and suffer from brain fog and low energy. After a week I could think clearer and my energy levels were/are up. I've signed up to receive this product every 6 weeks!
 I have been taken various thyroid support supplements for a number of years. Most seem to work for a while and then the body adapts and the vendors seem to fade.<br/><br/>Zhou Nutrition's Thyroid Support Complex with  iodine has given me consistent results and has not faded. Great product.
 I have been taking them for around 2 weeks now and they seem to be giving me energy like they say. They don't upset my stomach which is a good thing, the are pretty easy to swallow. I take them both together in the mornings.
 Working great now I'm not retaining the water I was before!
 I was a little hesitant to purchase this but had done my research so I bought one bottle. Directions said take 2 each day. I started by taking just one a day for a week then I increased up to the 2 per day as I am sensitive to medication. I experienced no adverse reactions and am surprised by how much better  I have been feeling. By the 3rd week  I ordered  another bottle and I plan on  continuing with the Thyroid Support. This product has helped me decide to take my health and well being to a new and natural level and am glad that I tried it.
 Ever since taking these I have way more energy all day as I was always tired and found my thyroid levels were slightly abnormal. I'm eager to see what my next round of bloodwork shows in 3 months but I definitely notice a difference!! Will continue to purchase them in hopes to stay off more prescription meds.  Thanks!!
 Since I have been taking the thyroid support supplement, I have been feeling great!
 I got these vitamins to help me with my energy levels during the day. I stand up at my work so I am on my feet for 9 to 10 hours a day. Thyroid support complex is helping me feel better and have more get up and go. Also I feel my thinking is more clear and sharp. Thank you Zhou Nutrition for making a great product!
 I have an actual thyroid problem and am on medication. If your meds aren't working this doesn't seem to assist in anything. Still working on getting my meds right so maybe it will help then. But I'm not really sure what this does for you in my situation unfortunately.
 I have been diagnosed with Hypothyroidism almost 2 years ago.  And just recently all of my symptoms have returned. So after asking for further testing and bloodwork, turns out I have Hashimotos disease.  I have been given the go ahead to start my thyroid support. Thank you
 I don't know if I need to try this longer than the one bottle's worth? I didn't notice any difference in clarity of thinking or any of the other issues...
 just started , too early to write any feedback , will be updating afterwards.<br/><br/>Now adding more review.<br/>I discontinued using this product , the pills does nothing. more that half bottle is still with me .
 I can only say, at this time, that I do like the Thyroid Support. I feel that I need a few more weeks to receive it's full effect. I have only begun taking them recently. Easy to swallow. Ingredients that I have been missing are included in the capsule such as Zinc and Manganese, along with other "boosters" for my system.
 I received it on Sep 23rd and have taken it for one day, today is the second, I must say that I didn't think it was goin to work so fast, but I usually lay in bed depressed on my days off, not today! I have energy to actually clean my house. I will order this from now on!
 I have not experienced any weight loss. I use to wake up at 3am every night but since taking these supplements I sleep through the night. Also my thinking is not as foggy. I'm on my second Bottle, about ready for number three. Still hoping to shed some lbs.
 Ive only been using it for a couple weeks and already notice a slight improvement in my energy level.  I intend on continuing to see if it gets even better. I think it will take a 2nd or 3rd bottle to really know how well it works.
 Got this for my wife who took it for 30 days and noticed no changes in overall energy or weight loss. I'm editing the review at this time because the company, with no request from myself, took it upon themselves to give me a refund for this product. I'ts great to do business with a company that backs their products. So I give the product 1 Star but the company gets 4 Stars. Thank you Zhou Nutirtion.
 Life-changing, I've never felt so alert &amp; energized, brain fog is gone and anxiety significantly reduced.
 Although I have always tested fine for thyroid I decided to give this a try and within a few days began to feel more alert,less lethargic with a notable increase in energy and lower body temperature.I buy many supplements but this is by far the best I have ever tried.I have already bought a second bottle.
 Since taking this supplement I feel more energized and less moody. My energy level stay pretty consistent throughout the day and I don't experience the debilitating afternoon exhaustion! I am more alert when performing tedious tasks and generally feel more productive throughout the day. If you are ready to stop feeling fatigued and drained, this is the product for you!
 These have made a difference in my energy level and I am able to get a lot more done during the day. Its like my body wakes up! I take 2 everyday with a light breakfast and I feel the difference all day. Will be ordering more!
 Haven't noticed any difference since taking this product. Won't buy again.
 I have been on prescription thyroid medicine for 20 years and I got tired of depending on it. I have tried different thyroid formulations from liquid to capsules and this one is as easy and affordable as prescribed medication. I have been off of prescription thyroid meds for a year now and have not had the side effects that even 3 days off the medicine would give me. No fatigue, hair loss, irritability.
 After being diagnosed with low thyroid but not enough to be put on medication by my Dr. I researched and found this product and it had great reviews.<br/>I have been taking it for approximately 5 months bow and I feel so much better than I did before. More energy and it has helped me introduce a little gluten back into my diet. I had been having to avoid all gluten for several years. Never associating it with low thyroid!!<br/>I highly recommend this product! It's a great price too!
 I used this formula for a month and based on the reviews of others, I really expected this supplement to take effect quickly. When it didn't, I shared with the company my thoughts and they refunded my money. A month after finishing a 30 day supply, and with a refund in my pocket, I realized that the Thyroid Support might actually have been working - just subtly, and slowly. I'm giving it another try for a few months, and hoping that if I give it a few months, I'll see or feel a real difference.<br/><br/>I'm only giving it 3 stars for now because I don't know how this is going to play out. I like that the company seems to be proactive and supports the experience of its customers. I'll edit this review after I've had a couple of months to see if it really works, or if I just imagined feeling slightly better before feeling worse/the same.
 In 2011 I was diagnosed with stage four breast cancer and had 14 months of chemo, 28 days of radiation, and almost 2 years of surgeries. Because of that I have had horrible problems with fatigue and due to the radiation to my neck I have nodules on my thyroid. Which has given me some problems again with fatigue.<br/>I've taken this now for almost a full month and am amazed at the energy I have. I work 3pm to 11:30pm  and before this product would drag myself out of bed at 10 to 11am. Now I am out of bed at 8am and have so much energy and clear minded.<br/>I would buy this again.<br/>UPDATE 10/11/18<br/>I've  been on this now for over 3 months and I can't believe the energy levels I have. I am sleeping better, doing more such as walking at least 45 minutes each day plus being on my feet for 8 hours straight.
 decent product. These are hard to judge because you really have to know yourself before and after use.
 I just started taking this product , I find it helps me to sleep much better at night. Although I only take one capsule instead of two only because I'm on thyroid medication also. I will continue to take this product.
 All the supplements you need and no dangerous megodoses. essy to swallow &amp; no upset stomach.
 This product really delievers. I was sluggish and felt very exhausted. However, after taking this my energy return and I didn't have a lot of sweet craving. I Love, Love this product.
 I did not notice a single difference while taking this, I had very high hopes too, I have all the symptoms of hypothyroidism with all normal blood work so was hoping for one relief<br/>I however gave a 3 star rating for quick and fantastic customer service
 Not good, don't waste your money, pure crap
 It's too soon to rate because I havn't finished my bottle . I will probably try another because I want it to help me . I have every symptom you can have for an inactive thyroid .
 I didn't see or feel any results from using this product. Looks like it's too late to send the product back.<br/>Update: This company has excellent customer service. While the product did not work for me, I was given a full refund. Going to check out other products from this company.
 I've been taking this product for a while. Didn't do much for me. Will not buy it again. The supplier did offer to refund. That is the reason for changing my rating.
 Since I started taking these I've been able to stick to my workout routine. After work I now have that little extra bit of energy that helps get me to the weights.
 I like the quality of this product. I feel great while taking it. I'm new to the thyroid issues and just got diagnosed, but I will continue taking this product.
 wife is feeling better and losing weight
 As a courtesy, I would like to say that I haven't had enough time to really give a true statement of this product, because of my time frame of usage , but I'm in hope that the results are what the product says it is. I'm hoping for more energy and good thyroid health so I'm able to lose a few bounds without taking unhealthy medications for weight loss and to get back to good health .
 I have noticed a difference with this product. My mood has improved as well as my energy level. Thank you!
 My wife recently discovered iodine supplements to help her circulation and relieve coldness in her extremities.  We saw an ad for this product, knowing there is a link between iodine and thyroid function, and decided to try it based on the great reviews.  She has noticed a definite improvement in her mental clarity and in her sleep patterns too.  She has always been a very light sleeper, and the iodine supplementation has helped with that, as her fingers and toes are not so cold that they wake her up in the middle of the night and require her to put on socks.
 As I've aged I am needfully augmenting my intake of remedial metabolism and iodine intake.  This product dots all the i's and crosses all the t's
 I'm usually a skeptic to these sorts of supplements but thought I would give it a try and the difference isn't life-shattering but definitely noticeable!  Better energy and clarity throughout the day and better sleep at night!
 I took it for 10 days. Had to stop because the product made me very shakey and nervous.<br/>Not happy with this Thyroid Support at all.
 I like this - have only used about 1 week but can really tell it is helping.  It works well with other things i am taking as well.
 Noticing more energy and ability to do more during the day. Metabolism kicked in and helping with the weight loss.
 I was super excited to try this after reading all the wonderful reviews but this just didn't do anything for me... In fact, I felt much sleepier. Pretty disappointing. Maybe one of the company's other products will work for me.
 I'm giving five stars to begin. First month of use coming to end, waiting for free bottle to begin second month. Don't feel any effects yet, need more time, will let you know!
 Not seeing any difference but I'm hopeful.
 Just finished my first bottle and will be ordering more. Have had more energy and even lost a few pounds. Thyroid support is super important for over all health.
 I had high hopes for this supplement especially with all the good reviews, but this made me feel awful by the 3rd week of taking and I had to stop taking immediately. I started feeling sluggish again, headaches daily (which is a rare thing for me), heavy dizziness, and my TSH jumped up 3 points after I had finally leveled out over the past year. I had to make an appointment with my Doctor after taking this product. :/ I hope they refund with their 100% guarantee.
 Did absolutely nothing...felt no changes what so ever.
 I took this product every day as directed, starting out with one capsule then 2 day for about a month and have not experienced any difference at all. I bought this because of the ingredients listed that help with brain fog and alertness as well as energy and this did nothing for me. I asked for a refund due to their 100% money back guarantee.
 I bought this for a boost of energy, but after taking the recommended doses for a few days.. I never noticed a change in my energy. BUT the seller was absolutely amazing! And they have some really great products that do work for me!
 Didn't work for me. On it for a month and if anything I am hungry more often and not losing weight.<br/>Update: customer service is five stars. This product obviously works for many just didn't for me.
 Did nothing for me. Some days I still wake up fatigued and it did nothing about my weight. My issue may not be related to hypothorid as I initially thought.
 it hasnt really helped me at all. after taking this it has caused me to have a hard time sleeping. it wakes me up and stops my hunger but my energy is still low and i have a really hard time sleeping. im going to have to stop it.
 Didn't work for me. However we are all different, may work for others. Probably should try it for 2 bottles.
 Nice packaging, but I have been taking this daily for 3 weeks and do not notice any difference in my energy or metabolism.
 Taken nearly the whole bottle- didn't notice a difference in anything except joints seem to hurt more. Wouldn't buy again.
 This had no effect on me.
 I wouldn't even  give these 1 star.  I took them 3 days in a row and I've never been as tired in my life as those 3 days.
 I have used other brands before , I don't see any results with this brand so its going back.<br/>Thanks amazon!
 This is the second months supply I have purchased and it's a product that works!  I will continue to purchase these and take them daily.  I haven't changed my diet/caloric intake very much, I don't work out at all, and I am a 37 year old female.  Prior to this product I gained weight so very easily as I have a very low metabolism also.  I have been taking this for 6 weeks and lost 5 lbs.  and I have not changed my lifestyle at all.  I highly recommend this.  But trying just one bottle (one month supply) is not what I suggest.  It's something that needs 2-4 weeks to regulate in your system (my opinion only).  So I would try at least 3 months to know if it works for u.  And taking it daily and not forgetting days is imperative IMO.
 When I starred taking Thyroid Support I was amazed at my energy level! I could tell it was making a big difference in the way I felt. I would highly recommend this product!
 A friend recommended this to me and said that it improves your energy. I took it for two months. During those months, I exercised a few times per week, and did not see any difference in my energy whatsoever. I then thought, hey, maybe you should give your friend these capsules the benefit of the doubt, and maybe you're not feeling any effect because you only tried it for a few weeks - maybe you have to try it for two months. So I bought another bottle and used it again the following month and so no effect on energy whatsoever. I did not take any other medication along with this, other than my daily centrum multivitamin.<br/><br/>I think this is a placebo that others are overselling here because I personally felt no effect of these capsules. I would caution those reading these five star reviews, even the "verified purchase" reviews. I get the sense that it is inflated nonsense. Don't waste your money. There's no "organic" energy pill that can provide the effects this product says it can provide.
 I so wanted to love this product based on the reviews I read about. I just turned 39 and felt like I needed a thyroid boost even though my labs revealed normal results, they were on the low side. I hoped to give my energy levels and metabolism a boost as I have steadily gained weight this year and experience continued fatigued. I tried this for approximately 3 weeks and experienced excruciating headaches around 4 hours after taking it. I even went down to 1 pill and still experienced the agonizing headaches. I wonder what is in it that causes them. I have since discontinued and no longer experience the headaches.
 I purchased thyroid support a little over a month ago and felt an immediate Change in my energy and even in my sleeping habits! i have recommended this product to my friends and family!
 Thank you for taking care of my concern.<br/>This company is completely trust worthy.
 This stuff really works!<br/>On my second bottle and i can really feel a huge difference.
 I love this product, !!! I think it is helping me tolose weight. Gives me more energy too.
 I give 5 Stars for customer service. Had this product for over a month and though it did not help me, Customer Service, after seeing my 1 Star review, credited my money back. Hardly any company does that anymore. So 5 Star rating for standing behind your product.
 Only took it a few times so can't say much, the package was clean and the bottle came sealed well.
 My clothes are falling off this has to be the corporate!!!
 it works and it helps some but I didn't lose weight or have better hair or or or really help with any of the issues a thyrod patient has.
 Great product, great company and service, what else can you ask for
 Maked me sick, company was nice enough to refund me my money.
 I really was expecting some relief but sadly ......nothing.
 I have these on auto ship to help my fatigue due to fibromyalgia.
 I'm on my second bottle. My thyroid went from a .5 to a .9 in a month!
 It's puzzles, it's counting, it's a train. What's not to love?
 Wow! I have noticed an increase in energy and mental clarity since using Thyroid Support. I would highly recommend this product!!
 I saw no change
 I did not do well on Synthroid, so I tried this. I took it three times. The first two times it upset my stomach. The third time I threw up.  I have allergies, but nothing on the label was a known allergen for me.
 Not sure what the hype is about, haven't felt anything.
 These actually made me more tired.
 Not sure if it worked, trying a different one.
 Not a single difference noted. No benefit whatsoever for me.
 Bought these for diet suppression but didn't feel anything. No affects at all.
 I'm on my 2nd bottle of Thyroid Support and I feel like I'm living again. The fog has lifted, I have increased energy, and it's greatly aided in my digestive problems.
 Did not work and gave me really bad leg cramps
 horse pills, not really seeing any difference.
 Thank you.  It was not the right fit for me
 It seemed to help with energy. I'm trying a different brand this month to do a comparison.
 All parties like it.  Ordering was easy.
 I love this Zhou product!! It has increased my energy after trying several different options.
 I've noticed increased energy since I started taking it.
 i have no idea if this works but it didn't make me sick.
 I did notice a little energy but, not
 I didn't notice any effects from this supplement.  Despite all the positive reviews I think this may be a placebo effect.  Good luck everyone!
 I don't really feel any different
 They do make you feel better.
 This product caused my face to become red and felt like it was burning. Also caused my eyes to become bloodshot. I only took 1 a day instead of 2 and it still caused it, just not as intense. They're now in the trash.
 It doesn't mess with my stomach like other brands.
 great product!!! I can feel a difference!
 Didn't do nothing for me.
 WORK GREAT.
 This stuff makes me sooo tired! Too bad, it seems like it works well for others. Makes me fall asleep during the day, which I usually can't do.
 I’ve been on various thyroid meds for years now, but this is my favorite method of thyroid support! I recently had labs done and they are better than they have been in years!
 Does not work at all.
 I bought this and started taking a little over a week ago. I ended up in hospital with swollen thyroid glands. They were so swollen I couldn't breathe. I stopped taking immediately.  :(
 😍
 It doesn't seem to do anything for me.
 I liked this product.
 No difference
 Did not work for me but they did refund my money with no questions asked will give the company another try
 Great product!
 didn't like
 I like it. Don't think it's helped me lose weight but gives me energy.
 It helps
 good job
 Great price and works great!!! No more salt problem.
 not real SURE ON THIS ONE
 Doesn’t work even after two weeks of daily usage. Don’t waste your money!
 Unfortunately I can't tell any difference by taking these.
 Just came off a cycle of T3, I am using this product to get my thyroid back up to party. So far so good no complaints!!
 I bought this because I was taking all the ingredients separately but I don't seem to be getting the results I was. Will be going back to the individual pills. UPDATE: After leaving my review I was contacted by the seller with a sincere apology about my dissatisfaction and was issued a full refund. Perhaps in the future I will try another one of their supplement mixtures.
 This supplement  made me sick to my stomach!! Would never buy Again!!
 I have been taking this supplement for a couple weeks now &amp; haven't noticed any difference at all. Will be trying different supplements.
 No change noted
 Been using this for about a month now and I can really tell a difference in my energy level. It's making a positive difference in how I feel overall! So glad I decided to try this!
 This really has helped both my husband and I! Can't recommend it enough!!
 Execellent product
 Price. Couldn't find them anywhere else.
 This seemed to actually make my thyroid hurt. Won’t be taking again
 Not sure about these - can't tell no difference in how I feel!!
 I don't feel any diff.
 It's good. I have not taken it regularly, so I'm not sure how well it works.
 A real help!
 Bought this for my fiance who has always had thyroid issues. She no longer gets tired, or sick as often. This has been a huge help!
 This is great for your thyroids
 Not sure why it did nothing for me, but it did absolutely nothing for me. Read the great reviews on it and after taking it as directed, I noticed nothing different. I mainly took this for mild depression, weight gain, focus and fatigue - I hoped it would work given that it's natural, but, nothing. Just a waste of $20
 Didn't do a thing.
 I've lost ten pounds with this product
 This does nothing, I was hoping for the best and got the worse!...So disapointing!
 I just received this Friday taking it for two days so far I haven’t seen no change I will give it more time then I will do another review. I feel more tired than I was before I’m not given any stores yet because I want to give it a chance because so many reviews was talking about how great it was and how much it change their lives I gave it to because the shipment was here on time. I will definitely add more stars than if I see any changes in the next few weeks I hope it does work for me I’ve been overweight all my life sluggish, tired, have a lot of illness going on and seems like nothing has helped I been taking it now it did not help me AT ALL. Good luck if going to order may help you
 My doctor asked me to stop taking this.
 I used this for a month! Nothing different felt!
 Not satisfied with the result its been almost 2 weeks and absolutely nothing  has changed
 Gave my throat a weird feeling.
 Love this product!
 I DO NOT trust doctors. Twice I've experienced deathly consequences to some prescription they've decided to "try". Anyway. Through my own research and experience I do have thyroid issues. High or low I don't know. I believe it fluctuates. This product certainly helps with staying asleep. I would sleep for two hours, wide awake for about 5 then sleep for about 7. This has helped me, but even more so since I started taking at night. As for energy and focus, yes. Indeed it has. Metabolism I can't really say.
 Seems to be working. I haven't felt this good in quite sometime.
 Did not notice a difference after taking for about a month.
 Works good
 The only thing a month of taking these pills did was add 10lbs and a ton of anxiety.
 So far I love it I have more energy and my brain seems less foggy
 Read more before you order This is for a low acting thyroid not hyperactive thyroid
 I HAVE BEEN USING THIS FOR 2 MONTHS AND I AM HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS.
 Love this stuff
 I already take Armor Thyroid. I thought maybe this supplement could help boost my thyroid situation. Do not take this without talking to your doctor. I felt sick from taking this. The worst, week-long headache I've had in my life. I felt fluish and it sidelined my running. I stopped taking it and on the second night, I sweated so much I soaked through my clothes. Then I immediately felt better. I have Hashimoto's, for what it's worth.
 It's good! Does give you energy &amp; helps focus for a little while.
 Works great
 Caused my liver levels to spike so bad my doctor was worried I had hepatitis. Be careful, this might cause serious liver damage.
 No real results but also do not take on a regular basis
 Second product that I purchased from Zhou Nutrition and neither has worked. This product made me feel jittery and like the Horny Goat Weed product I purchased from them, it lead to a bad headache all day.
 would have been nice if the shellfish warning was addressed in a way that one would see it prior to the purchase.<br/>that is the last zhou product i will buy
 Caused dizziness, headaches, bloating. Das it did not help with the energy levels.
 All products from Zhou Nutrition are manufactured with only 100% cGMP and FDA approved raw materials. Having been in the Nutraceutical Industry for over 25 years and dealing in raw materials, Zhou is one of the finest companies around. I use several of their products, Thyroid Support Complex being one of them, and youncan always count on these people. A great company!
 It does nothing but make me more tired.
 Terrible! It did nothing for me!!..I think it may even made me gain weight (it's holiday day season, so hard to tell for sure..) Went back to Thyroid Support, I feel better already!
 Don't know if it really would help in the long run as I was not able to take it for more than a week. Every time I took it even though I was taking half the recommended dosage they gave me severe diarrhea.
 Absolutely terrible. Took this as directed and within a few hours started having twitching in my hands and feet. I discontinued use, and my body went back to normal. I would not recommend this product at all.
 Useless stinky capsules and had no effect what soever. Trust me and avoid this completely
 I'm giving this 2 starts because I think this may be a great product for some people, just not for me. I'm already anxious and irritable and after just 3 days I'm fighting with my wife and co workers. Not for me. All I really wanted was an iodine supplement so Ill try to find something  specific to that.
 Did not do anything but they are refunding me in full..
 I used to used another thyroid  support but decided to try Zhou Nutrition. I am completely satisfied with this product and my results. I have seen a great improvement since taking this. I will continue to order from them.
 The best stuff in the world!!!!<br/>I have a sensitive stomach and this stuff doesn't hurt it. My body absorbs it and I feel Great! No jitters and No feeling like I swallowed a rock. I'm focused and ready to go!
 I hate really high hopes for this, and was very excited to start taking it. I'm on my 4th day -- and I've had HORRIBLE diarrhea and gas. I don't have any more energy than i do normally, basically I've had no positive changes. I'm actually really bummed it didn't work for me like it did for others.
 This stuff is wonderful I can tell such a big difference since Iv started taking this daily about a month ago. I feel like I have more energy and defiantly can tell that I think more clearly. Before taking this brain fog was a big issue for me. So glad I found this product.
 I have been taking this for three days along with two other items I purchased on Amazon that all are supposed to increase energy levels. Since I have started taking all of them, at the same time,  my lack of energy has dropped when I didn't even think it could get any lower. I will explain my situation a little bit later and also continue to update and hope there is a better result.
 This is the best thyroid supplement on the market. The ingredients are the highest quality that have had in the 50+ supplements that I have tried.<br/><br/>I didn't get nauseous, jittery or any feeling of anxiety.  I can't wait for my 2nd bottle to arrive.
 😰😱 I have a painful autoimmune illness that has caused the lining of my bladder to become  ulcerated and shred the gag layer which keeps acidic urine from getting to the most sensitive nerves in my body. The illness is called Interstitial Cystitis. My diet has to be one which is as low in acidic ingredients as possible. I also have a Thyroid Condition. The medication prescribed to me causes deep hot flares. I decided to try supplements. I've had to return a few, as Cheyenne Pepper is in the capsules, listed as the 4th or 5th ingredient. Thyroid Support Complex lists Cheyenne Pepper as the last ingredient. One half of the ingredients, I disposed of the other half, put my body in 😰😱😰🔥😰😱😰🔥 DAYS OF AN EXTREMELY HOT FIREY FLARE. 😩😫😩😤😫😩😫😤 Its taken over 2 weeks to heal the burn. I was hesitant to try this product, but also my ❤️ was full of hope. I need to find a supplement as soon as I can, sadly this isn't it. It came with great reviews on higher energy levels. I need energy, as I'm up much of the night emptying my bladder, urine feels 1,000 degrees. 😰😱🔥😫😩🔥😱 I truely needed this product to work. I don't eat very much, and can't seem to lose weight. 😢😢😢😢😢. I hope this helps others, as there are some pretty amazing reviews. If only I could take it and not be in agony pain. Wasted money, but now I know I can't have any supplements with PEPPER in them. It's been almost a month since I decided to try these. I feared the Cheyenne Pepper, as I put a tiny bit of the powder on my tongue, whoa!!!! Burned my tongue. Now I know that even 1/2 of the powder in the green capsules will put me in great distress. I will need to keep looking.<br/>All the best, to those whom have found this supplement to help you.
 I should have reviewed this before purchasing. Please be sure to do a review on this product before buying. Causes some medical issues
 Doesn't seem to work for me.
 Could not tell any difference.
 This is horrible. It made me tachycardic, jittery, anxious, irritable and major anxiety. If you have any anxiety, I wouldn't take this. I was hoping it would ease up after my body adjusts, but sadly it did not. I went down to 1 a day and it did not ease the side effects. I stopped and feel pretty much back to normal.
 Wasn't helpful at all. And there's a few ingredients that are approved for veterinary use only! I wish I would have returned this item when I had a chance.
 Finished the entire bottle and it had zero effect on me! Very disappointed knowing I'd wasted my hard earned money on a "best selling" product in the hope it would work.<br/><br/>****UPDATE; I've changed my star rating from one, to four stars after positive and prompt feedback from Sydney (Zhou Nutrition), immediately refunded both cost of product, as well as S&amp;H/tax. This shows me proactive effort in the company's part in ensuring their products may possibly be in constant re-evaluation for top quality!****
 A new found energy!  So very pleased with this purchase. Will be a life long customer!
 Too early to tell.
 Would have returned,  unfortunately missed the date. Not my favorite.
 This supplement did nothing for me. If one has symptoms of hypothyroidism, one should consider other reasons for the symptoms vs. taking extra iodine, which can be harmful in some cases. There are many ways to get sufficient iodine in your diet - cheese, milk, eggs, yogurt, shellfish, soy sauce, etc.<br/><br/>P.S. If you leave a negative review, the seller may give you a refund, which is excellent. However, then you will receive multiple emails from them afterward.
 At first I thought this was doing me good. I was always hot and I had gained weight and thought that even tho my thyroid levels were all within normal range I felt maybe if my thyroid was off a little this would regulate. (I have a few nodules and who knows if that has anything to do with it too) At first I was rejoicing because I stopped getting so hot and needed a light blanket under the ceiling fan at night while watching tv but then I realized I was gaining even more weight while cutting my fat and calories back. I stopped right away. Hope I didn't do any damage, I am sure it didn't but there's always athought. I took almost the whole bottle- 3 weeks or so.
 Worked well
 Never again
 Haven't felt that much of a difference but I will continue taking it!
 No results after a few weeks of use.
 As expected
 Misleading description.  These vitamins are NOT vegetarian nor vegan.  The label says "gelatin"... very irresponsible marketing.
 Not tired anymore!  Thank you.  Can I get a free bottle.
 If you enjoy sawdust then this is the pill for you.
 Contains soy.  Soy is a goitrigen, and not good for the thyroid.
 After taking this for a few weeks, I noticed a huge improvement! No more 'being foggy', more energy and a better sense of here and now!
 lots of energy. great product
 Honestly... I did not notice any difference taking this.
 Didn't feel a change
 Don't waste ur money
 Haven't really taken them as described.  Kinda forget too.  Already on thyroid meds from doctor so a bit skeptical about how and if they would actually work.
 This product did not work and I will not buy it ever again and will not recommend it to anyone
 I do not often write reviews, but this product deserves great credit from me.  I have struggled for years with the classical symptoms of under active thyroid.  Even with medication, many days were a struggle.  I started using this two weeks ago and I feel like a new person.  I am not setting the world on fire, but I am not struggling to get through the day.  I take one in the morning 1 hour after my medication and 1 in the mid afternoon before grandkids get here after school.  My energy is better, my mood is better and my house is cleaner. My husband is happy, because he does not have to come home after working all day and pick up my slack. I am even making the bed every morning again. I highly recommend this product. Start with just one and see how it works for you.<br/><br/>Update. Very pleased with this product. I just reordered.  Not only has my energy level greatly increased, my mood has as well.  Each day I accomplish more and am able to exercise more.  The weight is very slowly coming off, but I feel like that may pick up, as my appetite is decreasing and my calorie burn is increasing. Also sleeping much better.
 My husband is on Synthroid, and his docs are still in the process of tweaking the dosage to get it right. I saw how poorly he was feeling in between doctors visits and knew that we had to do something on our own. Changing our diet seemed to help, but it was just a couple days of taking this the good supplement from Zhou Nutrition that I could see a total difference in his mood and energy level. This is only his second bottle, but I know that he will be keeping this supplement in his daily med routine.  It's a great feeling to know its natural and not filled with all the junk Synthroid puts in his body. Highly recommend!
 These are the kinds of things that I end up impulse buying at 2am. They sure sounded good at the time though, too bad they don't work.
 i am a huge skeptic when it comes to vitamins and 'cure all' things .. now, having said that, after reading the reviews of this product and the fact that it was greatly reduced in price because of a lightning deal i decided to give it a try. .. it's been about 5 days now and i actually feel that this help me!! im not as fatigued as usual and ive been able to get up in the morning and get some things accomplished - which is a HUGE accomplishment for me! .. thank you so much!!
 To save money I purchased (2) of this brand and I started noticing the difference immediately. My neck began to swell, the skin between my fingers got callous &amp; peeled and my mood &amp; energy level plummeted. These are all the symptoms I had prior to taking any thyroid support for my hasimoto’s disease. This tells me that either the ingredients within this supplement are of low/poor quality or the ingredient amounts listed on the bottle are incorrect. Nevertheless I’m going back to 1 Body’s Thyroid Support which is a bit more expensive but actually works for me.
 I wanted this to work, SO BADLY! After reading all the awesome reviews of improved energy levels, improved mood and weight loss, I hoped I had found an answer to the exhaustion I feel since being diagnosed with thyroid issues. But, it made me feel soooo sleepy and tired, I felt as if I had taken Nyquil or something, just could not seem to get with it and do anything but want to crash. Then, the very first night and every night after until I stopped taking them, I woke in the middle of the night with a excruciating headache, and it stayed with me most of the day. After four days, I just couldn't deal with it any more, so stopped taking them. After a couple of days, the headaches lessened and my energy began to improve again. I wish I knew what was in them that causes such reaction, I would clearly steer clear of it in the future. I hoped these would be the answer for a lot of my issues, but sadly, I do not think they are for me.
 I like the product the quality, it's good but there are cheaper alternatives out there.  If this were $6 a month I would subscribe to it.  I purchased this on a prime deal and the price is now too high. The picture is of the alternative brand, look, the pills are the same.<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Thyroid-Support-Complete-Formula-to-Help-Weight-Loss-Improve-Energy-with-Bladderwrack-Kelp-B12-More-Thyroid-Energy-Boost-T4-to-T3-Supplement/dp/B016KUPLCU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Thyroid Support - Complete Formula to Help Weight Loss &amp; Improve Energy with Bladderwrack, Kelp, B12 &amp; More- Thyroid Energy: Boost T4 to T3 Supplement</a>
 For years I have been aware that I must have a problem with my thyroid. I have way too many symptoms of having hypothyroidism. It seems all my lab work is showing up in the normal range according to doctor. I have been put on prescriptions medicine for such and played around trying to get dosages correct before finally giving up on them thinking the labs were correct and I don't have a problem. Not sure what but something in this supplement works miracles for me!<br/><br/>Summer or Winter you will kind me wrapped in a blanket I am constantly freezing! I have hard time concentrating and my energy level most days is null and I have managed to put some weight on. Since starting this all natural supplement I am a believer things are taking a turn for the better. I seem to have energy, I have lost some weight and I am happy to report I can for first time in years leave the blanket on the arm of couch and not wrapped around me. If you have a sluggish thyroid suspect a problem I would recommend you give this supplement a try.<br/><br/>My reviews are the real deal &amp; each item is fully tested to my abilities. You will get no fluff or smoke from me. Yes, I did receive this product free or discounted to give my humble honest opinion. But I have zero loyalty the company providing me items to test. I tell it like it is &amp; how it worked for me.
 This product was fantastic for the first three days, really amazing! Great focus, fantastic sleep, more energy, etc.  However, something in it does not work for me, and after a week, even taking half the recommended dose, I had a horrible pain in my left side, that only went away while I ate, then came right back again. Went off of it, and the pain was gone in 24 hours.  I'm sure it will work well for others just not for me.<br/><br/>Update: the company gave me a full refund within 12 hours of learning the product had not worked for me. Honestly I did not even ask for it. If you have a thyroid problem, this is a risk free supplement to try. Excellent customer service!
 Oh my God is it real....I have barely started taking this product and I have palpitations, a terrible terrible headache and I could t sleep all night and have had abdominal pain.i just made me so nauseous that I couldn’t eat at all( I mean that’s their plan for weight loss )It’s like taking something to make you feel sick on purpose.
 I received a $5 gift card from Zhou Nutrition during Black Friday so I decided to try their Thyroid Support supplement. I have all the classic signs of hypothyroidism from chronic fatigue to weight gain even though I exercise regularly and eat right but I am hesitant to have a test done because the last time I was diagnosed with the same problem, the doctor wanted to put me on Synthroid. Two friends have been on this medication for years and they said it's a vicious cycle I don't want to subject myself to, so I want to address the problem as naturally as possible. I wanted to try the product for two weeks before writing a review  so I could see if there are significant changes. I have to say that taking this product twice a day has really helped alleviate the symptoms I was experiencing.<br/><br/>The first thing I noticed after five days was the huge change in my energy level and my mood! Note that the energy boost is very gentle and subtle. It's not like a caffeine kick that slowly dissipates in a couple of hours. In this case, I would just go about my work day without any sluggishness or loss of stamina and by the time I leave work, I am still able to run errands without feeling exhausted. Consequently, my mood has also improved tremendously because of the higher energy levels. Gone is the brain fog as well which has really slowed me down with work and was starting to stress me out. My mind is clearer and I am able to focus better. The pain in my joints upon waking up slowly disappeared too, especially in my feet, and I am not as sensitive to the cold either. The best part for me is I've noticed I am falling asleep earlier, whereas before I always had a difficult time falling asleep before midnight, and I no longer have a hard time waking up. Again, do not expect to jump out of your bed eager to run a marathon. It's not that kind of boost. I believe the supplement works great with a reasonable and moderate exercise regimen (I take two 30 -45 minute brisk walks a day) and a healthy and proper diet.
 I got this medication due to recent weight gain. I gained almost 25 pounds in less than a year,  which is a lot according I didn't weigh much to start. I was unsure about this medication due to me having gone to the doctor about my weight gain.  After reading the reviews, I decided to try this.  It is helping me to be in a more positive mood and to be more active than I was.  It helping with the weight gain by helping me have more energy.  It seems to working the way it is supposed to.  I'm going to continue using it and see what it will continue to do.  It also has great ingredients.
 Bought these for my wife to help with her thyroid issues.  They gave her incredible stomach problems.  The day after she stopped taking them the problems went away.  The problems were extreme gas and stomach bloating.  Made her down right miserable.  Maybe they do some good, but the side effects were not worth it for her and I don't blame her.  Going to see about getting a refund.
 Junk, felt no difference
 Full disclosure: I was given a sample bottle of this product to try and review after perusing various Thyroid/Adrenal supplements on Amazon.  I don't know if I have any sort thyroid disease (I have not been tested), but I have many symptoms, such as low/nonexistent metabolism, low energy, problems with focus and memory, unable to lose weight despite eating well and exercising like crazy.  My review of this product is based solely on my person feelings and experiences after taking it.  What I can definitely say is that when I STOP taking it... after a few days I feel so much more sluggish, tired, and unfocused.  I did NOT lose any weight like I had hoped, unfortunately.  However, when taking it I feel more aware, I can get more accomplished in a day, my joints hurt less (I've also been stretching more), I can concentrate better, I'm less tired, etc.  So while it didn't help as much as I was hoping, I'm definitely feeling better and hope that with prolonged use I'll continue to see/feel more results.<br/><br/>2/4/16: Updated to add that I reordered enough for another two months because the thought of NOT taking this product every day and feeling so worn down again terrified me.  I also bought two addition products to try, taking advantage of the coupon offered.
 I take nature thyroid but still have issues with weight gain, hair loss, mood changes and energy. I haven’t been taking this supplement long but it seems to definitely help my energy level, all the rest I’m still waiting for. I have several good allergies and this supplement doesn’t make me sick. I’ll keep taking and see what happens. But so far good.
 I struggle even with prescription medication. I am tired all the time and fatigued. I noticed since taking this that I have increased energy and less fatigued.Not a miracle medicine but it helps with some of my thyroid issues though.
 I was so eager to get this product, and I have been completely happy with it. The past few years I have been having trouble losing weight, and was told to have my Thyroid checked. Sure enough, thyroid issues run in my family. I was thrilled to see the ingredients were not harsh, and contain herbs, so I immediately requested to try this product for free without hesitation!!! I am not one to take pills, but this pill is easy to take, and I can already feel a difference and have more energy without any side effects.<br/><br/>Very pleased with this product!
 Just ordered my second bottle, and after I ordered it, I received an email from Zhou Nutrition requesting I submit a review for a free bottle. I haven't noticed any appreciable change since I started taking the product, but thought I'd give it a two bottle chance before discontinuing it. I'm mainly posting this review because I've noticed these "next bottle free offers" are getting pretty common when it comes to supplements, and it makes it difficult to judge whether people are really seeing results or not. So, just a heads up that you might want to keep the incentive in mind while assessing these reviews. In fairness, they did not specify that it must be a positive review, but they want a link or your screen name to verify that you left one. Most people will leave a positive review under those circumstances.
 I wanted to take this for a week before I left a review.  So, here it is.  I can honestly say I have felt a difference in my energy levels.  I also seem to be requiring less sleep the last few nights. I take 2 tablets mid morning with food as directed.  I would recommend this product, and I would purchase it again for myself.  Disclaimer - this item was purchased at a reduced rate for an honest customer review.
 I had no idea how bad I felt until I started taking this. I feel like my normal self again! It's been a week, and I have a TON of energy, and with a lower calorie diet, I have even lost a few pounds. I wish I would have found this years ago. I was able to start weening off my anti depressant/anti anxiety meds. I feel SO much better. I am no longer under a cloud of blah - and can finally enjoy my life!
 I've suffered from loss of energy due to high stress and over-consumption of caffeine, and this product helped restore my energy levels and get me feeling back to normal.
 I really love Thyroid Support.  As a woman who has struggled with thyroid problems since the age of 14, I was always feeling tired and never able to keep my weight down successfully. After starting to take Zhou Thyroid Support vitamins alongside my usual thyroid medication, I feel like I have so much more energy and I am also starting to lose weight slowly. I can definitely feel a difference in my pep, and often want to go do things where I used to want to be home more.  This supplement has had a big impact on my life, and I have now subscribed to get it once a month.  I can’t imagine going back to the person I was before without energy and without enthusiasm.  I've been taking it for about four months now, twice a day and I've already lost 37 pounds.
 Since all my cheap (and all my expensive) salt is now iodine free, I figured I had better get this before I died.  Th epills are pretty large, but that is to be expected.  When I remember to take it it does make me feel less sleepy and lazy :D<br/><br/>I was fortunate to receive this as discount, provided I was honest and unbiased in my review, and I'm glad I did!
 Noticeable difference after 2-3 months of use. Less fat accumulation, weight is the same but easy to discern that it is muscle vs fat (condensing down :) I exercise daily, and this is a nice change from preworkout or junk exercise supplements for overall results.
 Another great product from Zhou! This Thyroid support give me the extra energy and focus for a long work day. I take quite a few product from Zhou and they all have been great!! When I am tired I need that extra focus so I do not have the brain fog and this supplement give me that extra energy I need to go through my day. I would recommended it to anyone with that extra support need to get through the workday. Try it out, if you do not like it, they company has a great customer service where they will help you with any concerns you have. So pick up a bottle and give it a try.
 It definitely helped my sleep patterns. Before I starting using this, it was so hard to fall asleep at night and I felt horrible in the morning. I've only taken this for a month, but I'm already feeling more energetic in the morning. Highly recommended this product.
 I started taking this supplement a few months ago and I really feel like it has helped me balance my thyroid issues. I still take my daily medication. I just feel like this has helped me.
 Ashwagandha is a phytoestrogen...terrible for many pp with an endocrine disorder such as hypothyroidism.
 since taking this I am feeling great. I have lost 4 pounds in 10 days with this Thryoid Support Complex.  I love that this product is good for the thyroid. I do actually feel better since taking one of these everyday. I will update my review in a couple of weeks. i'v only had 10 days to try this .. so far its working great.<br/><br/>I purchased this product in exchange of an honest and unbiased opinion.
 I wanted to love this product and with high reviews was hopeful,  however, I experienced headache, severe stomach cramps ,and explosive poops. Symptoms stopped after I didn't take it again.
 Didn't do anything for me, I'm sure it's because my thyroid is alright. Oh well.
 did not do much for me
 Item arrived as advertised.  I took this supplement as soon as it arrived and WOW I noticed an improvement right away, I was pleasantly surprised. The energy boost is nice as I jump into a meditative state and work on activating my energy body. Doing some yoga and stretches also felt great. I reviewed this product at promotional price. The ingredients look pretty standard. Happy customer.
 Tried the product, finished the bottle, but did not feel any different.  I was really hopeful this would be a successful post.  Not for everyone. :( I tried... really wanted to get out of this spell
 So I believe this has helped me.  I was have bladder issues and my doctor had me on estrogen meds (which I did not like).  I have been taking this almost for a month now and my bladder issues have really calmed down.  I feel like now this product has made a difference.  I will keep buying this as long as it helps.
 Only been using this for a few weeks but so far I feel great! I have hypothyroid  which I take medication for] but still feel sluggish time to time and being 12 weeks postpartum doesn't help either..about a week after taking it I already started to notice a difference and now I feel more energized and overall more mental clarity. I'll definitely be taking again !
 Received these for FREE!!! In exchange for review I got this bottle of thyroid support hope it's working.
 Just another way to waste my money on a product that promises the moon and delivers nothing.  Does not work, but does thin out your pocketbook!!!
 I have an under active thyroid, and I was hoping this would help with my energy. After going though the bottle; I didn’t feel any different :/
 I haven been taking selenium, magneisum, zinc, vitamin d, and other supplements for years. It was nice to find a supplement with most of the vitamins and minerals I was already taking so I could take 1 pill instead of 5 or 6.
 I ordered this when I saw it at discount price because my thyroid has been slow since turning the big 40, I can say honesty that it has boost my energy level while helping me not eat as much. Easy to swallow pill with no bad taste or smell, I would recommend this for anyone that is needing a energy boost!
 Ever wonder why your friends can eat and eat and never seem to gain any weight.  One reason is a fast metabolism.  If you have a slow metabolism, then part of the problem may be an underachieving thyroid.

Zhou Nutrition has packed this supplement with ingredients that support the production of thyroid hormones and thyroid function.<br/><br/>Zhou Nutrition backs each purchase with a 100% money back guarantee, even if you use the whole bottle.

 Felt the difference after a couple of day.  Love the ash root added in here.  On my second bottle.
 Excellent product and a great price. As a health practitioner with 22 years experience and family history of thyroid issues this product is working for me.
 Just because it's gluten free, vegan, etc, doesn't mean it's natural. I had a very bad reaction to this-after just two pills, headaches, inflammation, and stomach pain that lasted for days.
 It gave me more energy when I first started taking it however after about a week it just stopped working for me. I went through 2 bottles but that energy boost never came back so I stopped taking it...
 A good supplement to take along with your medication. Takes a while to start seeing the results, maybe about 2-3 weeks of continual use but it does help with energy.
 This supplement was easy to take and is part of my daily regimen now. This is a month supply. You take 2 pills daily. I feel more awake and less tired.<br/>I did receive this item at a reduced/discounted price and thisnis my own opinion.
 Great product that works a lot faster than you would think. It has cleansing benefits that are apparent after a couple of uses.
 ** received for review and inspection purposes **<br/><br/>This is an alternative to prescription medications with a good mix of ingredients. I got this for my mother-in-law. Unfortunately, the capsules are a bit uncomfortable to swallow.
 nice that this has other nutrients that I need
 Just got this supplement and I noticed the form of B12 is cyanocobalamin!!!  I was VERY VERY disappointed!<br/><br/>Cyanocobalamin is a cheap, synthetic chemical made in a laboratory. It's virtually impossible for you to find this form in nature. Low-end vitamin manufacturers use it because it can be bought in bulk and added to products with claims that they "contain vitamin B-12!" What they don't tell you is that the vitamin is bound to a toxic, poisonous cyanide molecule that must then be removed from your body by your liver. Cyanocobalamin is also up to 100 times cheaper than the higher quality methylcobalamin.  (Read up more on Natural News . COM)<br/><br/>Not sure if I will take more than the one I just took before I noticed.  I also started to check most of the "thyroid supplements" on amazon and they all use this cheap toxic form of B12.  Zhou ... if you want to stand ABOVE the crowd use the 'REAL STUFF - methylcobalamin"!  Otherwise I say just take the crap B12 out of this formula so I can use it along with a B Complex of higher quality B vitamins.
 I am a big fan of supporting myThroid given the fact the most of us dont get enough Iodine in our daily diet to support our Thryoid. I wouldnt say I feel the effect as it is said in the description but I do like that I am prevent things that may appear down the road
 I absolutely love this product! I didn't think it would work, but I am happy to slowly be off synthroid. I hate the way it made me feel. This saved my life and have energy I never thought I would get back.
 I feel more energized since I started taking these I've been taking them for about 2 weeks now and I can tell a difference in my skin hair energy levels all have improved, I was told my thyroid was normal when tested now too
 Just on my first month.  So far I am very happy with my Thyroid Support.
 I took this supplement for one month but noticed no improvement whatsoever in my symptoms. I didn't have any negative reaction, it just didn't help. I do like Zhou Nutritions products, however, and have had very good results with some of their other supplements.
 Haven’t had any noticeable results quite yet but I’m hopeful! :)
 I've only been taking this for a couple weeks but I have seen a difference. I will continue using it
 After reading all the reviews, I was very hopeful for this product to change my life. It didn't. But, there have been no side effects. The swelling in my ankles has decreased, and maybe my energy is up 5%. I will try another 30 days, to see if better things happen.
 This is a improved my energy and my ability to focus.
 It seemed to give some extra energy but I did not notice a giant change. I took as directed for one month. Perhaps a longer trial is needed?
 Great product, I felt better right away.
 I have been taking it opposite my Synthroid and it is working well. I feel like I have ore energy.
 This works great!
 I love it, I feel such a difference in my day to day life.
 Absolutely love this stuff. Been taking it for about 3 weeks and accidentally skipped a couple days, definitely can tell the difference!
 Arrived fast and I actually feel like it’s working! I have more energy!
 Good product and excellent thyroid support
 Bought this for my daughter and she said it has made a huge difference with energy levels! Said she forgot it a couple time and boy could she tell!!
 I've been taking these for a month now and I totally feel like a new woman...
 I think it gave me energy which I needed badly
 Out of my thyroid support, definitely felt more energetic and it helped me lose weight!!!  Will be reordering!  Thank you!
 Love this product! It gives me energy and has really worked for me as far as weight loss. Highly recommend!
 i wish this would of helped me but it didnt 😢 i wish i could try hair influence instead tbe collagen its great o highly reccommend great customer service
 Great.  I have been using this stuff for a couple days now and can tell the difference in my energy level
 As someone with hypothyroidism this plus my thyroid medication really gives me the push I need.
 Great product
 This has made a big improvement in my life. I’m on my 2nd bottle and I have no complaints so far!
 Just started taking it.  Noticing increased energy level and elevated mood.  Will continue use.
 EXCELLENT supplement!! Definitely does what it says!! Highly recommended!!
 Fave
 It's only been a couple of days and I noticed a change. After looking at the facts and did research I see why, therefore I placed an other order.
 I really like this product! I can already tell a difference in my energy level!
 Love the energy these give me!
 Very pleased! Love the all natural ingredients and how much energy it gives me! Definitely recommend!
 Great product!
 Does seem to perk me up a bit!!
 Did not work for me. Perhaps for others.
 Please change your Vitamin B source to the methylcobalamin form, instead of cyano-. This was the deciding factor in choosing another bestselling brand, albeit a little more expensive.
 I've taken 4 bottles of this product and I'm in love! My body feels better when I'm taking this product!
 I was pleasantly surprised at how much of a difference it made.
 Smells awful.
 Love this stuff. It has mad me feel so much better energy wise.
 See your doctor first! Iodine is terrible for people with Hashimotos.
 I  purchased one before and was very happy with the results. You pulled in stations, that I was unable to get without it.<br/> I felt so good about the results, that I purchased the second one for my other TV. Both work flawlessly
 Nothing special.  Will not purchase again.  I have hypothyroidism and battle with fatigue and a multitude of other issues, unfortunately this product did nothing for me.
 I’m terrible with keeping up on taking vitamins, but I feel the difference when I take these regularly.  Definitely have more energy.  Not sure about the metabolism part. I don’t necessarily have a thyroid issue, but I know this has helped with the sluggish feeling I’ve been plagued with lately.
 Took as directed for 30 days, noticed none of the promised improvements. Buyer beware, the placebo effect is real and powerful!
 I think this probably does work for people who KNOW they have thyroid issues. But I only suspected I have those issues, so I gave this a shot and it made no difference--none at all. I tried taking it different times of day, i.e. before bed, in the evening but hours before bed, in the morning after waking up. I tried taking one twice a day, as well as taking two together. It never mattered. I have tried other Zhou products before, though, and they were good--though not perfect--so I trust them and don't think they're ripping anyone off with false claims. It's just, unfortunately, this is probably a product that you need to be sure you have an under-active thyroid before you buy it as opposed to being something that can help with energy and brain fog regardless or if your thyroid is maybe just a little bit off.
 We can tell a difference in energy since we started taking this.
 I ran out of it and did not bother to reorder for a while. When I did get it I felt the difference almost immediately.
 Literally did nothing for me. Did not help one bit.
 I order this regularly! It gives me energy and help with my thyroid!
 I really wanted this to work, but unfortunately, this made me REALLY moody and it gave me insane headaches.  I'm pretty bummed about it.
 I feel no difference at all after taking these as directed for 2 weeks now.  I also don’t know how to contact the manufacturer for a refund....
 I had this hidden about 8 ft up and one day it fell onto the cement and just broke open. What a worthless piece of garbage.
 Started taking these to help my persistent daytime sleepiness. Not only do I feel more energized throughout the day, but I noticed my skin cleared up too. I started getting acne when I was 19 and the past five years have been a struggle trying to figure out what would work to clear it up. Looks like I've found my solution!
 Made me pee green
 Make sure to do more research on the materials.
 Fantastic product works as advertised. Have been using this supplement for several months. Helps with the effects from my hypothyroid systems/problems. Feels better with more energy. Thank you. Will continue to use this product.
 I've been taking these for over a month or so, and I don't feel any different. I've read so many great reviews, I'm actually bummed out that it hasn't done anything for me that I'm aware of. The only reasons why I'm still taking it is because it doesn't give me any side effects and I'm hoping it'll eventually work.
