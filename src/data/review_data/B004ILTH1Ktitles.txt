Damn find job--with one reservation.
Replaced 23 year old Rowenta with a new one
If You Iron, Upgrade!

Returning this iron :(
Love it!
Good Quality Iron
I love ironing now
leaks and does not get wrinkles out - believe negative reviews, trust me they are the most telling
not because it doesn't do a good job ironing
Only buy if you have regular tap water in your house, and even then with reservations
Doesn't heat up well
Excellent iron overall.  Just a bit hard to see water level
Worth the money!
It will not leak water if you follow the directions.
Worth the money paid!
Won't Heat After Only 4 Months!
Wonderful iron
Don’t ever buy this Iron!
German quality!
