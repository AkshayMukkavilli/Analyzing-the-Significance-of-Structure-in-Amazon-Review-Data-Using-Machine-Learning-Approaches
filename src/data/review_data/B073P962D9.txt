 Ian Malcolm: I’ll tell you the problem with the scientific power that you’re using here: it didn’t require any discipline to attain it. You read what others had done and you took the next step. You didn’t earn the knowledge for yourselves, so you don’t take any responsibility for it. You stood on the shoulders of geniuses to accomplish something as fast as you could and before you even knew what you had you patented it and packaged it and slapped it on a plastic lunchbox, and now you’re selling it, you want to sell it.<br/><br/>Let's be clear...this was not written by JK...this is based on her series. And that becomes terribly clear very early on. Additionally, the number of names that are dropped is astronomical! Anyone worth knowing in the Potterverse is up front and counted. As in main character. The story, the plotline...it meanders all over the place that the reader wonders if the writers had a clue to start with or if it was just to "stand on the shoulders of geniuses." There was no way this was going to fail...none. The generation that grew up reading Harry's stories are now buying their own books and financing their own plays. Their imagination was set free with JK's works and personally I think that was one of her greatest gifts...engaging our imagination. This reads like fan fiction, poorly written fan fiction and not even with any good ships!<br/><br/>Your writers were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn’t stop to think if they should.<br/><br/>Don't do it. Keep Harry, Ron, Hermione, McGonagall, Ginny alive in your memories instead.
 Let me start by saying this, I love harry potter. I read the books 2-3 times per year since I was a child. I've grown up with these books. These books are a part of me, I've named my children after characters in these books. I have 3 tattoos, all of which are harry potter. I'm a dedicated fan, entirely obsessed to be candid. I have waited for this book like the rest of you.<br/><br/>I can handle the fact that it's written as a play, I was expecting this. I was fully prepared to accept this. I waited all night for this to be released to my kindle (it's 3 a.m and I've just finished). I sped through the cursed child and my final thought was, this was disappointing .<br/><br/>I'm skeptical of how much jk rowling actually contributed to this. I get more of a harry potter vibe from the fantastic beasts trailer than this entire book. The plot was bad, almost everything was bad. It was like a poorly written fanfic.<br/><br/>It sucks that I'm saying this because harry potter is a part of soul. I went into this thinking it was everything I'd ever hoped for.<br/><br/>I'm not saying don't buy the book, by all means buy it. Read it. See for yourself. I'm not being cynical, rowling is the queen of my world. This is the first and likely only bad review I will give regarding her.<br/><br/>Just be warned, this does not feel like harry potter. This was not intricate, well excuted, thought out, or clever. The characters were not true to themselves. I think the best way to go into reading this and saving yourself from despair is to read it as a fanfic and not the true works of rowling. It would be tolerable had her name not been involved, I expected so much more.<br/><br/>And now I will try to purge this book from my memory and continue to live in her past works of art. I still have big hopes for fantastic beasts and that's enough for now.
 Spoilers!!<br/><br/>Huge Harry Potter fan-- 16 years of reading!! So I was incredibly excited for the new one. I keep wondering if there's a therapy group where all the disgruntled fans can congragate and weep together. I'm also refusing to consider in cannon as it was not JKR herself who penned.  What they did to the INTEGRITY of these characters. I'm sick over it.  The entire 7 book series was about friendship, love and loyalty, and Harry knew that; and most importantly, knew that's what made him different from V. You're telling me, he, Ron and Herm  didn't continue to live and instil those values in their children? Rose was a bully, who was prejudice against someone without knowing them first.  Harry would never said he wished his kid wasn't his, or sacrificed his kid's only friendship over gosip. Harry wouldn't have choosen work over time with his family, which after all he'd been through WAS ALL HE EVER WANTED.<br/><br/>If someone were to ask me, what is your favorite thing about Harry Potter?, I would hands down reply: Harry Potter's moral integrity, that is the heart of the series. It's his choosing to sacrifice himself for what is good. It's choosing friendship over suspicion. It's a defiant effort to turn towards the pain of loving and losing, then choosing not to love at all. It's choosing to do what right, and best for others even when it hurts, is inconvenient, or scary. It's fighting for truth and justice, even when you're the only one doing it.  And when you move away from those central themes, the integrity of who we know Harry (and friends) to have PROVEN himself to be, you destroy Harry Potter and all that he stood for for 7 books.  This new book is the worst kind of trash, the one that destroys the soul of our hero.<br/><br/>Also, what they did to calm, measured, quirky, wise Dumbledore, making him a weepy, rude mess, who spoke in cliches, issuing a completely unnecessary "apology" to why Harry was at the Dursleys, when Dumbledore had already apologized profusely for that in HP5 AND severely told off the Dursleys in HP6 for their abusive behavior! It was just phony emotional porn!<br/><br/>  And Ron's a proper idiot who got drunk during his wedding?! He would have never disrespected Hermione like that. Hermione was neither clever, nor charming; she didn't come up with hardly any solutions. And what a weak, floppy mess Harry was during the fight scene?! His 16 year old self could have fought better. It's like they sucked the soul out of the books, like a dementor wrote it!! This is not even pointing out the horrible plot holes! No, I refuse this book is real. It's a bloody mess!
 I love Harry Potter - like have a Harry Potter tattoo and obsess over it kind of love. I'm also an English major who took multiple courses on reading plays of all kinds. So I am used to the set up and with amazing special effects could see this being entertaining to sit through just for nostalgia sake. However, it was bad. The plot was terrible. The characters were out of character by a lot... Doing things I didn't understand. It was insulting to read that something as silly as being embarrassed could turn Cedric into a death eater- his character was one of dignity, loyalty, and strength. To insinuate he could just have one embarrassing moment and end up being a death eater is unreal. Not to mention the giant plot hole of the time turner suddenly working in a way that he never has before (and in fact, was expressly written that it never could work in the way it does in Cursed Child). It read like a mediocre fan fiction written by someone who has only seen the movies. I was incredibly disappointed. If I was being more honest I would give this 1 star... But giving something in the Harry Potter universe such a low score is honestly hurting my heart.
 Most of this book is just reverberating the plot of former books through dreams etc. it's awful. At one point it says 1994, then says 25 years ago and the back says 19 years ago.<br/><br/>At this point they are just trying to make money and don't care about the fans or character authenticity or accuracy. They were all weak characters, and not the young, charming, inexperienced weak, that you'd expect from past writings. They all came across as middle aged disgruntled Muggles, lol. Too real for me - no charm.<br/><br/>I don't think Rowling even read it.  If she did, she should be ashamed.
 I am an aggressive fan of Harry Potter.<br/>What a disappointment to read this book.<br/>Very slow and irritating first two third of this book is really letting down of us Harry's fans.<br/>Last one third is ok type.<br/>But anyway it shows beautifully about the conflicts of father son relationship.<br/>Scorpio character is marvelous.
 I want to start this by saying that I am a huge Harry Potter fan. I grew up with Harry, I went to midnight premiers of the books and movies. I was so excited for this play. I wanted to like it. I really really did. If you are a fan I would say read it and form your own opinion. Here is what I thought:<br/><br/>-  Where was George?<br/>-  Where was Teddy? Because he was in the station in th epilogue.<br/>-  Where was Hugo? You know the other child Ron and Hermione have.<br/>-  Lily and James Potter… MIA for most of the play. Like James? Was he even in it?<br/>-  Why was Ron running the joke shop? He is an Auror. WHAT HAPPENED TO GEORGE? WHY WASN’T HE RUNNING THE SHOP?!<br/>-  Let’s talk about Ron. Why was he so non-Ron like? His character, all jokes no supporting and listening to Harry and Hermione. Also he is hardly in the play.<br/>-  Harry’s relationship with Albus. Everything about this is upsetting.<br/>o  In the last book when they are dropping off the children at the Hogwarts express, the kids are genuinely confused as to why everyone is looking at them and Ron makes a joke saying “I’m famous”. It is deduced that the kids do not know the extent of everything their parents went through to save the world. Yet Albus feel the weight of his dad’s legacy. Huh.<br/>o  Then we have Harry SEPARATING Albus and Scorpious. Let’s go back to that epilogue where they all see Draco with his family and a joke gets made about not playing with his son. Which then Hermione corrects and Ron says to beat him on test but not to get too cozy and marry him. Again, making it seem that everything in the past is in the past. Then there is Harry’s history of friends at Hogwarts. He knows. He would not separate his son from his ONLY friend.<br/>-  Albus choosing Slytherin for a friend? Awesome.<br/>-  The rumors of Voldemort having a child and that not being stopped by the ministry? Stupid. The ministry would have stopped panic about an heir being possible. Also Voldemort was conceived without love. He never cared about having an heir because he wanted to be in power. An heir would have been competition for him.<br/>-  More on that point. Bellatrix pregnant. She would have loved to mother the Dark Lords child; there would have been no greater honor. But. This does not work with the original time line. Bella is never pregnant, she fights at the battle. And then the gang goes to Malfoy manor there is no baby in sight. And if. IF. Voldemort would have wanted an heir; wouldn’t he have made it a horcrux and offered it more protection?<br/>-  Sexual tension between Scorpious and Albus. Yet Albus has a crush on Delphi and Scorpious on Lily. I feel as though either they should have been opened about their romantic feels towards each other or this should have not been included.<br/>-  The flashbacks/dreams Harry has. When Dudley is mentioned (yay!) and you find out petunia is dead. I know she was horrible but I do think Harry would have deep feelings about his mother’s sister passing. I liked the blanket part.<br/>-  Bellatrix husband somehow got out of Azkaban and raised Delphi. How did he escape Azkaban? Because there is no way he got pardoned. So how did he escape? And after escaping how was there no alarm over him escaping. Sirius Black escapes and the freaking muggle minister is alerted! Then there is a massive breakout and it is all over the daily prophet. But hey, this guy who tortured the Longbottoms into insanity he escapes and it’s cool. Yeah, sounds legit.<br/>-  The new prophecy. First of all: how did it happen with no one knowing about it except Delphi. Who made it? It’s sounding more and more as if this witch convinced herself that she is the heir of the dark lord.<br/>-  Cedric. Cedric a character who was noble and good and died oh so tragically. This character who was loyal and kind and helped Harry turns DARK SIDE?!?! BECAUSE HE LOSES THE CUP. WHAT?!?! CEDRIC A DEAD EATER HAHAHAHA NOPE NOT FUNNY. Thank you for turning a good character and completely changing him for the worse. Thank goodness you did not include Sirius Black in your play.<br/>-  On that same characters changing note. The trolley lady…. Hm. I will just leave it at that.<br/>-  Polyjuice potion. That s*** takes a month to make. I read the chamber of secrets. Many times. It takes an effing month. And you need a piece of the person you are changing into. But wait not, here I got some polyjuice potion here in my back pocket and I just happen to carry my dad and his best friends hairs at all times. So let’s change into them and break into the ministry.<br/>-  Btw that potion is not necessary because you can transfigure a HUMAN. Seven books and that never came out. Must be very dark magic.<br/>-  On the dark magic note. Harry duels Delphi (a eighteen year old) and she is stronger? Um. Do we not recall Harry being a teenager and he beat Voldemort. His wand is the s***. So yeah how does this even make sense?<br/>-  The no sugar diet. WHAT. Sounds like something movie Ginny would do, not book Ginny.
 I love the Harry Potter series. I read the books multiple times a year, watch the movies frequently and have read a lot of additional articles from pottermore. I had to wait a few days to get this book because of cash flow issues but Now that I have read it I fully regret ever reading this.<br/><br/>while I was looking forward to this and I knew it would be a script from a play not an in depth novel that I am used to; even with expectations being lowered a little to accommodate this being a play, nothing could prepare me for this travesty of a story.<br/><br/>Firstly: time travel is a weak plot line at best. After waiting years for a new story from Jo we get "what would have happened if Cedric hadn't died" this was such a let down.<br/><br/>Secondly: Cedric being embarrassed during the triwizard tournament would have been enough to cause someone who we remembered as brave, and selfless, to become a death eater? What type of garbage is that? How dare they drag his name through the mud and tarnish his memory like this.<br/><br/>Thirdly: Voldemort has a child? This is such a plot line cop out and even while reading it this doesn't make sense. Voldemort was conceived under a love potion, he doesn't know or understand love. Even with Bellatrix falling head over heels for him, in what universe do these two  get together and make a baby? And wouldn't Hermione have noticed that Bellatrix was pregnant when she used polyjuice potion to become her so they could enter her vault in Deathly Hallows?<br/><br/>And then Scorpious and Albus constantly referring to eachother as their best friend got to be annoying. And I am still wondering what qualities either of these boys possess that had them sorted into slytherin.<br/><br/>There were parts I did enjoy but they were few and far between. This is without a doubt garbage and I hope that Jo did not write this and that a corrected version of this will appear on pottermore or in print at a later date. My only hope is that I can return to reading the original 7 books and seeing the original 7 movies without this mashup of terrible plot lines tarnishing my love for Harry Potter.
 I, just like countless millions around the globe, love all things Harry Potter, from the first day the first book was in my local bookstore through my nth re-read of the entire series, as well as watching all eight movies more times than I can admit.<br/><br/>But then I read the new Harry Potter play/book<br/><br/>and I hated it.<br/><br/>I will ill try to say why without spoilers.<br/><br/>The characters. We have spent over a decade watching Harry, Ron, Hermione and even Draco Malfoy mature from children int young but strong adults.<br/><br/>Those are not the characters we will see in this play. In THIS play, Hermione is a shrew. And is employed in other than expected after reading Deathly Hallows, and after Rowlings' post-Potter interviews. This Hermione is NOT a nice lady. Treats her friends as underlings and her husband as she would an unwanted stray. With mange. Her brilliance has dimmed to a few riddles weak enough for the reader to get long before the protagonists.<br/>Harry is a workaholic who seems to have avoided his life since Book 7. His desk reflects his personal life, a mess. And his great, hard-won abilities in Defense Against Dark Arts? Not evident in this story. In fact, he seems weaker now than he was in his Triwizard Tournament days. And he, too, is barely tolerable. Not at all the sympathetic waif-turned-savior who we cared for, feared for, and many of us secretly wanted to be...<br/>And Ron. Poor Ron. Always the third in the trio. Harry had his Scar and his Destiny. Hermione had the brains. But Ron... Ron was their heart. Ron was no idiot - "the best played game of chess" from the first year days showed us that. But really, without him and his devotion to both Harry AND Hermione, Voldemort would have won. Ron was Harry's first, last, and best friend. And he was all that and more to Hermione. It was Ron, really, who taught Harry what love is. But here - here he is only the Comedy Relief. More pathetic than a three legged dog following the master who kicks him, he becomes less important, less interesting, and less credible as the same Ron Weasley we followed for seven years of his life.<br/>Luckily enough, they are really only background. The protagonists are Albus, Harry's middle child, and Scorpius, Draco's only child. Albus seems the main protagonist, but the story would go nowhere without Scorpius.<br/>Unfortunately, Albus is... Thoroughly unlikable. He lives in the permanent pity-party of a middle child raised in the showdown of a famous father. He divorces himself from his brother and cousin moments after the play begins. He creates his own misery, despite plenty of options.<br/>And Scorpius never fleshes out into more than a weak copy of both Ron and Hermione to Albus-as-Harry. Friend, but with definite suggestions that under the right circumstances, there could be more than friendship between the boys.<br/>And and almost all of Albus' troubles are his own immaturity (even taking his age into account) and his own self-pity, perhaps even self-hatered.<br/>Even his his attempts to undergo trials to better himself, to prove himself worthy to be a son to the Boy Who Lived... Well, unlike Harry, Albus seeks his own trouble, deliberately, with warning after warning, and nearly causes irreparable harm everyone he should have loved.<br/>So, yes. The characters were a let-down.<br/><br/>The setting? Replace "Hogwarts" with "the Tardis" or "the USS Enterprise" and you do not change the story one iota. Just substitute "sonic screwdriver" or "phasers" for "magic wand," as appropriate.<br/><br/>And as for the plot: I basically told you that it is the story of a middle child of a famous and distant father who tries to find value in himself, but not in any good way. I won't mention plot devices, but let's just say this one has been so overused in the science fiction, fantasy, and even comic book literature of the past decade that there was no doubt that only the use of the Harry Potter name got this play produced in the first place.<br/>In short, there is nothing new. Nothing special. Nothing interesting. Just used plot devices and the destruction of characters the world has loved for nearly two decades to tell the story of an unlikeable, slightly spoiled, self-pitying boy with middle-child syndrome who, when offered a new life, a new chance, time and again held on to his daddy issues so hard that I, for one, only finished reading this play because I wanted to see how low it would sink. As a middle child myself, I had no pity for Albus.<br/><br/>Rowling sold out on this one. Audiences will love to go back "home" to Hogwarts and our heroes (with a villain or two, or there is no conflict to resolve). But when they leave, and re-read the original books, re-watch the movies... How many will see the magic in this play was all in their own desire to get more time in a beloved world that ended with the Deathly Hallows?
 I rarely review, that being said, i am so unbelievably dissapointed in this "story". I do understand that J.K didnt write this, but i feel that someone carrying on her legacy should have somewhat of her writing style. This has none of that. Ive been reading these books since the 2nd one came out, I wanted to love this, and i hope the play itself is as good as its being hyped to be. Its not that its in script format, It is just imo that the writing is horrid. Its like the worst 'fanfic' ive ever read.
 Have read the 5 star reviews on here, the issue is not that this was written as a screen play. This issue with this screen play is that it totally rips apart the story of Harry Potter and will make you question the entire series. As an avid Harry Potter fan I spent my childhood reading and rereading the stories, delving into the detailed world that is Harry Potter with its imagery and developed characters. None of the characters in here felt right. (SPOILER) Ginny was subdued, Harry was an Arse, Ron sounded like he might belong in St. Mungos, Hermione sounded old, bitter and unpowerful, and Draco was the only original character I actually liked which is against everything in me that is Griffindor.<br/><br/>Wish that I would not have read, JK Rowling should have left the series as the perfection it was and not sold out.<br/><br/>SPOILER<br/>Ummmmm the Trolley Witch is a monster that has claws and keeps kids on the train? WHAT? What is this god awful madness. At least have some sort of enchantment that prohibits them from getting off the train. That is all.
 Read this as a library copy before deciding to buy it. It's that bad.<br/><br/>The play format isn't obnoxious; it's easy to read. That's the only thing going for this book; you'll get through it quickly, provided you don't damage it too badly throwing it across the room in disgust every time you encounter another badly-written passage.<br/><br/> Everything other reviewers are saying about this being a fanfiction is true. The characters are underdeveloped; after everything we saw in the first books, there was a lot they could have drawn on for who these characters are. They also don't seem to be very British anymore, which is odd. The interaction between characters is wooden and in places just ridiculous. The plot... I won't give spoilers, but let's just say that there's so much deus ex machina that it's downright disturbing. Rather than inventing a new plot, they contrived a way to retread the old plots, which feels cheap and lazy.<br/><br/>The teenagers don't act like teenagers. Too many of the conversations are exposition tools, and in stilted language that kids don't use. It's as if they didn't actually know any teenagers when they wrote this. The adults, however, DO sound like teenagers. They simultaneously kept the teenage mannerisms of the main HP characters, without keeping their inherent deeper personalities.<br/><br/>I don't believe in bad books. But... this is a bad book. Even on its own, it would be a brutal read; as part of the HP universe, it's a bitter disappointment.
 I'm going to start by saying, I grew up with Harry Potter. I am still currently for probably the thousandth time rereading the books I grew up loving. Harry Potter and the cursed child is abismal. Harry, Ron, hermione, Draco, everyone is completely lost in this, they are just names used at this point. The story was sloppy and very rushed, moving years in only a few pages. I understand that as we grow older we change but this had very little left of anyone. At best I can describe it as a very poorly written fan fiction. Everything about what I at least loved about Harry Potter was completely removed. I understand this was a script for the play but I don't think it remotely was written by jk. If it was I would expect details from previous books to be correct and not severely muddled like the movies were. I am very dissapointed, and am not considering this a Harry Potter book, it was abismal. If there is anything I wish I could tell jk, it's this: we loved Harry yes but his story ended, we want more yes, but we fell in love with the world, and that is what we want more of. Tell us a story that has nothing to do with him or his family.
 I'm a HUGE HP nerd, just trust me on that. So even though I knew it was just a play script that J.K didn't write but liked it enough to let them put her name on it, I had to read it for myself.<br/><br/>There is no way this should be officially thought of as the 8th story. She ended 7 fine and this just completely ruins that epilogue, she should never have let this be considered part of the HP universe. I went into this with low expectations and I was still a little disappointed. The characters don't act like they would if this were written by J.K. or any normal fan that know and love them as much as a lot of us do. The story skips over a bunch of things-i get it, it's a play... But the first few years at Hogwarts in the beginning were just a waste. You get to see some of the characters you love but others that you assume will be in it are completely ignored. I mean, the story has Hogwarts in it, where is Neville? Where is Hagrid? You're left completely in the dark about what has happened to a lot of these characters, not even a mention of them if they are alive or dead. The story itself is a bit ridiculous and is completely predictable. I won't give any spoilers but the whole thing is just one person after another whining about their daddy issues.<br/><br/>Read this if you are curious and make your own decisions, but for me I wish I hadn't. I re-read 1-7 ever year (at least once a year, if not 2-3 times) unfortunately this book will sit on my shelf and never be read again. :-(
 Was very skeptical about the fact this was a play &amp; my 1st instincts were correct. I was so excited to see a new Harry Potter story, even though I'm 62 y/o, that I ordered impulsively w/o waiting for reader<br/>reviews. JK Rowling may have given her blessing &amp; gotten a monetary chunk of the sales, but that women's ability to tell a great story is NOWHERE to be found in this new release!! This is going straight to ebay.
 I refuse to call this the 8th Harry Potter book. The characters have no depth, the plot is flawed and it wasn't even truly written by JK Rowling, she gave her input to the script, she didn't write it. This is badly written fan fiction. I wish I could forget this book and go back to the mystery of the REAL Harry Potter books.
 (enough said)
 So, I just finished reading Cursed Child and...I'm incredibly disappointed. I knew full well that this was merely a script and not a full-blown story. I'm totally fine with that..except for the fact that it's terrible.<br/><br/>*possible spoilers*<br/><br/>The initial excitement of holding a new HP book wore off incredibly quickly. The characters in CC have almost no semblance whatsoever to their true HP counterparts. They are flat and dull in so many ways.<br/><br/>And what's with the relationship between Scorpius and Albus? I fully expected this to turn into a full-blown romantic relationship because they reiterate their feelings for one another over...and over...and over...But it doesn't really add anything to the plot when they do!<br/><br/>Speaking of plot...this one is terrible! Time travel, angsty teenage drama, more time travel, random daughter of Voldemort, more time travel...There are more holes in this plot than a cheese grater!<br/><br/>Ugh..I have read the original HP series through many times, and will continue to do so. But this book will never be reread. I will likely give it away or give it to Goodwill as soon as my wife finishes reading it..Disappointing.<br/><br/>Two stars because I can't 'hate' anything HP, but this is cutting it incredibly close.
 This was pretty bad, and for what it's worth it doesn't have anything to do with the script format of the book. It's the story, the story is absolutely vapid, and were it not for its title it would have been discarded among the throng of shameful attempts at engaging storytelling. The plot is centered around time travel, quite possibly the most cringeworthy storyline cliché imaginable and completely passes over the essence of the series in the first place. Throughout the first few acts the reader is constantly being jerked around in a half-assed attempt to catch them up to speed, and the sparse snapshots of life that we are shown do little to rival the sentiment of merely watching an episode of Full House. I'm thoroughly convinced that anybody who rushes to the defense of this book is so intransigently entrenched in fandom that they couldn't work past the guilt of having grown up with Harry Potter to even consider slandering this abomination to an incredible series. I can't help but think that this shoehorned hardback is opportunism at its finest.
 So very very sad ... Rowling created a special place, special characters and encouraged millions of people to READ ... this work was pointless, poorly executed, poorly conceived and an overall disappointment.  Silly story line, further damaged by weak characters and ultimately destroyed by making it a play ... should have stopped at 7 J.K..
 I did not enjoy this story, and I really wanted to. The first 2/3 of the story is a tale of teenage angst. The final 1/3 is interesting, premise-wise, but extremely week. "And then EVERYONE had children and their children reenact the same dramas" is boring. The Malfoys have drama again (even though Harry and Draco ended on good terms?), Harry doesn't see anything wrong with locking up his son (uhm...)?  Delphi is.. actually I still don't know what her original goal was. I'm trying not to throw spoilers here, but what was she getting at with Cedric? Before Albus &amp; Co see the possible other outcomes, what did she hope would happen?<br/><br/>Sigh.  I'll still see the play when it comes around, but I won't travel to see it like I had planned.
 D for Dreadful.<br/><br/>I read the reviews but didn't think much of all the one-stars. I figured hardcore Harry Potter fans were just being too harsh in reviewing after years of inventing their own futures for all the beloved characters.<br/><br/>I was so wrong.<br/><br/>I want to stress that I really really wanted to like this addition to the Harry Potter canon.  I even wanted to read it quickly so I could get to Amazon to leave a great review, defending the plot and characters. Unfortunately, it truly did fall short in my eyes.  The characters don't seem like themselves, the plot seems rushed and full of holes, and there are so many unnecessary and incompatible story inclusions that seem incorporated just to be able to revisit old characters. I was, regrettably, disappointed.<br/><br/>SPOILERS ----&gt;<br/>First, I agree with many of the comments left here in that having Albus Potter be sorted into Slytherin was great.  However, there was no explanation of why and no vindication for Slytherin House either.  I would have hoped that Slytherin was finally shown in good light, but this did not really happen either.  There were hardly any signs of ambition or leadership in Albus or Scorpius.  How did they end up in Slytherin, anyway? Also, why was there no mention of Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff?<br/><br/>The idea that Albus and Scorpius wouldn't understand (or care about) the consequences of using a time turner to change a significant historical event at the age of 14 is preposterous.  Even if Scorpius was mildly tempted just to follow his friend, he would be smart enough to try to dissuade Albus from actually making any changes in history.  He is portrayed as smart like Hermione, but this certainly didn't fit.  And to try to set things right by doing it a second time? And on top of that, doing something entirely different that second time hoping it would put things back in order?!  Please.<br/><br/>The biggest plot issue I had was that Voldemort has a child, and with Bellatrix Lestrange before the Battle of Hogwarts, no less.  We saw Bellatrix in book 7 in detail the year before she died.  As someone pointed out, the idea that she was pregnant while fighting Harry, Ron, and Hermione in Malfoy Manor and no one notice is absurd.  Maybe I'm missing something in the timeline on this one.  Also, Voldemort would have planned much better than to leave his descendant with no proper care or plan for the future.  Voldemort took every precaution and went further than any wizard known in history to assure his immortality. He would have had similar care and preparation for his plan B.<br/><br/>Finally, there is a big issue with the characters in this story.  I thought that the reviews of changing characters might be attributed to them growing into adulthood.  Now, though, I really don't think so. There was a mix of odd sappy behavior and furious rages from Harry who had always been respectful of others and learned to control his emotions towards the end of the series. Hermione was preoccupied and sloppy. Ron was no longer witty or clever but included as some kind of foolish comic relief.  Draco was the peaceful voice of reason.  It really didn't make sense to me.  As for the flashbacks, they seemed so forced and unnecessary - only existing to give the audience a chance to revisit characters.  Even they were disappointing revivals, though.  Dumbledore seemed emotional and unhelpful, Cedric was full of spite, and Snape was sentimental and kindhearted (even if Snape was good in the end, he was never one to get emotional - he himself states that it is a key to his Occlumency skills!).  Very disappointing.<br/>&lt;----<br/><br/>I could go on but why.  All in all, I was let down.  I expected much more than this.  Perhaps it was my high expectations after so many years or re-reading the magnificent original 7 immediately before I picked this up, but I did not enjoy Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. By all means, read it since it is supposedly canon now, but don't expect to be impressed.
 If you are a fan of Harry Potter and have not yet read this, save yourself! DO NOT READ THIS! Pretend it doesn't exist. It reads like hastily written fan fiction. Yes, I understand that it is a play script and not a novel, but it lacks the character development and rich descriptive detail that made HP so much fun to read. So disappointed.
 Listen, if you're a HP fan, you're going to read this book. But please, please, please, get it from the library or borrow a friend's version. Do not give these "writers" your money. This reads like a 327 page money grab. It has none of the charm and depth of JK Rowling's world. The two best words I have to describe this "book" is shallow and sterile. Everything we loved about the books (the locations, the lore, the characters) have boiled down into sterile, simple versions. It reads like amateur fan fiction; not the HP stories we all love.
 First off, I am a huge Harry Potter fan when it comes to the original 7 books and 8 movies. I was one of those kids who had to get the book on day 1 of release, just so I could read until 2am before having my mother yell at me to shut the lights off and go to bed. In which case I'd grab a flashlight just to continue reading. I knew there would be spoilers from others around me if I didn't hurry up and read as much as possible each day. I should also add that prior to Harry Potter I hated reading books with a passion. Finally, I found a series that held my interest from start to finish.<br/><br/>Fast forward to now, as an adult. Yet another Harry Potter book is on the shelves. This time it is a play. That wasn't a problem for me. I've read plays in the past.<br/><br/>Here's a breakdown of what I didn't like:<br/>-It comes off as a poorly written fanfic. It's obvious JK Rowling had very little say in this. Why her name is even on the book is beyond me. This is not her work. Supposedly they agreed on the story together, but I just have a tough time believing this.  It's as if she was too nice to tell Jack Thorne (the real writer) no. She should have disagreed with it for numerous reasons, which I will go into detail below.<br/>-The characters are not themselves, for one. Yes, I understand that 19 years has gone by, but even so that's no excuse for how drastically different some of them were.<br/>-It's all about time travel. We were told all the time turners were destroyed, but now all of the sudden we learn that one time turner still exists that allows you to go back in time for 5 minutes. Harry's son, Albus, and Malfoy's son, Scorpius, are friends who decide to go back in time and save Cedric. Yup, that's the plot. Time travel is the plot.<br/>-Voldemort has a daughter. Bellatrix is the mother. She was pregnant and gave birth in book 7 .... Need I say more? I don't think I have to explain how insane that one is. Anyway, their daughter uses Scorpius and Albus to change the past and basically bring Voldemort back.<br/>-We learn that Cedric's death was a good thing because he'd have become a death eater otherwise. Apparently he was so hurt by losing the Triwizard tournament (after time travel affected everything) and embarrassed that he became a death eater as a result. Again, what!?<br/>-Where's George? We learn Ron is running the joke shop. Cool, but where the heck is George?<br/>-Where are Albus's siblings whenever things go crazy and his life is in danger? It's just Harry and Ginny who freak out. Where's the rest of the family?<br/><br/>I could go on and on, but I think you get the point. I love JK Rowling and will forever love the original Harry Potter series, but again this is not her work. She had very little, if any, say in this. This is Jack Thorne's work and I am not a fan. Sorry to put it so bluntly.
 As an avid fan of the Harry Potter series, I was extremely excited to read this book and did so in a few hours.<br/><br/>As many people have already said, it was a huge let down for so many reasons. The plot sucks, the characters don't even match up to their original depiction, it's predictable and corny. Just terrible. I am trying to force myself into believing that this just never existed because it's better than considering this as the future.
 J.K. Rowling just trashed her legacy. She deviated from the core of her characters. You'll find yourself thinking "She/he would never have said that." or "He/she would never have done that!" It just doesn't track with the characters we knew so well. Fans of the books will be very disappointed in the script. Firstly, it's not actually a novel (duh) and it doesn't read like one (also duh). Many will blame the format for the departure from her past quality and while it clearly didn't do Rowling et. al. any favors, this reads like fan-fiction. Start to finish. The new characters, the changes to old characters, the plot, the concept - all of them scream "fan-fiction" and not even good fan-fiction. The key points of the story just don't fit the universe. It's uncomfortable to read this if you're deep into the original stories. You'll struggle to fit the actions of characters into what you know of them. So much of the plot feels like a retread of old material and not just flashbacks but the themes. This didn't add anything new to the Harry Potter universe. At least, nothing that we couldn't have lived without.<br/><br/>There are a few brief moments that feel like the wizarding world we all know and love but sadly, they are few and far between.<br/><br/>Fans of Harry Potter do owe it to themselves to read the story but I strongly recommend that you lock this tale far far away from your memory of the 7 books.
 Very disappointed. Save your money. If your a fan of the JKR series you will not like this. Written in play format it just reads badly and it's also reads more like a fanfic in story line. I wish I could unread this.
 I should say, I'm a massive Harry Potter fan. I'm such a fan of the novels that, at times, I can't watch the films because they are nothing like the books. I eagerly awaited the arrival of this script, and hoped that it would continue the story in a way that left me longing for more. I was severely disappointed.<br/>You'll read it in the other reviews, I'm sure, but the plot holes and characterization of this story were just horrendous. There is no other word for it. You might find yourself, as I did, occasionally swept along in the story, but that doesn't make it a good story. It certainly doesn't excuse the poor writing which is filled to the brim with trope after trope, cliche after cliche, corny phrase after corny phrase. That JK Rowling would lend her support to a script of such poor quality is inconceivable. Perhaps she was confunded?<br/><br/>By page 42 I was ready to be done, by page 242 I was laughing hysterically. This script is pure tripe. I don't have a problem reading it in script form. I would rather read it in a script than be distracted from its flaws by flashing lights and (what I'm sure is) great acting.<br/><br/>Don't pay to read this book. Rent it from the library, or borrow a copy if your curiosity is that insatiable.
 Waste of money. Takes about an hour to read. Not written well at all and it is fanfic. JK had very little to do with this story. To call it the Official 8th story is a rip and a kick to all fans. How much money we keep pumping into the franchise. All we would like is a new book. So many back stories that could be walked through and we get this. A script. Yes it is laid out like one. "Harry exists, Hermione enters"
 Let me start off by mentioning two very important point about myself as a reader: 1. I hate paying for shipping and will go out of my way to avoid it 2. I am a massive Harry Potter Fan. In fact, in preparation of reading this book I reread all the Harry Potter books. Not that I wasn't going to anyway, but it was a lovely excuse. Moving on, I have decided not only to return this book, but to pay money to return it. It cannot sit on my shelf amongst the other HP books. I refuse. There are basically three reasons why this book is not a HP book and after I have returned it and finished this review I am going to promptly forget it ever existed:<br/>1. This is not written nor does it sound like JK Rowling. This "story" may have been "based on a JK Rowling story" but it just does not seem like it. It truly seems more like a poorly developed fan fic. JK Rowling is seamless, sophisticated. She doesn't allow for many mistakes to be made. It often felt like whoever wrote this play didn't even read the HP books but merely watched the movies. Big Mistake.<br/>2. The story is poorly developed and poorly executed. As I mentioned, there are a ton of mistakes made. I won't go into them as other reviews have beautifully listed them. So if you want a list of all the mistakes made and the impossibilities according to previous books, look at some of the other longer reviews.<br/>3.  The characters, our characters, our beautiful trio, does not sound/act/speak or do anything like they generally would. Ron is an imbecile throughout this novel, Hermione isn't terribly bright, Harry isn't himself, not at all, and the new characters we are introduced to aren't well developed.  The author (whoever it is) doesn't mention key characters like Teddy. Not to mention the direction they do go in with the plot is just beyond ridiculous. The author seems to spend more time on Cedric Diggory than he does on Ron or Hermione.<br/><br/>While reading this book I continued to keep in mind that this book is written as a play, that reading a play is different from reading a novel, and that as a play you will not get the same emotional insight as you would in a novel. Apparently it is very good watching this play on stage. However, as a book, I cannot and do not like this and for me, it is not "the next installment" but a poorly written and poorly developed fan fic turned into a play. I am so disappointed. I can't even believe JK Rowling approved this for publication.
 I am  huge Harry Potter fan and have been looking forward to reading this. I can't even begin to describe how disappointed I am in it. The story is horrible. I wish I could have the time I spent reading it back. I'm not talking about how it being written as a play makes it awkward to read. I actually didn't mind the format per se. The basis of the story and where it went was very simply terrible. It was not an enjoyable read, and even the ending was unsatisfying.
 A total failure :  The dialogue is stiff and wooden, our heros reduced to pitiful caricatures rather than believable older versions of themselves. At times, Albus and Scorpius act and sound years older than their parents.  Shabby attempts to insert humor fell flat while frantic action scenes reminded me of those I have seen in poorly directed Chinese Kung- Fu movies.<br/><br/>Even more disturbing is that all the critics' accolades remind me of the old "Emperor's New Clothes" Tale.  Everyone praising something absurd for fear of being criticized by the people around them.  Have we really become so desperate for another chapter in Harry's life that we'll settle for whatever is thrown at us?<br/><br/>For me,  this is a prime example of greedy moguls in the movie industry (because of course a movie is going to be in the  works eventually,...  with the probable addition of a talking pet sidekick... a la Donkey or Jiminy cricket)  twisting old beloved traditional fairytales into scenes of dancing,  singing mice and teapots that talk, while bullying their target market into agreeing with so-called experts who are actually secretly  profiting in some way from promoting the offered dribble.<br/><br/>That Rowling put her seal of approval on this  play shocks me. For me,  Harry's adventure ends firmly on platform 9 3/4 as he sends Albus off to Hogwarts.<br/><br/>Frankly, I think Rowling owes us an apology.  And Amazon?  I want my money back!
 Alas, what a disappointment.  I am unsure what I can write that has not already been written, but I will try to contribute.  I should start by saying that I am an incredibly devoted fan who has cosplayed Harry Potter and who avidly anticipated this new installment of the Harry Potter world. Like many others, I question how much Rowling contributed to this and I agree that it is like a horrible fanfiction.  A Very Potter Music, a parody, is more canon to the fans of Harry Potter than this debacle.<br/><br/>A few reasons that this dismays me go as follows (Please, excuse the spoilers):<br/>1. JK Rowling has admitted her folly with time turners.  Yet, they were the main plot device in this book.  It was almost used to explain why one could not have used them to go back in time to stop Voldemort.<br/>2. The characters were disastrous.<br/>  a. Harry Potter, who has completely mistreated by his aunt, uncle, and cousin would never have treated his son so shamefully.<br/>  b. Ron was used as a comic relief and a joke.<br/>  c. Hermione wasn't Harry's best friend; Ron was. However, Harry treated her as such.<br/>  d. There are more, but I don't have time.<br/>3. Bellatrix was never pregnant which makes the whole plot moot.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you must ruin your Harry Potter experience, please rent it from the library.
 I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter series and was so excited for the Cursed Child to arrive.  Having just finished it, I'm extremely disappointed.  I knew it was written as a play, so it's not the format that's the problem - it's the story.  It reads like bad fan fiction -  all the magic of the original series is gone.  Harry, Ron, Hermione and many of the original characters appear, but are sad, flat versions of themselves.  Albus Potter, as the protagonist, is completely unsympathetic and his motives, which drive the plot, never seem justified.  The storyline is not compelling, just depressing.  And there are serious flaws in the plot which render it all ridiculous....SPOILER ALERT: Bellatrix Lestrange secretly gives birth to Voldemort's child just before the Battle of Hogwarts?!? For that to be true, she would have been obviously pregnant in several scenes in Book 7.  How would no one have noticed that?!?!?  Also, Polyjuice potion cannot be brewed in a day. And how, if the Potters' house is protected by the Fidelius charm, did they find the Potters and steal the blanket???  Perhaps with the spectacle of a theater production, this story might be more engaging on stage, but in my view, the Cursed Child is an unnecessary and unworthy addition to the Harry Potter canon.
 I loved every one of the 7 Harry Potter books. If you think you are buying #8, you are not. I finished Harry Potter and the Cursed Child last night. I feel like Act 1 was written by a student learning to write a play. Act 2 was at first as if they crossed Harry Potter with It's a Wonderful Life, then actually started to get good. Finally, in Act Three, they realized they needed to hurry up and finish. This is Not written by JK Rowling. I feel incredibly disappointed after all the hype for pre-orders as this was marketed as a new story and not the "fan fiction" this is.
 Expectations were high. I loved the original Harry Potter books, and I even thought The Casual Vacancy and the Galbraith books were pretty good.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this reads like bad fanfiction. My favorite characters appeared in name only, with none of the depth, charm or interesting dynamics that made the original Potter books so compelling.<br/><br/>Perhaps the lack of character development could have been saved by an interesting plot, but the Cursed Child lacks that as well. The storyline is driven by how growing up in the shadow of his father, Harry Potter, makes Albus Potter a dark and tortured soul. Although Albus' siblings seem perfectly well adjusted (basically mini-Fred and mini-Ginny), Albus suffers from ANGST, causing him to pull incredibly stupid stunts that advance the plot in the absence of any logic or reason.<br/><br/>Clever, creative world building could have possibly saved this illogical story with flat, annoying characters. And yet the writers fail to add any dimensions to the HP Universe, instead using old set pieces (that I used to know and love) in ways that make no sense while simultaneously sucking all the whimsy and wonder out of Magical Britain.<br/><br/>If you would like to read Harry Potter fanfiction, I recommend hpmor.com instead.
 Before I say anything about this book, I would just like to say that if you are a die-hard fan of the Harry Potter series, please leave that wonderful, untainted world alone. Don't buy this book.<br/><br/>***MILD SPOILERS BELOW***<br/><br/>While I would not compare this book to a bad fanfic, I am incredibly disappointed that JK Rowling said that this story should be considered canon. The characters are nothing like themselves in the series (Professor McGonagall is now a ditzy old lady with little regard for rules when it suits her) and they're very flat. I'm not sure how characters with SEVEN BOOKS of character development behind them could possibly be this lackluster. Parts of the story are absolutely ridiculous (the snack trolley lady is an immortal being that spends her free time making explosive pumpkin pasties and sharpening her hand-spikes? Please.)<br/>Overall I was very disappointed by this book. The Harry Potter books were such an integral part of my childhood, and this book just felt like an awful mockery of a wonderful story and a sad attempt to milk more money out of the franchise.
 There seem to be some significant plot holes in this story. It's not written as well as the first 7 books. The first 7 books go into great depth of each character and let you really get to know them.  This seems to be just written for high action entertainment instead of plot likers.  Besides the plot holes it seems to contradict things from the book series.  It was an easy read that I finished in 24 hours.  There were very clear differences between the books that were writtten by JK and this joint effort. This book lacks her wit and humor and just repeats things from her books.  I've read and loved the 7 Harry Books she wrote MANY times. So it was very tedious to reread quotes from them over and over and over again.  This play is like one of those tv shows where they just show you the clips from old episodes with very little new material. And I'm guessing this play makes the assumption that you've read her updates to the story on Pottermore?  There were some real holes in continuity from where the last book left off and where this one picked up.  We miss out on a lot of the beloved characters.  There is no Dursely humor. There is no Hagrid, no house elves, only the mention of a ghost other than Moaning Myrtle who gets a few lines,<br/>  ------ spoiler alert--------------<br/><br/>In book 7, Voldemort killed the horcrux residing in Harry. That got rid of Harry's scar and his ability to speak Parsiltongue.  Both his scar and Parsiltongue are back in this book.<br/><br/>His scar hurt in the books because he had Voldemort's soul fragment, Horcrux, in his body. That's gone now yet his scar hurts because of Voldemort's daughter being around?  Since he no longer is connected to Voldemort, he has no connection to his daughter.<br/><br/>  I'll never pre-order a book from Amazon again. I tried to call them to see when it would be delivered during the release date. I couldn't get even a yes or no answer from 3 different people I tried to ask about it. Then on the release date when it wasn't delivered to my kindle I called to find out why not, and they had cancelled my order. WHAT?! I called to see when it would be delivered and they cancelled it?!  What a nightmarish company Amazon Kindle has become to deal with.  Their operators clearly don't speak English.  They can only recite what's on their scripts, So if you ask them a question that's not on their script they just keep reciting things that don't have anything to do with what you are asking about, such as what time in my own time zone will this be downloaded to my kindle?  Can I do anything to download it as soon as it's midnight? - no answer to either question, then after all they put me through, to cancel my order?  And that's on top of them poorly pronouncing English words so that they are barely recognizable. They talk in a loud background so you can barely make out what they are saying. And the one operator breathed heavily into the phone the entire time and after giving him a bad review he called me back to do that more to me. Ugh.  Never again.
 I laughed, I cried, I wished I could go back in time and tell those twelve year old kids on ff.net that someday they'd be vindicated.<br/><br/>I'm a huge fan. I've been here since the beginning in 1998, I taught my son to read using these books. This story was so disappointingly hilarious.
 The only way to justify this amateurish script, which has much beloved characters wildly out of character, is as a semi-autobiographical play written by Scorpius or Albus within the HP universe. It is not compliant with book canon plus author interviews. It is not compliant with the characters as presented in the epilogue of Deathly Hallows. Characters that should be there (Neville, the Weasleys,  most importantly) are completely missing and not even mentioned. I wish I could obliviate.
 First and foremost, I was well aware that this was a play, not a novel; but even by those standards this is a disgrace. If it was possible I would give  0 stars. I am horrifically obsessed with these books, for the past 19 years (tattoos, pet names, my adult apartment covered in maps and memorabilia - you get the point). Every Christmas and July 31st I have my own HP marathon - movies, and books, respectively. After re-reading the entire series just a day before reading this I was almost in a HP PTSD shock. I have read awful, poorly written, fanfiction that was lightyears better than this tragedy of a story (even calling it that seems overly kind).<br/><br/>The characters you love and adore to abhore are completely missing - just their names remain, and tiny fragments of what seems to be a stolen history of their lives. I sighed, scowled, and groaned mercilessly while reading, and eventually completely gave up trying to understand even a semblance of what was going on in this story.This is NOT cannon, nor something I can physically or mentally endure sitting on my bookshelves next to what was the light of my childhood (and early adulthood if I'm honest). I will rightly say that I had a massive nerd freak-out, and actually tore the book to pieces to prevent myself from re-reading it, as I knew I would as a sadistic form of torture - and it was cathartic as hell.<br/><br/>If you only watched the movies, you may be able to endure this story; but the Potterheads who live and die for these books are just testing their patience, never-questioning love of all things HP, and the sainthood of Rowling by reading this story. (I am aware it is not her writing, and that with the play coming out she was in bind to publish, but that does not excuse this abortion of a story. Even as a play the plot alone is only a modicum of what anyone truly in love with these characters and world would be expecting.)<br/><br/>**SPOILER WARNING**<br/><br/> So many issues: the timeturner now apparently having the ability to go back decades, and create butterfly effect implications; Hermione's visage as a cold, cruel, DADA professor; Harry's Hermione-like myopic focus on his work, above his family; Ron - as a whole; too many others to list without losing my cool once again.<br/><br/>After waiting 9 years for another story, this is truly heartbreaking, and worthy of tears!<br/><br/>**And yes, that's my cat, Albus, looking on approvingly of the tattered remains of my sanity that night.
 I could get past the predictable plot and the plot holes that are big enough for a truck to drive through, but I detest that most of the characters are not the valiant characters I've loved for years.  Ron is not dumb (remember he played the greatest game of chess in Hogwart's history?) and Harry is not ineffectual and weak (the line in the play about never fighting alone? So who fought Voldemort at the end all by himself because "that was the way it had to be?" Who was in the Chamber of Secrets fighting the basilisk?  Who went on and saved the Sorcerer's Stone?).  Dumbledore's portrait? That was a horrible portrayal.  I could go on . . . but when I re-read the series again and again, I'll surely leave this little piece out.  If I want to go forward, I'll just find some decent fan fiction about Harry and his children.
 As a lifelong Harry Potter fan, I was so excited for the release of the next story - months and months I waited in anticipation, and then, last night, I finally read it.<br/><br/>What a disappointment.<br/><br/>As J.K. Rowling did not write the book, the characters in the play feel like strangers. The tone of the book is just...off. The plot-line is weird, and doesn't follow along with the logic and rules established in the series.<br/><br/>Personally, I think this book reads like fan-fiction - but BAD fan-fiction, to say the least. I spent my teenage years on sites like MuggleNet, and I have definitely read some good Harry Potter fan-fiction in the past.<br/><br/>This story just feels wrong, and is totally amateurish. If you're not a die-hard Harry Potter fan, you might enjoy this story for the entertainment value, but as a die-hard fan, I was supremely disappointed.
 why jo why????  why would you sign off on this??  so many possibilities and this is it.  sadly this story is rubbish.  i knew it was a play script and she didnt write it. but to put her name on it and endorse the whole affair lent credibility and expectation that it would be good.  but thoroughly disappointing.  not true to the characters. story line seriously lacking. time turners?  really?  sigh...
 I'm a hardcore Harry Potter fan: read all the books, own all the books, played all the PC games, watched all the movies, and read tons of HP fanfiction. That said, this play is a disappointment! It reads like very bad fanfiction. There were overused tropes, gaping plotholes (For example: Polyjuice potion takes a month to make!), and bad charcterization. JKR didn't write it and the diction feels a bit off. Only good thing in the play: Scorpius Malfoy !
 I wanted to love this play/book. I've read the original novels more times than I can count, and love them more and more each time I open them. I wanted to be re-immersed in the world of magic, get to know my old friends as adults, and see what kinds of morals they have instilled in their children, to see if their children could carry on their legacy of fighting for what they believed in. I had extremely high hopes when I opened it up and started reading. I wish I had gone in with no hopes or expectations, because I probably would have been less disappointed if I had.<br/><br/>After reading it, it is very clear that JK Rowling did not do any of the writing. It may have been her story, but the voices and portrayals of the characters were so unlike the original books that it's impossible to think she penned any of it. I realize it was made to be a play, not a book, and perhaps seeing it on stage, acted out with special effects and real interactions, would have opened up more of the emotion that was meant to be behind the words, but simply reading them didn't do that. The words just fell flat and the characters lost all of their charm and wits from the original stories.<br/><br/>*Mild spoilers*<br/><br/>The first 20 pages were great, basically a rehash of the epilogue and then a little bit of time getting to see Albus and Rose navigate the Hogwarts Express just like Harry did his first time on it. It felt very authentic and nostalgic. But from there it went downhill really fast. The plot COULD have been good, if it was used to develop the characters' personalities and not just to bring back characters that we knew and loved (Snape) or hated (Umbridge). Unfortunately, throughout the entire book, I felt like the personalities of every original character just fell flat. They were all brooding and had decided that work was more important than family, which is the opposite of how they acted in the original series, where they did everything they could to protect their families from Voldemort. Albus, for being the main character, was completely under-developed because they skipped through too many years of his early teenage-hood. They never even said why he was sorted into Slytherin when none of the rest of the Potters/Granger-Weasleys were, and that was a pivotal piece of information. It went from "Albus Severus Potter...SLYTHERIN" to "Albus can't get a broom off the ground and hates Quidditch" to "Albus is starting his fourth year at Hogwarts," all in the span of just a few pages. I think skipping so much of his early time at Hogwarts made him a very emotionless person who it's hard to connect your feelings with. Oddly enough, my favorite character was Scorpius, the offspring of one of the most-hated characters from the original series, because he actually had a chunk of the book devoted to getting to know him and showing his true colors; if every character had had that, I think I would have found a way to relate to them all better.<br/><br/>On top of the poor character development all-around, my biggest pet peeve was the idea that Voldemort could possibly have a child. The man whose life mission was never to love or show emotion to those around him would never have involved himself romantically with Bellatrix Lestrange, especially not enough to produce a child. And the idea that that child was born in the Malfoy Manor before the Battle of Hogwarts is ludicrous, because Draco knew nothing about her, and he would certainly have noticed Bellatrix's pregnancy and resulting child while he was living there during his 7th year, yet he was the most surprised of anyone by the revelation that Voldemort had a child. I understand needing a new villain for the story, but it would have been so much more believable if it was anyone but a child of Voldemort's.<br/><br/>*End spoilers*
 (no spoilers)<br/><br/>I avoided spoilers before reading this play, but went in having heard the storyline was absurd and that seeing the play was worth it for the effects and staging. I didn't have very high expectations going in, and I already knew the facts: it was a play that wasn't actually written by J.K. Rowling and it was most certainly not going to be Harry Potter #8.<br/><br/>That being said, I was quite frustrated when I finished reading. It took me less than 2 hours to read through this, and with each new twist I became increasingly confused as to how JKR could've approved this story. The characters have the same names as the ones in the HP series, and some of the magic is the same, but the play is completely inconsistent with canon. The characters seem like different people in many cases, and usually the version in the play is worse. For example, Ron is a worse version of movie-Ron. Things that were carefully detailed in the books are thrown away for gimmicks. Many aspects of the story come off as badly-executed fan service.<br/><br/>Maybe seeing the play would make this more tolerable, but the story itself isn't what you'd expect for the HP universe. If you feel like you should read the story out of completeness as an HP fan (which is why I bought the book), I'd recommend trying to borrow it from the library (or at least not paying full price for the hardcover edition).
 I too am a huge Harry Potter fan.  I have read every book and watched every movies multiple times.  I was so disappointed with this play. I love reading plays so that wasn't the problem.  The story itself was awful, boring, and so predictable.  I knew the minute the character was introduced that she was going to be the person who caused all the mess and it really wasn't even an interesting mess.  It was just not up to JK Rowling's writing standards -- I was quite shocked frankly that her name is on this.
 (Warning: Long Rant ahead).<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>1. SPOILER: There was a tie-in to the events of ‘Goblet of Fire’, which is my favourite of the books.<br/>2. SPOILER: There was a time travel aspect to the story which I’m a sucker for.<br/>3. There were patches of good dialogue. A few lines even had me laughing out loud.<br/>4. Some scenes did resonate emotionally for me, but, CON, I think it was more nostalgia from the books, rather than due to what was actually happening at the time.<br/>5. SPOILER: I enjoyed the friendship between Albus and Scorpius.<br/>6. SPOILER: I enjoyed any scene between Harry and Draco.<br/>7. There was one scene where Albus was smart, and that was the best part of the entire play.<br/>8. It probably would be a lot better performed live on stage. Well let’s hope so anyway!<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>1. In a script where you rely heavily on dialogue to convey everything, most of the dialogue was poor.<br/>2. New characters were one-dimensional.<br/>3. Fourteen year-olds spoke and acted a lot younger, for the most part anyway.<br/>4. It seems, Harry, Ron, and especially Hermione, have undergone personality transplants somewhere between ages eighteen and forty. I think Centaur, Bane, put it best in Act Two when he says to Harry, “You’ve grown older, but not wiser.” I couldn’t have put it better myself! Although, small PRO, they were more true to themselves in the last half of the play.<br/>5. There wasn’t a single scary moment throughout – not even when characters were in actual physical danger!<br/>6. The plot was predictable. I guessed the villain early on.<br/>7. SPOILER for the Third Scene, Act One: When Albus is sorted into Slytherin and quickly befriends Scorpius everyone acts like it’s the worst crisis ever. Now given everything Harry knew by the end of book seven, and given that he gave Albus Snape’s middle name, I would’ve thought he would’ve raised his kids to be more tolerant and accepting.<br/>8. Also, James, Lily, and Rose, were just plain old mean. I can’t condone this!<br/>9. This might be a bit nitpicky, but Scorpius used a lot of modern day slang, more so than any other character. Considering how Draco felt about Muggles, this seems odd to me.<br/><br/>End of rant!
 So I bought the book fully prepared to read it as a play. Having read and re-read all the books with my kids (as bedtime stories) I wondered how tired my voice would be with while I read as every character and honestly it wasn't very a tired at all seeing as how I simply couldn't read this the same way I read ANY of the previous books with them. This book is simply not in any way what we all hoped. It was exciting waiting for it and sadly We as a group were disappointed. I'd say buy it as a long time fan, buy it to know what happens but don't buy it if you are expecting any of the feeling you had reading any of the other books for the first time. Know it isn't (or doesn't feel or read like) a true Harry Potter story. It is simply missing the the essence that Rowling alone had infused in her previous books.
 Plain and simple- this should've never been written. Harry Potter was just so REAL to me before. This book just cheapened every character and the relationship I had with them. I feel duped, as though they said, "It's Harry Potter, of course they'll buy it!" I'm happier believing JK Rowling didn't actually have anything to do with this.
 Harry Potter. A character and a series that defines a generation. Having grown up alongside Harry, Ron, and Hermione, the Harry Potter series has been near and dear to my heart since I first picked up The Sorcerer's Stone. So when I learned that Harry Potter and the Cursed Child was going to be published for us to read, I was both happy and hesitant - happy to see what more might be done and hesitant to have the ending from Deathly Hallows changed in my mind.<br/><br/>As Harry and Ginny's son Albus first attends Hogwarts, the apprehension that Albus feels stems from his trying to live up to his father's reputation and expectations. When Albus befriends Scorpious Malfoy and gets sorted into Slytherin, he becomes more and more distant from his father, and Harry's temper eventually gets the best of him. When the opportunity arises that Albus can change the past, he takes it, not realizing the drastic and dark changes it could spark. Albus's actions bring back the pain in Harry's scar, leading him to fear the return of unspeakable evil and confront the consequences of his and his son's actions.<br/><br/>A play is a different beast than a novel, and it's always a touchy subject to revisit a cultural staple that played an integral part in people's childhoods, but this play that visits the famed 19 years later in the Harry Potter world does a good job of developing the characters, both new and old alike so that it still has that Harry Potter feel. Events took place a little too rapidly for my preference, and it was filled with areas in the plot that raised more questions than it answered, but it was an entertaining foray into life after we left the story.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd give it a 3.5 out of 5 stars.
 I am a very big fan of Harry Potter. I have read and re-read the entire series more times than I can count. I own 8 different sets of the books in a variety of formats so I always have access to them. I had been eagerly looking forward to reading this latest installment in the series and had pre-ordered my copy months ago. That said, words cannot describe how incredibly disappointed I was with this book. I knew it was not a novel. I had accepted that. In fact, that was the least of the problems in the reading. I knew that it was not written entirely by J.K. Rowling. I had, however, assumed (incorrectly, it seems) that since she had given her approval and blessing to the story that it was worthy of her name. I was sadly mistaken.  SPOILER ALERT  Having hoped for a reunion with all the old characters and perhaps an introduction to some new ones, I was very disappointed to see our old friends so flat and out of character. Yes, people change over time, but these were almost resembling the "Horcrux Harry and Horcrux Hermione" of the final book in the sense that they were similar to our characters yet horribly different. In this case, they were flat.  They acted and spoke in ways the original characters would never have done. Even the photo of Dumbledore was a caricature of his former self. I read the entire book, however, as I did, I found myself anxious to finish and dispose of it. Canon or no, this will not be joining my beloved sets of books.  I have seen fan fiction that is better than this.  Indeed, it is written like a poorly executed piece of fanfic. There were so many different ways the characters of Albus and Scorpius could have been developed. And why, after having lived in a magical world for so many years where people routinely lived to be hundreds of years old, are the characters dying so young?  We are led to believe that Malfoys are gone, that the parents of many of their former classmates are gone, that professors are gone. I do not understand why this has happened, and there is little in the way of explanation. Overall, I was very disappointed in the writing quality. Perhaps the stage version is richer and more detailed than what we see here, and I truly hope it is, but if given my choice at this moment, I certainly would not pay to see this performed.
 Absolute disappointment. I feel like I was duped.<br/><br/>I did very very little research on this. I knew it would be taking place 20 years down the road from the last books, and I knew it was technically just a screenplay, not an actual book. But I failed to realize it wasn't actually written by Rowling. I should have known, and I should have saved my money.<br/><br/>Being that it was a screenplay I originally wrote it off, knowing it would likely to let me down, it would lack the depth I wanted. But the hype of release reeled me in, and the endless ads spouting, "Harry Potter is back, read the eighth book", lead me to buy the kindle edition so I could read it immediately. Oh what an utter waste of money.<br/><br/>It is absolutely nothing like the originals, even if it was a proper book. None of the characters seem like themselves. I understand that they all have done some serious growing up, but it all seemed very out of touch. Only later did I find out that it would appear that Rowling didn't even have much of a hand in it. No wonder it sounded nothing like her originals. It really seemed like poor fan fic. It was so cheesy and childish, and just kept replaying old scenes, playing with time travel, making it so it was not original at all. It was so predictable. I kept trying to give it a break, telling myself that it's meant for the stage, it would probably be better there. But there were moments, that even on stage would have been terrible.<br/><br/>To me, it's clear Rowling did not have much of a hand in this. It can not be put in the same line as the other books, and should not be considered part of the series at all.<br/><br/>*** SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT ***<br/><br/>One of my biggest issues was the gift Harry decides to gift Albus. Why oh why would a teenage boy want his dad's ratty old baby blanket? Really? It was just clear that was in there for the plot later on. It didn't make any sense whatsoever.<br/><br/>So predictable. They go back in time to return and find one of their good friends was never born? How original. They go back in time to a dark world where evil prevailed? What a surprise. Never read a book where that sort of thing happened... Ugh. Lazy writing is what that is.<br/><br/>And the bit with the trolly witch on the train? No other kid, Serious Black even, couldn't get past her, but Albus and Scorpius (oh and really, that name, Scorpius? While I loved the character, that name... I couldn't get past it) were able to jump off really without any problems.<br/><br/>And come on. These two kids and a twenty year old girl could not have broken into Hermione's office and library so easily. Please. She was incredibly smart when she was a teenager. You are telling me, now, 20 years older, she doesn't have some impenetrable safe guards in place for her office? Or at least a more difficult riddle to crack. What a joke. She's smarter than that.<br/><br/>Further so, I don't think Harry would have been such a terrible dad. I understand he didn't really have a "dad" to look up to, to guide him in his own path of being a parent, but I don't think he would have been this d-bag dad.<br/><br/>And what was with Dumbledores breakdown? How awkward. Again, so out of touch with the original character.<br/><br/>I need to go back and read the good stuff to cleanse my pallet of this atrocity.
 SPOILER FREE<br/>There were so many bad decisions that went into making this it's hard to believe the person who wrote the finely crafted interlocking world of the original books was involved in any way.<br/>First, why on earth would you issue the final episode in the form of a play? People keep saying "well it's probably better on stage". Well, the fan base is an ardent worldwide group of novel readers. Choosing to only show the true version of the story to ONE room of people in one place at a time was a just a poor choice. Everyone else gets cold and frankly ridiculous sounding stage directions instead of pages of rich description from one of the greatest writers of the century.<br/><br/>Second, and much more importantly, this story line is so bad it's actually gut-wrenching. As a huge long time potter it was so hard and painful to read. I don't usually like being critical or snobbish about movies or books. I try to enjoy them for what they are and not dissect them 100 different ways. That being said this script was so full of plot holes and inconsistencies it's actually hard to believe JK ever read it. Books can and will be written about the problems with this story line. It is completely incompatible with the world the original 1~7 books established. I would provide examples but don't have it in me to open the book again. The motives and actions of many of the characters make absolutely no sense at all. The decisions of both the protagonists and the main villain are so absurd and illogical that the only explanation is plot convenience to take the audience to revisit an old story.<br/>It's so frustrating to see an almost perfect series, something which will live on as a classic; tarnished by what is essentially a polished turd.
 This is really the only review I have ever written on amazon, so that in and of itself is saying something. I first started reading Harry Potter when I was in middle school and I am 30 years old now. I picked this up hoping it would be comparable or 'exceed expectations,' if you would. I expected it to be different given this is in a script form, but what I didn't expect was the characters to be so unlike the characters we fell in love with in the original books...I will not add any spoilers except to say I wish there was a bit more originality in the plot!! I found everything to be boring, predictable, disappointing and poorly written!! I guess we have to take this for what it really is which is just a poorly written script and nothing else!!!
 i'm still processing. but if you didn't know this was a published play, how big of a fan could you possibly be? that was widely reported and also clearly printed on the book cover.<br/><br/>what can i say. there are a couple wonderful moments. and then there's the other 98%.<br/><br/>the thing is, there's entertainment value here. i'm sure the play is a good show. but it betrays the world and, in turn, the fans. the voices are off. the characters as well. i would have much rathered read a story about the attempt to thwart a time turner scheme than one that used them improperly. the world has rules, jo used to say that all the time.  i think the trend of her letting go is a bad one. i hope to hell she writes the other fantastic beasts sequels.
 I am sure J.K. Rowling did not write this.  Perhaps she was paid off to lend her name to this,  Why?  She doesn't need the money, so why let her characters be butchered this way?<br/>  Nothing in this awful play is like the great series.  Hagrid brought a Happee Birthday cake not a Happy Birthday cake.  The Minister of Magic is the Minister of Magic NOT the Minister for Magic.  Harry is nothing like Harry in the book and the warmness of Harry and Albus  at the end of Harry Pottter #7 rang true,  however the cold relationship between them in the play was.....  just not authentic.  Nothing in this mess is like the books,  every plot development is wrong.<br/>  This play was so bad I couldn't even read the entire thing.  Halfway through I ended my torture by skipping to the end,  then skimming the part I left out.  Ugh!  It never gets better.  I can't tell you the hundreds of things that were horribly wrong because it would all be spoilers.  My advice is to skip this book,  or at least borrow it from the Library so that you don't feel as bad as I do for spending good money for it.
 Harry Potter and the Cursed Child by John Tiffany &amp; Jack Thorne, based on the original story by J. K. Rowling is actually a script for theatre. This is the story of an adult Harry Potter and primarily his son, Albus and his best friend, Scorpius (Draco's son). It deals with parenting, expectations and time travel. In my mind, this one was nowhere near as good as any of the others in the Harry Potter series.  It was mostly nostalgic in that it revisits the Triwizard Tournament from Goblet of Fire and some old characters make an appearance.<br/><br/>I did not like:<br/><br/>  The plot with Delphi was completely out of the blue and really didn't seem possible, so the book seemed corny.<br/><br/>  I really missed J. K. Rowling's writing!<br/><br/>  The grown versions of Harry, Hermione and Ron were dull and seemed like totally different people. (Harry ordering Prof. McGonagall around seemed very out of character and that's just one example of many.)<br/><br/>  Harry had three children, but James and Lily are barely even mentioned.  Same with Ron and Hermione's son, barely mentioned.<br/><br/>  It lacks the humor the other Harry Potter books had and just didn’t make enough sense to be good.  (This one only had a couple funny parts--Hermione's daughter Rose was a bright spot and Ron was still kind of funny but it seemed forced.)<br/><br/>I liked:<br/><br/>  Draco and his son, Scorpius.<br/><br/>  That it is a quick read and wasn't bored with it or felt I was plowing through.<br/><br/>  Harry and his son Albus coming to understand each other--heartwarming.<br/><br/>  Ron and Hermione's daughter, Rose, because she takes after Hermione.<br/><br/>If I had to sum it up in one word, it would be blah. I would not recommend buying this book and wish I had used the money I spent on it for something else.  Get it from the library and save your money.  If you read it not expecting it to be good like the others, then you probably will enjoy it, somewhat.
 The playwright(s) didn't handle whatever source material J.K Rowling had well enough to justify the creation of this script. It read like a teenage fanfic, and I've read young adult fanfic that can rival this strained and completely unbelievable mess. One might say the one star is for not following my idea of how the HP kids turned out, but it's not. The one star is for the badly written script that, hopefully, the actors have managed to save, but it doesn't change its unbelievability in characters and their choices.
 I'm true Harry Potter fan and I can not accept this. I wish I didn't read it my memory stays with Deathly Hollow.<br/>In the half of the book I was still waiting to see something is gonna change and with a huge twist I will love it. It didn't happen.<br/><br/>First of all, all the old characters lost their identity. They are not our Harry, Hermoine and Ron. There is huge change on Draco's being.<br/><br/>And Story was not exciting at all. It was all cliché.<br/><br/>I don't accept the fact that because of this is play it needs to support by actual play. When I read Shakespeare, I never needed to see play to understand characters' struggle, joy or regrets.<br/><br/>I suggest you not buy or read this book if you want your HP memories stays how they are right now.
 I'd give this cheesy bit of silly fan fiction zero stars if that were an option. If J K Rowling really had a hand in this, then she's sold out because this is so bad, so camp, so UN -Potter, it's unbelievable. I don't mind that it's a play script; that's fine and doesn't interfere in any way.  But the "plot" isn't a celebration of magic, it's a mess; the machinations of a mind not in tune with the Potter world at all.  One gets the impression that this Jack What's-His-Name - the "creator"- never read the books and either doesn't care for the Potter characters or resents Rowling's creativity and success because he seems to delight in twisting the characters as we've known them into unrecognizablely silly plot devises.  As I said - this is nothing more than fan fiction, and poorly written at that. This reads more like the literary attempts of a 14 year old fan girl.  A best seller?  Of course - because Potter fans were cynically manipulated into expecting something vetted by Rowling to be quality.  Instead we got ripped off by a piece of crap using the names of characters we love.  Fooled us once, Ms Rowling, but it won't happen twice. You owe us a sincere apology.
 I almost didn’t read thing because the reviews were so harsh, but the plot on wiki sounded like something I wanted to happen since book one. This epic story comes in the form of a play manuscript and leaves much up to the imagination! If you are strong with your own HP imagery, then this will be a pleasure to read. It will take a couple of chapters to get used to the format, no doubt, but press on! Just when you think you have it figured out, there is a plot twist I had not seen coming.<br/>As a writer, I become skeptical when authors don’t push plots to their full interest. This story reveals layer by layer a question I have been asking for eons: “What would happen if Potter got sorted into Slytherin?” But then it goes a step further than you can imagine. This is all I can say without revealing spoilers about this spellbinding book. The whole cast and crew is present to assist with an epic tale. Prepare yourself for the ride of a lifetime and (PLEASE) don’t knock it till you’ve tried it.
 I cannot say there was any part of this book that sent me back to the HP world that I know and love. I knew this was a script and not going to be in book form. That wasn't it. I was okay with that part. My imagination is good enough to fill in those blanks. I knew it wasn't written by JK herself. That someone else wrote it and she approved it. My thoughts where that SHE KNOWS HER CHARACTERS and if she approved it that it would be spot on.<br/><br/>I am not here  to say that I know the Harry Potter characters better than JK. That is ridiculous in my opinion. They are her creation after all. Some say that this book/play isn't in "canon". That anything outside the 7 books don't fit in this world. That is also far-fetched to me. This world and this canon are JK's. If she wants Harry to grow up, dress in drag, and date Peeves (non of that happened btw), she can! It is in canon and part of that world. This world is JK's after all. W are only lucky to be part of it.<br/><br/>I am here to say that I have my own thoughts on what characters would and would not say. That there were some things that the main people said and did that just blew me away. Not in a good way. There is one main thing that Harry Potter says that, in my opinion and I feel most everyone else's, he would never ever ever ever say. Never! By the time I got to that part of the story, I was already put off.<br/><br/>The characters apparently grow up and become completely different people. Say and do things they would never do in my opinion. They all but forget Harry and Ginny's other two kids. There are two stand out points in the book. They are interesting but lacking. The idea of this story line is great. Which I feel like is JK's part to this story. The writing itself and the character development is awful.<br/><br/>The story itself bounces around all over the place. They drag one beloved character from the past through the mud. Harry smacks close to the Harry we loved to hate in Order of the Phoenix. The moody and annoyingly "why me" Harry. Ginny reminds me a lot of Molly in the book. There is no mention of George. Ron is the closest to the Ron that I imagined. Hermione grows up and reverts back to the pre-troll version of herself. Albus Potter needs a good smack and I actually like Draco's boy, Scorpious. I cannot say that it was this way for everyone else. I kept expecting something to happen between Albus and Scorpious.<br/><br/>Don't go in expecting this to be a wonderful addition, THE 8th book in the Harry Potter world. They could have given us this information in a post on Pottermore and I wouldn't have been as disappointed. You will be able to tell pretty early in that this was NOT WRITTEN BY JK. It feels more like a fan-fiction. With that in mind, I've actually read fan-fiction that was so much better than The Curse Child is. The main characters in this book apparently grow up to become other people. There is weird things added in like dragging people through the mud, time turners that don't make sense, and hand grenade pumpkin pasties...yeah. You read that right. Think "Anything off the trolley" and then the sweet old lady growing spike and throwing exploding pumpkin sweets....weird. Just plain weird.<br/><br/>I wanted to much for this to be amazing. I think that is why I went to bed this morning wholly disappointed. I feel that the only positive thing this story had was taking me back to my childhood. Reminding me of midnight releases and the wonderful anticipation of a new story. It failed miserably in everything else.<br/><br/>Should you buy it and read it? Yes. I think if you love the Harry Potter stories or have read them then you should read this as well. It does add to the stories. It was fun to see them all grown up. There is no other reason to read it. It isn't fantastic or a great piece of literature.
 I wanted to love this. I've been eagerly anticipating it since it was announced. And I tried to talk myself into liking it the entire time I read it. But there are just too many problems.<br/><br/>First, I realize this is a play—just stage directions and scene notes and dialogue. So right off you're not going to get the beautiful, rich prose of J. K. Rowling. And it will be clipped—there isn't time in a play (even a 5 hour, two-part play) for all of the little details that Rowling is able to weave together in her novels. But this felt like bad fan-fiction. Most scenes were 1 1/2 to 3 pages long. Things jumped all over the place and felt disjointed. A play was definitely not the right forum for this story.<br/><br/>Second, characters did and said things that are inconsistent with the characters Rowling gave us in her seven books. I did not believe most of the characters.<br/><br/>Third, the plot kept getting more twisted and convoluted and soap opera-y. The structure, symbolism, and relatability of the seven books were thrown out the window.<br/><br/>On a positive note, there were some redeemable themes that we come to expect and love from J. K. Rowling. Themes of love, trust, acceptance, and redemption are touched upon. I loved the fact of the central, unexpected friendship. I didn't love the journey they took, but the fact of the friendship was beautiful to me. And there was more understanding and acceptance at the end.<br/><br/>Overall I'm glad I read it. But I probably won't need to read it again. And I definitely don't count this work as Harry Potter canon. I'll stick with the original, amazing seven books.
 SPOILERS<br/><br/>Upon reading "Harry Potter and the Cursed Child," I can only assume that Jack Thorne lived under a rock until quite recently, and has never been exposed at all to the mythos of the Wizarding World beyond its Wikipedia page, and yet somehow, by some unknown magic of his own, he managed to con J. K. Rowling into singing off on a half-backed Potterverse rip-off of the Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode "Dopplegangland." That is the only way I can justify the grossly out-of-character depictions of no less than Ron, Voldemort, Snape, and Harry himself. No character and no event is sacred, and all are trod upon with equal abandon. A supremely disappointing addition to this series that I will just pretend does not exist altogether.
 I have to say this was disappointing. Most of the script reads like fanfiction and is basically a rehash of the original books. There is very little that is original or creative. While the concept  of the plot was briefly interesting, issues were quickly resolved without making use of anything new within the Harry Potter universe. The writing is not complex or layered, possibly because of the screenplay format.  It is also ridiculous and childish writing to have most the main characters married, still in contact with another, and their offspring named after former favorite characters. I cringed reading most of this and would not want to watch it as a play.
 I was shocked when I opened Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. It wasn't a book with lovely prose at all; it was a script--for a movie!  I was annoyed. My first reaction was to retrieve the shipping box from the trash, repack it and send it back.  I sent my spouse to do just that while I checked the book out again on Amazon and saw the description I had missed when I placed the order.  My bad.  I checked to see if there was a novel of this eighth book. There was not.  The 'rehearal' script for the upcoming movie was all there was.  I opened the book to see if I could tolerate the read.  I could. Though I felt punked, I decided to keep the book, skip the movie and write this review.  I'll give it one star; it is in book form.
 Feels like a money grab to profit off the Harry Potter phenomenon. Lazy and poorly written story. No character or plot development to speak of. Its like they throw every past Harry potter character into it to make you feel fake nostalgia. I understand this is a script for the play. Maybe the play will rely on the practical effects of magic and time travel to revel the audience because the story stinks.
 I'm a huge Harry Potter fan, but I couldn't get through a third of this play. This clearly isn't written by Rowling. The characters are nothing like they were in the books and the writing itself is very weak. Do yourself a favor, don't buy this book and save $15. Go read the other Harry Potter novels or anything else by Jk or any other author.
 I'm just so disappointed. I'm finding it difficult to find the words.<br/><br/>Obligatory remarks: I have loved Harry Potter for 20 years. I'm reading the books to my daughter, I have read the 7 books more times than I can count, I have led my students in countless discussions and debates about the books over the last 15 years. I also read more Harry Potter fan fiction than is normal or healthy. I've read every possible scenario of what happens to these characters after the canon books.<br/><br/>I was so excited about the Cursed Child that I could barely sleep this week. I knew it was a script, I knew Jo didn't write it. But I was excited. Now, I'm bummed.<br/><br/>******I WILL NOW BE SUPER SPOILERY:<br/><br/>SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS<br/><br/>Things I liked:<br/><br/>-Albus is a Slytherin! Yay!! This was my one wish for this book, along with hoping Scorpius wasn't the antagonist.<br/>-Scorpius. I'm a huge fan of all things Malfoy. Seriously, Draco Malfoy is my favorite character. I'm pleased with how Scorpius was written in the play. The rumor that he is Voldy's son? Brilliant.<br/>-There were times when I could really see the original Ron and Ginny in their characters here. Not often, but occasionally.<br/>-Who wouldn't like to see Snape again?<br/>-I'm glad to see that Harry is struggling with his experiences. Let's face it, with all he's been through, he would definitely have PTSD. The epilogue in Deathly Hallows always struck me as a little too "shiny happy."<br/><br/>The disappointments:<br/><br/>-Time moves too quickly, and we get almost superficial glimpses of why both Albus and Scorpius are struggling in school. I would have much preferred for the story to focus more on their experiences at Hogwarts. With Rose as the antagonist with a Malfoy prejudice? That would have been great. Truly great. And unexpected.<br/><br/>-Slytherin. On a deep, gut level, I've needed Albus to be a Slytherin. I've always been troubled by the portrayal of Slytherin House in both the books and the movies. They are the Evil House. Why, WHY would Hogwarts condone the sorting of a quarter of the school into Death Eater training grounds? If Salazar Slytherin was so evil and essentially a racist, why does Hogwarts still have a Slytherin House? And what is the message to the students who are sorted into Slytherin? "You're evil, kid. Enjoy being a Death Eater!"<br/><br/>Wasn't the takeaway in Books 1-7 that we shouldn't judge Slytherins unfairly? Draco actually saved Harry by not "recognizing" him at the Manor. Narcissa saved Harry by being brave enough to lie to Voldemort. Snape is by far the bravest, most extraordinary character in the series. And let's not forget Regulus Black, who knowingly sacrificed his life at a young age in order to destroy ONE Horcux and give others a chance to finish the job. Slytherin more than redeemed itself in the series. And the epilogue reinforces this when Harry tells Albus that it's okay to be in Slytherin. I knew in 2007 that Albus HAD to be a Slytherin. Surely the House system has changed by the time he goes to school? Surely Hogwarts is sorting students on their qualities and recognizing that all four Houses are valid and none are evil? Surely Hogwarts would rather abandon the House system than continue to train dark wizards in Slytherin?<br/><br/>Yes, in The Cursed Child, my dream came true and Albus was sorted into Slytherin. And he became best of friends with Scorpius, just like I had hoped. But there is no redemption for Slytherin to be found. The Slytherin kids continue to be jackasses, even to "their own." They bully Albus and Scorpius. We are never for a second shown that Albus possesses Slytherin qualities, nor are we shown that many people can possess the Slytherin traits (cunning, shrewdness, leadership skills) and still be a good person. This play just reinforces the same old Slytherin prejudices. There was an opportunity to redeem Slytherin, and it was lost. Spectacularly.<br/><br/>-Everyone else has said it and I will say it, too: Time-Turners. No. Just...no. There was plenty of material possible without having to revisit the "greatest hits" dates of the original series. How convenient that the play ends on October 31, 1981. It's Back to the Future. And not in a good way. I actually groaned when I saw the date. And again, not in a good way. Not to mention that Time-Turners have always been self-fulfilling; they are a closed loop, if you will. We've never seen them change anything. Going back in time always happened. Essentially, when you go back in time, you're only doing what you've ALREADY done. In Azkaban, Harry and Hermione always were there- they didn't change anything. They didn't change time. They just repeated what they had already done. We also have never seen anyone "go back" with a Time-Turner. They just catch up with the present.<br/><br/>Are you telling me that there are no other stories to tell? There are- fanfic is full of better ideas that don't involve traveling through time (and don't get me started on the fact that a canon Time-Turner can't travel that far back.) I was hoping this would be a Hogwarts fic, maybe interspersed with Harry dealing with his issues. Maybe even Snape wasn't dead. In canon, we never see a body after the fact, not a grave, or a funeral. A search for Snape would have made my heart so happy. But maybe I read too much fanfic. There are logical ways to make that happen, too. Draught of Living Death, always carrying Nagini's antivenin with him, etc. Or, barring that, what if Snape's portrait was included instead? Albus befriending the portrait at Hogwarts? Portrait Snape as Albus's mentor and advisor? Sign me up.<br/><br/>-Cedric. Where do I start with Cedric? I'll start here: how convoluted is it to imagine that Cedric living would have resulted in Harry's death and Voldy's success? There is no chance that this is where Delphi would have started, prophecy or no. No chance. If I had the ability to travel through time, and I wanted Voldemort to win, I would not start with Cedric Diggory. I would have started with convincing V not to attempt to kill Harry. (I know she gets there eventually, but it's a Plan B.) I would have traveled to another time and killed Harry. Or prevented the destruction of a Horcrux. Or talked V into changing a Horcrux into something less obvious. Or talked him out of taking Nagini to the final battle. Or corrupted Harry into joining V instead. The possibilities are endless. But saving Cedric is not on that list. It's not. It can't be defended. It's a HUGE coincidence that saving Cedric would cause him to become a Death Eater. And logically, Delphi would have not known this or even considered the possibility. The "prophecy" was a ridiculous, clearly last-minute addition in order to lend some credibility to going back to the Triwizard Tournament. But we know Cedric. There's not a chance that he would become a Death Eater. He's the most loyal, fair-minded character in the entire series. It's not even slightly believable.<br/><br/>-There's a second Time-Turner? What?? It's like the second launch device in Contact. I know I'm mentioning too much fanfic, but seriously, there are better amateur stories. And better HP time travel stories out there. JK destroyed all the Time-Turners for a reason during Order of the Phoenix. So they wouldn't ex machina the entire story. Are there really no other ideas?? Here's one: Harry being the Master of Death creates some interesting possibilities. I know he destroys the Elder Wand, but maybe he still is the Master of Death as the last owner of the Hallows? Wouldn't that be a better story? Harry discovering he can't die? Or maybe gifted with special powers from Death?<br/><br/>-We come to the worst of all. Voldemort has a child. Voldemort. Has. A. Child. It's hard to write that, because that's ridiculous. It's dumber than what most 12-year-old fanfic authors would come up with. It's rehashing the same old tired storylines, a problem that plagues most sequels. "But this time, Voldy's a hot chick!" Not to mention, the logistics of her birth are impossible to believe. This means that Bellatrix was heavily pregnant at Easter, when she tortured Hermione at the Manor. Also, who would have returned to the Manor after the final battle to find a baby? Well, logically, the Malfoys would have. So Draco should know, at the very least. If we insist on this storyline of V's baby, I would have preferred (by a LOT) that Scorpius really was Voldemort's kid. We all knew from the beginning that he wasn't, because we all just knew the story wouldn't have gone that way. What an awesome shock it might be to have Draco produce the second Time-Turner and explain that the rumors are true! And how does Scorpius deal with that? How would his friendship with Albus have progressed? How would Harry feel about his son in any kind of relationship with Voldy's kid? See? It's a more intriguing story than what we were given.<br/><br/>-Lack of complexity. Books 1-7 were brilliantly constructed, with hints of what was to come almost from the beginning. The Cursed Child is not complex. There is no challenge. I love reading to my 7-year-old and exploring those complexities in the first 7 books. It's work for her, but ultimately worth it. TCC is formulaic and lacking the depth and cleverness of the originals. Hermione puts simple riddles on her bookshelf to hide the Time-Turner? Really? That's only one example!<br/><br/>-I know that this next point is the ultimate fanfic reader hang-up. Let's face it: everyone's gay in fanfic. But I believe I know why, or at least why I enjoy it. Fanfic is the best chance to see how little changes might affect a well-known story and well-known characters. What if Harry were sorted into Slytherin? What if Voldemort didn't bring Nagini to the final battle? What if Lily died but James didn't? What if Sirius didn't go after Peter in '81 and had the chance to raise Harry? These sorts of hypothetical situations are the cornerstone of good fanfic. And they are why fanfic exists, to be honest- to see the ripples in the pond that little changes can make. I think this is why everyone is gay in fanfic. It brings up some interesting ideas: If Harry had a crush on Draco, how would that have affected Sixth Year? Or if Harry had been in a relationship with Cedric, how would that have changed the Triwizard Tournament? Would he have personally tried to save Cedric after the fact? Love and relationships are the big, pivotal plot points in most stories on the planet. Changing relationships up helps us see different possibilities in a well-worn story. It's a fun exercise!<br/><br/>I say the above because I want you all to be aware that I am not some fanfic-crazy woman who wants all the characters to be gay. I just like the mental exercise of imagining how little changes affect the entire story. When I heard that the Cursed Child would be about Albus, and then I saw the pictures of Scorpius, I pretty instantly hoped first that they would be friends, and then I wondered how them being more than friends could affect the characters (Harry and Draco can handle being civil, but could they be in-laws?) And I almost got my wish. Scorpius seemed to have deeper feelings. It is expressly written that he has issues with Albus flirting with Delphi. That he was jealous. I know Dumbledore is gay. But come on- they can't be afraid to insinuate that at least a few people in the wizarding world are gay. Statistically, many of them should be. At least leave it ambiguous, like with Dumbledore. Instead, they have to include at the very end that Scorpius likes Rose. Rose, the least interesting character in the whole damn play. And that's saying something.<br/><br/>Final Thoughts:<br/>I suspect that the play itself is spectacular. The acting, the costumes, the sets, the special effects, all of them are most likely breathtaking and divert from the plot issues. But reading just the script exposes all the issues. We have no opportunity to be distracted by the spectacle. That's why I think releasing this was a huge mistake.<br/><br/>I'm worried that this has tainted the first books for me. I don't want to read Goblet of Fire and picture Albus and Scorpius (and Scorpius 2) there during all three tasks. Ultimately, this story adds nothing, only subtracts. There must be literally thousands of stories in the wizarding world to tell. I'm so disappointed that JK signed off on a story that included Time-Turners, events from Books 1-7, and Voldemort 2. It's poorly-constructed fanfic that we now are forced to accept as canon.<br/><br/>I wish this all hadn't happened. I was enjoying picturing what the whole gang was doing now. Now that I know, I wish I didn't know. I'm going to go back to better stories. I'm going to eat my feelings and pretend it didn't end like this.
 I feel like The Cursed Child is a very polarizing work. You either love it or you hate it. Given that Harry Potter is such an important part of so many people's lives, the reaction is understandable. I'm very sad to say that I'm firmly in the negative camp.<br/><br/>I wanted to love TCC so much. I was so excited to see an extension to one of my favorite stories. I remember how exciting it was, back in the day, to wait for new Harry Potter books to come out and then devour them in one night, screaming and cheering and crying as these characters I loved so much made their way through their world. I wanted so badly to experience even a sliver of that feeling once again. I picked up the Kindle version of the book with hesitant excitement -- finally, I would get to know just how everybody fared in the end.<br/><br/>The answer to that question was: poorly. Now, I realize that JKR only had a slight hand in this manuscript. It really shows. So many characters felt stilted or wrong. The dialog, which should have been the book's shining light, fell flat most of the time. I tried to imagine it being read out loud by skilled actors and that only made it slightly more palatable. The majority of the new characters felt as flat and undeveloped as a newborn Sim, random attributes thrown together in the hopes that something would stick and come alive. The only exception, for me, was Scorpius, who still managed to have a bit of a heartbeat despite the lousy writing surrounding him.<br/><br/>The story was also silly. It was a silly story. It read like try-hard fanfiction to me, like a soup with too many ingredients. One particular twist in the story was so unbelievable -- in a bad way -- that I found myself staring up from my book on the subway, as if on The Office, gaping at an imaginary camera. I have since read impassioned defenses of this twist that have convinced me that there may, in fact, have been the slightest sliver of canonical defense for it, but, no, it still read as ludicrous to me and completely out of harmony with the world of the original seven books.<br/><br/>In short -- I did not enjoy TCC, but you might, and I hope you do. For many reasons, it didn't work for me.
 ,,,but all we have is the  script, which had some good basic ideas that flubbed in the execution. While I am sure the actual show is spectacular with amazing special effects, this has such ham-fisted dialog and plain dumb errors,such as when out of the all the people who had brewed polyjuice in the room, no one seemed to remember *how excruciatingly long it took to brew it*and THAT might be a reason that it's not immediately available. A lot of the rules that JKR had created for her world just were willy-nilly set aside with some sort of glib attempt at explanation. It just didn't satisfy and part of it reminded me of some fanfiction stories I had rolled my eyes at. There were some redeeming factors, such as the true friendship between characters that would in the previous Potterverse have been destined for hate, seeing some familiar characters step into maturity, and seeing Harry struggle with his legacy. But overall, this didn't do that much for me.
 I feel empty and let down.  I have no issue with the format, I've read many plays, the story lacked feeling for me.
 I doubt J.K. Rowling needed the extra income, and she certainly did not need this to add to her fame. The co-authors were palpably the main authors of this play, and they were riding Rowling's coattails. I love the Harry Potter books, and have found them witty, imaginative, clever, engaging, and often profound. They certainly have the potential to become lasting classics in literature, even if there are some inconsistencies and less than stellar passages in them. I also like to read stage plays, not just watching them performed on stage. I remember reading Shakespeare's plays right before attending performances - and both the reading and the performances were enjoyable in their own rights. Thus, I have no problem with the format of the story "HP &amp; the Cursed Child."<br/><br/>My problem is with the contrived story line, the character representation (in Ron's case it was particularly a misrepresentation, in light of the original series), the absence of Rowling's usual linguistic creativity, the dominantly bland lines, and that the play failed to add to the overall HP Universe. This is particularly disturbing because a typical HP book was a learning experience for the young readers: the story had deep and consistent moral message, which is missing here. In fact, the book rings hollow. Deathly hollow...<br/><br/>I would rather neglect that this book is part of the official canon, and treat it as a mediocre unauthorized fan fiction. That would keep the integrity of the neatly complete 7-book series. With writing like this, Harry Potter would have never become a mega hit.<br/><br/>Just one SPOILER here: Albus and Scorpius want to notify Harry about their location (time and place). Thus, they create a message they know would wind up in Harry's hands and be revealed to him in the future. To be clear, the idea (in a different version and obviously without magic) was used in Isaac Asimov's "The End of Eternity." I don't know whether the authors were aware of Asimov's fiction, but it is certainly one of the better known time travel novels. So, this "major punchline" in the story was rather predictable and unoriginal.
 Honestly, I am a long-time Potterhead. These books came out as I was growing up. I aged with the Trio. I stood in line for midnight book releases. I WANTED to like this. I really did! But....I don't. I really did not enjoy it. With it's script format, it was a quick read in a single afternoon. That wasn't an issue for me as I'm familiar with script format. It was the story itself that got to me. It felt like it took all the happiness of the original books and epilogue, pulled it out of you, threw it in the mud, stomped on it, and shoved the mess back in where your fond memories were. It is not fun. It is depressing. It feels more like crappy fanfiction rather than a JK Rowling story. The fact that she is not the sole writer is very clear here. I really wonder how much she contributed herself beyond checking it over and putting her name on it. There were cannon errors and characters acted out of their norm (even given the fact they are now adults). Honestly, if I could Obliviate this from my memory and end with book 7, I'd be happy. It changes your reflection on the original books.
 I bought this book when it first came out, but then never read it because of the mixed (bad) reviews. Maybe it was because I came in with such low expectations or maybe it was just because it's a great story, but I loved it. Yes, it's different from the original books. It's more character and dialogue driven, it is a script afterall, and because it's a script we miss out on some of the details that help really bring a story to life.  Also, it's a little more mature, Harry and the gang are forty now and some of the jokes kids won't relate to. But I don't think this story is really for children. Many of us grew up with Harry Potter, but now we're adults. This book deals heavily in relationships, mainly between fathers and sons and I think it did a great job. I know that many people were mad with how Harry acts towards Albus, but if there is one thing this book teaches us is learning that those you love aren't perfect. Though this book differs from the first seven it still has the components that made those seven great; adventure, heart and friendship. Also guys, it has time travel. Let me repeat, time- butterfly effect- travel. Which helps to tie it back into the world of the first seven books. The while time I was readibg it I thought; I can't wait to see how they do this on stage.
 It did not do the original HP characters justice. There were many times the characters betrayed their true identities, by behaving in ways they would have normally never acted. Ron was made into a babbling, head over heels idiot and Hermoine was not her head strong, intelligent self that we have come to love and accept throughout the series. Harrys character was acceptable, although I would have loved to have seen him be an aurora. With the new characters, there was weak character development and the plot was very predictable. As a long time Potter fan, this script was a disappointment and should not be remotely considered the 8th book to an amazing series.
 So let me make this as clear as can be. Harry grows up to be a bad father and a bit of a jerk, Ron is an idiot and Hermione raises a hateful bully? The writing is just so bad. So silly. It's like a high school sophomore wrote the dialogue. The hogwarts express trolley witch has claws and polices the train now?! What?! So ridiculous.<br/>  I truly believe if JK Rowling has written this story by herself the result would've kept with the beauty and wonderment of the Harry Potter universe. BUT as she did not, this miserable embarrassment of a story is something that I am chalking up as an insult to the Harry Potter character and dumping from my memory.<br/>  Of course some JK Rowling sheep will love it and cheer for a encore but the reality of it is that the three wonderfully amazing children who saved the world and banded together grew up to be stupid, hateful adults who speak like 12 year olds? I sincerely hope not. Maybe the next play will feature another time turner and make it so this one never happened.
 I just... I can't understand how JKR thought this would be a great conclusion to the story we all lived and breathed. I know she hasn't penned most of the play and that shows (really really shows) but I issue is how did she let them blemish the legacy in such a silly and almost immature manner. It's literally like the people who worked on this script didn't understand Harry Potter through ages. They just had some material but it wasn't a living thing for them. I swiped page to page hoping things would pick up. It didn't. The way they changed certain intricate attributes of the trio.. it's unforgivable. I mean the Starkids play on Harry Potter (how much ever they were made for laughs) stayed true to the Harry Potter spirit than this play/script. I do not have an issue that it was in the play format. My issue is this script is about a group of people who are in the Wizarding World that we all love, but they surely aren't anyone we know, understand or love. JKR, don't let it end like this please.
 My favorite thing from the original books is they brought to life a beautiful and mysterious world. This... Did not. I suppose if you saw the play, it might feel magical, but just reading the script is dry. And the dialogue is cheesy. It's not naturally flowing at all. At no point did I get "the feels."<br/><br/>The story is also a one trick wonder. The entire plot revolves around one piece of magic, used over and over again. The jokes also get recycled over and over again. It was like a very long MacGyver episode... Everything works out at the last second, and not in a way that would stir emotion.<br/><br/>If you just want to catch up with Harry and the gang, this book is fine. If you wanted to go home to a beautiful, deep, magical world, forget about it.
 I have been reading Harry Potter since the first book came out and am a huge fan. I loved the books and read them at least 5 times each (probably more). I wanted to like this book but it was really hard for me to finish because it was so bad. I used to read the original Harry Potter books nonstop until I finished them. I read the last book for 10 hours straight and that was around 900 pages. It's two weeks after I got this book and I can't even get myself to finish the last 50 pages of this book. It's obviously not written by JK Rowling and the whole story is ridiculous. The rules that JK Rowling set up for going back in time in the Prisoner of Azkaban somehow don't apply in this book. Ron and Harry don't even appear to be the same characters. Ron somehow turned really funny and Harry is a bad dad that doesn't understand his kid. The Harry that I know from the original books would have got to know his kid and his kid wouldn't resent him for no reason. Also, there's NO WAY that Voldemort would have had a kid. He couldn't love and I cant imagine him liking anyone touching him. This book feels like fantasy when the other books felt real. I hope that JKR contributed very little to this because of how poorly it is written. If she contributed even 5% of this storyline, I am very disappointed in how this story of Harry's life and his children's life are going. If JKR wanted to create a play, she should have done a story about the Marauders at Hogwarts or during the first war against Voldemort. She could have even done a story about the Harry's kids at Hogwarts facing other evils but to create a child of Voldemort feels fake and like the story just needed a villain and used almost the same one as all the other books. I am very disappointed. I wish this book had never come out at this point because it puts a damper on the original books. I'm going to live in denial and pretend that this didn't come out and this isn't the future for the Wizarding World. As far as I am concerned, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows concluded the story and Harry's scar never hurt again. All was well and should have stayed well.
 I had not the greatest expectations in this book after reading the terrible reviews, however I decided to purchase it and read it against the odds, to find myself stucked in half way thought the book asking myself "why, why are you reading this"? My hunger for more Harry Potter Sagas blinded my logic and now I'm here writting a bad review about the book " that should not be named". How on earth this book got published? Harry potter saga books are well written, with an engaging plot and characters. This book could have had so much potential if it was written by JK Rowling. But it was not the case. The characters are nothing like the original ones. Sound different, act different and just doesn't make any sense. The only interesting thing about this book is the relationship between the two kids. Maybe the writers had a good idea but the execution of the book is poorly. Sorry.
 This was such a disappointment.  I'm honestly wondering how much input J.K. Rowling even had in writing this.  The characters were out of character, the plot was awful, the dialogue was bad. I didn't even care that it was written in play form.  I felt like I was reading a bad fan fiction written by some 12 year old.  I don't recommend this to any fans of Harry Potter.
 First I’m going to start with the obligatory comments about how much I love Harry Potter and the world J.K. Rowling created. The first HP book was published in the US when I was in 6th grade and the same age as Harry. My mom, a children’s librarian at the time, saw the book at the Scholastic Book Fair. (Remember those? I hope they still have them!)<br/><br/>She, sensing this book was going to be great, picked it up and gave it to me. As a 6th grader, I felt too grown up for what looked like a kid’s book, so it sat for a few months on my bedside table (which doubled as a bookcase). Then, one night, I couldn’t sleep. I’d finished whatever book I was reading and had nothing else lined up. It was very late and I was getting desperate. So I grabbed the closest book, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone, and started reading. And did not stop until I finished the book. My first-ever all-nighter!<br/><br/>The next year, when the second book came out, I was in England. At that time, the books were published in the UK long before they came out in the US. All my classmates got to read the book when I returned from my trip, months before it finally came out in our country. I was super popular for a while.<br/><br/>The following year, my mom was in Scotland and found the third book. After that, they started publishing the books at the same time in different countries. And my family stopped travelling to the UK. By that time, the damage was done. I was completely hooked on Harry Potter.<br/><br/>Needless to say, when the series ended, I was devastated. Of course I wanted to know how it was all going to end, but I didn’t want it to end.<br/>So years later, when I learned about this play, I started to feel some of that old excitement again.<br/><br/>Now, let me preface my review with the assurance that I knew I was getting a script and not a novel. I have a degree in Theater as well as English, so I knew what I was getting into.<br/><br/>When you read a play, you have to create a lot of the atmosphere yourself. Rowling does an amazing job of this in her novels, but you don’t have that luxury when reading a script. The stage directions will give you some clues, but for the most part, it is up to you to imagine the story.<br/><br/>With that said, this play must be a visual phenomenon. There is a production credit for “Illusions and Magic” (and an “Illusions and Magic Associate”). The directions and some of the lines make it obvious this play is visually astounding. (The old stage manager in me would love to see this play from a technical perspective).<br/><br/>However, my beef with this play is twofold: 1. the story and 2. the characters.<br/><br/>First, the story. As many other people have said before me, the plot of the play reads like fanfiction and not as something from the mind of Rowling.<br/>image<br/><br/>Using time-travel as a plot device seems lazy. There was a reason Rowling had all the time-turners destroyed in the fifth book. Using time travel to solve your problems every time wouldn’t work (perhaps with the exception of Doctor Who). On the other hand, I can see how Voldemort’s supporters would feel they have no other option except to go back in time and change things. Even wizards and witches can’t bring people back from the dead. But using an illegal time-turner felt like a cop-out to me. Surely Rowling could have come up with a better plot device than time travel?<br/><br/>I am of a divided mind when it comes to the characters. Of course I am basing this solely on their lines and my imagination of how the actors would perform their parts. Perhaps I would feel differently if I were to actually watch the play. Regardless, I was sorely disappointed in one of my favorite literary characters ever: Ron Weasley. In the novels, Ron is a deeply flawed person with an enormous sense of humor. Some of his lines in the books still make me laugh out loud when I read them (”…wouldn’t recognize a joke if it danced naked in front of him wearing Dobby’s tea cozy” comes to mind). In the play, Ron’s lines were cringe-inducing attempts at Rowling’s seemingly effortless style of writing dialogue. He just plain wasn’t funny.<br/><br/>Rose was rude and a bully, but I could see where she got that from her father, who was certainly not the nicest child at times. Albus was annoying, but that just showed he took after his father as a teenager. Speaking of Harry, he was very disappointing as a parent and not at all what I imagined…Parenting is rough, but for someone who grew up without his, you’d think he’d try harder to be the best father he could.<br/><br/>And don’t get me started on Delphi…<br/><br/>For one thing, I desperately did not need the image of Voldy getting it on with Bellatrix, tyvm. For another, it was just too much of a stretch for me to imagine Voldemort having a child. Just didn’t fit the character I remembered from the books.<br/><br/>Other characters were not nearly as disappointing. Like most folks, I particularly enjoyed Scorpius. There were a few good lines from Hermione, another favorite character of mine, even though I wasn’t overly happy with how she was portrayed.<br/><br/>To sum up:<br/>Plot: meh<br/>Characters: mixed<br/>Reliving HP happiness: hooray!<br/><br/>Now I need to plan another trip to London so I can see the play and completely change my mind about the entire thing…
 So disappointed!  How can I unread this garbage?  JKRowlings is a wonderful writer and I have read the Harry Potter series at least 20 times but this book is no where near what she writes.  So upsetting to a huge fan like me!  Can we have our money back?  The characters are so changed that they do not even remotely feel like the original characters. Such a disappointment!  Please rewrite this book yourself JKRowlings and show us your Magic once again!!!
 This is probably one of the worse stories I ever read. The story line is weird and the characters are not the same characters they were from the original. a lot of people are saying JK Rowling did not write this, she simply approved it so her name could appear on the book but as a published author myself, I would never approve a spinoff from my work that was this bad and if she was involved in the writing process, she is losing her touch. I love Harry Potter, I always have, in fact JK Rowling was my inspiration for being an author myself but this book shames the entire world of harry potter.<br/>Also, do not let people try to tell you the reason its bad is because it is written as a script and not an actual novel. That is not what is wrong with this book, it truly is the material in the script that makes it bad.
 ***WARNING!!! CONTAINS SPOILERS!***<br/>Let me start by saying that the dialogue is complete S***. Rarely does it possess the unique charm and sense of antiquity we've come to expect from the wizarding world. More often than not the characters (particularly the kids) sound more like your typical American street teenagers than British wizards. I know it's set in the future, and as Millennials our speech is different than that of our parents, but c'mon. Below are just a few of many gems. Ask yourselves, is this really the way any wizard in the HP universe would realistically talk?<br/><br/>Delphi/Hermione: This really doesn't feel how I – I even sound like her! Triple wow.<br/><br/>Scorpius: No. No way, José. If we're doing this, we're doing it (he puts on a pair of familiar-looking glasses with a smile) together.<br/><br/>They also use the words "friggin", "lame", and "uber geek." And I should add that there's a scene where Harry actually refers to Professor McGonogall as "Minerva." I know that it's been a loooong time since he's been a student of hers, but really??? He also threatens her with Ministry action if she doesn't do what he wants, and she bows down and takes it. I'm sorry, but I just can't imagine either of them reacting this way. There are many other examples I could cite where people say/do things that are completely out of character for them, but I'd be here all day.<br/><br/>I have to say, I liked the twist where Albus was sorted into Slytherin. Remember in the epilogue of DH where he's so nervous about being in that house? Well, our suspicions are confirmed in CC! I also found it interesting that Voldemort ended up having a child.<br/><br/>The story is intense, exciting and interesting, but due to the flaws I mentioned above, I can't say I found it all that great. Personally, if I were the writers, I would edit the dialogue to not sound so "modern" and "American." That's one thing they could easily change as the play evolves, and I think it would help to bring up ratings.
 If you're on here, debating whether or not to buy the book, and using reviews to help you STOP NOW.<br/><br/>First, let's be clear: this is a script, not a book. I've read play scripts before so I wasn't too worried about the format, but for some reason this seemed pretty jumpy.<br/><br/>I think a lot of my issues come with the writing. I felt the characters that we potter-heads knew and loved were somehow changed into characters we'd never met before. I realize that this story focuses less on our beloved characters and more on their offspring. Unfortunately, even these new characters seemed one dimensional and undeveloped.<br/><br/>The plot was... Meh, somewhat predictable.<br/><br/>Overall I was just disappointed. If anything, this makes me want to re-read the actual series again.
 It's nice to have a new story with Harry Potter characters, even if it's a play which cannot include the details supplied by the actors and the staging. That said, the story is rather a mess. SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS. The dialogue is not at the level of Rowling's; many elements seem to have been inserted into the plot in order to satisfy fans who want to see familiar characters in particular contexts; extensive teasing of a love affair between two boys goes nowhere and should either have been used or removed; numerous characters become purely functional and somewhat interchangeable role-players in the plot, particularly Hermione, Ginny, and even Harry. Draco Malfoy is unrecognizable. The villain is both predictable and, to a great degree, underutilized.<br/><br/>I can understand that JK Rowling probably just wants to write Cormoran Strike right now, but frankly she should have made sure this was written at a higher standard. I think of the complexity of character development in, say, The Casual Vacancy, which is like a short version of a Tolstoy novel, and wonder why she couldn't get this play to be a little better about it. Plays can have great characterization and great style. No doubt I will read this again after a while and find more nuances than in my quick rush-through, but I wish still it had been better.
 As someone with a Harry Potter tattoo, I'd say I'm a pretty big fan of the series. So that makes me all the more disappointed in this play. While I understand that, as a play, it's meant to be performed, and some of the nuance might be lost in translation, the flaws are too dramatic to be excused like that. All our beloved characters, Harry, Hermione, Ron...they're all horribly out of character. And OTHER beloved characters (Neville, Luna, George, Teddy, to name a few) are completely missing. The plot is convoluted and overwrought, the big "reveal" is extremely obvious from very early on, and to be honest, the story is just...bad.<br/><br/>I wanted this play to be the heart-wrenching tale of a son trying desperately to connect to a father that he can't understand, the story of a father who is trying to come to terms with both his horrible past and the fact that his son seems to be the very antithesis of him. I wanted this story to be HUMAN, even though it's set in a magical world.<br/><br/>What I got was a story that is too caught up in its own magical setting to remember that a good story should ALWAYS be driven by the characters within it.<br/><br/>If you're a Harry Potter fan, feel free to get this book to complete your Harry Potter shelf of books. But don't go into it expecting to learn anything new about the Wizarding World that you fell in love with all those years ago. This play reads like poorly written fanfiction. Feel free to skip it.
 I was 17 when Deathly Hallows came out so I grew up with Harry Potter like a lot of these reviewers.  I own all the audiobooks and listen to them frequently.  I was so excited to hear a play would be brought to life and even more so that those of us without a hope of seeing it live in London would still get a chance to read the new story through the published rehearsal script.<br/><br/>I continue to have mixed feelings about the story as a whole.  There are parts I adore about this story, such as Scorpius being the greatest child ever, Draco admitting to his lonliness and vowing to bring his son up differently than how he was raised, the struggle Albus feels carrying the weight of his father's legacy and pressure to succeed.  And then there are parts that I struggle to reconcile with what I know and love about the HP series.  I cannot fathom the idea of Voldemort having a child - consensual or not, magical intervention or not - with anyone.  I can't imagine any amount of public humiliation at the Triwizard Tournament that would turn Cedric into a Death Eater and kill Neville at the Battle of Hogwarts.  I can't imagine Harry ever saying he sometimes wishes Albus weren't his son.  Even if he regrets it immediately, I'm not sure I could see him going that far even in the heat of the moment.<br/><br/>I had issues with the mechanics and plot holes that time-turning caused in Prisoner of Azkaban and had many of the same issues with the time-turning in this story as well.  I felt quite a bit like the entire hidden purpose of having a story involving time travel was just a way to bring back old characters for the fans to see again, although I don't feel any characters were done any real justice by that so it was often awkward.  Most of the characters felt at least a bit *off* to me; close to their canon personalities but not quite right.  I started referring to it as 'canon-adjacent'; it's easy to say it's a fan-made telling of Harry's future if that's easier to accept, but for a lot of people it's also a perfectly acceptable addition to the series.  Accept the parts you like, and continue to daydream and rework the parts you don't.  Fiction allows that kind of freedom for headcanon.<br/><br/>I would love the opportunity to see it performed live.  While this wouldn't change the issues I had with the plot, it would definitely be a more well-rounded experience with the story overall and I think I'd have a better appreciation for the story presented in a completely new medium for the HP canon.  I think I could forgive some of the more absurd points if I had a more complete picture of the experience, with the atmosphere and magic - both literal and figurative - I associate with the series as a whole.  I'm definitely saving my pennies for when it makes the trip to Broadway!<br/><br/>Overall, I flew through the book and enjoyed the experience of dipping my toes back into the world of Harry Potter after so many years of having no new material, but it's clear this was a fan work and not the complete brainchild of Jo Rowling.  Her approval and backing of it tells me that she's at least behind this tell of the future of her characters even if she didn't write it, which is a bit tough to think about given how different parts of it feel.  However, I don't think it's fair for me to do what so many fans have done by completely trashing it and writing it off.  I think it's given the fandom overall a new thing to discuss and debate and love (as many people do!) and that's important.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 3.5/5 stars
 I feel as if I was tricked, buying a book with J.K. Rowlings name slapped on the front. It's hard for me to believe that she had any part of this book. Yes, I understand that it was a play and written that way, but I was missing the magically descriptive writing style that she has that can bring you into a book and a reader can picture everything very clearly. This book had potential but unfortunately it did not live up to it. I feel as if whoever wrote this didn't stay true to the characters, I could not picture Malfoy's character saying or doing half the stuff they have him doing in this book. The Kindle version also had quite a few grammatical errors. If you had high hopes, prepare to be let down. This book was basically like reading fanfiction.
 I am a massive Harry Potter fan. Like many others I grew up with Harry and have read the books countless times. The Cursed Child feels like a poorly written fan fiction that butchers years of character development in 200 pages.<br/><br/>The writing is terrible and there are so many points I am cringing at how bad the dialogue between characters is.
 Ho-hum. Most books, you either like them or you don’t. For this one, I can’t decide.<br/><br/>Maybe it’s because I give JK Rowling a bonus for being brilliant and she could copy the phone book and I’d still read it happily. Or maybe it’s because I missed these characters so much that I would have given anything to see them again, so to speak, even at the cost of having to read a mediocre book.<br/><br/>Because that’s really what it is, a mediocre book. My first gripe is that you can tell it wasn’t written like JK Rowling’s other books, aside from the fact it’s a play and not a novel. Meaning it doesn’t seem to be written entirely by her. For this book you feel she sort of glanced over the summary and gave her nod of approval, then left the premises. There are too many inconsistencies – it’s called the Ministry OF Magic, not FOR Magic in her other books, and certain charms like “Flipendo” have never appeared in her other works, just the computer games. I found that sloppy – like an unwelcome intrusion. As if people who’d only ever seen the movie but not read the books were suddenly in charge.<br/><br/>Spoiler alert: The time turner makes another appearance. As does gillyweed and polyjuice potion. Lots and lots of polyjuice potion. I never found it all that convincing to begin with, thinking that of all the magic available, going that way is the most cumbersome avenue, and it stays that way here. Personally, I would have loved another walk through Diagon Alley but there was no room for that. Actually, the entire first few years of Hogwarts are compressed into just a few pages, which is hard to swallow given the typically slow start and diving right into the moment for all the other books.<br/><br/>The story is basically all about Harry’s youngest son Albus who struggles as a teenager, as teenagers are prone to do, feeling oppressed by the fame of his father and not fitting into the family mold. His best friend is Scorpius Malfoy, Draco’s son, around whom suspicions swirl that he is Voldermort’s son. A fantastic plot of time travel and messing up the past ensues - It’s plausible I guess, but I found the plot too forced –bringing back certain elements of the previous series that had been particularly popular. There were parts that I enjoyed – the glimpses of Ron and Hermione as a married couple, for instance, another appearance of Prof. Umbridge, or hearing a little bit more of Dumbledore’s wisdom – but the main shortcoming for me was Harry. He just didn’t seem to be using his head like he used to.<br/><br/>If you love these characters and have been dying to hold this not-really-a-sequel in your hands, you’re going to buy it and read it, regardless what anyone here says. But if you really want to treat yourself to some good fresh writing, read JK Rowling’s (aka Robert Galbraith) Cormoran Strike detective series. THAT is a story you won’t be able to put down.
 Spoilers ahead!<br/><br/>Maybe the script doesn't do justice to the presentation of the play on stage, but the story itself was truly awful. It seemed like a poor man's badly developed fanfiction mashup of Back to the Future and Harry Potter, with characters whose personalities were warped and distorted to fit the childish, fast-paced plot. The internally inconsistent logic (Scorpius and Albus are smart enough to give their father a message in the future...but not smart enough to realize the sheer stupidity of changing a significant historic event?) combined with an almost comedic, eye-roll-inducing villain made it clear that this play is written for kids and pre-teens who probably never even read the original books. Releasing a book with "Harry Potter and the..." in the title, with JK Rowling's name on the cover gave me certain expectations, none of which were met.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how this play will be presented given the special effects requirements, but maybe those will at least distract from the fact that the plot is nonsensical and definitely not the Harry Potter fans know and love.
 I'm not even three scenes in and I already want to cry with how awful this is. I expected more of Rowling. Has a war taught this world nothing? And what the bloody whoa is with Ron and his nose idiocy? Ugh. I'd rather just read a well written fanfic. Poor Scorpius seems so lonely in this, and Rose is just acting like a Malfoy. It's enough to make me want to scream. Read Lord of the Rings instead. At least that war saw some growth and development. Honestly. I could get into the epilogue here too, which seems to be where this began, where Slytherin is still seen as the "house of the snake and of evil dark wizards", but I'll leave that for another rant. Honestly. Hell. After seven books, you realize nobody learns a sodding thing and the Wizarding World remains completely stagnant, as witnessed in this play. I'm not even certain I should finish it.
 I am so disappointed by this book. I loved the series. I read them to my children. They grew up on these books. How could JK agree to this?  It is utter crap! I have never written a review before but this book forced me! Yikes i wish they woulduse the time-turner to have gone back and never wrote this story.
 Nothing about this book reflected a shred of the character growth Jo built with her beloved characters since our first trip to Hogwarts with the Sorcerer's Stone.<br/><br/>I have been trying to articulate just how upset I am but it ends up being a long rambling of "AND THEN THIS happend, but that wouldn't happen because of THIS and WHY would ______ do THAT?"<br/><br/>It hurts me that I didn't like it. Part of me thought "am I just old now? would third grade me like this?", but no. I think third grade me would also feel cheated. Part of me thought "maybe this doesn't translate well in a book? maybe in the play it makes more sense?" but I just don't see how that would be true.<br/><br/>I chalk this up to fan fiction, but even that is upsetting because I have read much better fan fiction. Knowing Jo accepts this as canon is unsettling to me. I don't know about your but I am purging this from my memory. It ended nineteen years later. But then again, I was even critical of that. It felt cheesy.<br/><br/>These two were so, so, so, so, lucky to have this opportunity and blessing from Jo to help continue the story and I feel they were careless. Eternally bummed.
 Okay, Ashton Kutcher, you can come out now.
 Oh what a disappointment! I'm battling with whether I should be disappointed or just accept this for what it is...but, no, I'm disappointed. Mostly I'm disappointed that JK Rowling allowed this to be published. I can imagine that this would be a good, fun and well produced, spin off play but publishing the script is unnecessary and feels like a sad attempt to cash-in.<br/>JK is such a masterful author, she creates the most incredible, vivid alternate word and does this through wonderful prose and lengthy descriptions which the reader gets lost in. This play, in contrast, feels thin, rushed and flimsy. The characters Ron, Hermione and Harry feel like caricatures and, aside from Scorpius, the new characters we meet are underdeveloped and two dimensional.<br/>There are grammatical errors throughout - I know it's a play but this is still unacceptable!Without pulling this apart for the sake of it there were also a few parts of this story which didn't sit right or seem feasible (I'm sure they can be explained though).<br/>- Why is it so easy for Albus and Scorpius to cast spells on Cedric at the Tri Wizard tournament? Wouldn't all of the opposite teams be doing this to help their representatives all of the way through?<br/>- How is Delphi able to spend so long in Godric's Hollow when the time turner only allows 5 minutes?<br/> - I just hate the scene where Harry and Dumbledore had their heart to heart and tell each other they love one another.<br/><br/>This shouldn't have been published; rather just left as a spin off play for people to enjoy and take for what it is.
 SPOILERS This was a disappointment. Like many other reviewers, I am a true fan, and have loved all things Potter. The basic premise of this story was intriguing, but the writing, particularly the dialogue, is just so poor. Yes, I know it's a play, and based in the stage direction, I would imagine the effects are stunning in the theater, but the Potter canon has always been about the characters. The trite dialogue simply leaves them flat. Worse: there is no true humor in this story, other than using Ron as some sort of slapstick comic relief. (I don't remember Ron being as clumsy or unintelligent as this character is drawn.)  Many of the plot devices are recycled from other media, as well. The whole story with the underground movement came straight from the last Shrek movie, although it does explain some of the casting choices. The most incongruous of these devices is the idea that Delphi is the love child of Voldemort and Bellatrix. Unless Voldemort raped Bellatrix as some kind of punishment, the idea of his being intimate with anyone directly contradicts his whole purpose. He would also be super careful NOT to have progeny, as he would not want to be attached to anything. Voldemort is a creature that expects to live forever as the most powerful being: he does not want attachments or competition. When reading this, I could see the dramatic visual appeal, but. in the end, I could not get past how the dialogue seemed to be lifted straight from a badly written made for tv Disney movie. These characters are British, yet their slang is too American. There is simply too little Rowling here.
 Ok, everyone's pretty well covered what's right or wrong already. I agree, Rowling should've been the only author IF this was a novel. It's not, it's a script for what I imagine is a great play.  I hope she will decide to do a novelization because we would then get a full blown characterization of these people we've known and want to know better(i.e. The kids). Ron would've never been a magic/joke/trick store owner unless he took over the wands store or worked in the dept of magic development program for devices or such. I see Ginny as second in command in the ministry and I'm not being a feminist here, I'm simply seeing the strengths the women had in the original 7. I do see HP working through PTSD but c'mon he  comes across as a real whiner here!<br/>I found the beginning and end better written and the middle section frustrating and just filler. It gets 3 stars because, face it, we got another HP book. Almost a 4 until that middle section bored me. It took me less than 4 hours to read so that was good- but that wasn't so good until I remembered, it's a script. Ms. Rowling, I hope you'll either put it in novel form or continue the story with further exciting adventures we are used to.
 This is an awful story that is 100% untrue to the original characters and original plot line (which the book manages to change like 3 times… sorry for the spoiler; I won't give any more but just be warned that everything "crazy" that happens in the story is absolutely ludicrous and will anger you immensely).  I feel like J.K. Rowling decided to have a contest where she had fans write the last story, and then would pick the best one as the winner while editing and changing it for inconsistencies.  She then got ridiculously lazy, scattered the entries all over the floor, threw a dart up in the air, slapped her name on the first script it hit without even looking at it, and had it published.  It did not hit a good one.  JK Rowling, you've officially sold out.  The only redeeming quality about this entire book is that it is in play form, meaning there is very little writing, meaning you will waste fewer hours of your life reading it (think tearing off a bandaid on a particularly nasty wound.)
 (no spoilers in this, I haven't actually finished the book and I've already made me decision on it) I'm heartbroken to be writing this.. I cannot tell you how big a part of my life the Harry Potter series has been. To say I adore it isn't enough. So The Cursed Child is killing me. It's so bad.<br/><br/>I tried so hard to tell myself that it's a play, it has to be a little different, they can't have every little detail and every single character. And I could get over missing details and characters. What I can't get over is the out right absurdity and silliness. I know it sounds like a crazy thing to say about a series about magic, but it's true. In the original series Rowling could write about unicorns and flying broom sticks and magical ways of being immortal, and she did it in a way that made you feel it was possible, made you feel like you could really be a part of that world. This book doesn't have that. Instead it has me shaking my head and getting irritated at how little it follows the concrete facts Rowling worked so hard to establish. It always amazed me how she wrote a series over several years and everything tied in so well together; this book just doesn't have that.<br/><br/>The first part I found ridiculous was the trolley witch. Suddenly she's this hundreds of years old being whose food turns into bombs and can turn her hands into spikes but apparently has no means of stopping two boys who are supposed to be bad at magic (they can't do spells well until they practice them, like twice, and suddenly they can. They also never get in trouble for doing magic outside of school) from jumping off the train.<br/>Then there's the 'engorgio' charm. It sounds like a small detail but it really bugs me. They use it to engorge someone's head and he floats away. In the original series engorgio was used to make things bigger, not fill them with helium. As I said, it was something so normal in the original series, and it just gets completely skewed in this, and it's an example of this kind of thing happening multiple times.<br/>Another thing I can't stand is the time turner. A man wants Harry to go back before Voldemort's return to power and save his son's life. This so greatly diminishes everything that was established in earlier books about time turners and even about Harry's relationship with this man.<br/><br/>There are so many other examples of things that just don't fit into the Harry Potter world, but the worst thing about reading this is that these characters just aren't the same. These aren't the characters we fell in love with. Ron's just a moron, I can't get a grasp on who Harry is at all, and with Draco it's like they can't make up their minds about if he's supposed to be nice or a jerk. You would expect Rose, with a laid back father, loving mother, and close nit family to be a good person, but she's nothing but a little snob. Honestly with the huge Weasley family and all the others Harry's surrounded himself with, you just expect them all to be close nit and loving, but that's just no the case and it's so sad.<br/><br/>The deeper into this book I get, the more it feels like a fanfiction written by a juvenile, and the more I feel like it has to be a joke. It's sad for those of us who have stuck loyally by this series to see Rowling willingly put her name on something that so clearly undermines the series she worked hard to create. This is not the Harry Potter we know and love.
 okay, so there is a lot of controversy over CC in the HP fandom, but i honestly loved it.  i felt that it added to the original story, not so much in "tuning in where we left off," as much as the message it conveyed (which i won't spill here because i don't need anonymous death threats, which i'll probably get anyway because i've admitted in a large-scale public forum that i loved it).  as for those readers who complained that "it was a difficult read because it's in script format," seriously?  just don't read the Harry:  and Albus:  parts.  it's not that hard.
 This is, of course, a must-read for anyone who loved the Harry Potter stories.  That said, it's clearly NOT written by JK Rowling.  And, being formatted as a screenplay, it misses SO much of the satisfying detail of the original seven books.  The amazing wordplay is totally lacking.  Often, the words and phrases of characters we know and love seem.... foreign.  So many times, I found myself saying.... there is no way he (she) would have actually said that.<br/><br/>For the first 1/3 or so of the 'book'.... I actually hated it.  I almost quit reading it, which of course NEVER happened in any other book of the series.  However, after your mind accepts the bare-bones format, and accepts that you won't get the satisfying writing and word play.....  the story is good.  It's convoluted and complicated, and really, at some level, pretty satisfying.  It does feel like it could have been a continuation of the story.  I found some major flaws in the story (like.... that could NOT have happened... didn't they consider the limitations of....... kind of thing).  But, overall, I'm glad I read it and enjoyed it.<br/><br/>I would have MUCH rather waited longer and gotten a REAL story from JK Rowling herself.  But, I'd still suggest reading this if you loved the Harry Potter books.  Just... prepare yourself for superficial - something you've never gotten from Rowling before.
 How disappointing. I wish I could remove the memory of this monstrosity from my mind. It doesn't even seem like J.K. Rowling had anything to do with writing this screenplay and I'm shocked she put her name on it! I knew it wasn't going to be like the original books but I certainly was not expecting this. The characters are not remotely similar to the Harry, Ron and Hermione that HP fans grew up with.
 I've loved Harry Potter since the 3rd grade. I've read the series countless times, watched the movies even more, and of course read the whole addition Hogwarts Library bookset. Harry Potter has been a huge part of my life and childhood, it's timeless to me. After all, "Hogwarts is always here to welcome you home." The series is great, it has a great legacy. This book sort of tarnished that for me. Some parts were nice, like being able to get more information about the fates of the characters I knew so well or about the Trio's families but in the whole it read like a mediocre fan fiction. The plot was awkward and forced, absent of the detail and twists and turns that made the prior seven so enjoyable. It seemed recycled and unnecessary, key points of the plot things very unlikely to happen. Frankly, the only reason I see J.K. Rowling publishing this play is in order to make more money, which saddens me to say but honestly I think she should have left the series well alone; the most enjoyable parts of the play were nothing that couldn't have been revealed through a series of short stories on pottermore.
 I knew this was going to be a script, not a novel, so entered into reading it with the right expectations.  I enjoyed the plot, and as it progressed the writing was fleshed out better.<br/><br/>Particularly earlier in the book, however, it was choppy, not "deep" enough, and negatively changed in ways from the HP 7 Epilogue, but these issues were mainly just distracting.  More concerning, the wording of sentences by characters well known across seven books was flat and not consistent with those characters as children or teachers, mainly in the early scenes. This is particularly noticeable with Hermione and Ron, where neither portrayed a personality early on as adults in the script,  as mature and animated as their child selves in the books. Professor McGonagall came across a bit silly and flakey in some scenes, something she never would have been accused of in any of the 7 novels.<br/><br/>Those things aside, the play developed very well, in my opinion, and had the right flavor of twists and turns in the play as the novels did.  The ideas and family bonds, as well as the strife, was consistent with what you might see between parents and children with the backgrounds they have, or stigmas they might carry due to association.<br/><br/>All in all, it was a good script and I think as improv and and general response is given to the viewings, the stage play will correct many of the faults seen in this version of the script book.  I will definitely endeavor to see it when it comes to the US.
 I am happy i bought this over all... The book itself is not in any part written by j.k. Rowling. Do not expect her style of writing. It is however approved by her so i feel that's an important point to note.<br/><br/>This on my opinion is a fantastic book to have it you are a true Harry potter fan. It dives into the young Albus' life. And tells a different kind of story than Harry potter ever was. It is not about Harry anymore, but about his son. It is a lot about their bonds and how harry is learning to be a father now at this point in life.<br/><br/>It's the first time i have ever read a play besides in school. I read it on one day. It is not a long book. I mean it's like 300 pages but the text is spread out quite a bit. I had a great time reading it too... After starting, and this is the reason for four stars, it got slightly confusing with the quick flying through the years of Albus' life. I did not enjoy that particular part of the book very much and that's the point where i really noticed the different writing styles the most. i thought to myself i never would have gotten through all the Harry potter books of they were anything like that. I feel it could have been some thing like, beginning at Hogwarts, giving the background needed to get the story then go on to four years later and tell the story. That part was annoying and it's something i knew was going to end and i was just like, okay when will it be done. That is the only critical thing i have to say about the book. Which is pretty good since I'm choosy about my books. The screen play does not bother me a bit, I actually felt more there in the story than a lot of other books.  The story itself was great, i thought the characters were spot on,the personalities perfect, ups and downs and thin i didn't expect but that added to the story so much. i love the overall additions this adds to the story... I still separate the Harry potter books in my head from this book but it's probably just because i have only read it once so far. I ummm love Harry potter, it's the best series i have ever read. I can read the books over and over.<br/><br/>AS a side note; I watched a documentary type deal on j.k. Rowlings decision to allow Jack Thorne and John tiffany to make this and she said she refused hundreds of offers over the course of years before allowing any third party people touch her Harry Potter story. She did not decide on this book lightly. It is a great story and i woulda say a must of you are a Harry potter fan like i am. Even if it's separate In your head from up you'll bee glad you read it,i was anyway. Hope this helps someone decide. It's money will a on my opinion.... Also where else are you going to get an entire days worth of entertainment for $10??? Worth it!
 I'm a huge Harry Potter fan.  Huge.  I've read every book of the series several times.  This is NOT #8 in the series. I wish I could say that it was a visit with old friends, but it wasn't. I think JK Rowling lost her mind when she endorsed this drivel.  I stopped reading it at 7% because I hated it, but then I went back to it.  I should have left it.<br/><br/>It was bad fan fiction.  I'm sorry I wasted my time and money.  It was disjointed and written terribly, and that had nothing to do with the fact that it was written as a play.  The grammar was awful.  Nothing was explained.  This was the stupidest thing I've ever read, and I have read Twilight, Fifty Shades of Grey, and lots of fan fiction.<br/><br/>Hermoine was not believable as the Minister OF Magic (they kept calling it the Minister FOR Magic). Harry was an awful father, just annoying, and a very weak character. Ginny was not the spit fire she is supposed to be. Ron was an oaf and not one bit funny. Albus was an ass. The only characters I liked were Draco and Scorpious. Draco was how I wanted him to be when he grew up.<br/><br/>The discourse between Harry and Dumbledore is ridiculous and stupid.  Dumbledore crying in his portrait?  Give me a break.<br/><br/>As for that pregnancy, there is no way that Draco would not have known about it, and I didn't get the impression that he was lying. But then, since nothing else was explained, maybe he was lying.<br/><br/>In this "book," polyjuice potion can be made instantly instead of over a course of one month, and third years are taught about the patronus charm.  Those two are just two examples of how this deviated from the original series.<br/><br/>This entire thing was rubbish.  If I could have given it zero stars, I would have.
 I'm a big Harry Potter fan (books/movies/theme parks) but I'm not willing to blindly pile on stars for the sake of the brand name. The minimum you need to know is that it is a worthwhile read (if a bit short due to it being a play) and if you like Harry Potter than you should read this (if you haven't already).<br/><br/>The story (without giving away spoilers, which is difficult) starts where the last book/movie ended, at the train station where adult Harry is sending his second child off to Hogwarts. From there, we follow Albus (Harry's second son) through his adventures with Scorpius (Draco Malfoy's son). We see adult Ron, Hermonie, Harry, and Ginny throughout and also welcome so other beloved characters back.<br/><br/>Overall I enjoyed it. I loved seeing what happened after the events of the Deathly Hallows.  I would have liked to have seen more of Albus as he adjust to life at Hogwarts (which turns out to be hard for him) but that is hard to do as a play so I have to forgive a little of the writers speeding through parts that would otherwise interest me.  The writing/dialogue feels a little off compared to the source material and at times seems forced but it is hard to read a play manuscript the same way you would read a book. I definitely would like to see it on stage because alot of the stage directions look really difficult to pull off (I do community theater so I have some stage experience and I couldn't even beging to figure out how they would do some of the things the directions say to do).<br/><br/>The story also has some really touching moments between Harry and Albus. They both have to grow as people and build their rocky Father/Son relationship. It does a good job of showing how hard it would be for someone to have a famous father with all the expectations surrounding it.<br/><br/>In summary, it is definitely a worthwhile addition to the collection but will likely fall somewhere in the middle of ranking for favorites.
 So this was enjoyable to read. But it was enjoyable as vaguely interesting fanfic rather than a legitimate part of the Harry Potter series. I enjoyed the characters but they weren't very complex and they were rather flat. Honestly my biggest issue with the play was the plot. So prepare yourself for<br/><br/>SPOILERS!!!<br/><br/>None of the plot makes sense because it involves using a Time Turner to travel back in time and change the past- which is not how time travel works in Harry Potter. It is very well established that when you go back in time using a Time Turner you do not change the time line- in fact the fact that you went back in time has always been part of the time line. Much like time travel in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. This is fairly crucial to the plot of Book 3 because Harry knows he can produce a patronus and get rid of the dementors because he has already experienced this the first time.  If time travel worked the way it does in this play Harry would have been kissed by the dementors and never had the opportunity to go back in time and do anything- it would have been the end of the series. Furthermore, it would defeat the purpose of Hermione having the time turner in the first place because she would have created an alternate reality every time she went back in time and chose to go to a different class. It would have been unimaginable chaos.<br/><br/>END SPOILERS<br/><br/>So I'm glad I read it, but all in all I think I could write something better and I'm not really that great at writing I just read the Harry Potter books a lot more than these authors apparently did.
 I am definitely the only person out of my group of friends who hated this book. Assuming you read the synopsis, I'll just explain my disgust:<br/><br/>1. I immensly dislike he main character. I've read books where villains and mean/terrible people lead the story, so I enjoy reading about a character with a few flaws or personal struggles. This one was overly pathetic. It figures this would be about a kid who doesn't compare to his dad, the great Harry Potter. Who would? It's Harry freakin Potter! There are 7 epic books about what an amazingly strong and courageous character he is! Even he started off with a few struggles before growing into the champion he was. I don't understand how this is the best plot idea that was established. Why are so many people comparing this kid to his dad? And why isn't this kid ridiculously proud of his dad? He has a sour attitude about wanting to establish a separate identity, but his actions don't reflect his wishes. Instead he just keeps brooding.<br/><br/>2. This could still be part of #1, but it felt to important to mesh in there. I don't like how he made me react as a reader, and I'm so mad that this kid made me think that he needed a time out. I am nobody's mother, so how dare he entice the urge to yell at him for acting so childish and disrespectful to his dad! He has a great life, with a family that loves him, so he should be more appreciative of the things he's taking for granted. This is the first time I have ever sided with a parent in a book. A parent. Now I feel old and wizened over teenaged drama. This kid is a huge jerk.<br/><br/>3. I completely understand that this book was not written by J.K. Rowling. I want to state that I was not expecting a similar writing style, tone of voice or even similar level of creativity. That being said, Harry, Ron and Hermione sounded absolutely nothing like Harry, Ron and Hermione, respectively. I was expecting a little change since they're older, but really, these are characters who have been through a war of chaos, stress and anguish, only to grow old sounding like a group of guest stars on Sesame Street. I enjoyed the play format of the book, but with so much riding on dialogue, I was struggling to accept these as the same characters that J.K. Rowling created.<br/><br/>I think 2 stars is overly generous, but that's because I've probably placed my expectations a little too high to begin with.
 If you are looking for a quick read that will give you allow you relive the emotional highs of the original series, this is the book for you, but don't expect a serious continuation of Harry's story.  There is a lot here that is funny, cute, and interesting, but calling this play canon makes the original Harry Potter series look like a joke by association.  I feel like this would be better received if it were presented a dramatic interpretation of Harry Potter (à la 'A Very Potter Musical' but less comical) rather than "the eighth story."<br/><br/>The good:<br/>Scorpius is adorable.<br/>I love the way that Ron and Hermione's relationship is portrayed<br/>There is a lot of interesting commentary on "what might have been" if small details in history were changed.<br/>It is often quite funny.<br/>Not relevant to the book, but the acting and special effects in the production in London are supposed to be amazing, so if they released a recorded version I would probably shell out more money for it, despite my disappointment with the book.<br/><br/>The bad:<br/>The plot is bizarre and fanfiction-y in multiple ways. If you've had any contact with HP fanfiction you will easily recognize several tropes that seem bizarrely out-of-place in a real Harry Potter story.<br/>There are multiple plot holes (mostly small, some rather major) and inconsistencies that call into doubt all of the detail and planning that went into the HP universe of the original series.<br/>Rather than taking the opportunity to expand upon the post-war Wizarding World and show us how the world developed in the past twenty years, the play focuses mostly on revisiting characters and events from the original series.  Some characters that I was looking forward to learning more about, such as Teddy Lupin, where completely left out of the story.  Instead, we get to see Snape, Dumbledore, Cedric, and even Harry's parents, which is nice except that I already got well acquainted with those characters in the original series and was looking forward to something new.<br/><br/>Basically, I think this play is written to give a nice emotional high to those who are still sentimental for the original series, but anyone who was looking for a new story or expansion of the universe will be disappointed.  On a brighter note, the trailers for Fantastic Beasts look amazing, so at least we still have that to look forward to! :)
 It's been said better in other reviews, but really, this script can't stand without the spectacle of the stage.
 Ok when I first read this book the minute it was released I thought I liked it. But that's because I had hyped myself up and wanted to love it SO MUCH that I basically forced myself to. I'm OBSESSED with everything Harry Potter, and I mean OBSESSED. So basically if I didn't love this I felt like I was betraying my favorite series in the whole world. Slowly after the initial reading when I started actually analyzing and thinking about what I just read, I realized what an absolute piece of trash it is as far as a Harry Potter story goes. The characters were literally not even remotely similar to the characters we know and love. The story was just one big giant plot hole and inconsistency. I don't care that it was written in play form, I knew ahead of time that this was a screenplay for the play. I'm talking about the story itself which is horrible and terrible and NOTHING like Harry Potter.<br/><br/>So before this turns into a pages long rant, I'll stop myself. This is what I think of this story: Compared to the ACTUAL Harry Potter series, it's TRASH. BUT so are the movies compared to the books (not anywhere near as much trash as the Cursed Child though.) So basically while I pretty much hate this story, I take it with a grain of salt because there is a TON of stuff I hate about the movies too. So I would never destroy this book (I collect EVERYTHING I can HP so it's still part of the collection) and honestly I might see the play just to experience that because I'll be in New York next year when it starts on Broadway. But unless you are like me and pretty much compulsively by HP stuff just to add to your collection, don't even bother. And I pretty much worship anything that comes out of JK's mouth but I don't care what she says, the Cursed Child will NEVER be canon.<br/><br/>So in summary: the Harry Potter books are a billion times better than the Harry Potter movies which are a billion times better than the Cursed Child.
 I (like most of the people who read this play) grew up loving the Harry Potter series. I must have reread all seven books a dozen times at least... which is why I could tell right away that J.K. Rowling did not write this. Since her name came first on the credits, I assumed that she had creative control over this project, but I did some research once I had finished and found that this was not the case. She gave the other authors pointers here and there, and perhaps gave them some insight into the characters that only she, their creator, could have, but other than that she had little to nothing to do with this play. I wish I had known that before I bought the book, so I will say it clearly to you right now: if you are looking for a follow-up to the Harry Potter series written by J.K. Rowling herself, this book is not for you.<br/><br/>The story isn't bad and it has some really clever twists, but it reads like a bland fanfiction story (which, in a way, I guess it is). The characters don't have the same "voice" as they did in the original series, and it is jarring to read. It is someone else's interpretation of what our beloved characters should sound like, and this made it feel fake to me. The characters also don't speak in a way that sounds natural in general, even aside from them not sounding like themselves.<br/><br/>Another thing I didn't like was that everything in the text was clearly designed to manipulate readers based on their sense of nostalgia. Events from prior books were brought up just for the sake of saying "hey, remember that thing that happened in that other book you loved? I remember too." This took time out of the real story and led to too quick of a wrap-up at the end of what could have been a hugely monumental reveal/crisis in the wizarding world, as well as to a complete dismissal of several new characters who were introduced in the beginning of the play. Basically, this play takes bits and pieces from all of the real Harry Poter books and uses them to try to tell a new story that falls flat.<br/><br/>Of course we all want to know what happened to our favorite characters after the Harry Potter series ended, but that is the beauty of reading a really good book: the author brings you to the end of her story, and then you get to decide in your mind how everything turned out beyond that. It is understandable, though, that people jump at the chance to read a follow-up supposedly written by the woman who started it all - but I think now that it might have just been better to let the original seven books end where they ended, and leave the rest to your own imagination.<br/><br/>The thing that bothered me most about this play is not that it is a bad story in and of itself, it is that it was falsely advertised. Sometimes it is fun to read Harry Potter fanfictions online, but you always know that those are not written by J.K. Rowling herself. This book has her name on it, but she was hardly involved with its creation at all. This felt like a betrayal of her readers, and I feel cheated on both a financial level (even as an ebook this book was not cheap!) and on a personal level. I feel like a great friend from my childhood just lied to me to make more money for herself.
 First of all, as a life-long theatre lover, I have read many, many plays. So I understand that they are not meant to read like a novel. Obviously, they are best experienced on stage.<br/><br/>That said, I have loved dozens of plays that I haven't been able to see. I was hoping this was going to be one of those, too.<br/><br/>It wasn't. From the start, it felt choppy and disconnected. The characters we know and love said and did things entirely out of character, especially Harry. Ginny hardly had a role at all, and all the fierceness has apparently faded.<br/><br/>The plot was subpar. I have literally read the same plot in fanfiction, and I'm pretty sure they were better quality. It felt so contrived. I was hoping for a new villain, a new obstacle. Instead, the writers used time-turners to dredge up the same villain we spent seven books fighting and destroying.<br/><br/>And let's talk about those time-turners. (SPOILERS)<br/><br/>How convenient that an extra special time turner just happened to be created, and that Malfoy just happened to have one too. So. Contrived.<br/><br/>But the thing that bothered me the most? Hermione.<br/><br/>Hermione is married to Ron, and at the start of the play is Minister of Magic. She's brilliant and powerful, as expected, although I admit I was disappointed that she was in politics after all.<br/><br/>So the kids go back in time, and screw some stuff up, and Hermione and Ron's futures get messed up and they don't end up together.<br/><br/>Fine. I never liked them together.<br/><br/>But wait. What happens if Hermione doesn't marry Ron? She is a brilliant witch, an independent and fierce woman, so she is still wildly successful, right?<br/><br/>NOPE. She ends up as a Snape-like teacher, cruel to her students, bitter and angry about life, with no prospects.<br/><br/>WHAT. THE. HELL.<br/><br/>That is NOT Hermione, and the writing of one of the best female characters in fantasy did not feel like Rowling at all.<br/><br/>In short, save your money. This story was the worst.
 I was disappointed. There was so much potential. This just comes off as fan fiction. I understand that this is the script for a play, but the things that I didn't like are basic story elements. Those elements might be covered up by glitz and explosions when you see it on stage, but they were my biggest grievance.<br/><br/>I do not like how time travel is used in this book. Time travel was done so well in the Harry Potter series. The rules introduced here seem so arbitrary and don't make sense. It seems more like a way to show scenes and characters that the audience will enjoy.<br/><br/>The tacked on romance at the end is so stupid. The Harry Potter series gets flack for the relationships set up late in the series, but Rowling did an excellent job of writing friendship. This book is the opposite. It writes a budding romantic relationship so well, but it calls it just a friendship in the end.<br/><br/>There are good things this book did. Slytherin was shown in a different light. Complexities of adulthood and the difficulties of parenthood were shown well.<br/><br/>I wanted so much from this book so maybe I am being unfair in my critique, but I give this book a 2/5. I absolutely want to see this play. I may even read this book again, but I don't think it is good. The rating is also comparing it to the standard I have for all things Harry Potter.
 It's hard for me to read a script without picturing actors stomping around on a stage.  I also read that the play itself had a lot of slight of hand as an interpretation of the magic.  Instead of imagining the world of Harry Potter to be super deep and realistic, I could only see a cheesy play.  I know it's incredibly difficult to get as deep as the novels when we are only reading dialogue and stage directions and maybe I would feel more enthusiastic if I were watching the play on the stage.  I felt the characters were off and the emotions I was meant to feel, I couldn't.  It was hard to connect and I think there was a lot of back story that would've made this more believable.  I don't think it's the worst idea to have a book about returning to the past, but I see two major issues with this story.<br/><br/>1. Slytherin is often thought of as the evil house, but is supposed to contain wizards with great leadership skills.  This tends to be why we see people like Snape and Draco being kind of power-driven. Snape is on a power trip in his classroom and Draco walks around like he owns the place with his goonies. The qualities they possess can also be shown as positive and Albus and Scorpius had a chance to show fans that Slytherin House occupants are also kind leaders.  I feel a great opportunity was missed.<br/><br/>2. How does Delphi come up with the conclusion that saving Cedric would change the world? And I have trouble believing that Cedric could ever become a death eater, no matter how embarrassed he may be.  I understand the idea behind linking "the spare," but still find this to be very unbelievable.<br/><br/>I think a lot more could've been done to bring Harry and his son closer together.  I think the Pensieve could've been used to help Albus understand his father by seeing more of him and achieving that flash back idea that connects the old plots with the new one.<br/><br/>I honestly think a movie would offer a better level of realism and stronger connection with the characters.  I think the lines of the main characters from the books we loved could be tweaked, but I think it really has more to do with delivery and that's hard to grasp from just a script.  As Potter fans we are used to depth, grand scenery, and strong characters.  This format doesn't give the same effect. I would love to see this as a novel written only by Rowling and maybe a move adaptation along the way.<br/><br/>I wouldn't have chosen this direction with the plot, but since Rowling has made this the 8th official book, I really hope a novel follows up to save this story from losing the feeling of the characters.<br/><br/>Although, plays are meant to be watched.  Perhaps I am missing something.
 This book was so bad that my mind actually vanished the memory of reading it from my mental database.  Last week I came across this book in my bookcase and got excited.  I couldn't believe I had a Harry Potter book on the shelves that I hadn't read.  We'll, I started reading it and DEJAVU... OMG, I suddenly remembered that I had read this book when it first came out and was so appalled with it that I tossed it onto my bookcase!  Well, I won't be making that mistake again - I tossed it in the trash where it belongs.  I am re-reading the original Harry Potter books (nearly finished with The Order of the Phoenix) and am happily re-purging The Cursed Child from my mind again.
 *contains a few spoilers* I am a HUGE Harry Potter fan and could not contain my excitement for this book to come out. I also just finished the entire series (again)  to prepare for this book. I KNEW it would be a play, so it would be a little different. I tried not to go into the book with any expectations other than being excited to return to the Wizarding World, which was exciting enough. And it was... underwhelming. The beauty of HP and of JK is her ability to craft these amazing, complex, insightful, in depth characters with an intricate plot, which sucks you into their world. And because the formatting was a play, it was hard to be really immersed into the world and into the characters as in the original books. It all felt rushed and everyone felt underdeveloped, especially the new characters. I loved the friendship of Albus and Scorpious but it was also a bit flat and some of their character development was lost in the writing (or really lack there of)  JK Rowling is my favorite author, so I guess I missed the details of her writing through this format. Luna, Neville or Hagrid do not make an appearance through the book, boo! The ability to connect with the characters and really love them/ or even hate them in the original books is what made them so...magical. So, the book was okay, NOTHING compared to the original story where you really connected with the characters. I do hope the JK Rowling returns to Harry Potter, maybe the year after the battle when Harry, Ron and Hermione return to Hogwarts for their last year and how the battle impacted them all afterward. Love you JK Rowling and I hope you keep writing in the magical world, a full book would be great next time, because of course, I will always love Harry Potter. Always.
 The Harry Potter series of books (the seven ones in the main series and the three "Hogwarts Library" complimentary ones) are popular for a good reason.  They're not your "flavor of the week" fad and they're trend setters rather than followers. They're timeless, engaging, well written mystery novels that are far more interesting and smarter than the movie adaptations make them look (not that the movies are BAD, quite the opposite, but people who are only familiar with the series through them are certainly missing a lot).<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, referred to as "the eight story" is none of that.  It's certainly not a book, since it's a play, so what we have here is a rehearsing script.  Now that's fine.  It's understandable, expected and I have no problem with it.  The problem is everything else.  Unlike the books, this story is derivative, predictable, self-indulgent and dumb.  It has many of the characters seen in the original books, but they're there in name only, since their personalities are certainly not the same.  Also long gone?  The smart writing, the nail-biting mystery, the sense of adventure and anything close to actual life-lessons, replaced with childish attempts that border on humorless parody.  This story is fanfiction, and it falls into its most notable pits, doing no effort to avoid them.<br/><br/>Let me give you an example.  Picture you and your significant other are shopping and you say: "Hey, we should buy milk", so she/he replies "We can't do that, we have no milk!".  Spot the lapse in logic there?  How you offer a solution to a problem and the other person replies by simply stating the problem which you're giving a solution to?  Note how preposterous that is, and how dumb it would be if you just accepted it?  Let me show you the example on the book:<br/><br/>Two guys and a girl are about to use a Time-Turner to travel back in time.  One of the guys proposes an idea:<br/>GUY: "... we're going back without any knowledge of whether we can travel back afterwards... maybe we should just - try going back an hour first, say, first and then..."<br/>GIRL: "I'm sorry, GUY, we have no time to waste."<br/><br/>No time?  NO TIME?  You have a freaking Time-Turner RIGHT. THERE.  Time is what you have THE MOST of.  More than anyone else.  Heck, the entire idea he was giving you was to MAKE TIME.  Your response makes no sense!  And the fact that neither of the guys point it out is even worse.<br/><br/>Now this might sound like nitpicking, but this particular bit of dialogue showcases the main problem with this strictly plot-driven story: logic is set aside because the plot demands things happen.  Characters will go against their personalities because the plot demands things happen.  This is just one of the many aforementioned pits of fanfiction.  Here's a short list of others:<br/><br/>- The Mary Sue: this is a character that has no flaws, can't fail and always has the right thing to say to solve a situation.<br/>- The Obvious Villain: this is the character that you will easily peg as the villain the moment they show up even though the story treats it like an unexpected twist when it's revealed.  A telling sign is that they're too eager to make the plot advance.<br/>- The Derivative Callback: what's a writer to do when he wants to evoke the same feelings from a work someone else started without having any idea how to write well?  Simple, he just writes scenes that are similar to ones created by the original writer in hopes that the memories of the previous ones will be enough to give readers the same feeling.  In this particular case, this gets too on the nose when two guys and a girl use Polyjuice Potion to sneak into the Ministry of Magic to steal a trinket.  I wish I was kidding.<br/>- The Manufactured Drama: this one's obvious.  Drama has to happen, so while two characters could talk like normal people instead they choose to either stay silent or break character just for it to occur, because the writer has no idea how to bring it naturally.<br/>- The Forced Pathos: a writer wants the reader to feel sad, but he can't write compelling drama, so what does he do? Simple, he repeats sad scenes that the previous writer created.  The difference with The Derivative Callback is that these aren't just similar, they're literally the same scenes, step by step, shown either by flashback or time travel.<br/>- The Superpowerful villain: a writer wants the stakes to feel higher, so what's he to do when he can't write compelling characters or situations?  Well, he gives the villain incredible powers, of course, whether these make sense in the story or not.  "Oh, you thought the previous villain was powerful?  No, here's version 3.0, that old geezer has nothing on MY guy!  What's that?  That there's no precedent for this kind of power in this universe?  Blah, I don't understand those words, look at the fireworks!"<br/>- The Ship: Sigh.  I, of course, mean "ship" not as a vessel, but as a verb, as in "I'm going to pair these two characters together wheter it makes literally no sense or... wait, ESPECIALLY if it makes literally no sense".  This is probably the most known one in fanfiction (so much that it has its own subcategory, called slash fiction), but it's especially painful here.  Once you read who's certain person's father you'll know instantly who the writer decided would be the mother, even though, again, it makes literally no sense.<br/><br/>Please understand that I gave this story a fair chance.  I was actually very excited for it, I preordered this book back in February.  I knew it wasn't written by J.K. Rowling, but I also knew she's not the only good writer in the world, so I gave this what I thought was a well-deserved opportunity.  Instead, I was "rewarded" with having to read what appears to be some blogger's Harry Potter, Back to the Future and It's a Wonderful Life's fanfictions all rolled-up into one.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, this is amateur writing at its worst.  I have nothing against fanfiction.  I've read some very, very good Harry Potter fanfiction in the past, but for the life of me I can't believe writing this poor ever got such a chance.  I absolutely don't recommend it, but if you HAVE to read it, then go prepared.  Adjust your expectations as low as possible and you might draw some enjoyment out of it.  But it will still never feel like the touted "eight story".
 This is the first time I ever purchased a book in script form...will never do it again.  I was really excited to get this book loaded to my Kindle, however, I'm very disappointed in the style.  For me, it ruined the read.
 It's ok....I enjoyed being back in Harry Potter world but sometimes the characters acted totally out of character, the way the characters addressed each other bothered me as well.  When speaking to Dumbledore's portrait Harry kept calling him Dumbledore rather than Professor.  The kids addressed all the adults by their first names, Snape calls Ron and Hermione by their first names, and Draco and Harry using each other's first name.  The names really threw it off for me.<br/><br/>Another thing out of character is when Harry is alone with Delphi he says he has never fought alone.  Didn't Harry fight Voldemort alone?  Harry has fought alone most of the time.  It's almost like Harry has lost his nerve.<br/><br/>I would love for JK Rowling to write a book based on this new character Delphi.  This script seemed like a rough draft of a very raw idea.
 SPOILER FREE. After finishing this on release day (short, under four hour read for me...a generally average reader in speed), I initially clicked the 4 stars while hesitating between 3 and 4. I am now switching to a 3 because the more I think about it, once nostalgia wears off you're left with something somewhat acceptable but not very memorable.<br/><br/>I'm sure the play is entertaining with great lighting and effects, but in terms of reading this play as a book, there are times where the dialogue is lacking and the characters don't feel like the characters we know from the seven novels...the story also takes some liberties with new developments that although I'm completely fine accepting, I was surprised to see the direction. And there were some beloved characters that didn't seem to get the treatment they deserved.<br/><br/>All in all, I had a smile on my face during some parts of reading this and was happy to have a chance to experience the play without being able to see it in London, but when I look back on the Harry Potter series, this will be more or less a footnote-worthy licensed side story (that J.K. Rowling may not have had a whole lot to do with), and not part of the main canon I remember.
 I bought this and finished it on my kindle today. I had been putting off reading it due to the nature of it being a play and seeing that it was not well received. I had initially thought the story might be better left where it finished. I took the plunge and it was extremely disappointing. I am a huge fan of Harry Potter, I have been my entire life, I reread the books every year, know the difference between lines in the books and movies, etc, super Potter nerd. This was just a terrible fan fic. I doubt JK had much to do with it. The characters were so unlike themselves, the plot was terrible. I’m honestly heart broken to say any of it. JK is a hero and a terrific author. Read it to see for yourself, but I’ve read better fan fic about the Marauder Era.
 If you are going to read this book you have to detach yourself from Harry Potter books 1-7 which is very hard to do. Take it as published fan fiction that J.K. Rowling liked so much she put her name along with it. Certain things do not flow with the way the series was previously written and it's hard to get past. Character behavior and personality are also things that become lost with this story making the whole plot highly unbelievable. They shouldn't have referred to this as the 8th book and should have called it what it is, Harry Potter fan fiction. If you want a book that gives you an alternate look at Harry Potter and the rest of the characters this is a good book to read. If you are looking for something to continue the Harry Potter story line, this isn't it.
 Such a letdown after the HP series. I know this was originally written by playwrights and then JK Rowling got involved and gave it her approval, but the story was just stupid. The plotlines were already done in some of the fanfiction so nothing new or surprising there. Very disappointed in this story
 I'm not sure what happened here. The only thing I can guarantee is that JK Rowling had nothing to do with the crafting of this story.<br/><br/>Reading a play is an inherently different experience from reading a novel, of course. Novels like the Potter series are full of rich narration and world building, whereas a play is reliant almost solely on the quality of the dialogue. Nuances in character development and narrative must come to life in the dialogue, even when watching a stage production, because true theater doesn't rely on sets, scenery or special effects. Reading the play should be comprable to seeing it live: of course, quality actors bring it to life, but seeing King Lear in person isn't generally any more powerful than reading the incredible script in your living room.<br/><br/>Was I naive for hoping for this kind of quality? Probably not, considering the playwrights are so accomplished. The dialogue in Rowling's books was, admittedly, not the most compelling, but her narrative and world building made up for it. Absent that, and absent a writer with a gift of crafting character interactions, this book was a massive disaster.<br/><br/>It truly does read like bad fanfiction, with massive leaps of logic and plot holes that are impossible to swallow and one-dimensional, cookie-cutter characters (something I think the Potter books avoided foxily).<br/><br/>As a lifelong Potter fan, I can't really accept this as canon, and I hope that those new to the Potter universe will avoid this chapter in the saga entirely.
 I was so excited to start this book, but also scared at the same time, being a Potter Head and growing up reading the original Harry Potter series. I couldn't help but wondering if it would meet my expectation or be a great disappointment.<br/><br/>Well it was an epic failure on all levles. It was pretty disheartening,  I mean the stroey line was so dry and just very predictable. I knew where it was headed very quicly. There was no mystery or pull to hold the reader other than you hoped it was going to get better but it never did.<br/><br/>Maybe I expected too much or over hyped it in my head. Non the less it was a fantastical diaster my personal feelings. I really felt like she going to over milk the Harry Potter franschies. It felt a little like she use the killing curse on the series at this point." Avada Kedavra"<br/><br/>Being a big Harry Potter fan and reading all the books as a kid this book kind of take away from the orignial and leaves you more angry than satisfied.<br/><br/>The plot wasn't very good and just left you annoyed. It was very boring and many holes in the story line with a lot of unanswered questions that didn't even needed to be asked. It really makes Harry look stupid in general and just annoys the readers to the end. I stress this  especially if you have read and love the series thus  far.<br/><br/>Its coming to a point where she needs to leave the character alone or shes going to just screw up the whole series if she continues down this road. It did have the potential for greatness tho. She just has to stay away from certain aspect of the old books. She also needs new material not the same old ones recycled. Maybe its just me and I am over judging.<br/><br/>This book was a big let down  in so many so ways plot wise. I really felt like I wasted my time on it, however if you are a fan you are going to most likely want to judge/ read it anyways. I fell like she preys on the fact that you will want to read it no matter what at this point. I recommend if you are going to read it at least borrow it from a friend or library before you commit. Just to form your own opinion.<br/><br/>I am happy I read it, but the whole story was predictable and a very sloppy story line. It wasn't that originally Harry Potter lure. It lasck the pull, mysteries ,fun, and adventure the original books had. It also feels like shes just rewrting the same books only changeing a few deatails.  I wouldn't recommend it but if you are a fan you have to read it for your selves like I said earlier.<br/><br/>It isn't a great disappointment ...read with caution Harry Potter Fans. Its a big let down but now you have a warning so many it wont be so bad.<br/><br/>My best review without givng aways the story line. No Spoilars !
 I enjoyed . . . The Cursed Child, but not quite as much as I hoped to.  I don't want to spoil it for others, so I'll just say that some points convey a strong sense of fanfiction wish-fulfillment.  I enjoyed Scorpius' character, though I don't understand how someone with his personality would come out of Draco Malfoy's home.  I'm torn about the depiction of Rose Granger-Weasley; it's hard to imagine Hermione and Ron producing such a snobby kid, but she is the daughter of two of the major heroes of the last Wizarding War, so perhaps it's not particularly surprising that she feels entitled to be the among the most popular kids at Hogwarts.  I found Albus' character to be a bit troubling.  I don't understand how he gets sorted into his House, unless we are supposed to believe that he was attempting to rebel, even from the first.  Also, the crux of the story is the complicated Albus-Harry relationship, and I think that the script quickly passes over the source(s) of tension, and, as a result, the conflict is under-developed.  I am also disappointed in the lack of any real family connection between the Potters/Weasley-Grangers.  Apparently, James doesn't ever really think about, or look out for, his younger brother, and their relationships with their cousins seems largely non-existent.  I also think Ron is written too much as mere comic relief.  And, like many, I really don't like the Cedric development.<br/>The new characters may come alive on stage; on paper, they seem a bit thin.  Not surprisingly, this is especially problematic for Delphi.<br/>But there are things that I think the play does very well.  Amos Diggory's grief and anger feel very realistic, and I can see how Harry and Draco can find some common ground through their concern for their children.  I also like Ginny's portrayal.  And there is a moment when Albus and Scorpius have a break-though about how they can succeed at their task that is funny but also sad, as it so strongly conveys how isolated and lonely they are (though Scorpius' depiction as a loser is a bit confusing because the play gives the impression that he's a nerd and more like Hermione than Ron or Harry in his study habits).
 If you value you memories of Harry Potter , run away from this horror.  Crappy fan fiction . Just, no.  I cried. I actually cried over what they did to the legacy of JKR amazing books .  This is just crappy. And not in the Tommy Wisaue Room crappy way . More like a 7th grader with no idea of life, politics, parenthood and story tellingwrote it. just , yeah that bad.
 I have been a fan of the Harry Potter series for almost two decades.<br/>It reads a bit like an angsty fan fiction. It seems to revel in the misery of the characters, but obviously loves the series and its mythos.<br/><br/>Parts of it are quite touching and good- I especially like the characterizations of the adults- though they did a bit of a character nerf to Ron a few times, similar to how they did it in the films where they took away his smarts and strategy and instead had him act as the only levity to be found.<br/>Ginny was characterized well (unlike the films, yeesh), as were Harry Draco and Hermione.<br/><br/>As for the news cast...<br/>I love Scorpius, and how he is just a genuinely sweet fellow who is a total nerd.<br/>Albus is just about the worst character I've ever read. He has no redeeming features, except that he cares about Scorpius- and even that comes across as a form of rebellion against his dad rather than genuine friendship.<br/>Rose is a snot, and I was sad to see her barely in this at all.<br/><br/>The plot.... It isn't true to Harry Potter and actually breaks many of the laws of magic we know, and does not have a plot structured similarly to the mysteries of the HP books.<br/><br/>PLOT SPOILERS AND MORE AHEAD<br/>Time travel doesn't work how it did in Prisoner of Azkaban.<br/>This is not really a mystery- it's 'The Butterfly Effect' set in the harry potter universe.<br/><br/>I'm genuinely not sure who the cursed child is, felt the rumors of 'he's the child of Voldemort' were shoehorned in, and hated Delphi for being boring and with a motivation that seemed tenuous- as did Albus's for trying to save Cedric Diggory. The whole main plot felt arbitrarily chosen. A Voldie/Bellatrix love child? Saving Cedric? Why did she even bother dealing with these teens- she could have just stolen the time turner!<br/><br/>The sequences with the adults were good- the time travel ones read rather poorly and seem to have 'off' choices. The script seemed to almost Queer-bait a Scorpius/Albus relationship- and very poorly. Then they'd hamfistedly establish 'but don't worry, they are straight! See!!!'<br/><br/>They over-redeemed Snape, over bamfed Hermione in certain scenes, under bamfed Ron,<br/><br/>The heart of the play- the relationship between Harry and his son- felt completely one-sided. Albus is truly a horrible kid, and Harry can't connect with him- but I don't see how anyone could. He's awful. He's not compassionate, kind, funny, smart, interesting or compelling. All he does is complain. I tried to like him, but I couldn't find one scene where he drew me in.<br/><br/>The one scene that truly touched me deeply was Harry having to witness his parent's deaths, and do nothing to stop them. It made tears appear in my eyes.<br/><br/>The 'clever' scenes in this, weren't. :( Delphi wasn't all that smart, Hermione's safeguards in her office and the riddles were sadly oversimplistic, and the even Al's 'use the blanket!' didn't seem to make sense, as what were the chances that his father would come across it in time? The 'prophecies' in this were quite weak. At one point they time travel and Rose no longer lives- but really, shouldn't Al and Scorpius not either? It makes no sense. Their 'rules' for time travel are non-existent. (And Cedric turning evil seemed untrue to the books.)<br/><br/>Scorpius's mother's passing was glossed over, and added nothing in particular to the plot except give Draco some more angst- and show more evidence of how thoughtless and horrible Albus is.<br/><br/>So, to sum up-<br/>It's ok. The adults part are fun to read. The children's individual scenes are only good when Scorpius is talking, and the overarching plot is just a few Butterfly Effect time travel sequences for no real reason. Who is the cursed child? Who knows. I say it's Albus, because he's the worst.
 Just as the number of stars indicate, it's okay. If you really want to read it, then I don't think you'll be able to resist buying it even if you've heard whispers of discontent about the plot.<br/><br/>I think it's pretty fair to say JK Rowling was pretty clear that this wasn't a full out novel, it's just the published script of the play in London. So my review is not because I thought I was mislead. I was extremely aware this was the script.<br/><br/>My quip is with the storyline itself. It's pretty clear after a few scenes in, you realize there's very little to JK Rowling's actual writing style, but you're curious enough anyway to continue reading to see how the story progresses. Obviously, it's not going to read like a novel narrative, and the story is told through conversations that are happening in very specific situations.<br/><br/>There are the obvious moral undertones to the story.<br/>- The Father/Son Dynamic between Harry/Albus, Draco/Scorpio and all the torrential feelings when a parent is trying to understand their child.<br/>- Going back in time to change the past doesn't necessarily make for a better future<br/><br/>And things of that sort. So the story line does have some depth to it, and there's that moment of small gratification that Severus gets.. and it's satisfying for a person that's always been a fan of his character.<br/><br/>But otherwise.. the rest of the plot just leaves you head scratching. How time turners are used in the Cursed Child vs in the original series is different. And there's a huge focus on time travel, and it's kind of disorienting. I appreciate the flashbacks of the original story line, but I'm here for NEW material.<br/><br/>And really.. the biggest thing I had a problem with was the love child of lord voldemort and bellatrix. Really? We just had to go there? Trying to imagine the lord of absolute darkness and evil, the person who was willing to split his soul into 7 pieces, an indiscriminate murder who's M.O was strictly for finding revenge on HP and returning to power, having a love child in the middle of all that? And yes, I've heard the argument that he would've wanted an heir, but clearly, if he could survive in Prof. Quirrell's head, would immortality really be an issue for him? Would an heir actually be necessary? The whole prospect seemed pretty absurd to me.<br/><br/>All in all.. I was just left confused and just wondering... why?
 When I received this book I flipped to the end to see how many pages long it was as I do with all books. The blank full and part pages and the short lines turn this 308 page book into about 100. Hate the format, have never read a play before and doubt I ever will again. Plot line foolish.  I'm a 70 female that has read all the books at least twice and listened to them on audio books of which I have the full set . A sorrowful end to a wonderful series.
 Seriously lacking. I've been a Harry Potter fanatic since I was 9. I went to every midnight release of the books and the movies. I reread the Harry Potter series every year to this day. This was complete trash. The majority of people who grew up with Harry Potter and waited anxiously until midnight to get a copy of the next book will probably also agree. There was no magical feel to the story. The plot was farfetched, and had the true mark of fan fiction. The personality of the characters were painfully forced. While I know a screenplay is different than a book and would have a different "feel", this was just awful. I used to stay up reading the new Harry Potter book until I finished it, usually four in the morning. I had to force myself to read this all the way through. This is an insult to Harry Potter. J. K. Rowling should never have stamped her name on the cover along with the writers of the play. This was obviously not Rowling's world of Harry Potter
 Like many other reviewers on this site, I was very disappointed in this book.  I am a Harry Potter fan, even if I recognize that it is not great literature, it is highly entertaining and solidly written.  I do not have an issue that this was a play script and not a novel.  I was prepared and acknowledged that many of the important pieces like the ambiance of Hogwarts and the "wizard world" would be missing.  Where I draw exception is how entirely inconsistent this story feels.  The characters don't feel or read like those we've come to love. The plot is juvenile.<br/>For those few of you who love Harry Potter (and haven't read this play yet), you may just want to stick to the original seven books and leave your memory of Harry unsullied by this unnecessary addition.<br/>SPOILER TIME: Ron's character was a ridiculous.  I know many people think he was a little superfluous in the books, too, but now he's just there for comic relief.  Unfunny comic relief, at that.  Cedric being humiliated once and becoming a Death Eater?  I cry foul on that one.  As a character, Cedric was noble enough to tell Harry about the egg, humble enough to admit that Harry had helped him, and kind enough to allow Harry to win the Triwizard tournament with him. Cedric constantly tried to limit his own father's pride, yet one humiliation turns him into a Death Eater?  Not buying it. While I really didn't like the idea of Voldemort's child, it was obvious from the time she was introduced who she was.  I mean, she was THE ONLY influential new person in the entire play!  Let's not get into the whole time turner thing.  That was the best they could come up with?  Such a contrived plot device.  And for pity's sake people, you can't just go whipping up Polyjuice Potion from ingredients someone has in their house; it takes a month to brew!  This was a significant plot point in "Chamber of Secrets."  Rowling; why didn't you catch this!?
 It doesn't take very long to realize J.K Rowling did not write much, if any of this (the writing is awkward, not well told and prone to the occasional error).  Although her name is huge, when you look closer it says the play is by Jack Thorne based on a new story by J.K. and two other guys.  I love Harry Potter, have read everything about it and seen all the movies and this play/"story" bears no resemblance to the original masterpiece that is Harry Potter.  I feel totally tricked by this book and preordered it based on the massive title and J.K.'s name.  I still love the series but my respect level for this franchise and the author dropped.  After so many of us have waited too long for something original in the series, to feed us this drivel is poor form.
 I really wished I would have read the reviews before buying the Kindle version. I just don't understand how Rowling could have made such a story like this. She has amazing books, not just from the Harry Potter World. This book is as if a 15 year old girl who was obsessed with the epilogue wrote it all. It's purely fanfiction at the worst level, and I know, I've read some. The characters that we have loved, cried, and laughed at since we first picked up the first book are so different from when they were 17-year-old kids.<br/>I'm very disappointed how it all came out. I really wish someone would obliviate it all from my mind. It doesn't deserve all the hype that it's been getting. I don't know why Rowling's people didn't tell her how awful it was. Bad on them, and her. Thanks for ruining something that could have been great...
 On the one hand, it's good to revisit the Hogwarts universe, and diehard fans will find themselves unable to resist the opportunity to do so.  The themes of how our histories can continue to haunt us despite our best efforts are interesting to explore.<br/><br/>That said, I find it hard to believe Rowling would allow this adaptation of her material to go forward.  It offers an incredibly superficial treatment of those themes in a frenetic plot that features key characters constantly running around like chickens with their heads cut off.  The worst element of this story is how it turns Ron Weasly into a complete fool . . . in every incarnation.  Though he is supposedly an auror AND inexplicably running George's joke shop, he never has anything better to do than pop in at Hogwarts.  While I grant that Ron was never the character with the greatest depth, he wasn't a complete and total fool--there was a reason why Hermione loved and married him.<br/><br/>Albus and Scorpius are funny and echo the original trio in important ways, and it's interesting to consider what it would be like to be the son of the famous harry potter.  Draco Malfoy is surprisingly the only character who gets any depth, but it doesn't always ring true.  When he tells Harry how his father disapproved of his marriage, one has to wonder why Lucius Malfoy was walking around free to harass his son when readers have to assume that all surviving death eaters were surely thrown into Azkaban.<br/><br/>Readers are also likely to find the play format frustrating, but you have to take it as it is.  I would not say I regret reading it, but it's definitely not worth full hardback price, even from Amazon.  If you're OK with eating a cheap fastfood burger when you crave red meat, then read it.  I say that seriously, not sarcastically: sometimes we take what we can get in the face of a serious craving.  However, this book, like the burger, seems unlikely to provide much satisfaction.  Depends on your point of view, as the number of five-star reviews make clear.
 No character development, weak story, poor writing, uninspired dialogue. Disappointing on every level. I was hoping the play would come to the US soon, but now I think I'll pass.
 Since I was 12 years old, I have lived and breathed the world of Harry Potter. As I have grown, my love of JK Rowling's world and works has only grown. I have anxiously awaited a story following the adventures and misadventures of the children of the characters I grew up relating to so profoundly. Given those facts, I had such high expectations that I knew, deep down, that in some small way I would be left disappointed with anything other than a full length novel. I knew going in that this was not going to be that.<br/><br/>There were so many things about this play/story/book that were right... and yet I also feel like lots of things were 'wrong'.<br/><br/>Spoilers coming!!!<br/><br/>Rights:<br/>Albus' struggle with his own identity and not measuring up to his father and older brother<br/>Every single thing about Scorpius Malfoy<br/>The continued love and relationship of Ron and Hermione<br/>Intricacies within the wizarding world<br/>The temporary resurrection of Snape<br/><br/>Wrongs:<br/>Every single thing about Harry. I feel like he was pictured to be a shell of his former self. Nothing about his dialog and behaviors seemed to be true to the character we all know.<br/>Ron was painted to be a bumbling simpleton.<br/>I feel like the ending was, well, lame. The whole pigeon thing was just bizarre.<br/>A weeping, sniveling Dumbledore<br/>All in all, it was a nice story. I feel like I needed to read this to be able to form my own opinions.<br/><br/>Will I read this time and time again, like I have with all of my nearly-worn-out Harry Potter books? Nah. Probably not. I will give it another go in a few weeks to see if it has grown on me, but it likely wont get a third read.<br/><br/>Would I recommend that others read it? Probably. Yes. I think that everyone needs to be able to decide for themselves if this is the closure they needed. For me, it wasn't. But for others? Possible.<br/><br/>In all honesty, I have MUCH preferred the full length novel fan fics by G Norman Lippert following James Potter and the gang to this. Which, I suppose, is all the review this truly needs.
 This play is a betrayal and a departure of the beautiful world Rowling built.  It unnecessarily shakes up the potter story for what?  Is the wizarding world so small they couldn't find source material?  So many things  we love are yanked in different directions in this novel it's reminiscent of the complete lack of understanding displayed by the directors of the latter movies.  If you love Harry Potter, this book will hurt your feelings.
 Mildly entertaining as it brings us back into the Potter world.  That said, be prepared for more disappointment than joy.<br/><br/>Spoilers!!!!!!<br/><br/>A Malfoy and Potter becoming best friends and being outcasts....loved it.<br/>Harrys persona.....not in keeping with the boy who lived over 7 books.<br/>Ron...same old Ron.<br/>Hermione....bland character.<br/>Malfoy....inconsistent personality throughout.<br/>Ginny....same as Hermione but at least a little better.  Provides a solid counter to Harrys sometimes cold and brooding personality.<br/><br/>I was truly excited to read this but any time we have to rely on time travel I become somewhat concerned.  There were portions that I enjoyed and many you others I was left disappointed in.  I say read it as there's very little time commitment and it does add a little to the Potter mythos.  That said, be prepared to be left with a somewhat empty feeling at the end.
 This "book" is a script. Got it. I went into it knowing there wouldn't be the beautiful writing of JKR, but I fully expected a plot just as magical as the original stories I hold so close to my heart.<br/><br/>The story reeks of fanfic. Instead of a fresh, exciting new story in the wondrous world of HP (which one could argue there are THOUSANDS of new directions this story could have taken), we are forced to revisit old plots with time traveling. Yawn. The characters, new and old, are terribly written. The plot twists read like a bad soap opera. I honestly did not enjoy the story and it breaks my heart to say that.
 I made the mistake of thinking Harry Potter and the Cursed Child was written by J.K. Rowling. It is not. And even though it’s supposed to have been based off a short story by Rowling, and it appears she has sanctioned this play, I was very disappointed in this book.<br/><br/>Some Background<br/><br/>My husband and I are both HUGE Harry Potter fans. We read the series out loud together early in our dating life (and then later when the last book came out), and we’ve listened to the audiobooks numerous times since then – together and apart. (I’d previously read the first 3 books in the series in college and re-read them all as each new book came out.)<br/><br/>When this play was announced, I originally wanted to go to London this summer for one of the early shows. Knowing that was a little crazy, I instead pre-ordered the script when it was announced. I knew we’d have to read this play together – just like old times.<br/><br/>The Format<br/><br/>The play itself isn’t hard to read. It’s mostly dialog which is my favorite part of many books anyway. It was a little tricky to read aloud because unless my husband was looking over my shoulder, I had to read the character names before reading their lines. I don’t do voices.<br/><br/>The Good<br/><br/>There’s very little I liked about the play. In fact, I’d like to pretend I never read it. I am going to treat it the same way I treat the one fan fiction book I read a couple of years ago, like just that – fan fiction. Even though Rowling gave the idea for this story, I am not going to treat it as canon.<br/><br/>That being said, I was happy with the jobs that Harry, Hermione, and Ginny ended up with. Ron, not so much. One of the additional things I wanted from the epilogue at the end of book 7 was to know what careers the main characters ended up in.<br/><br/>And Albus and Scorpius were really cute. I liked this new generation friendship. Their banter reminded me of Ron and Hermione in the earlier books.<br/><br/>And that’s about it.<br/><br/>The Bad<br/><br/>Without giving anything away, I will say the following:<br/><br/>- The original characters seemed really out of character. Draco was about the most believable.<br/>- I hate time travel stories that mess with the original plot line. If it didn’t always happen that way, then it’s not possible. This book changed too many things, too many times.<br/>- They messed with the way some magical things worked. Time turners don’t need to be touched; they need to be around the people’s necks. Polyjuice potion isn’t brewed overnight, and it requires a hair of the person you’re transforming into. For me, Harry Potter has always been about the details, and they messed with the details with this play.<br/>- Harry is married to Ginny now. Hermione to Ron. Ron and Ginny should not have been on the outside of all of the action. Their marriages were too flat.<br/>- And the big reveal about Delphi? No. Just no. I didn’t buy it.<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>This play probably makes a better play. If I’d seen it live first, I think I would have just loved seeing the characters brought to life – new and old. I wouldn’t have cared so much about the story (maybe). But reading it as “the eighth Harry Potter” book was just a mistake. Sadly, that’s what I did, and my opinions and rating reflect that misconception.<br/><br/> ...]
 What a disappointment.<br/><br/>My kids grew up with Harry Potter books:  They sharpened their literary teeth on discussions of whether Snape was a villain or a hero and dug through the book for details to prove one another wrong before they ever heard the words "textual evidence" in school.  They looked forward to midnight premieres (books and movies) with the same excitement they'd reserve for a big vacation.  I fully expect to have grandchildren named after characters from the series.  I say this to show that we're not casual fans who've watched the movies a couple times.<br/><br/>I'll say it again:  What a disappointment this book turned out to be.<br/><br/>Yeah, it's a play, but the scenes are all short and void of anything resembling the enthralling world that exists in the first seven books.  The magical details that flesh out the characters' lives in the book series make only token appearances in this story line, and no new magic comes to life; instead, we see scenes from the original book series from different points of view.  It almost feels like an outline for another story -- as if the writer (I really doubt JKR did much of the writing) penciled in the bare bones of the plot line and intended to return to fill in the good stuff later --- but never returned.  It's not entertaining as a book, and I would not buy a ticket to see it on stage.<br/><br/>The characters do not behave in a manner consistent with their first-seven-book counterparts.  A character becomes a death eater?  A character essentially volunteers to die?  All of the adults are too busy to pay attention to their kids, yet they don't seem to have much of a social life, and although they have big career titles, we don't really see that aspect of their lives either.  So what are they doing?  This didn't "feel" like the world we know and love.  The worst sin, of course, was at the end when the group all went to witness a certain life changing event; sometimes you just have to bluntly speak the truth:  That was stupid.  The younger generation was no better.  The children's personalities aren't well developed, which is a let-down, given that in the original series the characters are what MAKES the book -- even the secondary characters seem to jump off the page with personalities full of both good and bad.  I also didn't like the heavy-handed homosexual overtones between the two main characters; it seemed stilted, as if the writers considered bringing in a theme of tolerance/acceptance ... but couldn't quite get around to deciding whether it was a theme or not, so it just comes off as a weird, incomplete tangent.<br/><br/>I started to give this book one star, which would be fair for the majority of the book ... but I gave it a two because of ONE SINGLE LINE Harry speaks in the final scene.  For those who've read the book, it's the line when he says, "Yes, but you forget that I never _______."  That one line was pure Harry Potter.  That line encompassed the friendship and dedication that umbrellas the whole series, and it speaks to Harry's bravery and his determination to do what's right at any cost.  That one line was better than the entire book combined.
 What this reads like to me is a rough outline of what should have been a whole new series of Harry Potter novels - which Mrs. Rowling couldn't be bothered to actually write, so she handed the draft off to a couple of theater guys, who crammed 4 or 5 books into 1 and called it a 'play'.<br/>The tensions between Harry and his son alone would have made an excellent novel 8 in the series, before we even get back to Hogwarts.<br/>Things like character development, layering of plot lines and the building of interest are lost arts in literature (and even more so in movies and TV !), but Mrs. Rowling is quite capable, her other books are proof of that.<br/>Not sure why she took the VERY easy way out on this one.<br/>Many of the characters are basically caricatures of their original selves, the plot has more holes than thinly sliced Swiss cheese, the whole thing's kind of a mess.<br/>It's ok if you look at it as a potential theater production, which has to be shortshort by necessity - can't keep the audience in the theater for 3 weeks - but it should come with a neon pink warning label : THIS IS FAN FICTION, NOT J.K. ROWLING !
 Better than I thought it would be.<br/>In my mind I definitely wasn't giving this one a fair chance. I don't like reading in playwright format, but I flew through this one. It's not even J.K. Rowling... but that didn't matter either. These two guys that wrote this one did her stories justice.<br/>Was I blown away to give it a perfect rating? No.<br/>Did I like it? Overall, yes.<br/>I liked how it picked up where the films and the last book leave off. You are left wondering what happens with Harry's family, since you get that glimpse. This story gives you everything you want and more.<br/>What I didn't care for was the bopping around to different scenes. I get it's a play so it's different, but some were to cut and dry for me. Especially coming from such huge books from Rowling. This was like a tidbit.<br/>Still good though, and fans of the series should read it.
 I made the mistake of rereading the original series immediately before reading this.  Mistake number one.<br/><br/>I purchased this book/script after being on the fence about it for months.  Mistake number two.<br/><br/>I read the many disappointed reviews and still spent money on it.  Mistake number three.<br/><br/>That said.  I'm sure the play itself really helps in covering up the rickety story line and many gaping plot holes.  I'd imagine the play is perfectly enjoyable to watch.  This, however was so disappointing to read.  And that's coming from a huge Harry Potter AND time travel fantasy fan.  Our beloved characters acted so far out of character throughout.  The story jumps several years in a single bound.  Everything is incredibly forced (relationships, personality traits, conversations) and doesn't sound like Rowling at all!<br/><br/>If you must buy this, I recommend reading only after its been a good year since you read the original 7 books.  That way you have a decent opportunity to forget as much as possible about the original story and don't compare the new story too closely with the originals.  I hated the last chapter of the 7th book for how forced and out of character it was, and this book was exactly the same.<br/><br/>And, if you're looking for a great fanfic, check out the James Potter series by G. Norman Lippert.
 This was a really, really tough read. Not because it's long (it's not) or because it uses complicated language (it doesn't), or even because it inspires deep thought (it won't)... It's a tough read because if you grew up loving Harry Potter, and you were excited for a new installment of the universe you love, this is going to be exactly like flying your car into the Whomping Willow.<br/><br/>The writing itself isn't bad, and it's formatted like a screenplay so it's a quick read. Unfortunately, that's about all positive I can say. All the characters that you know and love get completely ignored or are so out of character you might as well be reading a story about the actors who played them. The new characters (i.e. the kids of Harry, Hermione, Ron, Draco, etc.) get into misadventures that read like a bad fanfiction and the entire plotline (won't spoil anything) is a convoluted mess that leaves you feeling like someone confundus'd you.<br/><br/>Overall, skip. Hard skip.
 I will try not to include any spoilers here!<br/><br/>Like so many others, I was excited to travel back into the world of Harry Potter. After devouring the other books, I felt the famine of nothing new for years and years. I was ready for any tiny morsel I could get. However, this book did not satisfy the hunger.<br/><br/>To be honest, this read more like a fan fiction written by a casual reader who did not know the ins and outs of the books. There were many things that did not match with the original stories and many things that simply were left unexplained. I understand that this is a play and so, by nature, it could not go into the extraordinary details that the books themselves could. However, when they flat out change things (like how polyjuice is made) just to make the plot work, it seems lazy. And it is hard not to be angry about a book that completely destroys the character’s character. Without spoiling anything, know that there are a few characters that they will try to make you see in a completely different light, and it is not appreciated.<br/><br/>My complaints aside, it was nice to visit with the Potters and Weasleys again. But I think I could have gotten the same from a quick internet search. Maybe JK Rowlings will one day treat us to an actual book with a fully thought out story, until then I guess we are stuck accepting whatever we can get.<br/><br/>No disclosure needed - I am a “reviewer” of Amazon products and often get things at a discount, however this item I have bought at FULL price for my own personal use. Thank you for reading my review!
 This coda to the wildly successful and tremendously entertaining seven-volume Harry Potter series of novels that transformed Young Adult literature is rather peculiar. First, it deviates from the narrative form of the seven novels—it’s a play. And although it retains much of the charm and wonder of the Harry Potter universe, its true focus is somewhat more profound—the complicated dynamics of parent-child relationships.<br/><br/>In this story, our favorite Hogwarts trio—Harry, Hermione, and Ron—are all adults with children who attend (of course) Hogwarts. Draco Malfoy’s son Scorpius plays a major role in the story as well. As for the “cursed child” of the ambiguous title, there are three candidates: Scorpius, Harry’s son Albus Severus Potter, and Delphi, a mysterious young lady who turns out to have quite an ominous heritage.<br/><br/>The story deftly balances plot and character development, using time travel to display the complex relationships among generations, and although Harry himself is not the protagonist of this tale, his hybrid position as both orphaned child and husband/father sharply foregrounds the challenges of parenting faced by those who grew up without strong parental role models.<br/><br/>This might seem rather “heavy,” but Tiffany and Thorne manage to infuse the story with the requisite dose of Potter magic. Recommended for all muggles.
 3 stars says it all. it's okay<br/> This is not the Potter you know and love and for many have read the books and seen the movies more times then you can count.<br/>The charters of the story did not seam like they where who they where in the previous books this did not read or feel like a traditional Harry Potter. And not just because it was written as a play something that you quickly adjust to.<br/>As many of the other Reviews say this feels like a fanfic due to a lot of things and is still a good read but by no means matches the previous seven books we had developing the Harry Potter world.<br/>This is a okay edition to the Harry Potter world but you in no way leave it feeling the same way about Albus as you did about Harry in Book 1.<br/>Really the hardest parts of this is to get over how fast the time is paced it moves by really quickly and this is probably for the play's sake of not going on for 5hrs but it makes it and awkward read.<br/>This books has a lot of good in it to there are some parts that are really funny and some others that make your inner wizard/witch full of cheer and anticipation. This is after all a HARRY POTTER book we can't not be happy about it.<br/>I do think if this is played of well on stage it could be a very well preformed play.
 Both of my children disliked the book.  After reading I have to agree.  It is a weak story with characters that are dissimilar to their earlier selves.  The book is nothing more than a weak, dull Potter tale and poorly written at that.  I am honestly shocked by it's release considering the financial fortunes riding on the series.
 I believe it will look great as a play on the stage. As a book, it is just a flat story. Or, actually, a story trying to be deep but having only flat characters. I won't deny I have felt happy with this book as I haven't in ages. Almost ten years since the last Harry Potter came to my hands. Last night I experienced the same: I couldn't stop reading it - finished around 4 in the morning. But once it was over, came the disappointment. Those people are not people I once knew. Some of them still talk the same way they used to, even Dumbledore as a painting on the wall. But the majority of it sounds different. Like if someone just tried Rowling's in a polyjuice potion and forgot that talent wouldn't come along. I recommend you to read it because we fans deserve something after these many years, but keep your expectations low, please.<br/><br/>By the way, if it is a time-turner messing everything around, why is there a Golden-Snitch as a cover?
 it was bad. Me and my wife are avid potter heads. And we read the books together before bed almost every night. And watch the movies pretty frequently as well. The plot was very predictable and the characters were shells of themselves. I knew that Rowling didn't write this herself so I tried to be very forgiving, but as me and my wife neared the end of the book we found ourselves "oh good it's almost over."
 This is the 8th book in the Harry Potter series; although I cringe to call it that.  I think I will just say it takes place after the 7th book in the series and is more fan fiction than anything. This was okay but not great.  It was just something to extend the Harry Potter world that felt unnecessary to me.<br/><br/>Those who say this reads like fanfiction are correct; that is pretty much what it is.  That is not to say fanfiction is bad, and this was okay.  It just didn’t have the magic of the earlier books.  This is also written as a play (which I knew going in) and I am not a huge fan of reading stories in play form.<br/><br/>The majority of the story focuses around the next generation of boys (Harry's son Albus, and Draco's son) and their daddy issues.  That right there is pretty much the story.  Voldemort comes back into play in a sense and this kind of made me groan.  I am not a huge fan of the “returning of an already vanquished evil” theme.<br/><br/>Overall this was a quick read and it was okay, but I didn't love it.  My ten year old son, who is absolutely obsessed with Harry Potter right now, did really enjoy this book.  So, this book may work better for younger readers who just want a bit more Harry Potter in their lives.  I was fairly disappointed and would have been better off if I had never read this book.
 In this book, we are returned to the world of Harry Potter many years after the last novel. Potter and his friends are now grown up and even running things in some cases. The characters are faced with a new, yet familiar problem - I won't spoil it by giving details here.<br/><br/>The book was OK, but I was a little disappointed. I had hoped for more, especially given how long it had been since the last Harry Potter novel.<br/><br/>Maybe it was the play format instead of the novel format that I was used to for a Potter story. Seemed like something was missing making it hard to visualize the story in my head. If watching a play, the actors supply this missing element I guess.<br/><br/>In any case, the story just seemed to plod along. The characters seemed rather flat. The story itself seemed a little shallow. It was nice to see some favorite characters again, at least in some form.<br/><br/>One thing I noted was how much blank paper there was in this book. Seems they could have been a little less wasteful in formatting.
 It was nice to see the story to continue. However it was nothing like the wonderful world of Harry Potter that I spent so many hours of my time enjoying. It was corny and poorly written. I cringed at several parts. "Harry states " fine I'll finish you myself" cringe!!! I realize it was a play but still this was a sad sequel and I'm convinced it had very little input from JK.
 When I first heard that there was going to be a play sequel to the Harry Potter series, I was intrigued and hoped at some point I’d get to see it.  When they announced they were going to release the rehearsal script, I was happy, but didn’t plan to buy it right away.  I should know me better than that.  Yep, I caved and bought Harry Potter and the Cursed Child the week it came out.<br/><br/>If you aren’t yet familiar with the world of Harry Potter thanks to the wildly successful novels and equally wildly successful movies, then this book isn’t for you.  It assumes you know the backstory to what happens here, and if you don’t, you will be positively lost.  There are references to events and cameos by characters from the past books.  However, if you are already a fan, you’ll love diving into the latest story.<br/><br/>What is most notable about this book is that it is a bound copy of the rehearsal script for the play.  That means it reads very differently than a novel.  Essentially, it gives us dialogue and minimal stage direction and even less description.  It’s a different type of read, and you need to be in the proper mindset going into the book as a result.<br/><br/>The play actually opens with a scene we are already familiar with - the epilogue of the final novel.  In it, we see an adult Harry Potter sending his middle child off to his first year at Hogwarts.  From there, we see Albus Severus Potter landing in the unlikeliest house in the school and making a surprising best friend.  We breeze through a few scenes before really landing on the heart of the story, which involves time travel, alternative realities, and a chance to save an innocent from dying.  But when things go wrong, can Albus Potter undo what he has done?  Can Harry Potter work with his son to save the day?<br/><br/>I’ve seen some fans complain about this book being glorified fan fiction, and I can see their complaints.  The plot seems a little wacky overall, not the carefully thought out books in the series.  Yet, every time I started to feel that way, the characters pulled me back into the story and I forgot my complaints.  If you know and love these characters, it’s hard to not cheer for them.  I still feel like the basic premise of the story doesn’t sit completely right, but I don’t mind so much.<br/><br/>And that’s because I love the core cast of characters, and it was great to see them again.  I’m not sure I bought Ron’s personality in the story, but that’s my only real quibble with the characters.  There was a surprise ally along the way, and I loved seeing that relationship develop.  There were some truly touching moments as well.  Many of them were predictable, but that didn’t make them any less touching.<br/><br/>Those used to the immersive world of the Harry Potter novels will definitely miss that here.  Once again, we are reading a play, which is mostly dialogue.  The details of Harry’s world aren’t here because we would see that on stage.<br/><br/>And maybe that’s part of the reason I always had a hard time getting truly into the world like I would the books.  I kept picturing actors on a stage as events unfolded.  And the short scenes always made me think of how the scenes would change for an audience.  I tried to picture how they’d do the magic on stage as well.  That was distracting, although it is a personal issue.<br/><br/>The book is only 300 pages, so shorter than most of the novels.  Couple that with lots of white space because this is a script, and you have a very fast read.  Again, I think this helps explain some of the complaints from fans.<br/><br/>While I don’t think this will ever be anyone’s favorite book in the series, I’m certainly glad I read Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.  If I ever get a chance to see it, I’ll jump.  If you are a fan, go into it expecting a play script instead of a novel, and you’ll be just fine.
 There may be some "spoilers" in this post, so you've been warned.<br/>I see where they were going with this story. I really do. But I feel as if it was executed pretty poorly. The eighth story being in script form isn't what made it poor, although that didn't help either.<br/>The plot line itself is a sort of an interesting one. Voldemort having a child seemed pretty crazy, but intriguing nonetheless. It also interested me that Snape was in the mix along the way (I'm a huge fan of Snape) and that Scorpious was nothing like Draco and more like a Hermione type. Blah blah blah.<br/>What didn't interest me though...the rest of the story. Yes, Ron, Harry and Hermione showed glimpses of the Ron, Harry and Hermione we knew in the first seven books but I feel like they were not true to character in the eighth. That may be JKR and the other writers trying to convey how people can change with age but it did me no justice as an HP fan to learn that they had turned into pretty boring adults.<br/>I think JKR needs to write a full story with no contributions from anyone else and with a few differences in the plot line...and just maybe it will be a good eighth installment to the series I revolve my life around.
 Well, this is a mite disappointing.  As someone that grew up with the books and films, I was quite looking forward to this.  While the character of Scorpius is fun and there are some good moments, I find it severely lacking.  As others have pointed out, some of the characters don't seem like themselves (this is most noticeable with Ron).  Then there's the whole Voldemort takeover alternate timeline - it seemed like something straight out of Tara Gilesbie's infamous fanfiction "My Immortal", it doesn't seem like something Rowling would write.  I half expected Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way and her buddies to show up.  The Blood Ball?  Voldemort Day?  You're joking, right?<br/><br/>The play itself seems to be getting rave reviews and apparently this isn't the final version.  I'm interested in the final version to see what's been changed (and hopefully improved).  For now, this is a disappointment.
 3.5 stars...but let me explain...<br/><br/>Like most fans of Harry Potter, the idea and possibilities of an 8th entry into the series was always something fun to ponder and discuss. Rowling leaving us with the image of Potter's kids going off to Hogwarts, following in their famous father's footsteps also helped fuel the speculation and fan theories. However, that was one of the most perfect endings in all forms of entertainment. Aside from Breaking Bad, I honestly don't think there was ever a more perfect conclusion to a series.<br/><br/>So when the announcement of The Cursed Child was made a while back, I, as I'm sure many other fans did, felt a sense of excitement, while, at the same time, that nagging worry that, as Hollywood has shown with horrible and unasked for sequels (here's looking at you Zoolander 2 and Dumb and Dumber To), The Cursed Child would be a huge let down.<br/><br/>Thankfully, I can safely say that The Cursed Child in and of itself was not as bad as I feared. The format is definitely odd (we will get to that in a moment), and it's pretty damn obvious that though this is Rowling's concept(s), it is not her voice on paper (also more on that later), the story and overall feel is Harry Potter through and through. The wonder of Hogwarts still exisits, the dark magic of Voldemort and his death eaters still permeates and gives the story the dark feelings of the later entries into the series, and Albus and Scorpious aren't necessarily as strong and Harry and his friends, but together they make a good team; ones you can't help but root for, even if Albus is a huge ass brat most of the time. It's also an incredibly fast and easy read (I read this in 2 days, while in the midst of one of the busiest and hectic weeks of 2016), which should come as no surprise since pretty much all of the Harry Potter books are that way.<br/><br/>I just wish that Rowling and everyone else involved would have chosen to go down the normal, safe path and publish this as a novel instead of the script format. I have no problem with the idea of doing the entire thing in a play production. In fact, I think that's actually a pretty cool idea, especially now at a time when things like Hamilton are all the rage. The problem, however, is that it completely fails when translated to the page. Maybe it's because I've never been a big fan of the stage, or had any interest in being an actor, but whatever the case, trying to read Harry Potter in strictly dialogue and stage direction wasn't what I would call easy. Unlike a novel that flows together in paragraphs and sentences, a page of speaking instructions and commands to actors is jarring and takes the reader out of the story. I'm not saying it doesn't work (go read Shakespeare's Star Wars to see what I mean), I just don't think it did here. Don't get me wrong, I think this would look absoleuylt beautiful on the stage in London, but it sure doesn't look beautiful when you're trying to read it.<br/><br/>And while it's true that Rowling's fingerprints are all over The Cursed Child, I don't think she was the one that did any of the actual writing. It was like she gave Jack Thorne and John Tiffany an outline and let them have at it. While the dialogue between characters is clever and realistic, the feel is gone. I don't know if that makes much sense, but when reading this, there never seemed to be any of Rowling's original touch. Not that I'm totally blaming her (she has the Cormoran Strike series to write, a movie to produce, and a personal life to live), but without her at the helm of the writing process, it shows.<br/><br/>I really wanted to give The Cursed Child 4 stars, and I very nearly did. The problem is that in all honesty I couldn't. Of course it was better than expected in the story part, and the twist at the end, had I not accidentally read about it before, was one of the better ones I can remember in recent memory, however that can't be overlooked by the disinteresting format and the absence of Rowling herself. Not that my review is gonna stop sales, however. The book is already a worldwide bestseller and on track to be England's fastest selling book of all time. Not to mention tickets for the play are coming in at upwards of 1,500 bucks. So in that regard, it's still a rousing success.
 Having come to Harry Potter and his world later than most, I can honestly say that the whole series is really fresh in my mind. This play was a bitter disappointment. I knew it was a play, and I have no problem with that format. But there was little to nothing enjoyable about this reading experience. I honestly wish I had never read it. The characters are poorly written. The characters we know and love- Harry, Hermoine, Ron- are poor imposters of themselves. Ron is portrayed more or less like a bumbling idiot. Hermoine is conceited and shallow. Harry is a mere shadow of the man he should be. I don’t care if Harry Potter didn’t know his dad- I can’t imagine him so self-absorbed that he can’t figure out how to parent, and that is how he is portrayed in this book. And it’s not just the characters we loved... it’s the characters we loved to hate. Spoiler alert: Draco Malfoy confesses he never saw himself as a powerful ministry person... he just wanted to be a professional quidditch player and be happy. Barf!! Snape, when confronted with those who know he was really good all along, takes up the torch and plays the hero. Yeah.... no. The whole idea that Voldemort had a child... and by Bellatrix Lestrange?!?... is laughable. We’re supposed to believe that while he was plotting to get rid of Harry Potter once and for all, Voldemort took time out to impregnate Bellatrix, and she had the baby in the Malfoy mansion before the battle of Hogwarts? It’s honestly insulting to anyone who actually read the real books. I honestly cannot think of anything I liked about this story. The characters were poorly fleshed out, the dialogue was cheesy, the story was weak. I’m not going to tell you what to do, but I sincerely wish I had never read this book- let alone purchased it. What a waste.
 I'll preface this by saying, I'm not a literary genius by any stretch of the imagination.  I enjoy reading, and thoroughly enjoyed the original Harry Potter books.  That being said, I enjoyed this "book"/playscript for what it was... just an added story to the Harry Potter storyline.  Nothing particularly special, no sense of continued wonder that was built through the original books.  I think that's one of the things I loved about the original books, there a constant sense of "ooooh, where is this going next?" and general speculation from book to book.  This was more of a short story, that didn't have that sense of wonder for me.  It told a pretty good story, but it definitely began and ended for me.<br/><br/>It took me a while to write this review.  I think after reading the Deathly Hallows, my imagination came up with an idea of what would happen to Harry and the rest of the gang.  Where they would go, and what they would do.  This book destroyed that, and I think that gave an immediate negative bias toward the story.  I had expectations that weren't met, but that shouldn't weigh in on whether it was a good story or not.  Here I am a year later, and I can say I did enjoy the story.  If you have similar thoughts about what happened to Harry and the gang after the Deathly Hallows, let it go before reading this.... read it as objectively as possible, and let it sit for a while before you really judge it.
 It was just okay.  To me, it read like a fanfic, scratched out in the dead of night under the covers and with a flashlight by a lonely Scorpius/Albus shipper.  If I want to read fanfiction...and I DON'T...there are plenty of places to go for free.  It isn't even that this is a play; I knew that going in.  It's the out-of-character personalities, inconsistencies, plot holes, and mostly, the fanfic tripe (give me a freakin' break) are a turn-off.  I gave it one star only because I enjoyed seeing Snape again.  Lacking a Time-Turner, I'm going to perform a Confundus charm on myself to forget this ever happened.
 It simply isn't a good story and it reads unfortunately like bad fan fiction.  As a long time fan who has read and retread this series countless times I am very disappointed. Time travel as a plot device needs to be done right to work and it simply doesn't in this. At no point was I overly concerned about the fate of the characters nor was I sympathetic with main character albus potter. Maybe the script format makes it difficult to connect with characters and understand their motivations but I found the whole parent son relationship problem forced down the readers throats and eye roll worthy.  Spoilers ahead to save trouble of reading.  What good moments are Hidden in mediocrity<br/><br/>Albus potter is indeed sorted into slytherin and becomes best friends with Scorpius malfoy. Albus is black sheep of family with no great magic talent and isn't good at anything. Hermonie is minister of magic, Harry is head of magical law enforcement and Ron helps run The joke shop. Harry finds a custom time turner during a raid and is approached by Amos diggory to use it to save Cedric and he refuses. Albus overhears and decides to steal the time turner and drags Scorpius with him. The time line is almost destroyed blah blah blah ending with battling evil descendant of a death eater who wants to prevent dark lords fall during the night of Harry's parents death in godrics hallow.
 Book 7 of HP put such a final, satisfying conclusion on such a long winding story and I feel the new play might damage the whole HP experience for new readers. The play is a fanfic glossing of characters, events and objects that lovers of the series may go gaga over but add little value to the literary legacy it follows, often breaking against predetermined rules, boundaries and personality traits that were meticulously set up in the original 7 books. It's not about it being in play format, it's not about introducing new characters, there is a story there about children and their parents that's worth hearing. Some of the best works of art give you enough information to reach your own conclusions, allowing people to find their own meanings as they apply in their own lives. This play takes a backhoe to peaceful grave sites, sleepwalking us through what this or the other much adored character would have thought about everything if they were point-blank asked without leaving any room for speculation or interpretation... sigh...<br/>My concern is that if the consensus comes down that this "new conclusion" to the series is kinda meh, future generations are going to see the series as a WHOLE, as EIGHT BOOKS, hearing that the ending is sub-par, lessening the chances that they be willing to invest the time to reading that many book at all. "You have to read Harry Potter, it's one of the best reading experiences I've ever had," has become, "Read Harry Potter, it's amazing, but maybe wait a few years to read Cursed Child and take it with a huge heaping spoonful of salt." Overnight I've become an HP Purist. That was not how I thought my Monday would go, lemme tell ya.<br/>tl;dr: The new play is fanboy fodder and it's going to mess up the brand's place in history if considered "Book 8."
 I wish I could give this book a lower rating. I am a huge Harry Potter fan, have been for over a decade. I could care less that the book was written in a script format (I know some people were mad about it) My issue is with the horrible plot, awful writing, poorly developed and unbelievable characters....I cannot conceive how JK Rowling allowed this to be published with her name on it. There are so many parts of the plot that contradict or ignore the real plot in the HP books. So disappointed.
 Rowling, I want my money back! I have an idea - everyone, who is as disappointed as I am, let's send our books back to Rowling! How come her name appeared on this?.. Do not spend your money and time. It's a disaster. The characters are not themselves. In HP original series it took 1800+ pages to describe HP 4 years in Hogwarts. Here for his son it took - guess how many?-- 10! Yes, ladies and gentlemen, TEN pages! 10 pages for 4 years. Still, it could have been good if there were no such horrible mistake which make me think that the authors consider readers/audience complete idiots. SPOILER: Act three in the end: Albus is left without his wand which has been taken from him and snapped. This fact was mantioned two times. Act four: "Albus opens both doors with his wand". How come? When and where did he obtain his wand again?<br/>As I said: Rowling, I want my money back!
 I, like many others, didn't look closely enough to see that this book was not written by J.K. Rowling. While I was not put off by the script format (since this is a copy of the script for the stage play rather than a novel), I was very much put off by the unbelievable plot and the frankly ridiculous dialogue. I have nothing against fanfiction (which this so clearly is), but I wish I had known that Rowling had no hand in it AT ALL, and that it had been better written. I've read better fanfictions online for free from authors who only wrote for their pleasure and not for money. Shame on the publisher for subjecting fans to this cash-grab.
 After reading the Harry Potter script you come away with a disappointment that this is just a Script for a theater play. I've said this before when being critical of other Fanfiction authors, in this media you have to describe the environment and scene that you're writing about. Being it's a script for a theater play, it didn't have a lot of environment context in the story. To be honest, I don't think JKR wrote a good deal of this Script. In fact, most of her writings were borrowed from the last chapter in Book 7 or from her own notes about how Lilly and James died and an odd character like the lady who delivers candy on the Hogwarts Express. Only JKR could have that much background details concerning a bit character in the HP Universe. The rest I can safely say was John Tiffany and Jack Thorne who are both accomplished theater writer and theater director respectively. I can only assume that they gave the Prop / Stage Manage a great deal of free-reign to decide what goes where and how it looks to the theater audience. According to London reviews a great many Theater critics describe the changing magical background scenes as "ground-breaking". Which if that's the case, makes Tiffany and Thorne a pair of geniuses for not "cementing" the background in the Script. Great for Theater, not great for readers of a hardback in Panera Bread.<br/><br/>But enough of the lack of JKR touches, what about our Trio and their children. Eh... not so much. I think Charlie Weasley, a minor character, had more lines in Book 4 or even Book 3 than did the siblings that weren't Albus Severus Potter, Scoripus Malfoy, and to some small degree Rose Granger-Weasley. Other than the last chapter of Book 7, which is almost copied word for word, you never hear from the other children... at all - for the rest of the story. I think anybody else who reads that would've like to have read more. There are some good points to mention. First, is the endless time dimensional reality love of Ron and Hermione. The time period changed repeatedly but the love dynamic never really changed between them. In fact, when they weren't married to one another in a different time reality both were worse off and yet they still felt as if there was still something that should've been shared between them. Which is sure to drive the Draco - Hermione or the Harry - Hermione shippers insane. Not even in a different time reality do you have a Harry - Hermione marriage. Imagine that.<br/><br/>One question that always had me wondering since Book 7 was definitively answered. If for say, Harry decided not to return and instead decided to stay with Prof. Dumbledore behind the veil at the mystical train station what would come of Voldemort, the War, and Ron and Hermione. Hermione becomes a failed leader of the resistance with Ron and Severus at her side. Truly Harry is needed to defeat Voldemort and win the war.<br/><br/>Side notes: Ron was treated a bit poorly as a funny and brave sidekick. Hermione is the Minister of Magic, Harry the Chief of Magical Law Enforcement, and Ron owns a Joke Shop. No mention of Ron ever being an Auror for a time before taking over at WWW with George.<br/><br/>As for the Lead of the story, Albus Severus Potter, at first, I didn't really liked our Protagonist. Albus, was a Slytherin and it showed more so than Scoripus Malfoy. However, I must admit he grew on me. Albus showed himself more Harry Potter than adult Harry Potter. My favorite character, hands down, was the calm, rational, and good Scoripus Malfoy. He should've been a Gryffindor and not a Slytherin. I think in the Malfoy clan, he would've been a Black sheep of the family. Even funnier was his unrequited liking of Rose Granger-Weasley. Who to me was about as stuck up as you can imagine. I did not like Rose at all. She inherited all the ambitions of Hermione and the Quidditch abilities of Ron and none of the humility of either.<br/><br/>Quite simply this was a story of the relationship of Father, Harry Potter, and Son, Albus Potter. It showed a dramatic and realistic approach, but I never could truly sympathize with either. I guess this makes them realistic and a bit disappointing.
 JK Rowling could do no wrong in my world until she put her name on this and allowed someone to butcher her beautifully crafted characters because this is TERRIBLE. I cannot believe I paid for this. I am a huge Potterhead, but this was ABSOLUTE AND UTTER TRASH. I had to physically stop myself from throwing my ipad on the floor at times because that's how FRUSTRATINGLY AWFUL this "play" is. It makes a MOCKERY of Harry Potter. It's like reading fan fiction by someone who didn't quite understand the characters. Didn't quite get that Ron or Hermione or Harry would never do or say the things they're being made to say and do. Biggest disappointment of 2016
 This reads like the worst example of angst-y fan fiction I've ever seen. Scorpius and Albus constantly whinging about whether it's OK to hug, Hermione and Ron pulling apart so no one sees them kissing (they're MARRIED!), Harry vacillating between asking advice and ignoring it ... oh, the drama, the anxiety, the hand-wringing! It's as if they not only haven't grown or developed since we last saw them, but have regressed. It isn't due to being presented in "play" form; I can read a play and envision the emotions and descriptions that are left out. It's due to the terrible character "development" (of which there is very little) and the way in which beloved characters (Ron, Hermione, Harry, Draco, Snape, Dumbledore, etc.), who were developed lovingly and extensively over 7 previous books, suddenly act like whiny babies, or broadly comedic fools, or over-sensitive children instead of adults. Professor McGonagall, one of my favorite characters in the "real" books, loses her sternness, her sense of fairness, her common sense, and comes off as vacillating and foolish. Dumbledore seems to be suffering from old age dementia, with his bumbling "advice" and teariness. I am a huge Harry Potter fan, and fully expected to love and cherish this book. Instead I HATED it. I refuse to even add it to my Harry Potter bookshelf, but instead donated it to my local library. What a stunning disappointment.
 In short: the delivery and condition was fine, but the book wasn't great.<br/><br/>In long(er): My girlfriend has the trunk-style boxed set of all the original Harry Potter books (she is quite the HP fan). I'm 26, and it wasn't until last summer that I finally read any Harry Potter books. I am an avid reader, just never got around to them, didn't see what all the fuss was about. Then I read them, and instantly fell for the writing style. (If you like Sherlocky stories, check out Rowling's Cormoran Strike detective series under her pseudonym Robert Galbraith.) She's such a detailed writer, already one of my favorites; her details are so vivid, her descriptions come to life in ink.<br/><br/>My girlfriend had been on the waiting list for this book from the get. A new Harry Potter book? Score! We both read it in a matter of days. It wasn't at all what we expected.<br/><br/>First off, it's manuscript style (remember those Shakespeare plays in high school? right...). I don't mind that, because dialogue is very important in any story. However, it loses details that you love with a book--there are no thoughts or internal monologues and no detailed background, except for the clunky one-person-is-explaining-to-the-dimwitted-other dialogue format.<br/><br/>Second, I was acutely aware throughout that I was reading a ready-for-performance story. Every character is described enough to get an idea of general features, but vague enough that I couldn't pinpoint any specific trait (e.g. Harry's goofy hair, Ron's red hair, McGonagall's always-on stern expression). It's clear to me that they were writing this story to avoid pigeonholing themselves in future casting. Basically any one person can be every character in the play--which is great for aspiring actors, but less so for those of us just trying to get lost in a story.<br/><br/>Third, the action was written for a play, which relies heavily on visuals in some scenes. "Epic wand battle" isn't enough for the lover of the scene breakdown. That's not an exaggeration, that is an actual quote (though now I can't find it to reference, so I hope I'm accurate).<br/><br/>Fourth, the ending was abrupt at best. Without giving much away, I'll simply say this: the whole book is filled with the anticipation of rising and rising and rising action, and finally at the climax, it's just done. Even in Scooby Doo the final plan goes at least a bit wrong. I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop until I realized it was already over, and we cut to epilogue-grade garbage for the last two scenes.<br/><br/>If you must must must read this book, check it out from a library or borrow it from a friend, it's not worth the purchase. If you can, wait until the movie comes out, which I'm sure will happen eventually.<br/><br/>PS. Though JK Rowling gets bolded first bill, the story actually was a collaboration between three people and the manuscript itself was written by one of the other collaborators. I think that's part of the reason it is so stylistically different from the other books. I also am not sure how much of this is Rowling's work rather than being a glorified "fanfic" written by two guys who were fortunate enough to have input from the original creator.
 I love all things Harry Potter.  This is very childish.  It was too easy to write this as a play, which glosses over much needed details and imagery.  The characters are not developed in any way.  You don't feel any compassion or love for any of them.  Wish J.K. Rowling would have written a follow up instead of these guys.  That said - I was happy to read anything Harry Potter - but prolly should have waited until I could buy the book at a yard sale for a quarter.
 I was excited to get this.  It came in just a couple of days.  Great service, Amazon.  I waited til the weekend so I could settle in and get lost in another JKR work.  I expected it to be a different sort of read since it's a script but I've read lots of scripts and never had any problem enjoying the story.  I read the entire book in two sittings; kept waiting to be drawn in...the next page....ok the next chapter.  I don't know how much of this was actually written by JKR and how much was written by the two co-authors, but this reads like a mediocre fan fic.  I've never been disappointed in anything with Jo Rowling's name on it, until now.  There were a couple of instances where details were completely wrong, as though the author perhaps didn't read the HP books closely enough to catch them.  The best I can say is that I am glad I have it so I'm not missing a piece of the HP collection.  Unlike the 7 HP books, however, I won't need a second copy of this one to keep in good shape as I wear out the first with rereadings.  I won't bother to reread this.  I also won't waste my time going to see it on stage next time I go to London.
 Having been a dedicated fan since the age of five, I was very excited to receive this book in the mail today. Unfortunately I must say it was a bit of a letdown. The story read like a fanfic piece and the original characters did not really seem to speak to me in the way they did in the original books. The new characters also seemed sort of flat, and I didn't really feel attached to them in the same way as the original characters. This could be attributed to the fact that this is a screenplay and not a book, but I've read other screenplays that simply felt more involved. I really hate to give this story three stars, but the whole thing felt like a forced and unnecessary addition to the canon universe.
 Contradicts the rules, characters and pretty much everything we learned about Harry Potter and the Harry Potter world. Seriously did the people who actually wrote ever read ANY Harry Potter book EVER? I'm not paying good money for another piece of crap like this which only sells because it Harry Potter and so must automatically be "Popular" I schlepped through the whole thing hoping it would get better (It got worse) and because I didn't want to have wasted the money I would otherwise have spent on two or possibly three book that were actually good. Reads like bad fan fiction from a wannabe fan. How can you characterize even Voldemort wrong? This shows how. Not even train wreck good. Update: I don't usually hold grudges about books but even after over five months I still feel cheated by this book. It took a world and characters that I loved and pooed all over them...it's the content that makes this so horrible not the format.
 It's a strange choice for the publishers to label this as "Harry Potter #8," including on the actual dust jacket. That sets up unfair and unreasonable expectations.<br/><br/>This is, of course, a stage play, which Rowling only had a hand in creating. As a result, it's missing a lot of the world building and internal dialogue she includes in her novels, making the whole thing seem thin when compared to the previous seven stories.<br/><br/>Taken, not as a novel, but as a script it's OK. There's definite heart there and Albus and Scorpius in particular are charming characters. But Harry Potter stories rely a great deal on things that don't translate great to the stage and not at all to the script book. The recent news that Warner Brothers was looking at turning this into up to three movies is, for once, actually pretty good news, as the spectacle that doesn't translate well as a script will work perfectly on the screen and the additional time will hopefully flesh out some of the parts that feel rather thin as-is.<br/><br/>This is worth reading for Harry Potter fans, but they should go in expecting something much less than previous Potter works.
 I forced myself to finish this so that I could, in good conscience, write this review.  The following comments are my own opinion.<br/>Edgar Rice Burroughs beginning writing Tarzan, John Carter of Mars, At the Earth's Core, etc. when, as a struggling salesman, he read the serial novels in magazines, and said, "I can write something this bad!"  This is how I feel about the HP and the Cursed Child script - even I could have written something this terrible!  The characters were one dimensional distortions of the ones we know form the HP novels, the dialogue was shallow and insufferable, and the plot entirely predictable given the THOUSANDS of previous works dealing with the consequences of time travel.  There is absolutely nothing original here, and it has all been done, and better done, by many, many others.  It was terribly boring, and I found myself wondering if the writer(s) were paid by the word, because it was the "script that would not die!"  I thought it would never end!  I couldn't stand it, and I don't know how JKR would have allowed her name to appear on it.  The entire story deserved 30 pages or less for the entire plot (a very weak one) to have been written, and, frankly, I think should have never been written.<br/><br/>The "magic" was all a re-do of prior stuff all mashed up and contrived.  The characters were NOT the ones from the novels.  The story line was a boring re-do of countless time travel stories.  The plot moved forward at the speed of a receding glacier.  I only wish I could sell my Kindle version at a used book store, but, alas, I can't, and can only delete from my devices.<br/><br/>While I have some hope for the upcoming movie, I"m canceling my pre-order of the script.  I've learned my lesson!
 There are many exhaustive reviews listing all the problems with this book, so I am just going to say that I agree with everyone who gave this garbage one star. As someone who loves everything Harry Potter, it makes me sad to see his name on the cover.<br/><br/>Note to the poor souls trying to defend this monstrosity: it's not the fact that it's a stage play that I hate, it's the content, including the plot and all the characters.
 I have to admit, I took a sneak peak at what people were saying before I purchased this product and so I kind of got the gist before I started reading.  While this "book" is far from what we have come to expect from J.K. Rowling and the Happy Potter world, it reads much more like fan fiction.  This script format would need a lot of work to get it to the big screen but overall the plot resembles the trails we have come to see.  It is just too bad that J.K. did not more of a hand in crafting this script.  Better luck next time!  Anxiously awaiting anything J.K. puts out to get this sad attempt out of my brain.  I had high hopes and was sadly disappointed but another Happy Potter wanna be! **TEARS**
 The two star rating is for the simple fact that it was good to read old characters you know and love again. The missing stars are for the fact the dialogue fell flat and felt forced. Honestly, what real teen boys really talk about friendship and hug each other all the time? Not only that, but Albus acted like nothing more than a spoiled, entitled brat... The namesake of Dumbledore deserved to be written so much better and fitting of the namesake. While it was cool that Albus was in Slytherin with Malfoy, Malfoy acted more like he belonged in Hufflepuff. This screenplay deserved to be written so much better, and I was quite disappointed to have waited so long for this to come out to only be let down.
 So Predictable and so sadly written ;(<br/>Oh I so wanted to like this book but I just couldn't! It was so predictable and there was none of the depth of charature that usually is in her Harry Potter books. Jo and her cohorts failed to epic proportions. The writing itself was so-so at best..there were no moments when I was like that's better it was just a slow start. It never got better and it ended as I had figured out by the second scene....I hope the live version has some great visual effects to make up for a bad script.
 As a fan of Harry Potter and JK Rowling's superb books, I found this one disappointing. It missed the mark since it was written as a play. Rowling is one of the best children's authors of all time but we did not see this in the play. In some ways it felt disconnected - you could actually see it was written by different people in parts of it.<br/>i think that the characters were portrayed well. Harry would have changed a lot from the time of the last book. He's an adult now struggling with work and raising his kids. Albus is a whiny teen who has never known the real struggles people went through to create a safe world. He's like so many teenagers I know today. They create problems for themselves out of nothing because life has been a bit too easy for them.<br/>Scorpius is truly my favorite character. I don't want to give anything away by saying much more though!<br/>I have read it twice and the second time was better than the first. It is not my favorite Potter book by any means.
 Dialogue between characters is horrendous.  Main characters from previous 7 don't "feel" the same at all, their personalities have been butchered.
 I love the Harry potter books. Sadly this is not one of those. This seems to be a play written by other people who just got the"ok" from Rowling to use her characters. I felt no emotional connection to the main characters and spent a fair amount of time trying to wrap my head around the adult characters who were supposedly Harry, Ron, Hermione etc. They seem to all have had personality transplants since they were teenagers. On top of that, the plot is boring and predictable. When I reread the Harry potter books in the future, I will be doing my best to forget that Rowling gave this play her seal of approval.
 This was obviously one of the most anticipated releases of the year. Harry Potter has a huge following and many people from my generation (myself included) grew up with Harry. These books are hands down the reason I learned to love reading. There’s also a few things you should know about this installment, if you don’t already: its written as a script and while the story is from J.K. Rowling, it still had to be translated to a play form so we don’t get a lot of the descriptions and detail we are used to in the books. There were absolutely phrases I recognized and I was so appreciative of that. I’m not saying this is necessarily a disappointment, and I know it was necessary to adapt the story to a script. Still, I missed it.<br/><br/>That being said, did I enjoy the story? Yes, I did. I honestly did not have any expectations, because how could you when the story is told in such a different format? In a way, I think Rowling is smart to do it this way. If she had simply written another book, would I have been disappointed if it didn’t live up to the first seven? Probably. Most likely. But with a play..its new and original. Its a standalone, in a way, and I can appreciate it for what it is.<br/><br/>As for the story line, there were many aspects that were really heartwarming. There were elements from past books, and scenes with characters I never imagined I would see again. There are relationships I was happy to watch develop. I don’t want to say too much about the plot though. The story mainly follows Albus Severus Potter and his adventure. There’s not as much time spent at Hogwarts, not as much magic and spells, yet I still enjoyed it. It is not, by any means, a continuation of the series. It is a standalone play, but we do get to revisit our beloved characters one last time. There was so much nostalgia with this story!<br/><br/>The dialogue is also hilarious. Ron is still as goofy as ever, and Hermione is equally bossy.<br/><br/>“Ron: Honestly, every time I sit down I make an “ooof” noise. An “ooof.” And my feet- thr trouble I’m having with my feet- I could write songs about the pin my feet give me- maybe your scar is like that.”<br/><br/>Page 67<br/><br/>Harry is still same old Harry, and I was very pleased with his relationship with Ginny.<br/><br/>“Harry: I’d do anything for him.<br/><br/>Ginny: You’d do anything for anybody. You were pretty happy to sacrifice yourself for the world.”<br/><br/>Page 277<br/><br/>Oh and Scorpius was darling! I loved his character. His relationship with Albus made me nostalgic for the Ron, Hermione, Harry days.<br/><br/>I also really did love all of the references to Harry’s adventures from his childhood. I experienced some major Harry Potter nostalgia going through this play. The ending was also very poetic, in a way we ended where everything began. Overall, I was pleased with this Harry Potter story. It was a lovely tribute to our favorite characters, and we even learned a little more about some of them. My only regret is that I can’t see it on stage! Maybe one day :)
 I have real all the Harry Potter books NUMEROUS TIMES,  and now add a mom I am reading them to my kids.  They are a part of my life have been for many many years.  That being said, I fully believe this is one if the ABSOLUTE WORST BOOKS I have read as an adult.  The fact it was written as a play made it IMPOSSIBLE it get immersed in like the other HP books.  The plot was STUPID, the story line was childish.  It horrible.  I want my money back and the last several nights I have read this POS.  I WILL NEVER GET THAT TIME BACK.
 As everyone here has already said, this book...err "script" wasn't written by JK Rowling.  It's sad that's she has allowed her name to be plastered on the front of this book, because the writing style doesn't even come close to her own.  It makes me wonder if she'd read the script, or only saw the production.<br/>The best was to summarize this explanation, is to compare it to "Wicked".  We're all familiar with The Wizard of Oz, but no one ever thought what had happened there before Dorothy arrived.  That's why the 'book' (not script) was popular (pun intended), &amp; eventually written as a screenplay.<br/>This script is being touted as "Book 8".  Sadly, that's not what it is at all.  JK ruined the characters by allowing someone else to "puppeteer" her characters which she slowly allowed to grow and thrive.  It's proof that a "Book 9" won't be written, because she'll have to clean up what was essentially a ghost writer did to her characters.<br/>The only way she'd be able to revive HP, would be to write a prequel. And that d need to be a direct prequel to The Harry Potter series.  NOT Fantastic Beasts, which only links to Potter's world because he reads the book at Hogwarts.<br/>Book 8 has essentially ended Harry Potter for good.<br/>It's fantastic to be able to imagine the characters coming back to life in our heads, but sadly, I think this may have been "money motivated".
 To be honest, I heard there was a new Harry Potter book and just downloaded it.  I started realizing, saw it was a play and then did some research.  I would have read it either way, but I found that the general consensus on the internet helped me not be overly excited.  I enjoy reading plays, but I know that is not the case for many.  I found that in this format, and possibly due to the additional authors, there was a lot of detail lacking that was in the other books.  The overall story was pretty good, but I could have survived without it.  It doesn't flow along perfectly with the other books.  It is not only due to the play format, but the overall writing style is not the same.  Word choice, detailed descriptions, dialog is all different.  It seems "cheaper" sort of.  The new characters are very interesting and I liked the overall plot.
 I was so very disappointed in this book. It was very hard for me to get through this book. To read a Harry Potter book should not be a struggle I have to force myself to do. I love Harry Potter. I was so excited to read this. I hated that it was written as a script.
 Incredibly disappointed.  It wasn't that it was written in play form, but it was obvious it wasn't actually written by JKR.  Our favorite friends, Harry, Ginny, Ron and Hermione all act out of character.  I honestly wish I had never read it.  My boys are HUGE HP fans, but I don't want to let them read it, as I don't want the magical world ruined for them!
 Let me start by stating this is not a novel this is a play, so anyway expecting the enriching Wizarding world we all miss may be sorely disappointed. The overall plot is focused around the budding relationship between two unlikely characters. Scorpius Malfoy and Albus Potter, but with the pace that the writing takes it falls short for the character building that Rowling was infamous for. One moment we see our first year students trying to summon their broomsticks and then within fifty pages we have both protagnist as third year students, top it all off with a cliche plot of time travel and turmoil with Harry copping to be a better parent and you have The Cursed Child. I would consider "The final installment"  to be mere fan fiction that Rowling provided her seal of approval; nothing more. As far as I'm concerned the Wizarding world ended with Deathly Hallows
 This book was disappointing... It did not have the magic as the original series Rowlings wrote.... I was looking forward to being pulled in .... spellbound .... that only Rowlings can do.... but her magic was missing.... I did not recognize any of the personalities given to the original characters.... I felt very letdown..... This book was nothing like her others...It was a very awkward read.
 I've been a Harry Potter fan since mid-2004, and I absolutely loved reading "the eighth book" at last! I bought it yesterday, couldn't put it down all day, and just finished reading it today! It is spectacular to a highly magical degree, and as I live too far from New York City to ever hope to see the play live, I am immensely grateful that the official script is available to buy online. Thank you so much, J. K. Rowling, for allowing people such as myself to experience the magic without having to travel great distances and pay money for tickets we may never be able to afford to see Cursed Child performed live on stage. Who knows? Maybe someday they'll make it a movie, or something more accessible, but for the meantime, I am very happy with the script and my own imagination, fueled by my never-ending adoration for J. K. Rowling and her magical, wonderful world of Harry Potter! We LOVE you, Jo!
 Okay, let me preface my review by saying I love the Harry Potter series and have written in support of it to those Christians who believe it is contrary to their faith or fosters interest in those things which are contrary to Christianity. I have reread the books a number of times. But I couldn't finish this. I knew it was a play and was prepared to like it in that format. But what I found here was disappointing in any number of ways. Character development was lacking or inconsistent with the original books. Jumps in the story (narrative line, character inconsistencies, etc) were more than a play-format could make up for or legitimize (what I mean is one expects jumps in the story when reading a play moving from from scene to scene or act to act but one cannot expect casting something in a play format make up for lacks or lacunae in the story itself; that is, at least partly,what I believe happened here). Sorry, but I gave this two major attempts to read it through (in case the problem was on my end of things) and still couldn't do it. Maybe it gets really good farther in but I never made it that far. Really disappointing.
 After my first complete read-through of the book/script (or what I'm going to call the Harry Potter edition of Season 1 of "The Flash"), I feel like I'm reading a "meh"-written fan-fiction sequel. The storyline is messy (which is kind of intended) and I don't fully follow with the character development of the main characters (both the children and adult generation). Perhaps I'd enjoy it more if I watched it live.<br/><br/>Anybody else feel a bit unimpressed? I'd still recommend it since it's a pretty short/fast read and it's interesting to see J.K. Rowling's insight into the lives of Harry Potter and his friends/family (the story takes place around 2 decades after the Battle of Hogwarts). Overall, I'd give this book a 2.5/5.
 *** Little Spoilery But Not Too Spoilery ***<br/><br/>The Pottercast podcast once started a verbal story series that focused on the kids and what they did at school 19 years later, including Scorpius. I hate to admit it but that one captured the characters better I think.  I am a huge Potter fan. I’m a huge Rowling fan.  I enjoyed the screen play for what it was, but I found some of the characterizations a little odd. Specifically, Harry and Ginny were odd to me.  Ginny is pissed because Albus is struggling to relate to people and Harry isn’t connecting with him properly to help Albus because Harry’s always at work. Well for one, why can’t GINNY connect with Albus? She’s his mother after all, she can reach out to him too. Secondly, the kids are at school for most of the year and only home for a few months in the summer. Harry, who only ever wanted to have a family, wouldn’t make sure to spend quality time with his kids when they were home for the holidays? That doesn’t sound like the Harry we’ve known.  Part of that I actually found interesting though, Harry struggling to connect with Albus was interesting in some ways because Harry isn’t perfect and you see how human he is in the story. However, there are parts where it’s just over the top. Him spending a specific day with a blanket each year is just freaking weird. The Trolley Lady on the Hogwarts Train was super weird. Who really shines in this book is Scorpius and Draco. Draco is more adult than Harry in a lot of ways and Scorpius is just a really great kid who would never have been put in Slytherin because he’s a sweet kid all around. He’s the real star of the show for me in this book. Scorpius is who saves the day really in so many ways. In fact, I’m not entirely sure he’s not the cursed child in some ways.  Oh, and I’m glad I’m not the only one who totally thought Albus and Scorpius had a thing for each other. I’m glad a few other reviewers mentioned it too. I was sad they didn’t end up being together, it would have made more sense and would have been pretty cute.<br/><br/>So as a fan, yes I think you should give it a try. It is different. It’s not what you expect. It is interesting to see them all as adults and to be excited about who turns out to be Minister of Magic. I enjoyed it but I did find some of the aspects of it odd.
 If the books of Harry Potter are the ocean, deep with meaning and story, etc. this playwright, is like jet skiing, just skimming the surface (such is the form by it's very nature). Second, as stated on the cover "based on an original new story by J.K Rowling,"  the play is actually by Jack Thorne, and you can tell, **especially** after Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them came out. The magic in her work is just not there in "The Cursed Child." When reading this, I really got a taste of fan service; dynamics... characters... scenes... so much of the story felt just so hackneyed. On the other hand, other scenes and major characters seemed to behave in non-canonical ways, which is just disappointing.<br/><br/>I will say, this probably was still cute on stage. Cheesy, but probably far more entertaining than reading. So, perhaps I'm judging too harshly on reading a text that was meant to be performed and not read.<br/><br/>If you're debating on whether or not you should buy this book, I'll pose the question to you that I did to my mother when she asked if she ought to read it: Do you want this book for this collection, to further prove you are a Harry Potter nerd, like myself? Will you feel the story isn't complete unless you pick it up? If yes, you probably have it already, or will buy it regardless of what reviews say.<br/>  On the other hand, if quality is a standard of yours, and you don't want your final impression of the Harry Potter saga to be on a sour, or at the very least flat, note. You might want to pass.  Best of luck! ~Mischief Managed.
 This might work better as as live play, but it reads as a tedious mess. If another book comes out, I'll check it out off the library. I feel like I really overpaid for bad fan fiction.<br/><br/>There are seven Harry Potter books. This one does not make the cut.
 I liked how this was a continuation of the series I love but it is written completely as a screen play, which isn't really my thing. But even with that aside, I felt most of characters fell fairly flat (partly because of that and other parts due to their actions) and some things that happened in the plot just came out of nowhere, but not like a twist or surprise but more like "well, that was random." The alternate time dimensions were cool to see how things could've been, and at least those made sense, as to how it could have happened. Certain characters from the original series I felt did not stay true to their originals but 19+ years have passed and also parenthood, but there were some things that they did that, even with that, I still don't think they would've done or at least done differently. I did finish this book though, it was interesting enough to see how it would end.<br/><br/>I'm trying really hard not to give any spoilers, but I think the story was just ok, but that is just my opinion. I'm sure there will be others that disagree, and of course, I am not an author.
 This reads like bad fanfiction with Rowling's name slapped on the front.  The plot relies heavily on a Deus Ex Machina from a previous book with it's power level turned up to TEN THOUSAND.  It also runs pretty heavy on the cliches.  It didn't really feel like it expanded the world or the universe in any way, and lacked the sense of wonder that drew many people to the series originally.<br/>It did introduce some new character that I would like to see more of.  Please give us more of Scorpius-- just nowhere near this book.
 This will of course be snapped up by the millions of Harry Potter fans, so criticism doesn't have much point! Since J.K.Rowling is not here the sole author, there are places where her voice doesn't come through completely, and there are a few disparities with the previous books. This is, after all, a play script. For example, previously the two Weasley twins ran their joke shop. but now their younger brother Ron is shown as the proprietor. Interesting characters from previous books are unmentioned.<br/>  Of course scientific analysis of fantasies is rather pointless - who cares? -  but it occurs to me that all the various creatures described in earlier books could have been created by wizards and witches, and that includes elves, gnomes, trolls, giants, hippogriffs, centaurs... all are derivatives of human beings, designed for either usefulness or just whimsy.
 I had hoped that the reviews were wrong, but they were not. If I wanted to read a play I would purchase a play. I wanted to read a Harry Potter Book. I have read all the previous Harry Potter Books, several times. Love them. This was not one of them. I can not believe that JK Rowling had any part of this book. I think it was written by a group of people that had never read Harry Potter. Sorry. I can not tell anyone to purchase this play, unless you have never read a single Harry Potter book. If J.K. Rowling did write this, I am embarrassed for her.
 I knew going into this that Cursed Child was not a novel, but rather a play. I love reading plays, and I've loved Harry Potter for most of my life. This book wasn't bad because it was a play, it was bad because it was just bad. I knew that JK Rowling didn't write this, but rather was a consultant on it. Because of that, I strongly believed that the writers of this play would not be allowed to take this beautiful universe that she created and pervert it. I was wrong.<br/><br/>It read like fanfiction (bad fanfiction) and what was done to the characters that I grew up with is unforgivable. I'm shocked and disgusted that JK Rowling would put her name on this.<br/><br/>If you truly want to read this, I won't say don't do it, but I would recommend borrowing it from someone who has a copy rather than spending your money on it because it's just not worth it. Spend your money on something else that was actually penned by Rowling so your childhood isn't destroyed like mine was.
 I refuse to count this abomination as canon to the series that defined my childhood and I'm disappointed in JKR for sticking her name on such a poorly written piece of, let's face it, fanfiction. I mean, the idea that Voldemort would ever express a love or lust desire and do the piddily-diddily is preposterous. This whole book was preposterous and I wish I could erase it from my mind.
 I am a Harry Potter fan. Not a die-hard fan like some people are, but I've always loved to read, talk about and analyze the Harry Potter books. Seeing that I would never likely make it to London to watch this much-anticipated play, I decided to spend the 15 dollars and at least read the script. My impression was that this play would be really fun to watch, with dimensions brought alive by the acting, stage tech, props, etc.<br/>However, the script itself seemed very amateur. There were parts that almost made it, but overall, it felt as though I was reading a fan-fiction. The character and plot development were weak. I understand that this is a script for a play so it could lack the complexities we found in the novels. However, the characters seemed two-dimensional or out of character. The things they did or said were either too predictable or too outlandish. Basically, I found this world of magic unbelievable and shallow.<br/><br/>The plot was not entirely predictable, but it was definitely not original. It felt like a (spoiler here?) mash-up between Harry Potter and Back to the Future 2. The theme was obvious, but could've been delivered in a more masterful, creative way than was presented in this script.<br/><br/>All to say, this script will fall short for Harry Potter fans who love the books for the intricate plots, attention to detail, and complex character developments. Because this script lacks all of that. As I said in the title, it may be great to watch the play unfold on stage, but it certainly wasn't as exciting to read on paper.
 POTENTIAL MILD SPOILERS<br/><br/>I have been pumped for this ever since it was announced in 2015. I grew up with Harry Potter; I have read the books many times and havd watched the films many times. I own the ultimate editions so that I could have as many bonus features as possible. I recently bought the illustrated edition of the first book and plan on collecting the rest.<br/><br/>So it should come as no shock that my expectations for this story were very high. I read this script in just under 4 hours compared to the 3-4 days it would take me to read the books when they came out. So I had a lot to process quickly. One thing that stood out to me was, despite this taking much less time to read, the play feels epic and a good bit of time passes within it.<br/> Upon finishing, my feelings were mixed to negative. Some creative decisions were truly puzzling to me. But then I remembered that this is a play, not a novel or even a film. Visualizing this from a theatre perspective, I certainly gained an appreciation/understanding of why this story was told. Upon thinking even more, I want to re-read it and could find myself loving it.<br/><br/>Essentially, this story is about a parent and child learning to understand one another and appreciate one another. This is true for Harry and his son, Albus Severus and Draco and Scorpius (and another character that would be a huge spoiler that I won't mention). The contrasts between the fathers and sons are emphasized, hence why this story feels different from any other Potter story before. Albus Severus and Harry have almost nothing in common except blood. But what few traits they share are what bring them closer by the end.<br/><br/>Other beloved characters pop up. While they seem to behave in ways much different, we have to understand that they are at a different time in their lives and that (once again) this is a play. So certain things are played up for drama or comedy. Aside from the great new characters of Albus and Scorpius, I thought seeing Harry as a middle-aged adult was fascinating. My other favorite character was surprisingly Draco Malfoy.<br/><br/>If I have a criticism, it's that this story sometimes feels like a "greatest hits" of thr Harry Potter series. Upon re-thinking, I don't feel that way as much because it focuses on key events from the pass, not every event. It brings the past, present, and future together in a way that makes sense for the characters in this story. In my opinion, it actually does further the story quite a bit. And if Rowling or Jack Thorne ever did decide to continue this story, they certainly could take it to some interesting and different places.<br/><br/>My main issue with the play is not a big one, but it has to do with the villain. I like the villain, and the concept behind the character is interesting and plausible. However, I think an opportunity was squandered to go in a fresher, more inventive direction.<br/><br/>All in all, my opinion on this script has changed for the better. I actually appreciate the story and do consider it canon. There is an It's a Wonderful Life vibe to this story, and many of the creative choices do work, while some are more puzzling. Some plot points would benefit from a full novel or even a film in order to be fleshed out. However, I'm sure that watching the play is absolutely magical for any Harry Potter fan.
 Copied and pasted from my Goodreads review (spoilers are clickable over here:  ...]<br/>Wow.<br/><br/>Wow!<br/><br/>I don't want to talk too much about anything because JK Rowling is asking everyone to #KeepTheSecrets, but I guess that's why they make (view spoiler) so I'll do my best to avoid writing about anything specific (and when I do have to go into details, I'll just use the spoiler tags). You're warned. (Quick note to app users—apparently the spoiler tag doesn't work in the app. If you didn't have to click to see the all caps "spoiler tag" above, maybe don't proceed unless you've read the book.<br/><br/>I haven't read the Harry Potter series since I've joined Goodreads, so I don't have any reviews or official rankings of them. I've always said Goblet of Fire was my favorite book, although all of them are probably 5* (perhaps I'll reread the series next year!). I enjoyed reading Tales of the Beedle Bard when it came out and I'm always ready for anything Jo wants to give us from the wizarding world (although I did quickly get bored of Pottermore—perhaps it was the slow rollout of content).<br/><br/>I flew through this book in a little over 24 hours. Not too surprising given that it's a play (340 pages of script are a lot easier to read than 340 pages of a novel), but it did feel good to simply devour more Harry Potter fiction. It was great revisiting the characters I fell in love with so many years ago and meeting new characters Rowling created. (I think it's important to point out that the play, as far as I can tell, was written by Jack Thorne and was based on a story created by Thorne, Rowling, and the director, John Tiffany. If I had to guess, the overall outline of what happened/who was introduced was all Jo  her world after all] with some creative additions from Thorne &amp; Tiffany, but the actual acts and scenes and lines are all Thorne.)<br/><br/>What amazed me most of all is how what I read was actually happening right now on a stage in London. I've read plenty of scripts that require a fantastic director to put up (e.g. The 39 Steps &amp; Peter and the Starcatcher—both of which I read after seeing them on stage) but this probably tops them all. It should come as no surprise that the Production Credits list someone as in charge of Illusions &amp; Magic. But still, even simple bits like (view spoiler) are eclipsed by descriptions of (view spoiler), (view spoiler) or (view spoiler). I mean, HOW?! I really want to go to London just to see this on stage.<br/><br/>But I think it would excel more as a magical play than it does as a script. The story was interesting (view spoiler) and it was great to go back to Hogwarts and the Ministry of Magic, but it still didn't quite click. (view spoiler) It feels like a cheat to introduce a new type of magic that felt similar to an old type but without explaining all of its differences. Also, there were plenty of times characters did or said things that felt so out of character. For instance, (view spoiler) and grown-up Ron felt like he was just trying too hard to fill Fred's shoes.<br/><br/>There also felt like there were some plot holes with what I remember from the previous seven novels. Perhaps things changed after Voldemort was defeated in Deathly Hallows but wasn't (view spoiler)<br/><br/>In the end, the play feels a little too much like fan fiction and not enough like a Rowling addition to the series. I actually now wonder how much approval she had to give and how much Thorne &amp; Tiffany came up with on their own. It was great seeing old characters again but everything felt a little too convenient (especially this HUGEST of spoilers: (view spoiler) Seriously, WTF?!). But, I still flew through the book and I'm sure the play is amazing to watch... If I could give this 3.5* I would, but for now, I'm rounding up because it was still a lot of fun to read despite its problems.
 I was greatly disappointed.  I was so excited by the concept of getting a glimpse of the old characters that I loved so much growing up and getting to really meet their children and see their lives.  But I was left with more questions than I entered with.  I understand that this wasn't actually a book, it was a script for a play and that Rowling couldn't include all the details as she could've in a novel.  So for that matter, why couldn't she just write a book?  Why did it have to be a play?<br/>After the seventh book, Rowling insisted, again and again that she was done with the original characters and wouldn't be revisiting them.  But then she did and did so in a way that seemed to be a slap in the face to her fans.  She doesn't seem invested in the story anymore just seems to be experimenting with what the most money she could make with the least amount of work.  It feels like she slapped this together in a week or less and also seems completely detached with what is possible with live performances.  If felt like she thought she was writing a movie, but then settled for a play.<br/>Where was Teddy Tonks?  He wasn't even mentioned but it is implied that since Harry was his guardian, he (and maybe Ginny) raised him since he was orphaned.  I was so excited to see the dynamic of Harry (an orphan with abusive awful guardians) raises another orphan.  But Teddy wasn't even mentioned for a second.  That is insulting to Lupin and Tonks who acted as family to Harry.  Why would Rowling bother writing that detail into the books if she wasn't going to bother sticking to it and keeping him in the picture of the potter family.  A common theme through all the books is Harry desperation for familly.  He was so fixated on his desperation for biological family that he neglects his true family.  Ron, Hermione, the members of DA and others.  So, when Harry does have children, why on earth would he neglect one of them?  It doesn't seem right and all the characters in "The Cursed Child" seem like a shell of themselves.<br/>I could write pages and pages on my disappointment with this "book" and with the franchise in general at the moment, but no one would read that and I just don't have the time.<br/>Also, this book is $16, which is $15 overpriced than what I believe it is worth.<br/>A real miss by JK Rowling.
 Same familiar tune as many of the reviews before me - I knew this was a script, I knew JKR had not written it directly, and I was still supremely disappointed. As I was reading it, I kept thinking that it felt like I was reading bad fanfiction.<br/><br/>I can't enumerate all the plotholes and character issues, but here are some highlights SPOILER ALERT:<br/><br/>The reason that time travel works for me in PoA is that it is abundantly clear that Harry and Hermione were always there - there was never an alternate timeline or alternate universe. As Harry says, he knew he could cast the patronus because he had already done it. This is not the case in TCC. And having saved two extra magical time turners? I could not suspend my disbelief for that.<br/>On a related note, it seemed that many of the magical laws that had been established in 1-7 were ignored, such as taking a month to brew polyjuice potion. And transforming Harry to look like Voldemort, then having the transformation wear off?<br/><br/>And don't get me started on the character assassinations. Ron was like a caricature of himself, oafish and drunk. And Voldemort having a secret child??? It would have been much more believable to have the enemy be a Death Eater who remained in hiding.<br/>END SPOILERS<br/><br/>To be fair, there were parts that I thought how cool this must look on stage. However, without  the bells and whistles of a stage production to distract from the dialogue and plot, it was impossible to ignore the multitude of major problems.<br/>If you take my advice, don't read this. Preserve the memory of the untarnished seven books.
 What a pleasure after so many years to hold a new Harry Potter book in my hands and dive with happy abandon into the strange, but warmly familiar magical world of J.K. Rowling's imagination. While this "rehearsal script" for a theatrical production (first stage in London on July 30, 2016) is frenetically paced and (at least on the printed page) lacks much of the novels' spirit of whimsy--their rich depth of colorful, if often superfluous detail--readers do get to reconnect with many of the most-beloved characters in the series once again, and there are a few interesting (and essential) new characters as well.  Young Albus Severus Potter finds it increasingly difficult to live in his famous father's shadow; Hogwarts for him is no Hogsmeade holiday, only his friendship with the shy and lonely Scorpius Malfoy offers consolation, and Scorpius is himself dogged by dark rumors about his parentage. Mischief and rebellion are in the air like a swarm of dementors, but this mischief won't be quite so easy to manage when the two friends endeavor to change history.<br/><br/>That's the story in its broadest outline. The plot of "Cursed Child" draws on the earlier books, most heavily "Prisoner of Azkaban" and "Goblet of Fire", but a thorough familiarity with the entire series is assumed from the beginning. This may be problematic for some Potter neophytes, while "purists" who claim to adore The Boy Who Lived but can't abide the notion of his ever growing up or changing (as real people so often do) will find a fair bit to complain about--but don't they always?<br/><br/>Yet, by and large, the source material is skilfully mined for its 'quantum possibilities', the resulting story is often quite clever and, in moments, moving, poignant, and insightful. Rowling has once again given us an engaging magical tale that is also a compelling story of relationships (fathers and sons, friendship and love, family past and individual destiny) human emotion, growth and the understanding that comes with experience and maturity.<br/><br/>Recommended with the caveats noted above.
 Wow...just the general sense of disappointment I feel makes it hard to think of what exactly to say. First of all, being a die hard Harry Potter fan, having reading the books a dozen times in the last decade or so, having bought all of the extra books and holding J.K. Rowling to such a high standard I was extremely disappointed that her name was associated with this. It makes me feel a little better to know that she didn't actually write it, she just helped (?) come up with the general plot. It is frustrating, though, that she apparently did not even proof read?? There are so many things - big and small - that do not add up with the other books at all. The characters are barely even passable as themselves and even the terms are misspoken. "Minister for Magic"??? It's been Minister of Magic for seven books and now it changes? Even just small things like that irk me so much because it really is as though this is a poor fan fiction that Rowling felt some need to attach her name to? The narration - although I understand the need to be in play/production format - doesn't sound remotely like her! So disappointed. Going to go re-read the books and pretend like this never happened.
 SPOILERS! This might be the worst thing I've ever read. None of the characters felt like themselves. And I must say that the whole time travel thing was a big mistake. I've always thought that The Prisoner of Azkaban handled the time travel aspect rather well and the fact that the "changes" made in the past were actually visible in the present. That being said, if it were possible for someone to go back in time to save Cedric...he wouldn't have died in the first place! This book made me hate time travel plots even more. It is a weak premise to base a book on.<br/>I can't believe JKR allowed this trash to have her name associated with it. If she wanted this story told she should have written it herself in a well thought out book format that didn't have gigantic plot holes and stay true to characters. I'm sure forty year old Harry is different from sixteen year old Harry, but come on!<br/>The play format was very distracting up me. I haven't read a play since high school. But I do remember them to be well written and entertaining with complex characters. This book...thing was none of the above. I'm going to try my best to forget it. This cannot be considered canon!
 It is clear that J.K. Rowling did not write this play. It lacks the wit and heart of the novels and the characters are two-dimensional. This is basic: when writing dialogue, whether in novel form or in a play, a character's speech (rhythm, voice, choice of words, etc.) should define and identify that character, make it obvious who is speaking. Not so, here. Any of them could have been substituted for the other. Also, I was greatly put off by the number of times that the two boys (and their actions) were called 'stupid' by just about everyone.<br/><br/>Perhaps even sadder, for me, was the naming of the character 'Delphi.' Formerly the location for the powerful, noble oracle of Ancient Greece, now for millions of kids, Delphi will  be a name forever paired with an uninspired plot that does not reveal much truth. One of the most famous maxims/sayings attributed to the Delphic Oracle is: Know Thyself. Perhaps 'Know The Books Better' would be more appropriate here. So disappointed!
 Obviously there are a lot of mixed emotions before starting the infamous eighth Harry Potter book. Naturally I was excited — because it’s Harry freakin’ Potter — but I also just didn’t quite feel as excited as I thought I should be. Before picking up the bound version of the play (since I guess we really shouldn’t be calling it a book as it was never intended to be an actual book), I knew there were a few things that were hindering my excitement that I ultimately expected to affect my overall enjoyment of the experience (and in fact, they all did play a part in that). I knew that J.K. Rowling was involved in the plot and creation of CURSED CHILD, but ultimately, it was not her writing on the page. I knew that I was going to be reading a rehearsal script for the play and that the formatting might throw off my experience. And I knew that I’d be reading about adult Harry, Ron, Hermione, and company and I didn’t know if I’d like where their characters were in their adult lives since we had some pretty cheesy things happen in the epilogue of DEATHLY HALLOWS, and that actually was J.K. Rowling’s writing.<br/><br/>The short version of this review is that CURSED CHILD was kind of all over the place for me. The overall plot was interesting and I really, really loved certain parts but other parts of it just seemed so… I guess amateur is the best word I can think of at the moment, although that seems quite harsh. We’ve grown to love J.K. Rowling’s stories and how detailed they are and there were just certain things about CURSED CHILD that didn’t seem like they were plotted out very well. Other parts seemed completely random and totally uncharacteristic of the series. The overall concept of this story of the next generation was a really interesting concept but seemingly poorly executed. This was like cramming multiple books into one book (or I suppose, one play) and concepts were sort of flying all over the place. It was really fun to see things from the original series turn up but other times, the references back to the original series was very cheesy or just plain inaccurate. Small inaccuracies in some parts (it was “Happee Birthdae” not “Happy Birthday”), and some big timeline disagreements in others but it’s Harry freakin’ Potter. You don’t think the fandom will pick up on these? (They totally did.) It was just things like that that really made me feel like this was sloppily put together and that these playwrights who put the CURSED CHILD play together were missing some really core feelings and elements of the series.<br/><br/>I knew that I was going to be reading a script when I started and it was definitely a unique experience but I think the format lost a LOT in translation. There was less atmosphere, less dialogue, and less development which obviously you’ll get through the actors of the play and you won’t see in a rehearsal script. I just felt like I lost so much not READING those reactions, nuances, tone of voice, sensory descriptions — I mean, really a little of everything that brings the world of Harry Potter to life. Some of that is included in the script notes but the atmosphere is greatly lost because of the format. I mean, obviously this was specifically adapted for a play and that’s how they wanted to tell this story… But I really, really wish it had been developed into an actual book instead of just giving us the rehearsal script. There was so much more of this story to tell! Things would have been a lot less cheesy if they had been developed or explained. (Although some things I’ll never get over. They were just weird.) Everything felt really, really rushed and I would have rather had a simpler plot with more development instead of bursting from scene to scene. There was no time to really absorb anything and that also left very little room for character development. I don’t care if we already know the majority of these characters — they still need to have a personality.<br/><br/>I also didn’t feel like the characters were well-represented at all. Part of it may be because they’re so much older… But a lot of them felt far off from their younger counter-parts (although I’ve changed exponentially since I was 17 so… fair enough in some respects) but I hated that Ron came off the way he did. He was such a lump and a putz with little personality and he was essentially was Hermione’s lesser half. Hermione was a stronger personality, as she usually is, but I feel like even she lost a lot of her logic and wisdom… How do you LOSE wisdom over the years? Harry was always a bit all over the place for me so that was about the same and Ginny was a total movie Ginny, not book Ginny. (Ugh.) The main adult characters (the aforementioned) seemed so stiff and one-dimensional which is hard to bear after spending a full series with them, reading the series multiple times, and watching the movies over and over. We know these characters. They are our childhood. They are our friends. We grew up with them. To see them underdeveloped and misrepresented in a sequel like this just felt so uncaring. There were also a few characters from the series who make appearances (though I won’t reveal who they were) and some were AWESOME and some were confusing, to say the least.<br/>There was a weird sexual tension between the Albus and Scorpius (which I thought was just me at first but there are tons of THINGS all over Buzzfeed and Tumblr about this so I’m not alone) and I honestly thought it was going to be revealed that one had a crush on the other, or that they both shared romantic feelings. That would have been fine expect for the fact that it didn’t happen and I was confused by them always bringing up hugging and the deep friendship feelings which when described really sounded like something more than just a deep platonic friendship bond.<br/><br/>It was so great to see the future for Harry Potter but I just really feel a little let down by a short story. Some of it was so much fun. Parts made me cry. Some made me laugh. But I also had moments where I scratched my head, questioned a lot, and even laughed out loud (not in a good way). Some of it was suuuuper cheesy and I can see why people said it read as fanfic. Overall, it felt messy and rushed and the more I think about it and discuss it, the more I realize that I’m more disappointed than excited about the development. I would have loved to see this really developed in a novel or in a series. We needed so much more time with Albus to understand him a little better. I would have loved to see this great friendship between the two boys and their complicated friendship with Rose (oh, and don’t get me started about her role in the end of the book. An even cheesier way to wrap things up. Yay). I always love more time at Hogwarts. I would have loved to see those little clues along the way to the big reveal. I was okay with what the plot WAS (except for some parts) but it really just needed way more development. I kind of feel like if it can’t be done well, best to leave it alone, and I don’t think CURSED CHILD did justice to this series at all.<br/><br/>We did beg for an eighth book though… so I guess beggars can’t be choosers?<br/><br/>But now can we beg for an Ilvermorny series, pretty please? (Will I ever learn my lesson?)
 A disappointing story without any charm. It was as though the "author" tried to write a greatest hits version in order to capture some of the awesomeness of the previous novels and utterly failed.<br/>The story was a weak ploy to extend the series through time changing reboots. So lame and very disheartening.
 This review is free of plot spoilers. If thinking about purchasing this, you must first understand that it is a script, not a novel. Therefore it does not go into the depth and detail of the original novels, nor is it written as a narrative; it's a script. And while it had input from Rowling, the input of two additional writers is quite apparent. That being said, the actual plot line is enjoyable, but weak. At several times, it felt as though I were reading a piece of fan-fiction, rather than canon Harry Potter. I won't spoil the plot for anyone, but let's just say that it is a plot that has already been covered by many an amateur fan-fiction writer. After becoming used to Rowling's ability to create plots that offer twists, turns and totally unforeseen events in the original novels, this falls short. It stands apart from the other canon in that there is nothing tying it's plot in with the originals, no breadcrumbs left in the novels that make the reader suddenly go "ah ha, I see where this plot line was seeded." In fact, I found the opposite to be true, where certain events seem like they couldn't possibly have gone unnoticed in the Deathly Hallows. Unlike the original novels, it is not something I would re-read again and again. I finished it slightly unsatisfied, still unsure of exactly which character was supposed to be the cursed child (or perhaps it was intentional for more than one character to fit that role). Overall, it was enjoyable to spend a few more hours in Harry's world, and I can see the appeal of viewing this story as a play. The special effects described in the script would be truly magical to witness on stage, and I would take the opportunity to see it if it ever comes to a stage near me. But in the end, it is a weaker story than those in the original novels.
 This books lacks all of the great storytelling of the original Harry Potter books. I know it's based on the play and so this is not really a book. It's closer to a script with just dialogue, with no real, rich details and the characters are lacking (severely) the personalities you came to love in them so much. I'm surprised that J.K. Rowling put her name on this. Don't expect to have any great insights into the Harry Potter world you fell in love with or you will be disappointed. Also, I have to say I never felt that joy of 'having a new Harry Potter book to read' that I was hoping for. Oh well.
 I have been a Harry Potter fan since they were first published, but I am honestly disappointed with this play as much as I hate to say it. The characters we all know and love are painfully nostalgic to see, but are also not as dynamic as they once were. Perhaps it's because I already had head full of ideas of how these characters grew up, or maybe because I am not the greatest fan of time travel themes, but I could not put my heart into this book.<br/>The plot was tearfully predictable which is greatly uncharacteristic of J.K. Rowling and I felt like I was reading a fanfiction from a stranger.
 I am about halfway through the book. If you're looking for something exactly like the HP series books 1-7 you're not going to get it with 'Harry Potter, and the Cursed Child'. Book 8(HP and the Cursed Child) brings back most of the main characters who we fell in love with in the original series. I thought I always wanted to know what happened to all my beloved characters, but I'm not so sure now. I have a few issues with this book. One being that this book is written in a play format so reading it is kind of hard if you're not used to that, which I'm not. I haven't read a play since I was in high school(16 years).<br/>It reads as follows(no spoilers)<br/>*** -Ginny and Harry are angry<br/>Harry What do you want Draco<br/>Draco gives Harry a dirty look<br/>Draco You know what I want Harry. I want you to write a retraction.<br/>Harry is very angry, his face is fire red<br/>Harry I don't have any control over the paper Draco.(ect, ect, ect)-***<br/>My sister got her copy before I did, and warned me about the way the book was written so I wasn't surprised, but it still took me about 20(ish) pages to get used to the play format. Another thing is that I don't think J K Rowling had ANYTHING to do with this book other then putting her name on the cover as one of the authors(maybe she wrote a sentence or two?). It feels like the two men who did write this book only read the CLIFF Notes of the Harry Potter series because this book lacks almost everything I hold so dear from the original series. I think I would have been happier if the last I heard of Harry, Ginny, Ron, Hermione, and Draco was when they said "Good bye" to their own children on platforms 9&amp;3/4 at the end of book 7. On the positive side it's an easy read so finishing it shouldn't take too long. I just need to find the time.<br/>Also if you haven't read or watched 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows' in the past 6-12 months I suggest you go watch it so you are fresh on where Harry, and the gang left us. It might make reading 'Harry Potter and the Cursed Child' a little easier for you. Plus watching any of the Harry Potter series is never a waist of time. Lol. HAPPY READING📚
 4.5 stars.  "Harry Potter and the Cursed Child". (Parts One and Two). Rehearsal Edition<br/><br/>Being a skeptic about sequels I ordered this book mainly because I am a closet Harry Potter "groupie".  Yes, I read the books in my 50's and have "Pottermore" on my computer favorites!<br/><br/>Besides being a "sequel" the book is presented in script form, written as a read through and directive for scene settings of a play.  How can any of those things compare to the addicting words and characters of J.K. Rowling?<br/><br/>Well, it hit the mark for my unquenchable thirst for continuing the saga of Hogworts and it's favored alumni.  I felt an immediate connection to Harry's, Hermione's and Draco Malfoy's children.  The story of Albus and Scorpius had a more contemporary feel but I loved the fact that the old favorites were included and given some closure.  It took no more than a chapter to adjust to the literary structure and from there my mind assimilated the words easily and went into picture mode.  I loved the story and the characters and felt a seamless continuation of the original series.<br/><br/>My only lingering thought is:  "How will this go over as a live stage presentation?"  A movie?  Sure.  But a live stage may be a difficult venue to keep the drama and electric charge alive without the special effects.  Although I will be in line for a ticket if it comes to a venue near me!<br/><br/>You immediately see Rowling's engaging writing and development of the new characters.  I am sure Thorne and Tiffany made the way easy for adaptation to play format.  Their biographies show their success in that venue.  All should be proud of this addition to the Potter family of books!  HP fans...definitely pick this up!<br/><br/>￼
 I wanted to love this. I had been waiting for this. I was left disappointed.<br/><br/>Let me start by saying that I am a HUGE Harry Potter fan. I have read the books countless times. I think they are excellent books for children to read because of what they teach them. Yes, the fantasy is nice, but the core values of the books? The heart of the books are where they really shine. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child has taken what we loved about all of these characters and completely obliterated all of that. Harry Potter had many character flaws, but I don't believe for a second that he would have made his son feel unloved or separated him from his only friend. Family was the most important thing to him. Love and friendship were his whole thing.<br/><br/>Then, okay, I can see Hermione Granger being appalled at how poorly the ministry was run. I mean, children broke in multiple times! So, she becomes Minister! Don't you think she'd tighten up security?<br/><br/>The characters didn't seem like more grown up versions of their younger selves. They didn't seem anything like...anything I'd ever read. There seemed to be inconsistencies within the realm as well. It was just a bit of a confusing ride.
 Let me start off by saying I am a HUGE Harry Potter fan! I've read each of the books 1-7 about 10 times each. I was utterly obsessed with the books in middle and high school and still very much enjoy them as an adult. This story, however, is equivalent to poorly written fanciful fan fiction with little direction. I was a theatre major in college and have read literally hundreds of play scripts, so that was not the issue for me. It simply did not seem like Rowling wrote this. The plot and exposition were uncomplicated, slow, and simply bad. The characters seemed very different from their former selves (even taking into account that, yes, of course 37 year old Harry, Ron, and Hermione will be different and more mature than their 17 year old selves). And the language was not the same magic we know and love from the books. Again, I know all too well that novels and plays are different artistic mediums, yet still, this story falls very flat. I definitely do NOT recommend this read and will be doing my best to delete its contents from my memory.
 I grew up with the Potter books. I started reading them back in 1998 and the books and movies absolutely defined my teenage years. When this came out I was disappointed that it was a screenplay instead of a book, but I was willing to look past that. I was also willing to look past the fact that there were multiple authors, because at least JK Rowling was one of them.<br/><br/>So, like most Potter fans I was thirsty for more Potter, and bought this book the day it came out to start reading it. I noticed immediately that this is not Harry Potter. This feels like a half baked fanfic written by someone who watched the first two movies and then stopped caring about Harry Potter until they were asked to write this ten years later. Nothing makes sense. They even start with a scene that was ALREADY written and managed to mess it up. They change things all over the place, and it's honestly just a story that never needed to be told. There are so many tales in the Potter universe that would be amazing to read about and watch.<br/><br/>This is a prime example of "Be careful what you wish for" and "Sometimes more is not better".<br/><br/>If you haven't purchased this, do yourself a favor and just re-read the original series and be happy with that. JK Rowling is done with Potter for now. Her heart is no longer in it, and it's obvious from this half baked pile of crap.
 I enjoyed the read, but there were some MAJOR plot holes and blatant absurdities riddled throughout. (E.g. 40-year-old Hermione guards a top-secret artifact with three grade-school level riddles. The Trolley Witch is actually the Terminator. Polyjuice potion takes a month to brew, but the excuse to not use it is that they can just transfigure Harry into Voldemort because plot convenience. How did Albus get his wand back to fight Delphi? Why was Ron morphed into Fred Lite?! Wait, so Cedric becomes a DEATH EATER out of embarrassment? Convenient spilling of love potion and magical reaction on a blanket to send a message forty years into the future!!! Aaaaand the list goes on.)<br/><br/>Ahem. My point: next to everything felt contrived. The writers *not Rowling, she did not write it but did endorse it* simply reused the premise of Prisoner of Azkaban (which, in my humble opinion, had the weakest plot lines of all HP books), threw in some dramatics and teenage angst from an unlikeable and underdeveloped main character (Albus Potter), and rehashed Voldemort. Again. The book's saving grace was Scorpius Malfoy, whom I absolutely adored. He alone would have gotten five stars. He was engaging and funny, and the only character within the context of the story I cared about at all.<br/><br/>But I ramble.  A rating of three stars suits this goofy, vapid read because as I said, it was fun and enjoyable; but overall, it lacked depth and the kind of storytelling magic JK Rowling turns out. Also, Scorpius. I could read eight books about him and Albus (because come on, despite my dislike of Albus, the bromance between the two was still adorable) and enjoy them no matter how wreckless the plot was; which is probably why I didn't give the book 1 star. The plot itself is hackneyed and lacking, but at the very least I got a few laughs from it.
 This review will contain spoilers.<br/><br/>I wanted to avoid this book since I was unsure of the format.  But downloaded to my iPad Kindle app the night it was released.  I finished in almost one sitting.  It was a very fast read.  The format wasn't entirely horrible, once I got used to reading it and keeping track of who was "talking".  Perhaps it translates wonderfully on stage.  There were parts of the script that I was hoping it would be over soon, instead of hoping that it wouldn't end, as was the case with HP1-HP7.<br/><br/>Count me in with the numerous other reviewers who state the obvious.  This script does not read like a JK Rowling piece.  It has too many plot holes.  It has too many concepts just thrown into the novel for the reader to just accept as truth.  I even feel that had JK Rowling "wrote" rather than contributed to this script, the prose would have translated with more emotion and character growth for the characters.  Things like the passing of Astoria - between Albus and Scorpius as friends, and Father &amp; Son, Scorpius and Draco - it was almost mentioned in afterthought.  I had to reread a passage to realize that it had happened.  That could have transpired with more reason behind it. I know it was mentioned later in the script at more length as well.<br/><br/>It was nice to return to the familiar world of Harry Potter and his family.  I enjoyed that very much.<br/><br/>I disliked Ron almost entirely in the text.<br/>The time turner was too contrived a concept.<br/>Do parents always come/go so freely at Hogwarts?  Does Professor McGonnegal do as she's told or have more of a backbone?<br/>How is it that the Trolley Witch was outsmarted by nobody before, and was so easily outsmarted by Albus/Scorpius<br/>Voldemort's Daughter.  Sigh....<br/>I didn't read much (or any) hype about this book (err play) prior to the release.  Therefore, I was unaware that it was not actually written by J.K. Rowling.  That was a huge surprise to me.  Then again, all of the plot holes - I totally get it now.<br/><br/>To hear that JK Rowling announced that YES, this story is IT.  The finale.  It wraps up Harry Potter's story perfectly.  It feels like such a disservice to long-time loyal fans.  It will leave me with a bitter taste.
 Just terrible. If you like the Harry Potter series DO NOT waste your time with this garbage.
 In the epilogue to book 7, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, we saw that Harry Potter had kids. So did Draco Malfoy. Now we follow Albus Severus Potter and Scorpio Malfoy in an epic time travel adventure that sees them going back in time to try to change the future. What they don't think about is how their actions in the past will change the future.<br/><br/>If you're in need of a Harry Potter fix, then you will enjoy this. Yes. This is a play. But its better than nothing. You'll see what your old favorites are up to and learn more about the post-Voldemort world. No, it's not like the other books. Which is fine enough too. Just read it and make up your mind about it.<br/><br/>Also, as someone who got placed in the Slytherin house, I was happy to see certain events take place.
 I read this book version of the script of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, and it is enjoyable. I love the Harry Potter books and characters, so I am glad for the latest story.<br/><br/>Albus Potter (Harry and Ginny's son) and Scorpius Malfoy (Draco and Astoria Malfoy's son) have to prevent time from being altered so that Voldemort doesn't win and change reality.<br/><br/>The good:  I enjoy time travel stories, and the idea of going back in time to correct things is interesting. I like how the story continues with next generation after Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.  The interaction between the characters,  especially Albus and Scorpius' friendship, is engaging.  I like how the characters (Harry, Albus, Draco and Scorpius in particular) feeling they have to meet everyone's expectations, their sense of inadequacy, and how they have grief to deal with is addressed.  The characters having to make the choice to do the right thing is there as it has been through the series.<br/><br/>The problems:  I would like to have seen more of Rose (Ron and Hermione's daughter) and Lily and James (Harry and Ginny's kids).  I wasn't sure what to think about Delphi's character either.  This didn't prevent me from liking the story however.  This is a play, so it is better to watch rather than read the story.  I would be interested in seeing this in novel form, and I do want to see the play when I have the opportunity, but I am going to have to wait until it comes to the States.<br/><br/>In the meantime, this is worth reading, and it works as a standalone story.
 I love Harry Potter. Love it. I read them all at least once a year. Now I was excited for this book, how disappointed I was. I got seven pages in and had to stop for a minute at how terrible it was. It reads like a bad fan fiction. I finished it but only by sheer will power.... Fifty shades of grey was better than this and fifty grades is trash. I never thought I could be so dissapointed in an author. I cannot believe that Rowling signed off on this..... I cannot believe she would disrespect her fans this way. If your going to continue the potter story at least give us SOMETHING to work with.
 Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived, is now a grown man with children of his own who are now attending Hogwarts.  Harry's childhood was not easy and it appears that his son Albus is following in his footsteps.  Albus is sorted into an unexpected house at Hogwarts and his best friend is Scorpius Malfoy, son of Harry's longtime enemy Draco.  Albus has long struggled with being the son of the famous Harry Potter, but this time his struggles will put him - and those closest to him - in very real danger.<br/><br/>I admit that I had mixed feelings about buying “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child”, knowing it was a play and not a book, and - while was based on her ideas - it was not written by J.K. Rowling.  After reading it, I still have mixed feelings.  To be sure, the story is a good one with Albus struggling in his father's footsteps just as Harry struggles to be a good father (as he says at one point he did not have any good examples to follow growing up).  Albus's friendship with Scorpius is well done - I never thought I would like a character whose last name is Malfoy but Scorpius is delightful - in fact, I think he is the real star of the play.  Besides the expected Harry, Ginny, Ron and Hermione, many old favorites appear in this play (some briefly) and there are some poignant and scary moments.  But in the end, this is a play not a book and lacks some of the character development that was in the books. Albus and Harry's relationship is realistically done but I would have liked to have seen more of James and how Albus gets along with him.  Classroom action is pretty much nonexistent in the play.  I found that the play, which is split into two part and is meant to be seen on two separate nights, is overlong (so much dialogue for the actors to learn, especially the young ones!) and feels like it could have used some editing (perhaps with some of the alternate worlds in the play).  I was never bored while reading the play; it just seemed a long play to be sitting in the audience watching.  Having said that, I would certainly go see the play just to see how they pulled off some of the magic - I bet it is awesome to see in person!<br/><br/>“Harry Potter and the Cursed Child” is not as good as any of the books in the series, but Harry Potter fans will enjoy it if only to see what Harry, Hermione, and Ron are like as adults.
 If you want to see your favorite characters grow up and act completely differently than who they were, this is the book for you. Plot wholes, cringy dialogue, and totally predictable story lines abound in this book. I felt as if I had read this book before, probably because 13 year old fans have been writing fan fiction exactly like this for years.
 I know a script is not going to be a good a read as a novel, so I am reviewing this based on the plot alone.  This reads like a bad teen fan-fiction.<br/><br/>First of all, the characters are unlikable.Albus is way to moody.  Imagine Harry in OOTP squared.  Also, I can't believe that anyone as nasty as Rose could be the child of Ron and Hermione.  The new characters introduced are one dimensional.  Surprisingly, the bright spot is the Malfoys.  It's nice to see some personal growth.<br/><br/>Second, they contradict the way time-turners work as described in POA.  In that book, Harry and Hermione go back and time to make sure events played out exactly as they did the first time.  In the Cursed Child, they play fast and loose with the time line to create some highly implausible scenarios.<br/><br/>Third, without spoiling  too much, they refer to things that take place during the timeline of the novels that simply couldn't have happened.<br/><br/>Finally SPOILER ALERT the antagonist is Tom Riddle's secret love child?  REALLY?  Gross factor aside, Voldemort was the antagonist in 5/7 of the novels.  Couldn't we have gone another direction?
 I wanted to like this book very badly - I love Harry Potter, I love JK Rowling...I despise reading plays.  The fact that this was written as a screenplay immediately turned me off.  However, I read through it because it was a Harry Potter novel and I love those books.  The characters were creative, but the plot line was somewhat predictable.  I wish that they would expand more on the world of Harry Potter rather than Harry's descendents.  To see the future generation was good, though.
 I'm a huge Potter fan, but I have to say I was disappointed. The script aspect took some getting use to, but I was able to handle the stage direction after some time.  I think what got me SPOILERS was the time travel aspect.  As a long time fan of SciFi, time travel is old hat and something I expect.  When I enter the world of Magic though, I expect new and different story telling. Instead I got a SciFi trope. As a stage play, I understand that this is more of a celebration of the Harry Potter experience and not so much meant to continue the story, but I just can't help but be underwhelmed.
 First of all, I am a MASSIVE Harry Potter fan. So I am biased to really love this book. But I found it "OK". I guess I liked it. I recommend it if you are an HP fan too. But, if this is your introduction to the magical world of Harry Potter, I doubt you would go back for more. Maybe I have just been spoiled all of these years by the sheer awesomeness that is JKR's writing. This is just not that caliber.<br/><br/>The story is concept is good - just good. Not as well thought out as the series, but still good. And I admit I relished all of the new information about characters that have been a part of my life for so long - that they feel like family. But unfortunately, in Cursed Child, I didn't bond with a single character - not even the ones I have loved forever. And the only one of them that showed any of the emotional growth that I would expected after 19 years was Draco.<br/><br/>I didn't find the writing style as good as I expected either. I know it is a screenplay and written differently than a book and maybe part of the problem. Cursed Child just doesn't have the level of detail and seems less of a story and more of an 'Everyone-Feeling-Sorry-For-Themselves-Whine-In".<br/><br/>Hummm, maybe that's it.... A lot of the characters in the Harry Potter series had a hard time, and the books were sometimes very dark, but as a rule it was a positive - even magical (yes I used that word...) story.  It was a world that I could see myself wanting to be in.  I don't feel that with  this book. I am glad I read it. But unlike the Harry Potter series, which I have read so many times that I think it is permanently imprinted on my eyeballs, reading Cursed Child once is enough.
 ** spoiler alert ** Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, the much awaited 8th book in the wildly popular and new classic series Harry Potter -- is actually a play in 2 Parts, 4 Acts. Based on a new original story by JK Rowling and John Tiffany -- the script has been written by Jack Thorne, and performances of the West End production in London opened the same day as the book's release (coincidentally, also Harry Potter and JK Rowling's birthday--July 31).<br/><br/>The play is set 19 years from when we last saw Harry at the end of Deathly Hallows (Book #7) -- Harry now works within the Ministry of Magic, is married to Ginny and has 3 children. The story focuses on Harry's second son, Albus Severus, (namesake of both Dumbledore and Snape). In his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft &amp; Wizardry, Albus makes an unlikely best friend - Scorpius, Draco Malfoy's son. Albus also gets sorted into an unlikely house -- the house of Slytherin.<br/><br/>Albus and Scorpius soon find themselves on an adventure through time, back to the Tri-Wizard Tournament, which took place in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Book #4) over 20 years in the past. Not surprisingly, they find out that changing events in time is a dangerous &amp; tricky ordeal with dire consequences. They will need the help of their family and friends (including Harry, Ron, Hermione and other well loved characters from the series) to right their wrongs and return to the present time.<br/><br/>The play primarily explores themes of father/son relationships and friendship - the strengths and weakness of both. It is a quick, fast-paced read; I received my copy in the mail on Monday and had it read by Wednesday evening. It is a must-read for any Harry Potter fan, although as a play it lacks the descriptions a novel would have had time to flesh out. As a play, however, it includes stage directions that allow readers to imagine beyond the text -- and it is packed with both action and heart. After a successful run on London's West End, perhaps it will come across the pond, giving American Harry Potter fans equal chance to relive the magic, seeing "The Boy Who Lived" once again.
 Yikes, this is quite bad. I have a theatre degree and therefore I'm no stranger to scripts, so the format isn't a big problem for me. The problem, however, is the writing, storyline, and characters; which are pretty big problems to have!! It's written like someone who has read a few plays but never written one would, ie, poorly. The plot is not very good, even when it finally takes off in the 2nd half. The characters are ghosts of themselves, in ways that are insulting to fans of the series.<br/><br/>I feel like I just purchased hard cover fan fiction, and I'm not happy about that. I would unread this if I could.
 I have no problem with a play format. The issue was that the characters were flat. No character development or plot! This is not the caliber of writing one would expect from Harry Potter. Why would JK Rowlings do this to us? So disappointed. A waste of time and money. It was short and superficial I didn't become invested in any of the characters even the ones I've grown up loving.
 I am one of those annoyingly positive, silver lining people. So I avoided ordering this because I had a feeling, but my daughter begged. We read it aloud, and by act 4, I was skimming because it was boring, the characters acted out of character, and the dialogue was cringey. I did enjoy the two main characters. But I think they would've been better served to not include a single original series character and habe a plot that did not involve Voldy Moldy. Let the kids stand on their own. It's an unfortunate mess. My daughter started detox by immediately beginning to reread "Sorcerer's Stone."  In time, we hope we will forget this story.
 What the hell did I just read?  The fact that it is a script is not the problem it's the horrendous plot, characters and writing. It is so far from the Harry Potter world we know and love. It is poorly written and just plain weird.... basically it's all over the place. Shame on J.K. Rowling for being apart of this rubbish.
 No worries, there are NO SPOILERS in this review, just a heartfelt opinion =)<br/><br/>Being that said I didn't read it when it first came out as there were SO MANY bad reviews. At the end at the start of this year I found myself in a deep Harry Potter groove, it was childhood all over again for me so I decided that I was going to read The Cursed Child as I was growing more curious about it, specially after reading that the play won so many awards.<br/><br/>Now, is this the best plot I've read in my life? No, definitely not and the "shocking" plot twist I saw it coming a mile away, I was more shocked for being so obvious and unoriginal that any other reason, I actually broke down laughing on how silly I found it. I read the book at least a  month ago and I had mixed feelings about it, so much that I actually started reading fanfiction of The Cursed Child and I found a GREAT one that continues on with the world The Curse Child introduces us to, the plot is MUCH better and the characters are very well portrayed so it took out a little of my frustrations with the play, BUT as time passed I kept coming back on how The Curse Child made me FEEL. From the start it wasn't so much about the plot, but more about the emotional journey of the characters and that is something I quite love and enjoy.<br/><br/>A lot of people complain about Harry being a bit "dark" (which sounds so much to the Star Wars fans saying that Luke is too "hopeless" in The Last Jedi) but that's life people!! In our own lives we experience hardships and bad moments, sometimes we grow to be a better person, others we do not, but either way the only way we grow is by being challenged and THAT is the core of Albus's story with his dad; their relationship is a challenge for both of them, not just to one another, but to also in an introspective way. We see how their lives have evolved, changed them and mold them. We have the Potters, and in the other hand we have the Malfoys and the difference is so great! We see how the hero (Harry) and the antihero (Draco) learned and grew out of the different experiences they had to live, how that shaped the relationship with their sons and how that affects EVERYTHING around them.<br/><br/>The lovely thing about The Cursed Child is not the main plot which I find dull, but the journey the characters are embarked on emotionally speaking, and how at the core of it all is the desire for family, to be seen and understood (even for the most unexpected characters); which is something we can all relate to. We have all being teenagers, we all KNOW how it feels when your parents don't see you, or you don't feel loved or understood by them, Albus's suffering is legit, despite being a little self-centered (like all kids at that age) and we see how Scorpius too deals with growing (and quite heart-wrenching) pains, but at the same time we see how they differ from one another and the different perspective both take on life.<br/><br/>Also I have to add that the "big problem" in The Cursed Child and that much people don't get is that this is NOT a book. A book, a novel is meant to be complete and whole on itself, it doesn't need anything else to be added. A script on the other hand is not, it is complete only when it is performed and showcased in front of an audience with its actors, scenery and music. I've been hearing the soundtrack created by Imogen Heap for The Cursed Child play and is BRILLIANT! If you love her credit song for Narnia: The Witch, the Lion and the Wardrobe you will love the music she created for the play. Is mystical and magical, it takes you somewhere deep within you and into the story; I can totally see the different scenes matched up to her music and it just FITS. So maybe as a written experience The Cursed Child might not be much, but I feel that as a play is something else entirely, although I haven't seen the play, but just by hearing the soundtrack Imogen Heap created I have a deep desire to see it, as it truly transports you to the story, hopefully they will in time bring it so south america, 'cause it would be awesome to be able to be transported to that world, as I find the emotional journey of the characters VERY compelling so being able to see it on stage must be wonderful.<br/><br/>So my advice it this, if you like this type of stories with emotional load and character development, read it, I believe you will enjoy it. If you dislike that type of story and you want those BIG plot twist with an amazing story maybe it will not be of your taste, although everyone has their own definition of what an "amazing story" is, but comparing to the other Harry Potter books I say this pot is rather dull, but the emotional road is intense and I quite enjoy that; love character development in stories and Albus relationship with Scorpius is rather truthful and conflicted sometimes too, I feel it is very honest in the way it treats father and son relationships, family relationships, friend relationships, the relationship with yourself and your own darkness as well.<br/><br/>Also, if you have Spotify (or on Youtube) do look up Imogen Heap's soundtrack for the play, I bet that reading the script while hearing the music would be a profound experience, even if we can't see the actors performs, we can well see the characters perform in our minds.<br/><br/>Hope this review can help you all and as said in the title, if you are curious it doesn't matter what anyone else says, go and read it and is your choice if you enjoy it or not, you have the right to both.
 This is basically poorly written fanfiction. I can't believe JKR attached her name to it. The plot has gaping plot holes, stupid twists that DO NOT MAKE SENSE, and the personalities of the original characters do NOT match what they were previously. I'm sorry but there is no way that the characters can change that much. I love Scorpius but he is way too overbearing, I just want to punch him in his fictional face. There is no way Scorpius can be THAT different from Draco.
 Let's just pretend this didn't happen. New Harry Potter book? What new Harry Potter book? I CAN'T HEAR YOU.<br/><br/>My gripe isn't "oh Harry would never do that...Hermione would never say that...Well, that's not how I imagined their lives to turn out..." No. Although there was plenty of that. Example:<br/><br/>"Hermione: It's become quite popular {place to visit} as a weekend break.<br/>Draco: I can see why - look at the thatched roofs. And is that a farmer's market?"<br/><br/>I have news for you. Draco would never talk about the quaintness of a thatched roof or go gaga over a farmer's market. Literally the most absurd thing I've ever read.<br/><br/>No, the improbable dialogue wasn't what turned me off. It was that this new story lacked innovation. Lacked magic. Lacked Hagrid. Cliché in both characters and plot development. Albus Potter was a thoughtless misguided Harry. Scorpio Malfoy was a totally-not-endearing Ron. This was just bad. I mean, read it because it's the new Harry Potter. But that's it.<br/><br/>Rowling was able to channel bits of the original series with at least one character - Ginny still has the personality of a wet cardboard box.
 There were moments and aspects in the story that I really liked, but on the whole things just didn't seem to come together in a coherent fashion and characters didn't seem true to themselves.<br/><br/>My two favorite works of fiction are the Harry Potter Books, and the Original Star Wars movies.  The best explanation about how I feel about this story is that it reminds me of how the prequels to Star Wars felt.  It still has that spark of what made Harry Potter so magical and wonderful, but it fails to ignite into the flame that made the original work so compelling, moving, and lasting in its impact on people.<br/><br/>It may well still be worth your time to enjoy those sparks, and like many of the reviews I view this story not in a vacuum but in the context of it being a Harry Potter story and in my opinion it just doesn't measure up.<br/><br/>You can find other reviews which go into greater detail regarding all finer points of this.
 Despite the size and being in script form, it was actually a really engrossing and fast read which first begins where the 7th book's epilogue ended. I found a lot of the returning characters seemed to be a little, or in some cases quite a lot, out of character from the original series of books in ways that couldn't always be explained away by being older now and having more life experiences. Though, some of them could be and I liked those changes quite a bit.<br/><br/>Some characters we get much more insight into than we did in the original series and their changes make a lot of sense due to that insight. Perhaps the changes that didn't make sense were because of a lack of that sort of insight. There were also a few plot holes I noticed but nothing that was annoying. It's probably important to note that even though this is a book you can pick up and hold, it is really just a script for a play and isn't meant to be considered in the same way a novel would be.<br/><br/>The new characters are engaging and have their own distinct personalities and issues and struggles and are fun to read about. Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy especially, which is a good thing considering that they're the main characters for this.<br/><br/>This is an exciting, touching addition to the original series and I find that my money and time were well spent on it. I would absolutely recommend this book. The only reason this doesn't get full stars from me is because I docked a star (I would have docked only half if it would've let me) for the returning characters whose OOC-ness* didn't really get an adequate explanation.<br/><br/>*OOC = Out of Character.
 There is little to say about this sloppily crafted and poorly written play that hundreds of other reviewers have not already said. I will mention that apart from ridiculous plot and implausible characterizations, the play shows a kind of ponderousness that is mostly absent from the novels. Time and again the characters give long and trite lectures on their motivations or on the value of some ideal. Dumbledore in particular evinces none of the with and deftness he did in the books when he was being pedagogical.
 Disappointed i is the only thing I can think of to say about this book. I pre-ordered it and look forward to it all summer, and then when I received it was disappointed to see that it was written in script form for a play, instead of a novel. That was just the beginning of the disappointment  I then read the book, which was nowhere near being up to the standards that JK Rowling established in the original series. The characters were flat, the plot needed more development, and some of the idioms were just ridiculous in light of the Harry Potter world ("no way Jose")? Seriously?!  I'm such a huge fan of HP and this book just didn't live up to the reputation of its predecessors.
 It doesn't even deserve one star. I am a major Potter fan, and have been happily addicted since I was eight years old. I pre-ordered this as soon as it was available for sale, and I was ready to fly to England to see the play (though this did not happen thankfully, because the tickets were all sold out.)<br/>Not only do I want a refund for my money, I also want a refund for the time I spent waiting for this.<br/>The dialogue was terrible, and the characters of the Harry Potter we know and love did not exist in this play. Everything Harry, Ron and Hermione said or did was completely out of character.<br/>I won't give examples so as not to spoil it for anyone who might have actually liked this. Except one-pigeons???? What in the world? I'm sorry but no. Harry is not afraid of pigeons.<br/><br/>The plot was unoriginal. I've read dozens of unprofessional Harry Potter fan fictions with the the same exact one.<br/>There were too many continuity errors to count.<br/><br/>I spent good money on this, and I'm restraining myself from throwing it in the trash. Harry Potter fans deserved a better story than this.<br/>Of course a play or movie adaptation of a book will have differences. That's obvious. But this? I don't know what this was, but one thing's for sure. This wasn't Harry Potter, not by a long shot.
 Overall: The story was moderately interesting.  It involves time travel which can be very interesting if done well.  But, this was not done particularly well.  You knew what was going to happen by definition -- no other way than to suddenly change Harry Potter Canon material which is not going to happen with this play.<br/><br/>The writing style / dialog style was a bit off putting for me.  I really did not like the Ron and Hermaine's tone.  The way the characters were portrayed in the future was not very flattering.  I know it is supposed to interject the grind of real life but why do I want too much real life if my escapist reading?<br/><br/>The concept of Voldamort having a child is interesting.  Frankly, if she wanted to really have her revenge then she could have easily done it on the hapless characters in this book.<br/><br/>The content from the play could be an interesting addition to the Harry Potter canon but it needs to be rewritten and definitely not as a play.<br/><br/>I was expecting more for the book.  Harry Potter material does not work particularly well as a play in general anyway.<br/><br/>Summary:<br/>If you are looking for a Harry Potter reading fix, then pick it up but prepared to be annoyed with the play and the author.
 This is fan fiction. Every time I re-read a book in the Potter series, I find a new reason to love Rowling as a writer. Her plots are tight and incredibly well developed, her use of language is art, her understanding of human dynamics is profound, and her her lesson about love and friendship is as subtle as it is powerful. The Cursed Child script is missing everything that makes Rowling's writing so genius. This "book" cheapens the brand. Why Rowling allowed her name to be attached is a mystery.
 My review is going to sound strikingly similar to the preceding reviews.<br/>1.)  I was fully aware Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is a play rather than a book, but was still willing to read it. A play doesn't have the same opportunity to create complex characters as a book, so it seems that new characters are just dropped into the plot. These characters are complete strangers to the readers and contribute nothing to the plot other than a few lines.<br/>2.) I understand this is a play and it must move along to keep the showtime reduced, but as a reader, it seems like the plot moves extremely quickly. The speed at which the plot moves does not allow for the authors to share details about how characters arrived to their emotional state, or provide a sequence of events that led to a current event in the story. A scene that would have taken a chapter in a book takes a few pages of dialogue and narrations.<br/>3.) The authors of this book do not seem to know the original Harry Potter characters.  The characters are all 20-something years older than what would have been their 7th/final year at Hogwarts. I know people change over the course of 20-25 years, but the characters seem to be different people. The way they react to situations and their interactions with each other are not consistent with the characters we knew. I don't want to include a spoiler, but upon finding out a character's true identity, I essentially rolled my eyes.<br/>4.) Last, but not least, the plot is weak.<br/><br/>The only person that should be writing a Harry Potter book is J.K. Rowling. As an avid Harry Potter reader, I believe I know the characters very well. However, the only person that really knows them is their creator, J.K. Rowling. Lets leave it to the pro people! After reading this play, I have zero desire to see the play myself.
 Being a HUGE Harry Potter fan all my life, it is difficult to report that this simply could not hold my attention in any way shape or form.  I understand this is not a HP novel, and went into this with no expectations other than to read more into a world that I am already very fascinated in.  To my amazement, I couldn't finish the book.  It's not the screenplay writing style, or the dialogue-centered narrative, it's the stupid plot and the feeling I am reading a Middle schoolers HP fan fiction that makes it hard for me to look at this book on my shelf.  It doesn't belong next to the Harry Potter Novels I proudly display high on the second shelf, eye level for optimal contact with the other impeccable J.K. Rowling novels. It sits at the bottom, next to my third grader purchased Captain Underpants novels, and even the Captain cant contain the brown stain he feels for this 300 page excuse for a screenplay. Sorry 'Arry, yer a pissant.
 I am a huge HP fan and thus was a let down.  I hope it is better in production because it reads lime bad fan fiction.
 You know how sometimes Disney makes an okay movie with a slew of famous voice actors? And you know how sometimes Disney makes a sequel to those okay movies with completely different voices, thereby making the sequel to the okay movie even less okay than the first?<br/>That's how I feel about 'Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.' It is a pale comparison to JK Rowling's original 7 Harry Potter books. It feels somehow plastic, not nearly as real.<br/>When I read the 7 original books, I could not put them down. Was absolutely, incredibly enthralled by them. They remain my favorite books even now. When I read this newest one, my brain would connect that I was reading something and then it would go "Oh, yeah, that Harry Potter book." It wasn't something I NEEDED to ick right back up.<br/>So, ya, if you're a hardcore Potterhead, than you should read a copy. But it isn't going to enrich your life or your understanding of the wizarding world.
 I know this is a play, and we read plays differently than we read novels...but where was the suspense?  Where were the intricacies of plot and character?  There were some feel good moments when Draco's family and Harry's family were brought together, but it left me about as satisfied as the last film did when we skipped ahead a few years and found older protagonists and antagonists schlepping their kids to the train station.  All the darkness/hopefulness, suspense/calm were missing.  Ms. Rowling, please write the next ones yourself.
 First to clear some confusion - this book is actually a script. It's not a book that the play was based off it, it's actually the script of the play. As such, reading it is a little awkward.<br/><br/>Secondly, I'm a huge Harry Potter fan, and downloaded this book immediately. I wish it had been a bonafide full-length action-packed book like the originals, but maybe nothing can really live up to those? I finished it in a few hours. I found parts of the plot to be a little forced, and it was admittedly strange reading about Harry, Ron, and Hermione all grown-up.<br/><br/>The book follows Harry and Ginny's youngest son Albus over his first year at Hogwarts. Like his dad, he gets into trouble. Harry is OK at being a dad, you forgive him because despite how cool he is; he really did have terrible role models growing up. However, the action is like when you're watching a romance film and everything bad happens because of a misunderstanding. Unlike in the original series, where Harry and friends are forced into crazy situations, in this book it all sort of seems to unfold because of poor decisions. I do think that had it been more drawn out there could have been other plot lines to help round out the story and make it more believable.<br/><br/>That said, I'm VERY much looking forward to when I can snag myself some tickets to see the play. I think that it'll be great in play form, lighthearted, and just enough to sate the Harry Potter appetite.
 Alright, so the kicker here is that it's not everything everyone made it up to be. We were all expecting/hoping/praying for it to be the eighth book in the series, to continue on our childhood, however, it got blown way out of proportion. While it reads well, and has an intriguing theory, it's nowhere near the quality of writing we came to expect from J.K herself. It's a well wrote fan fiction, that is really just a theory. Read it- if you loved the Harry Potter series, really read it, but don't expect it to be the answers to your prayers because it's not. If you can get past that, then you'll probably enjoy it.
 Harry Potter and the Cursed Child must be viewed in from a certain perspective for Potter fans to cope with it.  It is a play based on a short story that J K Rowling wrote.  Just like the Potter movies change the plot and skip over massive sections of the novels, a play must have it’s own pace and style of writing.  It can’t cover all of the glorious detail the books could.<br/>For me the play script was a lovely short story, sort of like another couple of chapters at the end of The Deathly Hallows.<br/>If you didn’t enjoy the last chapter of the Deathly Hallows, then this play is not of you.  It is hard to see the our beloved Hogwarts friends grow old and boring, I found that a little depressing at the end of such a wonderful series. This play helped me understand that it is OK.<br/><br/>In this story we get a brief glimpse into the lives of the Potter and friends' progeny, along with an exciting page turning adventure.  It’s use of the time turner is a plot device that allows us to view the ‘greatest hits’ from the book series.  I imagine the crowd cheering each time we see an old favorite character make an appearance, like an encore after a fantastic concert.<br/><br/>As a huge Potter fan, the play script helped me realize I have had enough of Harry and friends as adults. I realized that with adulthood Harry could no longer have the same sort of adventures his character had in the novels, he has kids and responsibilities.  It would be against his big hearted character to put those things at risk.  And after reading the first few chapters, I didn’t want him to.  I was more interested in what the kids were up to; they were interesting because of their well established back stories and I wanted to read more about them.  If you had asked me before I read The Cursed Child, I would have told you the opposite, I didn't want to read about the kids, I wanted more from Harry, Ron and Hermione.<br/><br/>If there is more of the Potter universe out there in JK’s mind, I’ll be happy to just know that Harry is still existing in it and that he is still an imperfect human, who makes bad decisions as a parent as he did as a kid, but is still pure of heart and every bit the hero from the novels. But if the adventures in that magical world continue without him, I will be delighted to read every last word.<br/>I really hope this is a bridge to new adventures in Rowling’s magical world, it successfully established new Hogwarts' characters that I care about and want to see more of.  I struggled with the idea that the new Potter universe movie, 'Fantastic Beast and Where to Find Them' will take place years before most of the familiar characters were even born, because I thought I needed our three original heroes, but now I am hopeful that Rowling’s magic will be more than enough!
 Maybe it's the fact that it's a play and not a traditional novel that makes for much less story depth than the original books. This story is 90% dialogue (again, play), which makes for a quick read but also left me feeling a great lack of satisfaction.  I was happy for another HP installment, but I found this story seriously lacking in creativity and oomph.  The characters also didn't seem like themselves.  Harry was kind of an a-hole, Ron had more wit and balls than normal, Ginny was bold and talkative, Malfoy did a complete 180, and Hermione wasn't quite snarky enough.  The whole thing felt very contrived to me.
 Hmm, I really hate to give JK and company just three stars, but that's how this book/play left me feeling - just kinda "meh." True, the Harry Potter series is an extremely tough act to follow. But rabid fans were clamoring for another taste of Potterdom and most will never have the opportunity to see the stage production in person. So, for that purpose, this was a nice offering - and a fabulously smart move. Because this little sip of our favorite wizarding world has no doubt increased anticipation for the upcoming film "Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them" exponentially. I know I can't wait to see it!<br/><br/>But reading "Harry Potter and the Cursed Child" just didn't make me feel like I was getting a taste of the stage experience; instead, I felt like I was reading the working outline of Rowling's next big series. (And perhaps it actually is...wouldn't that be cheeky? :D ) In any case, I really wanted more...more character development, more backstory, more action, more dialogue. Seven books' worth more. C'mon, Jo, it will only take five (okay, maybe more) years of your life to write a new series. Is that really too much to ask? ;)
 Seems to be written in a hurry. Nothing the characters did was believable and nothing that happened was believable. I really wanted to like this story but it seemed more like childishly written fan fiction.
 I read this on my kindle. The story is nothing like it should have been. No one was how you remember them. Key characters such as Hagrid are barely even mentioned. We learn almost nothing about any of the new kids except Albus. Don't ruin your Harry Potter memories by reading this book.
 I love J.k. And the HP books, this feels like the writing of a fanfiction with plot holes, not the writing of the person who created this wonderful series, what happened! Harry has a horrible child, he can't even defend him self in a duel...this is the same person who defeated Voldermort repeatedly! Draco's  character is all over the place super weird sometimes like he used to be, sometime nice and funny to a degree, he has some weird multiple personality disorder. his son is sweet, charming and funny like Ron smart as Hermione but not that great on magic So Weird! And Really LOVES Albus...like I want to marry you love, which is fine I think that would be very forward but then he likes Rose too, don't lie to yourself boy!<br/><br/>Dialog is painful at times....this is Star Wars prequel bad.... Why!!!! I just don't get it, I am going to pretend this never happened and remember the old Harry.
 I read a review before posting this and she made an excellent point. This book is more like a "poorly written fanfic". It seemed fake to me the whole time. You can tell that J.K. Rowling hardly had any input into the writing of this story. It was horribly written. Never have I read a book and been most disappointed in my whole life. The plot was mediocre and the characters (like Harry) were saying things and acting in ways I know not to be true. There was no feeling, emotion, or excitement that the original Harry Potter books have. It's sad because I had such high hopes for this book and it just was not good. I wouldn't even waste money seeing this live. Such a disappointment for someone who is a HUGE Harry Potter fan.
 What an absolute disappointment, and it has nothing to do with it being a screenplay.<br/><br/>When I read that J.K. Rowling had assisted in this, I was truly excited, thinking that I'd once again be taken back to this wonderful world. I envisioned reliving childhood experiences of losing myself in Hogwarts, imagining that I was there with all these characters that I hold close to my heart.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this book takes all the magic away. The way these loveable characters are portrayed in quite the opposite: Harry is a disillusioned and angry man, Ginny is God knows what, Hermione's intelligence and wit are gone, and Ron's a backdrop, with no lines with substance, just to name a few.<br/><br/>Along with all the timeline errors, and mistakes in the stories, none of these characters' personalities are the same as the previous books. The storyline itself feels inaccurate, rushed, and not thought out at all.<br/><br/>I really wanted to love this book, because I wanted a chance to travel back to that world, but these aren't J.K. Rowling's characters. These aren't their personalities, their courage, their stories.<br/><br/>If I could give this zero stars, I definitely would.
 I was very excited when I saw there would another Harry Potter. I enjoyed the series so much. What I didn't realize, my fault, is that this book was written as a screenplay. It maybe a wonderful play, but the book, not so much. All the charm is gone, just the dialect. It's not fun to read, it switches from scene to scene quickly. I feel it was written for the money and not for the joy of Harry Potter readers.. As I said, not happy.
 I was soooooo excited for this! The anticipation! Those same feelings conjured up from when I was a kid. Oh how I wanted to love this. This is basically a badly written fanfiction and I know one when I see it because I have read so many Harry Potter fanfictions that are immensely better and quite frankly more believable than this. I even write fanfiction myself. A lot of people like to say that those who don't like it don't understand that it's a play and not a novel. As an English Literature major I know how to appreciate a play, this just fails on so many levels. Plot, inconsistencies with canon in the original Harry Potter series, beloved characters that are completely out of character. I don't care if J.K. Rowling gave it her stamp of approval, it's just utterly disappointing. However, by all means buy it for yourself and decide for yourself, while I don't like it, I read through it rather quickly and it was fun to read (and I absolutely love Albus and Scorpius in this) so I'm not trying to discourage anyone from reading this but don't go into it expecting it to be like what you're used to.
 I'm a die hard Harry Potter fan and the fact that it was a play threw me way off. I didn't know that buying the book. I pushed that aside. I grew up going to every Harry Potter book opening as a child as well as the movies. I wasn't able to go to the crushed child's opening because of work. I picked the book up today and while reading I melted. This is not J.K. Rowling writing. This is a lot of someone else's. There is no excitement, no magic, no feeling. The only reason I have given this book 3 stars is because part four is J.K Rowling writing and you can feel it with every ounch of your body. Part four brings you back to the Harry Potter you grew up loving. I will say no true Harry Potter fan won't cry in part four because of the history behind it. We all have that moment when we wounder about potter and James death and what Harry would do and this bring you to that. I haven't cried like that since Severus killed Dumbledore. Part four makes the whole book. Sadly this can never be a movie with out there being more heart to it.
 I feel I must start this review by saying that I am a die hard Harry Potter fan. I have all the books on audio and listen to them on repeat on a daily basis. They are my "background noise" or "white noise". I can quote whole sections at a time with Jim Dale as he reads it. I eagerly suck up any additional stories or writings I can from JK about the wizarding world and for that reason alone I love the play. With that being said, I am disappointed by the obvious lack of JK's skill in this play. It is obvious that it was written by someone else and only approved by her. There is a lack of detail in the storyline and more flat out bashing you over the head with information. The story also seemed rushed as compared to the books. This might be because it was meant to be enjoyed as a play and not as a book, but I found it to be a little disappointing. From this point on I warn you of spoilers!!!<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT<br/>SPOILER ALERT<br/>SPOILER ALERT<br/><br/>The story picks up at platform 9 3/4  19 years later. Already I am annoyed that some lines are spoken by the wrong characters, but maybe I am the only one that picks up on that.  Albus becomes best friends with Scorpius, Scorpius and Albus become best friend, Albus and Scorpius are attached at the hip, inseparable friends... We get it. They bash you over the head with it. Unlike JK, who let's you discover character development through character behavior, these guys flat out tell you over and over and over again. I found it a little insulting, but maybe it comes across different in the play. I hated the lady that pushes the trolley. They changed her from a human witch into some strange bogart like morphing monster. It seemed out of line for the wizarding world and rather uninventive. I find it more likely that there is a spell or barrier that keeps the students on the train and not a monster cart lady that is as old as time.<br/><br/>I did like hearing about where Harry, Ron and Hermione are now. I find it perfectly natural that Ron is a huge jokester now. We all knew that he took over Fred's spot in the joke shop and with his wife being in a serious position like the minister of magic, it makes sense that he would balance out the relationship by being over the top funny. I also liked the way they portrayed Ginny and Harry's relationship. Ginny always did seem more insightful than Harry so when he flies off the handle at Albus it seems natural that she would comfort him and be able to reassure him that Al will forgive him.<br/><br/>I always thought there was something between Bellatrix and the Dark Lord so to hear they had a daughter seems entirely natural. There is easily enough time between when we see them at the beginning of book 7 (July so probably already pregnant but not showing) and when the snatchers bring Harry to the Malfoy’s for her to have had a baby.<br/><br/>Over all, I am glad to have further information on where everyone is now, but I am disappointed in many parts of the plot, the way it was written and the lack of JK’s input. This won't be something I listen to on repeat, but I will likely still read it once a year.
 The Potterite in me was satisfied; the theater buff was not. I don't question that the London premier production is handling all these special effects magnificently, and wish I could see them do it in person. But if a school or community theater could manage them all, it would amaze me no end. And as a play, it seems largely to rely on these special effects, in an effort to beat the movies at their own special-effects game. The scenes are short and choppy; and it was sometimes difficult to follow which character(s) were the most focal ones. As a piece of theater, it came across to me as straining too hard to do too much. And even at that, I found there seemed to have been something crucial cut out in the subplot about Cedric Diggory. I should have preferred a more in-depth treatment with fewer scenes, but longer and more fully-developed ones; and something that school and community theaters could do more easily. I may be wrong: my fellow Harry Potter fans may find all the magic razzle-dazzle the important thing; but much as I have always enjoyed reading plays, I think I would have preferred this story in the form of an eighth novel, maybe even a trilogy of novels sequelizing the septology.
 I really liked the screenplay. I understand why some people are disappointed though; you don’t get to see the actors and there isn’t all the exposition and internal dialogue that you get in a book. However, if you’ve read the books once, twice, three times...then you understand the characters and I don’t think the screenplay takes you outside those parameters. One review I read didn’t like how Dumbledore was portrayed. I disagree, the man was full of regrets and whatever was left of him in the portrait was done with interfering. I loved seeing Snape out from under all the pressure but still delightfully snarky. Give it a try.
 HOW DARE THEY! I have been a loyal Harry Potter fan for years, but this book just ruined everything! It wasn't even true to the characters! Harry's this angery, soppy, stupid, egotistical, WORST character I have ever read about. What happened to the loyal, brave boy everyone loves? He would never threaten Hogwarts! Ever! The harry I know would have been proud his son was bridging the gap between malfoys and potters. Even if he was a little upset he would have encouraged his son to continue with his friendship. I also hated the time travel. It NEVER works out in a book. Cedri. Diggory a death eater, come on! That was the pinnicle of unbelievable. Dumbledore is a washed up tragedy, he ALREADY apologized people! Ron and Hermione were complete jokes😩 Ron would never get drunk at his wedding, and Hermione was about as smart as a zombie! But the absolute worst part was that Voldemort had a daughter. Sigh. Everyone in the entire harry potter universe KNOWS that that would never happen. He would never attatch himself to another person. Dumblesore makes that VERY clear. So to anyone reading this review, don't east your time or money. This waste of space in the universe doesn't deserve it. The cursed child will destroy everything you hold dear about harry potter😢
 Words cannot describe how much the Harry Potter series has meant to me. I have grown up immersed in the story and was thrilled to hear that there would be a new addition! Preordered the book months in advance and started reading as soon as it arrived.<br/><br/>That, my friends, is where the magic died. I knew going in that this was a script and would not be formatted like the original 7 had been. But what really stakes the heart of readers will be the complete lack of character continuity, terrible dialogue, and disjointed storylines. To be honest this read as a really really poorly written fanfic. A fanfic by someone who may or may not have read the preceding books, someone who has never written creatively before, and someone who thought Rowling's story should include random and unexplained instances of what can only be described as science fiction.<br/><br/>Having to think about what I read while writing this review gets me enraged all over again. I simply hope that the movie version of this will remain truer to the "real" Harry Potter than this utter waste of ink and paper. If you are a true Harry Potter fan, save your soul and read a plot summary of this rather than causing the yourself the emotional pain of reading this disgusting facsimile.
 Yes, I knew it was a play script.  I found it tedious, insipid, and boring.  It was a lot of work to keep having directions to read.  It isn't well-written, but I assume JK needed some money, so she put her name on it.  The storyline wasn't awful, but the carrying out of it was. The characters were underdeveloped and I never found myself attached to them, as in the original series.  You never become invested - you don't really care if the boys achieve their goal.<br/>Over and over, all I wanted was JK to have just written this as a book.  I understand she is a franchise, and congratulations for bringing uyourself up by the bootstraps, but I could have done without this book.  Perhaps the play is better (Emma Watson said it was).
 I love HP with most of my heart. I grew up with these stories. I pre ordered books 4-7 on Amazon as a child, flew to Florida just for HP World, listen to the audio books on repeat, all of it. But this.... this screenplay... is an abomination of all things HP. This play wouldn't have worked without JKs approval, but her approval is a discrace and just a way to ensure it makes money. The characters are so wrong, the things they say, the things they do, the actual characters would never ever in a million years say or do. It makes Harry look like a terrible dad, Ron an idiot, Hermione unethical. Don't even get me started on the concept of Voldemort procreating. I wish I wouldn't have read this. I'm pretending I didn't. I would burn the memory from my brain if I could. It didn't happen.
 I love Harry Potter. I have since I was 7 (I'm nearly 22 now) but I dislike the screenplay style of the story. This is BASED off of JKR'S but not completely composed by her, like the original series. The story, therefore, feels rushed, and the dialog, choppy. The friendship between Scorpio and Albus doesn't feel authentic like the original trio. BUT this is because of the screenplay fromat. If you love Harry Potter, you will read this no matter what....but my rating as a loyal and true fan.... is -5 ....out of 10.
 There seems to be some confusion from certain buyers of this "book" about what they are getting and comparing it to the original seven works of the Harry Potter heptalogy. This is a bound script book. It's literally the script to a stage play of a new story set in the HP universe. As such, it is almost all dialogue with very little of the detailed exposition that so many of us loved in the original series.<br/><br/>Keeping in mind that this is merely a script, I give the work 4 stars. Would I have loved to have seen it fleshed out into a proper eighth book - of course I would have. So would almost everyone who has read it, but it is what it is and as an HP fan I'm glad that the story has continued with the main three characters set 22 years in the future.<br/><br/>Without giving away too many spoilers, the story mostly revolves around the sons of Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy and their daddy issues that get them into lots of trouble. Of the two, I found that Draco's son, Scorpius, was easily the most entertaining and distinct character but Albus Potter was also well defined.<br/><br/>As far as the adults, Hermione is very Hermione-like and Ron is exactly what you'd expect a middle-aged Ron to be like. The one character that just didn't ring very authentic to me was adult Harry. There was just something off about his depiction and his relationship with his son Albus that didn't ring true to me.<br/><br/>It's a quick read being that it's a 300 page script book so be prepared for that. And maybe I had lower expectations knowing that this wasn't a "real" book, but I still think it's a very welcome addition to any Potter fan.
 Huge Harry Potter fan and all things Potter. I was thoroughly disappointed by this book as most other readers were. The characters were not true to themselves, the plot was awful and to be quite frank, made absolutely no sense. There was no story line... As the prior 7 books, each was a year at Hogwarts. This very short book covered several years but really had no substance and was just a rewrite of the books. I like J. K. Rowling, but absolutely believe that she did not have much to do with this book, if anything at all.<br/>I am not saying don't read it, I did breeze through it. But do not get your hopes up on the content .
 I couldn't wait to get my hands on this new story even while questioning the genre and readability. Overall the story works. The characters read flat, perhaps because they are intended to be acted. I felt as though the characters didn't age realistically and did things not realistic to who they are. Overall, it was okay. If you are a fan, you probably need to read it just to maintain your sanity. Was it worth 14 dollars, probably not, but I couldn't not read it. I had many of the same issues with it that I had with the second half of book 7.  It was okay, but if you're really needing a fix, go back and reread the series. You can't go home again, and it's true.
 Just like all of the 1 star reviews, I will not reiterate why the script is so bad point by point. In summary: bad plot, lack of character development, and overall just a path down memory lane of books 1-7. I would save your money and time; if you must, just go to Wikipedia and read the play summary.
 Cursed Child is an entertaining story, though the pace of reading a script doesn't exactly resemble reading a novel. All the magic of JKR's wizard universe is a little harder to find here, since nearly everything is dialogue. I imagine the stagecraft would make up for it.<br/>The plot contains some surprises, but if you can excuse somewhat of a spoiler, a significant portion just feels like Back to the Future II. The handling of time travel in the play is not as tight as what we saw in Prisoner of Azkaban, and it occasionally felt like a retread of Harry's Greatest Hits.<br/>I like that the primary characters, Albus and Scorpius, weren't just younger copies of their parents. I think the exploration of parenting and living up to parental expectations could be quite moving with the right cast.<br/>Overall, it's nice to be back reading Potter again. Reading Cursed Child was like attending my High School reunion. It's great to catch up with these old friends, but we're all going to be relieved when it's time to go home.
 Clumsy and ham fisted. Aside from the fact it's written as a script, it smacks as if the agent said to the author "Hey, can you bang out a sequel over the weekend, so we can get something to publishing next Tuesday?" Much like when a stand in takes up the torch to continue or finish an established franchise (e.g., Mitch Rapp, Jack Ryan, Star Wars movies 1-3), the finished product lacks continuity, polish, and elegance.<br/>This is not an adventure or mystery, like the original books. There is very little (practically zero) magic (ideal for a live stage production). A couple of potions, a few unlock spells. Certainly nothing 'new' to indicate the wizarding world advanced anything in two decades since Hallows. This is a morality play about forgiveness and redemption, coming of age and parents relating to their children; it could have been set in any small town in any time period, with normal people, and it would sell about 20,000 copies. Since it's recycling established, endearing characters it is going to be commercially successful. But it left this dedicated fan disappointed and feeling a bit swindled.
 I was very disappointed with this book. It is written in the studio format, which is probably the only way the authors could get it to work. It is obvious that JK Rowling did not write this; it is so far away from the usual quality workmanship we've come to expect from the author of the Harry Potter series. The story here, if there is one, is disjoined and choppy with glaring omissions and convenient scene changes which seem to be used not to move the story along, but rather used as a device to get the characters out of an untenable situation. This could have been a really good book; unfortunately, it is not. Don't waste your money --- borrow it from the library if you simply must read everything about Harry Potter and friends. But, prepare to be disappointed.
 Having been a Harry Potter and Rowling fan from the start, I was thrilled to see something new come out to quell the amateur fan-fiction that sought to keep the legacy going after Rowling ended her Harry Potter series.  This, however, is a chaotic mess, a mash-up of other story arcs, and a monumental disappointment.<br/><br/>While the script format could have been clever, the plot is lame and the dialogue is forced and silly.  The characters we had come to know through the "real" Harry Potter books are watered-down, shallow, thin, and barely recognizable.<br/><br/>I kept reading waiting for redeeming value, but sadly, there is none to be found in this horribly written bit of overly sentimental schlock.<br/><br/>If only Rowling herself would bring her creative powers to her Harry Potter series to keep it going, this sort of callow offering would not have been marketed.<br/><br/>Alas, I had to give it one star because no stars was not an option.
 This is a play script, not a book. But still it reads like it fits right in with the other Harry Potter novels. Basically, the story starts off right where the postscript of the movie Death Hallow part 2 left off, with Harry, Ginny and sons at Platform 9 3/4 as Albus Severus Potter prepares to leave for his first year at Hogwarts and is worrying about being sorted into Slytherin.<br/><br/>I will try to avoid spoilers, but let's just say Albus makes best friends with Scorpius Malfoy, who seems to have fallen far from his father's and grandfather's tree.<br/><br/>There's a timeturner involved, a prophecy, and the return of Voldemort.<br/><br/>That should be enough to get you hooked.  For me, I am waiting for the play to come to the USA and then I have to figure out how to secure some of the tickets which will may be sold out for decades in advance.<br/><br/>And if you figure it out, tell me who the cursed child is supposed to be.
 SPOILER ALERTS AHEAD!!!  Scorpius was the only decent character in my opinion.  He was well-written and felt like more of a hero in the book than Albus did.  Everyone else was either wildly out of character (Snape cracking jokes?!  Voldemort has a daughter?!  Get out of here with that) or just flat-out annoying.  I've heard it's more entertaining to watch on the stage, but that's very likely only because in theater the focus tends to be more on the theatrics first.  Yes, it's written in play format, but it's not really distracting and provides an easy read.  Hackneyed events, characters wildly incongruent with their book and movie versions, and ridiculous plot devices really, really do make this feel like a horrible fanfiction, or at least an encyclopedia of all the worst tropes one tends to find in them.  Read if you're a hardcore Potter fan (you know you'll always wonder anyway if you don't), but be prepared for disappointment.
 (No spoilers.) I hated giving this book only one star. I'm a huge, huge fan of JK Rowling's work. I've been reading the Potter books once a year since they came out. I've read her other works, as well. I adore them all. This just does not hold a candle to the rest.  I had not realized at first this would be in screen play format, which is really annoying and difficult to read-my fault for not paying attention to that. I had to force myself to get through it.The plot is weak and has holes, too many questions left unanswered, the story was rushed, and the characters actions were out of character (primarily Harry.)  It just seemed as if the attention to detail and rich storytelling that we are accustomed to with Rowling were missing.  This one  missed the mark. I'm gonna pretend I didn't read it now and hope one day I have enough money to travel to London for the express purpose of seeing the play in person. (lol!)
 I was an adult fan of this series.  I read them with my kids who were in elementary school when we started.  I have read the series once more on my own.  I am a hard core fan.  Love, love, love the story.  Bloody brilliant.  Exceptional writing.  JK Rowling is an incredible writer.  Consider the detail with which this entire story is written.  It's astounding.  The Cursed Child, not so much.  It was lame.  That's the best word I can come up with.  The story was contrived and a tad absurd.  The dialogue was weak.  The characters were changed.  Moaning Myrtle...that was the hardest to swallow.  Really!?!?  Malfoy, Ron and Dumbledore where also unrecognizable.  I wonder if these guys even read the books?  It seemed like they intentionally made the adult characters lame so the 2 young protagonist would stand out more.  If that was the case they failed miserably.  I get that it was a play and there is no character development but seriously, how did this get beyond a first year editor.  Read it if you're that curious but don't forget you were warned.
 Spoilers! You can tell it was not written by J.K. Rowling.  Harry is a very different father than the one we saw sending his sons off to Hogwarts.  In this version he is uncomfortable in the role of father and has a hard time relating to his son.  A sweet little old witch is turned into a demon truant officer and there is a very unlikely offspring as the new villain.  I looked forward to reading this and really tried to like it but could not.  There was so much time travel and alternate universes that I thought I must be reading a Dr. Who sci-fi rather than a Rowling Hogwarts fantasy.  The one redeeming part was the pairing of best friends from the offspring of enemies.
 I am a HUGE fan of Harry Potter and JK Rowling, but even I think some HP fans got a little ahead of themselves with what their expectations for this "book" was going to be about.  A lot of the reviews on here are pretty telling of that.  I think a lot of fans were expecting typical Harry, Hermoine, and Ron high jinx which you just don't get from this story.  It lacks JK Rowling's magical touch, but that is because she didn't write it.  She came up with a story with these 2 men, and in turn these 2 men turned it into a play.  Play scripts aren't the easiest to read sometimes.  They tend to lack dimension and can have characters coming off a little flat.  For this particular story some of the flatness does come from the writing.  There are moments that could have definitely been better, but I also think some of the lack luster moments are nothing like that while you sit and watch the actors weave their magic into the characters they are portraying.<br/>After all the negative reviews I read I was a little hesitant to start even reading, but half way through I realized it wasn't as awful as some of the more melodramatic reviews are portraying it to be.  Is it the same Harry that we've all grown up with no; but that's just it who is the exact same as they were 19 years ago?  Harry is almost 40 overworked and living a rather mundane life compared to his adolescent years.  The play deals with far more dare I say muggle issues and much less of the wizarding world magic we've all been use to.<br/>This story won't work for everyone who is a lover of this series and I can see why.  For me this story has in no way changed how I feel about the series, as other have felt it has ruined it for them.  If you are on the fence I'd say read it. Definitely go in with an open mind.
 Much has been said and criticized about the script format in comparison to the original novels. True, it gives the story a very different flow. Different, not better or worse. The story is actually quite enjoyable in merging the generation of characters that we know (Hermione, Ginny, Ron, Draco, and of course Harry) with their children. Surprisingly, it very much humanizes Draco and much of the Malfoy family. I did find it rather disappointing, however, that Ron is mostly regarded as a leftover and is not really given a significant role. My other criticism is that the dialogue sounds rather forced, and a few scenes, while obviously trying to pull for emotional content, are not quite effective at continuing the flow and are rather mediocre bridge scenes.<br/><br/>If you are a major Harry Potter fan, as many of us are, I do encourage you to read this book, as it does offer a good (but not spectacular) continuation of the story. I do not recommend this book for someone new to the Harry Potter saga, as it greatly draws from knowledge gained from previous entries. Make sure you read ALL of J.K. Rowling's novels before starting this one.
 Seldom does a single word capture how I feel about something, but I found one for this turd: Drivel.  What a terrible, money grab of a "book" this is.  So many others have written honest reviews on why this is such a turd, but I had to come back and lower the score as much as I could to warn others to stay away, if they at all can.  The characters, old and new; the plot; the pacing... all just utter drivel.
 Completely different characters from the original books, for all that they bear the same names, features, stories, and woven histories. The children I grew up with, the wizards and witches that I 'watched' grow from children into adults, have changed so drastically in personality and aim as to be completely unrecognizable. Other than that, it's a play, written as a play, read as a play, which was fine. There was, to me, little to no character development or growth, and stretched, cliche plotlines that held tenuously, if at all. Nowhere near as good as the original books.
 I would not recommend buying this book at full or reduced price and wait and buy it used as frankly it is not worth paying full price.  I am in my 60s and have within the past 2 years read the Harry Potter series-all books bought used. I enjoyed them tremendously.  They flowed from the novel to the next.  What a surprise this one was.  I knew it was a play, and there was a gap of several years, but it is more like a very short story.  Nothing covered about their life after they defeated Voldemort.  I would like to have read about their marriages, the birth of their children. The fans have been tremulously let down.  One of Hermione and Ron's child is mentioned once in the entire book.  All in all, the book is a big let down.
 There was so much anticipation for this book to be released. I loved the books she wrote and was excited for this one. When it got here and I finished reading it, I was left feeling as it there was so much missing.<br/><br/>As with so many authors, she is now taking substandard work and putting her name and the branding to it. As with so many other authors who pull this, this book is a mediocre shadow of her own work. It is easy to tell that it was written "based on her work" and not by her work. I feel a bit cheated by the quality, it didn't live up the hype.<br/><br/>It's got good bones, I can say that much for it, but bones are all it has. I'll pass the book to the next person and not keep this one on my shelves.
 Being a big fan of the Harry Potter series, I was disappointed with this.  I bought it, knowing it was written in a play format.  I've decided I like the story format much better.  It wasn't near as in-depth or "meaty" as the original series.  Not really what my heart was wanting, but that may be my fault.  I want Harry Potter to go on forever, and I know that's really not possible.
 As a "Potterhead," I of course would read anything that continues the Potter legacy. I did enjoy reading about the "adult" version of our hero. However, since it is in screenplay form, I did miss the details that were highlighted in the previous books. These wonderful details created strong characters and a mesmerizing universe that cannot be fully fleshed out in screenplay form. Also, the story spanned years and felt rushed. I would have loved to see Albus's character developed more, so I could actually comprehend his feelings and actions. Even with my minor qualms, I guess I should feel privileged that we even were given this continuation and an actual published version.  I definitely would suggest the reader to start the book with an open mind and the understanding that this book only scratches the surface of what could have been!
 I am a self professed Harry Potter nerd so of course I had to order this book to read.<br/>If you are unfamiliar with a play script you may have been disappointed in the flow. The brilliance of a script is that it allows the director to set the scene and stage when it is put on. I wasn't expecting the in depth detail and description of other Harry Potter books. However, the flow of the book (play) made it overtly obvious that JK Rowling did not write this. She had input but it lacked her special touch.<br/>The story was good. It wasn't the best but it was decent enough for me. I did miss the descriptive writing and wish JK would redo this as a full novel and delve deeper into some of the characters and their relationships. This was a little predictable in the outcome. It was still enjoyable. It just lacked much of the Harry Potter magic we have come to know and love.
 I was really excited that JK had come out with a new HP book. I'm a huge HP fan and thought that this would be the perfect end the series. However, upon receiving the book I was severely disappointed. I know it said screen play but I thought it was an actual book and contained a screen play as an added bonus. If I'm going to read a screen play I want to be an active participant in a play! As much as I loved HP this was a huge disappointment for me. The characters weren't developed enough and there wasn't enough background knowledge to know who the characters were. This book had so much hype behind it and it was really all for nothing. A series from my childhood is now complete and it was an absolute waste of my time. If you're an adult reader like me that grew up with the HP series, please save yourself the time and the money. Look into checking the book out at your local library or borrow it from a friend. Totally not worth it.
 I'm a big fan and this falls very short of Rowlings other books. Very disappointed. It was missing crucial segues, has multiple improbable scenes, several illogical character developments, way too dark for these current times, plot is clumsy and choppy &amp; moves choppily radically not so much forward. It was annoying and confusing to read... yes its a theater script and I know how to read those... this was terrible. I can see where Special Effects on stage in London could make this more appealing...this story NEEDS it! But as a book its flat, dull, illogical, whiny, bitter, depressing, old-hat, and where the plot does advance... its very rote and predictable. Reads as if someone else whose extremely amateur wrote it, not Rowling. Poor choices all through it... I literally stopped reading it halfway through... it just kept getting worse and worse and worse.  I am very sad for Rowling on this project... she can do so much better.
 As a play script this is quite well done.  I enjoyed the story and thought it was well thought out and developed and it had enough twists to keep it interesting.  It is however a script and not a novel.  For those not used to reading scripts I imagaine they would find this a challenging read.  Much is left for actor's, director's interpretation in terms of emotion of the actor.  It also uses stage notation which if one is not used to reading would make the story more difficult to follow.  In all it is a play I hope to see a production of at some point, or a movie.  As a high school drama coach my thoughs were often about how difficult this play would be to stage and how difficult the effects would be to produce on stage.  I understand the British production has done a very good job of bringing the story to life.  The scrip could also easily be addapted to be a movie, and in some ways would be better suited that a movie production.
 This was  such a huge huge disappointment.  I knew it was a play script and not a novel, but it came off as rushed, predictable, lazy and like a really bad fan fiction from the 90's.  It basically takes a deviant son and gives him a time turner, to relive some of the novels, and make a lazy plot of changing things that's already happened because of guilt.  None of the characters acted like themselves, and were no longer likeable or believable.  The only likeable character was Scorpius, and Rose was basically pointless.<br/><br/>The villain was half baked , and I have read fan fiction about a love child from Voldy and Bellatrix many times in the past, then they make her so lame that she gets defeated in her first very short battle and goes to prison.  Crappy ending to a crappy book.  They should have left well enough alone then to taint my memory with this nonsense.
 It is a play book. Probably nice to look at on stage and some readers with an huge imagination, can see it happen. Honestly, an eight book of this series would have been an nice extra but this book here is just a text book for the play. It shall be the actors who have to blow life in the characters.<br/>Why didn't they (editors) make a graphic novel. The text they have here. It is fast food. The characters of Albus and Scorpius are something I would have liked to read a book about but alas even on stage it will be Harry Potter and his friends who are in focus. Ron and Hermoine are much in love. Harry has a wife called Ginny. They all have a few brats. They have an important job except Ron and Ginny (Joke shop owner, Wife). Did I mention they are very much in love? I really don't care. The Boys are of more interest for me. Their development and maturity would have been stuff for a good novel of its own. A novel I would have liked to read.<br/>This textbook is junk and merchandise. Aunt Rowling will have more money to buy an yacht she doesn't need and sell it after a short time for much less as she has paid for it. Awesome.<br/>The Harry Potter series was my favorite for a long time. I was sad for it to end but that is life all things come to an end eventually and that is good. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child isn't necessary. Period. TWO stars.
 You know, this was fun. In its way. In a way of two very excitable Potter enthusiasts writing a fanfic and getting J.K. Rowling's approval to produce it on stage. All good fun. Just not Harry Potter as we know it. MILD SPOILER. When Hermione took on Snape's personality, though, they just about lost me. In no way, never, ever, ever, would Hermione turn into that of a bitter waspish witch (meant in derogatory terms here, pardon), even out of unrequited love. Never. Not our champion of justice and equality for all. This was the most glaring flaw I could find. Oh, and I STILL can't figure out who the Cursed Child is. Delphi, I suppose. But it just doesn't feel like the answer. It will much better play than it did a book, hopefully.<br/>SERIOUS SPOILER. Voldemort and Bellatrix, though. Eww. I once wrote a Mugglenet editorial on that very point (sadly, lost now), but still. The very idea.
 I don't know Jack Thorne's work, so I can't say if this is how he presents his plays. I don't know how much of a hand or say Rowling had in this production and the screen writing.<br/><br/>I understand the frustration with this novel and the plausibility of many things and how it all connects together with the 8 novels.<br/><br/>First, don't read this as a regular piece of literature. This is a screen play. These are scripts, lines for the players, so I read it as so. Scripts can't be read the same as literature. Example: look at how many times Hamlet had been remade and portrayed differently each time. One line can be repeated several ways and the effect will be different each time.<br/><br/>Second, time has passed. Harry and everyone are no longer teens. They are adults, parents who have kids, and they are working. So yes, I expected them to change in some way. Did I expect Harry to be a good parent? No, he never had stability in his life. And I think they tried to show that in his parenting skills or lack of.<br/><br/>Third, This is the Magical world. And right when we think we know the world, another thing pops up and suddenly we question it and try to see how it fits into the magical world. Yes, poly juice potion takes a while to make, but this is a screen play! Think of it like a movie? The protagonist will some how have the key/answer/solution and they somehow have what they need to make everything right again. So yea, this screenplay does fit into the cliches of movies.<br/><br/>And seriously? Humiliation to an extent could change Diggory. But becoming a Death Eater? Sure, we just don't know how bad the humiliation was to him and the effects of it to know how he became one. There are several gaps in this play because of the ever changing universes, and it seems we have to fill in those gaps and attempt to understand how a character changed. Isn't that part of screen plays?<br/><br/>But really though, Delphi's parents? I'm still trying to manage that. Although, her name did give away her role as an oracle/prophecy from the beginning... And we know that's bad news.
 As my good friend Amy says, if you read this as fan fiction it is not that bad. But JK Rowling gave her seal of approval and I was expecting more. It would have been OK if it had gone to the distant past, or the future, or revisited a tangential character (the Trolley Witch story was the only part I thought was worth reading about). But messing with the main storyline? Ignoring plot points that are now set in stone for Potterheads is lazy writing. I don't care if there are a million versions of reality: there are things that make you who you are no matter the circumstances, and taking a hero and turning him into a villain for the most pedestrian reason is beyond infuriating. I wish I knew an obliviator who could help me forget I ever read this.
 It was great returning to Hogwarts! I loved revisiting characters from so long ago. Unfortunately, there were some plot points that were a bit juvenile in creativity and completely contradictory to the HP series canon. The screenplay read easily enough like a book and I was alway reminded that it was such when there was a reference to someone leaving the stage. Overall, I enjoyed the screenplay and believe that reading it was better than seeing it live. I highly recommend for any serious HP fans, but those who only watch the movies can pass on this.
 THIS IS NOT A NOVEL, nor is it written by J.K. Rowling. With that said, it's not bad either. As a play, it would be awesome. If you're looking for a new Harry Potter novel, this is garbage. Keep in mind that this was always intended to be a play &amp; it's fine. The Cursed Child tells an interesting and fairly subtle story about tolerance and acceptance and dealing with expectations...complex philosophical machinations that show sure signs of Rowling's involvement, but this is a script &amp; therefore almost exclusively dialogue without all the internal trepidation &amp; rumination that colors a novel. This is peppered with cameos from many of the beloved Harry Potter characters which is great for the nostalgia factor, but not so peppered with the side-plots and quirky creatures/plants/spells/red herrings that Rowling was able to populate the novels with. If you can take it for what it is, this is a good addition to the larger world.
 I was so excited for the next installment of Harry Potter, but the plot/story in this is not up to standard.  I guess in retrospect it's not surprising as it's not written by JKR herself.  I'm surprised she endorsed it.  I was very much looking forward to learning about the next Potter generation, but this reads more like fan fic.  And sadly, now that this is released, it's part of the Potter cannon and can't be changed.  Sigh.  Maybe it might be better if watched on stage than just reading the script??? I kind of doubt it as my problems with this are with the actually story/plot and not the writing style, but I can still hang onto hope.
 NOTE: This is a play and it is written in that format. While it does not have the depth of JKR's normal books, it does have the same feel. I felt it would be better for you to have you and your HP friends each act out a part because it does not have the same growth or exploration of characters as the books. While it is a good topic to explore on, the play format, like the movies, does not have the time for you to really get to know the new characters as reading the books would allowed you to. It is interesting to see Harry and the gang grown up and how the next generation is, but it feels that the situation is plot driven to allow certain events to happen as oppose to real character motives. I hope JRK allows the HP universe to expand to allow other writers the freedom carry on the story or to delve into other aspects of the universe (hopefully the movie "Strange Beasts.." will allow that).
 Ok, I read the Harry Potter series a while back, basically as they came out, it could be just the way this is written (play vs novels) and the way I usually consume the material; so please take with a grain of salt.  While I liked the story somewhat, the character development was not as great as I'd come to expect, and yes, a Play won't allow for this, but I still thought they were somewhat single dimensional.  You'd love this as a Potter fan, and it definitely talks about characters we loved in the past in a somewhat new light, but if you're going there hoping to revisit the old school and the loving moments, it may not fit everyone.
 If you read and accept the book for what it is (a play script, not a novel), you should enjoy it. As i read it i could envision the play before my eyes and it will be an amazing play in London. *SPOILER* that being said, It's not nearly as good as the novels, and i did think the time turner plot was a bit cheesy and interferes with info from the 7 novels, and that was admittedly dissapointing. But I knew that being a play script it would need to be condensed and fast. I feel that the reviews giving 1 or 2 stars are disappointed because it is not like the 7 novels, which it isn't.  This script does not come close to the depth of story and characters in the novels. It is a play! To sum up, if you approach the book as it is, a script not an 8th novel, and accept it wont be as good, you should not be disappointed. A great addition to my harry collection.
 It's kind of a going back in time rehearsal of the original story line that adds a few back stories. It was difficult for me to get used to the play script format with the names on the sides before the lines, and I kept forgetting who was who with the original names being assigned to different characters. So after I had read it I still did not have a clear cast of characters envisioned in my mind.<br/><br/>I would like to read a story line where Harry launches into a search for the basis of the magic power that he and others possess and explore the foundations and source of the that power with the accompanying dangers of dealing with raw power and exposing the truth behind its existence. Where is the darkness and why was Voldemort "evil"? Why does love conquer all?
 Was difficult to read at first because of the formatting, it lacked descriptors that we are all accustomed to when it comes to Harry Potter.  Since it's the screenplay/play write there is not detail into what certain things would look like, for instance the neighborhoods, or the train, or the outfits.  You lose the guidance for your imagination.  I think the story line was predictable at times and other times you didn't see it coming.  It's obviously shorter than most HP books because of the formatting and lack of detail.  The first 25% was slow, very slow for me.  The next 25% was fast and interesting, the 3rd 25% was again slow and the last 25% was wonderful.  There are limited characters so that makes it a breeze to keep up with everyone involved.  If you're a HP fan, and followed all the previous books, you will enjoy this because you have a baseline for characters and their personalities to carry into your own imagination.  If you're not a fan and read the books, don't read this.
 I will start by saying that I have been a devoted fan of the Harry Potter book series since the first edition of Sorcerers Stone hit the shores in the US.  I have compared every piece of literature and fantasy to the journey the Harry Potter series took me through.<br/><br/>I am shocked when reading some of the reviews, If you did not know it was a script, you should just re-read the title.  However, I feel it was to much a tease to turn this into a book.  The story line barely brought me back to that same feeling i got reading through the pages of Goblet of Fire or Hablf Blood Prince.  You can tell this was written by more then just J.K. Rowling, the story just seemed too post modern tween.<br/><br/>Ill add it to the shelf, but i doubt ill read it again, and again and again like I did with the other books in the series.
 I'm a huge Potter fan. I've been reading the books ever since they came out at least once a year. A couple of things to be noted.. the screenplay kind of writing makes it very dull and somehow hard to follow. I don't think JK Rowling actually wrote a single line. why do I say that? only because I can't see her style, it lacks the magical touch and humor that made the characters so loveable and unique..<br/>Without the magical touch, they are just a bunch of teenagers with magical powers... yawn, that's the kind of boring stuff you can watch all day on U.S. TV...  boring boring boring...
 The real question I have after reading this is why was it released at all? As a live play I am sure it is wonderful, with the full sets and great acting, it seems like audiences love it. But as a script? Released with so much publicity? It really falls short.<br/><br/>Obviously I was not expecting a JK Rowling book with character development and a strong plot, but I was expecting it to be faithful to the original characters and cannon. Also the writing, I know it is a play but this is so basic. It reads, as others have stated, as a mediocre piece of fan fiction.<br/><br/>The best thing about this is probably the character of Scorpius Malfoy. The low point - realizing that Ron is nothing more than a bumbling fool who was drunk when he married Hermione and now runs the joke shop. It doesn't mesh up with the Ron we know. And this play doesn't mesh with the Harry Potter books we all love. It is a disappointing addition to the Harry Potter world.
 Weak plot.  Weaker dialogue. You could run through the plot holes,  and the characters are hollow. Maybe the staged play is better,  but this was disappointing. If you are a real fan,  don't bother.
 I don't really want to write a long review full of spoilers, and many others have already pointed out the plot holes and character inconsistencies in this book.<br/>I just wanted to add that time travel is exceedingly difficult to get right in a story, and it's really only enjoyable when it's done right. This one is badly done, with way too many inconsistencies and errors, making the book painful to read for that reason alone, even aside from all it's other flaws.
 I we so excited to read this book. I always like to follow Characters as they age and being able to see Harry and the gang all grown up seemed especially exciting. How disappointing. I feel like JK Rowling was only a part of this book in terms of character names, new spell encantations, and history from the original series.  I feel like the writers were hoping to recapture the magic- no pun intended- and fell short. I wanted Harry to be a better father than he was. I wanted his children to all be dull of life and vibrance. I wanted them to be normal happy children with a life that Harry didn't get to have. Instead they have a dad who seems like a past-his-prime professional athlete, not the Harry Potter we all love. I gave 3 stars because the story was well written although a Bit odd in some places, for instance the two best friends seem like they might one day be more than friends except one is in love with Rose. It jumps back and forth. I wanted the original characters to be grown up versions of themselves and not tired old people. They worked so hard as children only to grow up to be those tired, unexciting ministry workers from the first books.<br/><br/>All in all, this was an unnecessary ploy to get books sold.
 If i could i would give it a 0 star. As a Harry Potter fan I could have done without this poor attempt to undermind the character, of a beloved icon, that above all stood up for his friends, no matter the cost or how dire the circumstances. And you think you can box him as an awkward, un-resourceful, bad parent? Give me a brake -_-
 I understand this is a script and not a book and was prepared for that when I read it.  Knowing that, it was just a huge letdown.  The story was ludicrous, the beloved characters acted completely out of character.  I'm going to try and forget I ever read it.  I have it two stars for the very few nice moments but I am highly disappointed that Jo Rowling ever agreed to this mess.  It makes me sad.
 While then overall story is a bit of a let down, it's nice to revisit the harry potter world again, if even only a tertiary drop-in.  Still, the need to rely too heavily on scenes Rowling already vividly illustrated in her works feels far more like a literary or artistic crutch here than an homage.<br/><br/>For a last-ditch Harry Potter fix, it's fine, but this isn't really a continuation.  Canon, it may be, but don't put it on the same level as Rowling's direct works.
 This had the makings of a great story. Except it wasn't a story, not a book story, it was a script. Would it really have been so difficult to flesh it out like a proper book? At times, the script format seriously got in the way of my enjoyment of, or even coherently following, what was happening in the story.<br/><br/>I've purchased every book (hardcover or Kindle), almost every DVD, every HD-DVD, every BluRay and went to every movie but this time I feel a little screwed by JKR. Was this laziness? Knowledge that her fan base would buy the book no matter how flimsy the structure? I see a couple of other novellas listed but I'm afraid to buy them now that I understand her newfound lack on interest in high quality work.<br/><br/>Too bad, this could have been an outstanding book. Oh, well.
 I am an avid reader and a very big Harry Potter fan and was extremely disappointed in this book/play.  Maybe it's the difference between reading a book and a play, but there was no depth to the characters or the story.  The original cast members all turned in to whiny, incompetent shells of who they used to be.  I can't unread it, so it's likely I'll never look at the series in the same light again.
 This is a script, not a novel or even a novella, and should be treated as such.  For those who have never read a script before, that could present a bit of a challenge.  The story is in the dialogue and not all the other elements (from simple to detailed) that a story on a page may include.  A glimpse into the set and the staging help bring things to life if you have some theater or scipt reading experience, but may be distracting if you don't.  With that caviet, I did find the tale quite enjoyable.  The voices of the characters, both known and new, rang true to me and the story itself felt like it belonged in the world of Harry Potter.
 I'm going to say the same thing here I said on Goodreads.<br/><br/> ** spoiler alert ** While it was nice to continue the Harry Potter story... I think I need to see it on stage instead of read it.<br/><br/>It was capturing, it was a cool idea. Obviously JK Rowling didn't write it, she came up with the idea of the story but not the script. The voices of the stronger female characters were not as prevalent. McGonagall was still strong as the Headmistress and her usual stoic yet caring self... but it was missing something. Hermione... wtf happened. Sometimes she was her strong, know it all self. Other times it was like she just took a back seat. Hermione never takes a back seat. Ron was forgettable. It all just happened too fast. I feel ironic saying that since it's two plays that span about 2.5 hours each.<br/><br/>As I said, I just need to see it on stage. If Jo wrote it herself, turned it into a novel, I'd probably like it better.
 This play script plot is interesting and captivating. However Harry Potter novel fans crave character development since its the characters they love. The genre is somewhat limited. It relies heavily on its popularity to supplement that absent quality. In its place is a moral quality that reads more preachy than her normal writings, about the dangers of stereotyping. The adult angst is more about unmet childhood needs than quality storytelling. Its a good play, but her writings are great. And her stories are better than this. Her characters all have flaws but these overly discussed moral flaws dont touch our hearts the way her storytelling does and it sounds more like a therapy reenactment at times than a relationship.  No one wants a stereotyped Harry Potter, but perhaps thats the best that can be achieved in a play script. We cant hear his complex thinking or feel the sublties of ambivalence and shifting thoughts. Overall its good but far less mature than JK Rowlings' stories.
 I won't spoil anything of course.... But this book was like watching a Ben Stiller movie (think - Along Came Polly or Meet the Parents).  Everything goes wrong at every turn.  It's hard to read because it's written in script form, but it's really fun to get a dose of the characters you love in a short story.  I read this in a few nights and couldn't put it down!  It definitely feels like more of a short story kind of fun-read compared to the other Harry Potters, but if you're like me and you can't stop when you like a series - go for it.
 The story is a good idea but the characters aren't developed and it pulls away from the original potter books. Might show better on stage but it reads more like a fan fiction. Original characters aren't believable.
 I have read all of the Harry Potter books many times. It was very torn about whether or not I should read this new one after seeing all of the reviews. But I figured with all the time I have put into the original novels I needed to read this one. I finished it in one night. It was not a long or complicated read. I went into it knowing that a lot of people did not like it end that it was going to be different than the original novels.  I was surprised to find that the plot focused on an aspect of been covered in many different books, TV shows and movies. Time traveling .  I was able to easily predict several outcomes in the book. That is what I found disappointing. Despite this, I'm glad that I decided to read it. If you are a Harry Potter fan then you should read it. Do not let any bad reviews scare you away. Make your own judgment. I will probably even read it again at some point. But it will never compare with the original books .
 **This review is spoiler free.** I didn’t love the book, I didn’t hate it, but it also really irritated me, and I don’t know why it was written. I liked the play format; I thought I would’ve liked it a lot more had I seen it live prior to reading the play. I’d like to see the special effects used. I really liked the character of Scorpius Malfoy. He was a lovable, sweet nerd.<br/>And now the bad: there really isn’t anything original in this book/play. Everything, every plot point, felt recycled and unoriginal. Perhaps I’m being overly harsh here, but there was nothing truly jaw-dropping amazing and new and fresh here, like there was in every Harry Potter book previously published. The classic characters feel like caricatures of themselves. There also was no true tension in the book, everything was false tension, and it irritated the heck out of me. I was really disappointed with this, as it felt unnecessary and contrived.
 I am so sad to say that I hated it.  To be honest,  I think I would hate it even as a play.  The behavior, dialogue, and personality of the characters we know and love are just totally wrong.  Not a bit of it even felt close.  Honestly, I really think its quite worthless to read as the story line on it's own is just not good.
 Very disappointed. May have been ok as a play but not a good read. Wish I could get my money back. Love all the books but this is the worse one ever. Even as a play! Should have been free!
 I'm a huge Harry Potter/JK Rowling fan, but this was just terrible.  I wish I had never read it because it almost ruined Harry Potter for me entirely, but luckily I have since been able to compartmentalize in my head the difference between this craptastic bizarre work of fanfic and the REAL Harry Potter series.  So there's that.<br/><br/>I can't go in depth too much about what I hated without giving any spoilers, but I will say I don't think the tone was consistent with Rowling's style of writing at all (yes, I knew it was a play and I know plays read differently, blah, blah, blah. I just feel this way, OK?). I thought the story line was completely absurd (YES EVEN IN A FICTIONAL WORLD OF MAGIC) and the plot relied too much on old played out themes that have already been explored in numerous other works.  Also, just putting this out there, but Harry's son is an insufferable little brat and I hated him as a character so that didn't really help either.<br/><br/>So idk... I guess read it if you're a big HP fan, but just know it will disappoint you.
 This story was written more like a play, by a pair of playwrights with J.K. Rowling. Had it been written by just J.K., it would have been better. As it is, the thing is good, but not the great it could have been. Throughout, it leaves you asking: "why would Harry's kid want to do such a thing?", and it never supplies an answer. To show daddy up? To declare independence? To....what?<br/><br/>"To crate phony TV episode like drama" is all I can think of. So much of it revolves around going into the past...with no valid reason for doing so. Still, what there is is well written, and interesting. I don't regret having made the purchase, or spent the time to read it, but it did not cost a lot, either, and it was short. I recommend it to Harry Potter fans, with the warning that it is not quite what they may expect.
 As a lifelong potter head-  I was also disappointed.  I was fully aware it was a play script,  but I think it was a bit deceiving to put jks name on this.  This is tantamount to scrolling a great potter site and reading fan fiction.  This was a tribute from a fan,  and I feel certain a fantastic play- but it didn't feel like jo,  it didn't feel like the characters we've grown to know and love- a lot felt forced.
 I did not still expect the same quality of story as Rowling, but I was still surprised at how terrible the story was. I feel like the writers and publishers had to do some serious convincing and bargaining to get her to sign off on this. This may not be the case publicly, but surely she wasn't impressed with the writing. It was the most cliched and cheesy father-son story I've ever read (granted I never read cheesy father-son stories). This was like some cartoon reboot version of the original series with not-so-brief (thankfully) cameos from the original characters. I don't want to spoil the details, but you need the details to understand how corny this book was. So I'll leave you with this small voice in your head that's saying "told ya so" for when you inevitably buy this book anyway because you're a Harry Potter fiend and you'd read the manuscript for the next story off of used toilet paper if you had to.
 This play is built upon a common time travel trope and uses dull cliche dialogue. It is hard to imagine Rowling had a large part in the development.
 Growing up, I loved the Harry Potter books. Seriously from age 12-21 I couldn't get enough. I read every book over and over again on a loop. So I was hesitant to read "the cursed child". The problem with most sequels is that they can tarnish the original - and wouldn't that be awful. While I don't think the "Cursed child" ruins the original series...it does stain some of the very best parts of goblet of fire. Dead characters are brought back to life (briefly). I really wanted to like this book and did the best I could to see through the screenplay style but the plot falls short. Our favorite characters are reduced to one-dimensional versions of themselves. The only way I got through this book was the pretend it was just bad fan fiction. The one redeeming quality of the book is the ending. The whole first 90% had me shaking my head and genuinely disliking our protagonist (Albus Potter is kind of a jerk!) I easily could have done without reading the book and imagine the whole story will eventually fade in my memory while the original story will be as loved as the first time I finished the first book and every book after.
 I read the others and thought it would be great as the others were. I didn't realize it was a screen play but got over that part. Although I think it's rich that they charge a book price for it. The characters dialogue was boring, flat, and cringe worthy most of the time. I couldn't connect with a single character even though I grew up with all of them through the other books. In fact, I disliked each one. Overall seemed lazily written and a complete wast of money
 I am a long time fan of the Harry Potter series and was skeptical about this book from the get go. I didn't even order a copy until weeks after it came out. I loved the idea of continuing the series and following the next generation, but this was written like a poor fan fiction.<br/><br/>The way this book trampled over the original series was in a way horrifying. Taking something I truly love and manipulating it to create a dumb story about even dumber kids. It becomes very hard to believe that Harry would have a child so dumb.<br/><br/>Many people told me to read this as if it was a fan fiction to help improve my opinion of it, but it didn't work. I find it hard to believe a true fan would create a story that would so manipulate the original material.<br/><br/>I can't recommend this book in the slightest. It makes me sad that this is canon.
 It's hard for me to review this book because I really wanted to love it.  The only way I can explain how I felt about it is that it seemed to be a fake Harry Potter story.  I couldn't connect with the characters, nothing they did or said fit into my recollection of these beloved characters.  I guess what I took away from reading the book was extreme sadness, that something I had loved had been sullied.  I wish JK Rowling had not lent her name to this script, it just seems a way to get money out of her built in fan base.  I don't like feeling that I have been taken advantage of.  If you are a die hard fan I recommend you don't buy this one.
 Unfortunately I had very high hopes for this play.  However, it seems that J.K. Rowling simply did not have enough money and trusted the wrong people to revamp the franchise.  The play lacks any of the intrigue and mystery that grew the franchise.  While it is hard to put all of the intrigue and detail into a script rather than a book, to release this story in this way is indeed careless.  Instead of breaking new ground and giving the characters new battles and people to fight, we are left with tired characters that have little life.  Why in the world would a man who "never knew love" have a child? The entire premise of book was the Voldermort was a cold, unloving person who cared so little about love that he split his soul into seven (unknowingly 8) pieces.  We are truly left to believe that upon resurrection while he was in the few years that was not trying to stop Harry Potter he stopped to have a child.  Why not move on from Voldermort and find a new villain?  The real world is full of new threats just as the make believe world should be as well.  Imagine the depth and development a new character could bring, but instead we are left fighting old and now tired story-lines.<br/><br/>The story starts out with a wonderful premise of a Potter being sorted into Slytherin, but then ends up being a time traveling mess after that.  If you want a great time changing story, I would suggest Back to the Future.  Also one would think that a character who grew up without a family would be more sympathetic to the plight of a sad child.  All in all, I would say skip this version which apparently was written to people more interested in making money than expanding the franchise.  I wish I could recommend this book, but do know that once you read this book you cannot remove the stain it has brought to the franchise.
 I seriously wish I did not order and then read this book. I agree with other reviewers, it simply does not contain any of J. K. Rowling's magic, creativity or flair. I realize it is written in a play format, but it needs more adjectives, oomph and feeling. The sentences are abrupt and short; almost like reading  hurried text messages. I want my final memories of Harry Potter to end with the Deathly Hallows where the ending was stated as "All was well." I certainly don't want it to be on a dimly lit stage, centered around a weak plot story line, where the final words shared are "So do I. The End." Keep the magic alive in your heart and don't read this book. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because I was ashamed and saddened anything by Rowling involving Harry could be rated that low by a huge lover of the series.
 It's a tough read. I'm only halfway through, mind you, but this is nowhere near a typical Potter tale. The characters do not feel right at all, and the notations and descriptions are so extremely vague and poorly imagined that it probably makes for a somehow worse stage play. Describing something along the lines of "a group of witches and wizards gathered and they rattle and chatter like only true witches and wizards can" is like trying to be cute on a 3rd grade essay about a book you never read. Just. Lazy. The idea of the story seems like it could work, but I don't get the reasoning behind why the plot was even necessary. On the plus side, the 2 page "chapters/scenes" make for an easy rifle through changing the book from a 300 page romp into, realistically, more like a 100 page short story. Not bad for a neat little "cool, more Harry Potter!" but not even half as good as the worst Potter installment.
 I have to admit, I'm a Harry Potter nerd, but I'm not so obsessed that I turned my nose up at the idea of a play-turned-eighth-book kind of nerd. I was really excited to read this one!<br/><br/>Well, I was a little disappointed. It read like more of a fan-fiction novel than the original Harry Potter books, and I found it to be a little over the top in regards to its occasional cheesiness. Sometimes the dialogue of the characters didn't seem to fit the personality of the characters from the previous novels. In my opinion, the whole thing seemed a little bit rushed and forced.<br/><br/>However, because I'm still a huge Harry Potter fan, I still had to give it 4 stars due to my pure excitement about there even BEING an eighth book. I will admit there were some twists and turns in this book that made it pretty interesting.
 This book is disappointing. I'm a huge Harry Potter fan and was looking forward to this, but it's underwhelming. The dialogue is cheesy and the plot is predictable. It reads like fan fiction written by a teenager. We've waited 9 years for another HP story. I'm happy for any chance to get back into that world. But this could have been done so much better. It's kind of like really wanting chocolate cake for your birthday, and getting vanilla instead. It's better than nothing. You'd try to be happy. Yet you'd be thinking "really? That's the best you can do? I wanted something better."
 I think the right comparison point here is to good Harry Potter fan fiction. Rowling has a better executed plot and is much better at fleshing out new characters, but she is oddly weaker at giving the canon characters interesting adult stories. Rowling's conception of the Hogwarts universe is seen through kids' eyes and flipping it around so the previous heroes are now the boring adults (and yet still get half the scenes) isn't easy.<br/><br/>The Fantastic Beasts movie, which is basically a superhero movie set in the Harry Potter universe, is a much better vector for future exportation, I think. It allows Rowling to explore semi-adult story lines without the burden of the original characters.
 Reading through the reviews, I can see that there are a lot of people that didn't like this book. I can see that. The play format can throw people and it definitely doesn't bring to mind the same Harry Potter magic as any of the previous books. I've heard the play is fantastic, but that spirit definitely is not captured in the book.<br/><br/>However, if this book wasn't part of the Harry Potter universe and I didn't have such high expectations, I think I would have enjoyed it more. I actually did enjoy a lot of it and even loved some of it (trolley witch, HELLO!). If you like Harry Potter and haven't read it already because of the reviews, I do feel like you are missing out. It is worth the read through and it is a pretty quick read.
 I am a big fan of all of HP novels and have been reading the books since I was 11 years old. Unfortunately, this felt like I was revisiting a badly written version of earlier books. I was expecting a play that gave me more of an insight on Harry's life, his work at the Ministry, his new role as a husband and father, other magical worlds, etc. The first thing that annoyed me in the scene descriptions was the phrase "this is magic. this is chaos", which seemed like a condescending gesture toward the reader and which in hindsight actually seem to excuse the unimaginative plot.The time-turner is grossly overused and seems like a cheap plot device. I might have as well watched Back to the Future again . The simultaneous use of two time-turners was even more ludicrous. (So on one time turner they had only 5 minutes to change the past and on another they had more minutes--wouldn't this have had some kind of effect?---otherwise why point out the difference between time-turners... It really seemed like the characters spent hours awkwardly waiting for Voldemort at Godrick's Hollow) The story lacked verisimilitude. Many characters (Rose, Delphi, Ron, Hermione), were left undeveloped. Delphi's intervention at the end seemed forced. She did not play that much of a leading role at the beginning when they were trying to bring Cedric back then she suddenly appears at the end, only after receiving an Owl from Albus. If she really was planning to bring back Voldemort she would have intervened earlier. Finally, the idea that Voldemort and Bella had sex in some room of Malfoy's Manor was laughable and implausible, given Rowling's characterization of Voldemort.
 Not only did it not follow the character development of the original series and introduce a few logical inconsistencies, but it had inconsistencies within it's own story line.  Almost made me think that I was reading Stephenie Meyer, it was that poorly written.  I'm surprised that JK Rowling gave her name to this.  It's not that it is awful in and of itself (I was likely looking for problems, as the original series was quite well thought out), but when an author/playwright undertakes a continuation of a series, s/he has an even tougher ob ahead of her/him than just writing--they have to stick to what has already been written.  Not well executed at all for what it was.
 I'm 12 years old and I'n writing this review with my mom's account. I got this book from Amazon a few days after it came out and read the whole thing in one day. I would have rated this book five stars, but I only rated it four for a few reasons-<br/>* The book is written in script format, since it was based off a play, which is kind of annoying, but once you get used to it it's just as good as reading a normal book.<br/>* Some bits of the story, like the Trolley Witch, seem a bit ridiculous (but isn't the whole Harry Potter series that way?)<br/>* Rose Granger-Weasley and James Sirius Potter are barely in it, and Teddy Lupin isn't in it AT ALL.<br/><br/>But overall it's great &lt;3 It's really cool to read about Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Draco (unfortunately, Neville and Luna aren't in it) in the future and it was also really cool to learn more about their kids (especially Scorpius)<br/><br/>I would totally recommend buying this book if you're a Harry Potter fan!
 Not what I was expecting. I'm disappointed with J.K. Rowling on this book.
 If you like Harry Potter this book is a must! It has several twists you won't expect. It was not disappointing at all. I enjoyed reading this book/play.You will discover things which were not mentioned in the earlier Harry Potter books but which are important. The story is the best way I could have dreamed for the story to carry on!
 Very disappointed by this work. If J.K. Rowling wrote a single word of it, I would be very surprised. More likely, it was written by her co-authors and she just okayed it. Can't say I blame her, money is money, but it does make me lose some respect for her.<br/>The piece reads like a glorified Fan Fiction. The characters, both old and new, are one-dimensional compared to how they're represented in the original seven Harry Potter books. There are a number of sins I could mention, but the clincher was definitely Snape smiling in an alternate reality. And he wasn't even smiling because of someone else's pain! As a hardcore Harry Potter fan, I nearly died of heartbreak at this point in the story.<br/>That said, the ending wasn't too bad, compared to the rest of the piece. Overall a very disappointing read. Not impressed, J.K. Please try again. And this time, please don't sell out.
 Never mind that it's a play. Do mind that there are huge plot holes, inconsistencies with the other books, inaccurate and inconsistent characterization, lack of charm, wittiness, or imagination, terrible dialogue/lines, bad plotting and pacing, confusion over who the protagonist was supposed to be, and no true climax. I wanted to destroy it, but none of the ordinary methods worked. I guess I'll just have to wear it around my neck until I can find some basilisk venom. Hopefully it won't give me too many nightmares in the meantime.
 I was super excited to have a new Harry Potter story to read, regardless of its written format. The story is easy to follow even in script format. As for the story itself, I gave it 3 stars and not more because some of the "drama" (no pun intended), felt a little forced and it lacks some of the natural story flow that was so seamless in the original series of books. It still brought back some of the old favorite characters and was a good read. I don't think it's as excellent a story as the original books in terms of story line and character development but it's worth a read for the Potter fan.
 It's an easy read, which is what you would expect from a book that's target audience is children. It's a must-read simply because it is the last official book in the series. I don't even mind the script format. You get the background from the stage cues.<br/><br/>I was extremely disappointed in the characters' roles. I could understand to an extent Harry Potter having trouble communicating with his teenage son Albus Dumbledore. I cannot understand how Harry Potter is grappling to find common ground with his son after 15 years. Harry was an outcast at Hogwarts at times, so I find it hard to believe Harry could not relate to how Albus is feeling. I think Harry in this book is almost unlikeable. He always got in shenanigans when he was at Hogwarts and valued his friendship with Ron and Hermione, so how could he possibly think an appropriate punishment is to separate Albus from his one friend!?! Also, Ginny has a very depressingly passive role as his wife. Ron is still an enjoyable character, and he lightens the book with his antics.<br/><br/>The time traveling aspect seems like a crutch. In a way, the writers do not have to come up with a new storyline. The book ends with nothing new really happening. It's repetitious and an easy way to use that world without changing it. It's also reminiscent of Prisoner of Azkaban where they use a time traveler to travel back in time and have to make sure not to run into themselves. However, time traveling is a main plotline in this book.<br/><br/>I really love the character Scorpius Malfoy. His humor and relationship with Albus makes the book worth reading. Albus being a Slytherin was really exciting, but the writers never really used it to their advantage. You never see the Slytherin house from a different angle or gain a new appreciation for that house. Also, I wish there was more of a conclusion to whether Albus and Scorpius end up enjoying Hogwarts more or if anything changed for them there.<br/><br/>All in all, read it but don't expect it to be on the same level as the other 7 books.
 Shame on J.K. Rowling. She should not have put her name on this book.<br/>This is absolutely not her harry potter series.  If you are a fan of Harry potter, do not expect anything from this book.<br/>Very cheap written book.There are even typos.<br/>It ignores characteristics of characters as well as Hogwarts houses. While I was reading this book, I can not stop thinking of "back to the future" move. It is basically copy of "Back to the future" on the story of Harry potter book 4.<br/>What a waste of money and time on reading this junk.
 Truly a disappointment after JK Rowling's brilliant work. I really, really hated it, and I was honestly looking so forward to it. The fact that it's written as a play is not the problem. It's completely unbelievable, has shallow characters, a weak, ridiculous plot, and falls short of every mark. Nothing about it stands up to the original story line... even quoted lines carried over from the original books are incorrect, either misquoted or said by the wrong characters, etc. The characters are nothing like Rowling's quirky creations, and to totally change her work is disrespectful and shameful. I am disgusted. I will get my money back if possible.
 It’s a great story. It didn’t quite live up to the original HP series but was a fun addition. As silly as it sounds some of the story was a bit unbelievable or didn’t quite connect the way I had hoped. The idea of time turning was great in its introduction in book three where they could only go back a few hours, but the idea of going back years and changing the complete history by casting a few spells just seems much too powerful to be messed with by any wizard. But otherwise I was very entertained and the author did a great job of bringing back that wonderful Harry Potter nostalgia and closure on the post Voldemort world.
 I feel like I wasted my money.  This really feels like a fan fiction - and one that I didn't enjoy that much.  It's OK, but I personally feel that if JK Rowling wrote it, it would have been better.  If you can borrow it from the library, that's the best way.  You can always buy it later if you enjoy it.
 If you are a Harry Potter fan and loved the books, this will be a disappointment.  Very formulaic with none of the wonder or thought of the books. Did not read like Rawlings wrote it.
 This was absolutely awful on so many levels. Please see all the other 1 star reviews on this travesty. I am too upset to reiterate the reasons.
 I'm a huge Harry Potter fan. When I first heard about a "new" Harry Potter book, of course I went crazy about it. But when I discovered it was some kind of script, I was not so crazy about it anymore. Afterwards, a lot of friends who read it recommended the reading. Even so I was incertain about the book. Anyways, I finally bought it and read it in no time. And, even though the book have a very interesting story, it's not Harry Potter style at all. It was not written by J.K Rowling and yes, it is a play's script, which means it's a very straightforward narrative. The lack of details and descriptions made me not fall in love with this book. It coud be an amazing story if written by J.K. Rowling, but as it is, it's not. So, if you don't want to dive into the magical world of Harry Potter through a rich detailed novel, only want to know the "whos", "whens" and "hows", I think you could like it better than me.
 Disappointed. Story focuses on the characters' flaws, not strengths. (In the other books, the characters are real and flawed, yes, but their strengths are the focus, making us love them so much as they overcome their problems.) I didn't think I'd mind the script format, but it's super sparse with very little to guide you. Found it hard to picture the setting or hear the character's tone of voice. Part of the pleasure in reading are the way words come together to paint a picture, and this lacks that completely. Just step-by-step dialogue. But mostly, I was disappointed in the story itself, which spends a lot of time showing the characters' flaws and not enough time making us love them. Even the old characters I already know and love so much came across as surprisingly unlikable.
 Let me preface this by saying I am the HP generation- I read each book as they where released in my preteen years.<br/>I was excited about Cursed Child and had high expectations that were not met. Overall the story is good- I thought it was going in one direction and they threw a curveball in which was refreshing. It was also fast paced and a quick read. However, I felt as though some of the character choices didn't make sense and the book was still reliant on Harry.<br/>Logistically, I am fascinated to know how they pull this off on stage as the scene is constantly changing. Some people may not appreciate the script (vs a novel) but I have a theatre background and liked reading it with each characters voice.<br/><br/>A good script, but don't get too worked up about it.
 I really wanted to like this book, but just couldn't. As a long time HP fan, l find it hard to believe thst Rowling had anything more to do with this than lending her name and cashing the checks. None of your favorite characters are what you remember, or want them, to be. The dialog is clumsy, the plot full of holes, the entire premise ridiculous. Disappointing beyond belief. This is nothing more then poorly written fan fiction, penned seemingly by someone with little knowledge of the original story and characters we all love, designed to get money from long time fans. Don't fall for it!
 I was sadly disappointed by this book. Like everyone else I grew up reading this series and was excited. it is a quick read the the script format didn't distract in any way. Unfortunately, the storyline seems oversimplified and forced. The complexity of characters and story that we have come to love is missing.<br/><br/>Is it the worst thing I've ever read? Not by a long shot, but if you can resist, I would avoid adding it to your current "untainted" view of the potter world and JK Rowling's work. It doesn't do either justice.
 It's a good read. Not the greatest of Harry Potter story's, but an enjoyable read none the less. I feel time travel is a hard thing to get right, and they did get most of it right. I did notice a couple small things that seemed to be mistakes In the story though. Nothing to major, and I won't go into detail for fear of spoiling the ending. Since the mistakes if they are mistakes, and not misstakes in my memory happen in the end of the story. I would recommend Harry Potter fans read this, and I would love to see the show one day.
 The very talented JK Rowling, has a very distinctive rhythm and flow to both her action and dialogue, conspicuously absent throughout this.  The poor plot implication in Act 1,  divulged the entirety of the well-worn time travel genres.  I entered Act 2 only out of curiosity, not of the story, but rather the absence of continuity with characters and actions.  The conclusion, which was obvious from the beginning, has become a dismal yet merciful coup d' gras.  I would hope Ms Rowling would be more discreet in selecting  writers in the future.  In closing, I've seen much better work posted by readers,on Pottermore.
 I started reading the Harry Potter books when I was eleven years old, and the last movie premiered when I was nineteen.  I was part of the Harry Potter generation to the fullest, reading and writing theories, attending midnight releases, solving the puzzles on Jo's website, reading the new books in one sitting.  I have enjoyed the supplementary material, hoped to visit the theme park, looked forward to the Fantastic Beasts films.  This play is the one and only aspect of the Harry Potter franchise that has been a major disappointment to me.<br/><br/>First, I want to address the format.  Many complaints are being directed at the script format being difficult to read.  This does not bother me.  This story was intended as a play and I am grateful that the script was made available to the public.  It is meant to be brought to life on the stage rather than in the reader's mind, and there are inherent limitations that come with that.<br/><br/>However, when it came to the story, I was not impressed.  Generally, I felt that it read like fanfiction, and not even the best fanfiction. While I enjoyed the little nostalgic nods placed throughout the story, I found that the characters I love were lost, the plot was lacking and even problematic, and Rowling's well thought-out version of time travel was ruined. I could say a lot more but I want to avoid specifics/spoilers, so suffice it to say that I will *not* be considering this play a part of the Harry Potter canon.
 I have read the series twice, watched all the movies, and played the video game. I have an account on pottermore- I am a proud ravenclaw- but this book... I was so excited to read it, but u couldn't finish it. My love for the rest of the series is the only thing that convinced me to give it another shot. The ending- by which I mean the last 30 pages- were good, and was the only thing, except for maybe my regret for giving a Harry Potter book one star, that allowed this book to be a good one. I can tell, this one is not going to be a hit. J.K. Rowling, do us all a favor and don't pair up again.
 While at first it was nice to be back in the series with the familiar characters, the storyline was just terrible. It broke many time turner rules from the original and had cheesy dialogue. (See "No no no. Not that, anything but that." Actual line Harry says.) I don't regret reading it, but it deserves a very low overall rating.
 While I enjoyed the book I have to agree with others that things seem not well thought through.  The plot seems a little thin and to be honest, with a little though any reader should be able to pick out the glaring errors.  I'll not list them here to save others the pleasure of reading through the 'book' themselves.  I realize it was written to be performed as a play and it may do well in that regard, but it seems to me to be a bit of a money grab.  Now here's the problem, I still recommend that any Harry Potter fan purchase the item if nothing else than to complete their collection.  Read it, and by all means enjoy it.  Just don't be too disappointed in the book. Enjoy it for what it is...not for what it isn't.
 Okay. Harry Potter is the legendary series I will NEVER EVER regret reading; however this "Cursed Child" I have some doubts on. Ron gets drunk at his own wedding?! Cedric turns evil because he didn't win a competition?! Hermione, sweet, sweet Hermione...Has a bully for a daughter?! As if she wouldn't instill her own values in Rose! I hate this. And where's Teddy? Hugo? The only reason I gave it two stars is because a) It's still distinctly related to HP, b) Scorbus &lt;3<br/>Did Jack Thorne even read the books?! Please, I've read better fanfictions than this. Honestly.
 Eh...not really what I expected. Because of the way that it is printed, as a play, it gets very distracting with the storyline for me. I suppose others would not find this to be a problem. I paid for it, but really have no desire to finish it at this point. I do have to say, that what I did read thus far, I wasn't too impressed with the normally brilliant storytelling from Ms. Rowling. As with some of her other books, she admittedly stated she felt "forced". This one clearly shows she was. I absolutely LOVE Harry Potter, so this was a big disappointment. Sorry....
 WHERE IS THE MAGIC?!??!😭 This story is so disappointing it's lost the magic! The story is depressing, predictable and one dimensional! The characters are flat! The screen play format only makes the situation worse! How are you supposed to get lost in this book?! I feel cheated!
 Regardless of anyone's opinion, Potter fans will want to read this latest chapter in the series. It is a quick, but difficult read. The play format makes the flow of the story impossible. The story itself is short. It would've been far greater if the format was not written in a play. I also do not see much of Rowling's hand in this story. I would love to see how the play turned out. I wish, for the money spent, I would've got a bit more. But love it, like it, or hate it, fans will want/have to read it.
 It hurts to only give this a 2 star...but I have to be honest.  I am the HUGEST Harry Potter fan, but don't be fooled into thinking this is a "book" in any sort of format.  The only resemblance to a book is that it has a cover and I can buy it on Amazon.  It is a script to a play...that's it...the end.  There is no "story" development...no development of characters...no background story...nothing.  You're just thrown in to dialogue, left to imagine the rest for yourself.<br/>I'm sorry, but I would not recommend buying this.  I was angry the whole time I read it...feeling cheated of what J.K. Rowling is CLEARLY capable of presenting.<br/>Check it out from the library for free instead.
 If I could give it no stars I would! What a waste of time and money! I realize this was supposedly written in the same vein as Rowling. But this is nothing like JK Rowling!  The characters were all pathetic and completely out of sync with their personalities in the original books. I didn't find anything to make me like this. And being written as a script had nothing to do with my dislike.  The story (what there was of one) dragged on like a sore tooth and I had to force myself to finish it. I read voraciously so for me to be pushed to finish a story is saying alot! Can't and won't recommend...
 I wish I hadn't wasted my time and money on this story.  Even though the names Harry, Hermione, Ginny, Ron and Draco are used in this book they are not the beloved characters we know.  The plot was...well, I won't  go on, I will just say this: This is not a true Harry Potter sequel and  I think it's a shame that this project uses the Harry Potter name.
 Do not expect this to be another book in the Harry Potter series. As a screenplay,  it is mostly dialogue. It is not the richly written book that the rest of the series is. Much of the richness comes from actually seeing the play (which I have seen in London). It is based on the series but is not written by  J K Rowling.<br/><br/>After a brief time, I got used to the format and enjoyed the story. But without all the descriptive portions, I found it to  be easily forgettable. In fact, I had not remembered much of the plot so re-read it prior to seeing the play.
 This book was the worst possible way to end off arguably one of the best series of all time like seriously. First, nobody wants to read a book in the format of a play. Second this book is called "Harry Potter and the Cursed Child which implies that this is a book about harry potter and a cursed child NOT that there is an ungrateful son who wants attention by being ungrateful and being stupid enough to travel back in time not only once he makes the mistake multiple times.
 I grew up on HP. My dad read me the books and I fully intend on reading the books to my children. Not this one, though. It breaks my heart. It is so bad, I would give it negative stars if I could.<br/><br/>Let me start by saying that I hated the epilogue at the end of book 7. JK should have never written it; the names that she gave to Harry's children are cheesy and lame, pairing up the couples like she did left so little to the imagination. She should have just let it end.<br/><br/>That's where this comes in; the Cursed Child shows that JK doesn't seem to care about her fans, more like the amount of money her franchise is making. There was little to no character development throughout the play - even with the characters we know and love! The plot is terribly constructed with SO many holes in it. Poorly edited, as well. Spelling and grammatical errors abound. I understand that this play is probably very quite captivating on stage with special effects and superb acting, however this DOES NOT translate well into print. I can't stress that enough. Any action is not developed well enough; I had a hard time following large parts that weren't dialogue.<br/><br/>~~~~~SPOILERS BELOW~~~~~<br/><br/>The biggest problems I had:<br/>- Throughout the script, parts of dialogue are lifted from the books. This happens so often that it is redundant. Unoriginal.<br/>- Dumbledore and Harry's conversation seemed so surface, emotions so forced. Dumbledore crying, really? Harry talking about Daddy issues? No. Dumbledore's appearance was unnecessary and annoying.<br/>- Everything so conveniently falls into the hands of Albus and Scorpius. Need gillyweed? No problem! Polyjuice potion? Can be concocted in a minute, when in Chamber of Secrets it is clear that it takes a month to brew. Bathilda Bagshots house with the doors unlocked? Perfect. Draco Malfoy just *happening* to have an extra timeturner? PLEASE. Give me a break.<br/>- Voldemorts daughter. It doesn't work! Everyone would have known if Bellatrix was pregnant, that's not something she could have just hidden. Ridiculous.<br/><br/>There's so much more but I don't want to go on because, just like reading this book, it's a complete waste of my time. I hate JK Rowling for endorsing this pathetic piece of fanfiction. Oh yeah - she didn't write the book, which is misleading for readers seeing that her name is so huge on the cover. Don't buy.
 Dear Harry Potter and the Cursed Child: It's not you, it's me. Actually... never mind, it's you.<br/><br/>Look, obviously as a fan (and I mean a super die-hard fan who still reads the books at least once... okay twice... per year), you HAVE to read this. You can't possibly not buy it or pretend it doesn't exist. And you know what? For what it is - a play based on what I fully deem as fan-fiction - it's not half bad. I'm sure the production is decent, the story itself is okay in that context... but beyond that, it's just "meh." The timeline is too speedy. In rushing through Albus' first few years at Hogwarts, we lose ALL of the magic of the story, and all of the character development. Again, this is a play, so I get why they had to do it this way... but it's just so out of step with JK Rowling that it left me feeling no connection with the main characters. Also, I was disappointed with the adult versions of our beloved characters, who really seemed but a shadow of who they were. I just didn't find them believable at all, which was extremely frustrating. After getting to know those characters so well, it seems like the play writers really didn't know them at all. As if they had only scratched the surface of who these characters are.<br/><br/>The larger problem, of course, is that we all so desperately want a sequel. A real, honest, true sequel - because we can't let the world of Harry Potter go. Unfortunately, unless JK Rowling herself were to author another full-fledged, epic series of tomes to accomplish that, with all the magic and character development and just sheer amazingness of the first series (no pressure)... well, let's be honest, nothing less than that will ever be good enough. It can't be. And yes, that probably is coloring my opinion and rating here. But, the Harry Potter world is too rich, the story too full of magic and imagery, the characters too real... The Cursed Child is a play, and it can be read in 3-4 hours easily. It's simply not possible for this to come close to what it is we all truly desire. So where does that leave us?<br/><br/>Adjust your expectations for this. Then, adjust them again. I originally wrote here that this is/should be considered a companion book to the original series, and nothing more... but really, I think it may be even less than that. It really is just fan-fiction that someone condensed down into a play. At least, that's what I'm going to tell myself. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go pick up The Sorcerer's Stone and a pint of ice cream, dream about how JK Rowling has TOTALLY been writing a real sequel all this time (details for which will of course be released any day now), and forget this ever happened by embarking on another round of reading the entire original series for the millionth time.
 I was surprised that JKR put her name up there, with two other authors. You can go ahead and read it, it's entertaining, but nothing, nothing like the original Harry Potter books. The characters are shallow, flat and oversimplified, dialogues are full of banalities. Yes, there are a couple of sudden turns of events. Overall it might be considered as a "fan fiction".
 This was quite possibly the worst thing I've ever read... As a fan of the HP books, I was looking forward to this, but this is nothing like what you could even imagine. I understand that it is a script and a play, but it doesn't even play true to the amazing world that J.K Rowling created. The characters are written not like themselves in even the slightest way. Nothing even makes sense. It is just so so so bad.  Like many other people said, it reads like bad fan fiction. I've actually read BETTER fan fiction than this book. I am so disappointed. I am going to pretend this book doesn't exist, and that's it.
 This was a really great story about overcoming the past, family, and the power of friendship. The beginning was a bit slow as they set up the characters of Albus Severus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy. The second half bumped up my opinion of the book considerably once we got into the meat of the plot. It just took awhile to get there. Basically, Albus Severus is trying to go back in time to right a wrong of his father's but ends up messing up the fabric of time. I really enjoyed seeing how small changes altered the current reality so much. The friendship between the two boys was really great and reminded me of the trio in its strength and resolve. Some of the older generation felt a bit out of character at the beginning but I feel like the characters kind of found themselves again but the end of the book.<br/><br/>This isn't really just another Harry Potter book so don't expect it to be like the other ones. Go in with an open mind to a slightly different writing style, an entirely different format, and new characters. It is a good read but some die hard Harry Potter fans might be a bit let down if they were really looking for a direct continuation of the seven books JK Rowling wrote about Harry Potter.
 I've grown up with Harry Potter, the books, the films, as many people have. Words can't ever describe how much I love Harry and his world. However, I don't know how I'm going to finish this book. The play format I can get through. But oh my lord. I'm on page 31 and I've read better fan fiction than this. These aren't the same characters I fell in love with as a 1st grader. Not even close. The plot "hooks" are so terrible it might as well have come straight from a Stephanie Meyer novel. Page 31 and I already feel so let down. JK I'm disappointed.
 I really enjoyed continuing the adventures of Harry Potter and hope that this is not really the last we hear from him.  Although it was clearly stated that this was a play I wasn't use to the format and I did find myself confused at times and had to flip back and forth. However, my experience reading this one will make me much more likely to try reading one in the future as I did get the hang of it. I did feel that it was being told by J.K. Rowling however, it did lack much of her descriptive details. All in all I do feel like this writer captured the Hogwarts and Harry Potter feel and I would look forward to a full book. I would recommend this for all ages that wants to hear about the adventures and misadventures of Harry's son and unlikely friend. You will also learn the fate of our beloved characters and what could happen if you play with time.
 It took me nearly half the book to really get into the story - I'm not sure if it was just me getting used to reading Harry Potter as a play script with the minimal descriptions and reliance on dialogue or if it just took me that long to acclimate to my favorite HP characters being 20+ years older than I'm used to reading them, but it was slow going for a while there and I considered stopping. Once I reached the midway point though, the story got a lot more interesting (and I would say more familiar/comfortable as it began to draw more and more on plot elements from the book series) and I flew through the second half.  I would imagine this is a fantastic play though. I wish I could see it.
 Good news, bad news. The good news is that by the time I finished this book I surprisingly did not regret reading it. There were many parts throughout reading it though where I wished I never picked the book up. Overall though, I don't consider my $8 purchase of the Kindle book a total waste, though I don't see myself going back to it again. The voices of these characters read like a fan fiction with few fleeting moments of capturing the real magic. The ending resolved everything well enough that you don't finish feeling totally robbed.<br/><br/>*spoilers ahead*<br/>The characters voices were definitely off. There were things I feel JK would have never had characters say to eachother or do. Such as the poly juice potion kiss scene with hermoine. Also, snapes character was very chummy, which did not suit the way he was written for all 7 books! Once they concluded who Delphi was, the book got better for me and it seemed to have a purpose. And I also enjoyed the flash backs to the tri wizard tournament.<br/>I know a play is going to lack the depth of a novel but I still feel like the first half of the plot fell short.<br/>The story focused so much around Albus and Harry that other characters were sloppily thrown together. I doubt Hermoine and Ron would've raised such a snob and bully as Rose was. In fact, Hermoine and Ron's personalities seem to be so lost entirely in this that you wonder if they're actually still friends with harry beyond what they went through in the past. Also, where was James in all of this, or Lilly? James, much like Rose, mostly served to be a bully at the start of the book then fade into the background. Harry and Hermoine were written as very self serving type characters, while Ron was a trophy husband that occasionally served as comic relief. Draco actually seemed to be one the most interesting and likeable characters of this entire book.
 Look, if you're a true HP fan you're going to like it and bear through the difficult parts no matter what (with Jim Dale's voice going through your mind at the same time). This is our last piece into the Wizarding World. Truthfully, it's just OK. Nothing completely special, you can see where the story is heading early in the second act, but you will muster through because you are a fan. It is a bit confusing to read, I don't know it may just be because I am reading it on my kindle, but having the lines listed out by name and the constant jumping around makes your head spin. I had an open mind coming into this and of course there are many things I would have liked to change, but with a shrug of the shoulders I will add it to my HP collection and probably read it again and again just to get a better grasp of what is going on. Maybe by the third time I read it I will understand and enjoy it more. Overall I'm indifferent. Good pool read.
 I am a huge Harry Potter fan and have much love and adoration for J.K. Rowling, which is why I'm so bummed that I found Harry Potter and the Cursed Child disappointing :( I understand that this story was set in a much later phase than the original HP books, but it still seemed like the characters were very OOC. In fact, the characters I enjoyed most were the new young protagonists. I also found the plot to be a bit ridiculous and cliche. However, the book was a quick read (I read it in about three hours), and it was awesome to revisit the world of Harry Potter. I also really enjoyed the script format, as I'm an aspiring screenwriter. Although I didn't much enjoy Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, it made me remember how much I love the Harry Potter world, and now a reread of the first seven books (and maybe even a rewatch of the movies :) is on my to do list.
 I was skeptical about reading this because it is NOT written by JK. However, I did laugh and I cried. I've got two quotes from the script for you that sum up the plot and the point:<br/><br/>...there is only one truth we can't escape: That somewhere in our past a witch is trying to rewrite everything we ever knew ...<br/><br/>...there is never a perfect answer in this messy, emotional world...<br/><br/>I enjoyed seeing some old relationships got better, or sweeter. I also truly enjoyed seeing the next generation begin to flourish into wonderful people. But I really thought it was too far fetched to be "true" to the cannon in the 7 novels. The time turners, Delphi, prophecies... and Lily and James...that wasn't very nice!<br/><br/>If you are a serious #Potterhead, it's a decent read TO HAVE IT IN MY COLLECTION. Just grab a couple of tissues, and don't Tweet @jk_Rowling too many WTF's...
 This felt more like fan fiction than a real Harry Potter book. The characters were all pretty poorly developed and the dialogue felt forced at several points. Main characters from the older books (Harry, Ron, Hermione, etc.) also felt completely different and way more flawed/wimpy than their old selves. It is an easy read though and does trigger a bit of nostalgia, so I will allow it 3 stars.
 Let me start by saying that if you are looking for a good book that is Harry Potter themed (but not too much like Harry Potter) and you are okay with reading scripts, then you should absolutely buy it.<br/><br/>I bought this book seven hours after it was released, and I read it twice in my room before I came down for breakfast. I was so intent on reading it that I just rushed through it and loved it. But after I went back and read it again and again, I had to notice some differences and things that I didn't like about it.<br/><br/>Although this is a great book and the script line makes it seem really interesting and good, I was definitely not reading the same type of story as Harry Potter, and it is clear that this was not completely written by J.K. Rowling. It was really good, but in a very different style and I noticed several times that it would give information that was completely wrong from the Harry Potter series or things that they just made up. The characters acted in different manners and sometimes things happened that just didn't make sense. Also, I loved the time travel, but we have a whole other book about time travel in the third movie, but it tied in with the plot better. I know that Albus wanted to show to his dad that he is also good and can do things, but I just can't see why he'd risk his life to save the son of someone who had rejected him.<br/>I loved the party with Snape in it, and I loved that they introduced new characters, but the Cedric Diggory turning into a Death Eater because he lost the Tri-wizard Tournament is a bit much, as well as the part with Padma getting married to Ron. Hermione going with Krum made Ron jealous! If he went with Hermione why on Earth would that mean that he is jealous of Padma! She is in Ravenclaw and he probably hasn't spoken mroe than five words to her in all their time at Hogwarts. I am also a little bit disappointed that they left out almost all of the kids besides Scorpius, Albus and Rose form the story. I would have liked to hear more about them. Albus is always talking about how he hates Hogwarts, but we hardly even get a view of what is making him hate it, except for a tiny bit at the beginning. And Voldemort having a child... it just seems like a joke to me, because I just finished the Deathly Hallows for the 50 thousandth time, and she is pregnant NOWHERE unless somehow magic makes a baby disappear and appear out of thin air, but let's be honest folks. Also, how can Delphi fly? It says that she learned it from Voldemort, but he can't fly without a wand. The Death Eaters and Voldemort can turn into those black-ball-spirit-things, but they can't just glide without a wand.<br/><br/>But honestly, if you don't focus on that stuff and you're not looking for something EXACTLY like Harry Potter, then this book would be great for you. The script adds a lot of suspense to the story sometimes in the way that it's written and has a pretty good storyline. I absolutely loved it (apart from the mistakes) and gave it a four star because I don't want to be those rude people who just give it one stars. Yes, no story is perfect, but no story is done without work. It doesn't help anyone to get feedback from people after they've spent a year on a book to be told that it is terrible. I liked the book, and I hope that you did (do) too.
 There are plenty of people who have written extensive reviews of the book.  So I will keep mine simple.  I've read all the Harry Potter books many times over.  I still pick them up and re-read them.  So I was expecting interesting things from this one.  I knew it was written in a play format and was prepared for it.  What I wasn't prepared for was the lack of a fully developed story, many missing characters (some who were key in the prior books and movies), and just....a lack of something, je ne sais quoi.  Makes you wonder how many people had a hand in writing this story
 I found this easy to read and follow although some people I know who've read it found it confusing to read in the script form. I enjoyed the story and might have given it 5 stars if I wasn't comparing it to the HP series which goes way beyond anything I've ever read. Enjoyed reading J.K. Rowland's vision of what things were like later in their lives, the maturing of the characters, and the exploration of how things could have been if other choices had been made. I found some of the things slightly inconsistent with the HP series which was irritating to me because I'm obsessed with keeping things true that way. Other than that, an interesting read.
 Although the story had potential I think first of all keeping it in script form was a mistake.  I didn't mind it so much but it seems many other readers had a problem with it.  Next, to give Voldemort a "love" child was a stretch, I think he was as repulsed by the notion  of physical love as Sheldon Cooper and anyone he'd deemed worthy to carry his heir would most certainly been less in battle and more in hiding.<br/><br/>Voldemort wouldn't have sired an heir anyway as he'd already planned his immortality, and it wasn't in any way going to be vicariously done.  A hapless minion who felt cheated of a promised station, such as Lucious Malfoy would have been more believable.  Lucious would have been desperate to re-elevate the Malfoy name and redeem himself to the Dark Lord and taken great satisfaction in destroying Harry Potter's past and future to do so.<br/><br/>While I enjoyed revisiting old friends I have to say it felt like they had some other engagement and had rushed the visit.  Indeed such an event merited a two part series but in separate books with a bit more character development and a cliff hanger at the end of the first book.  J.K. Rowling should have followed her original formula and banged out a story on her own and then allowed a playwright artistic license.<br/><br/>Indeed, thank you for the story, and do come again, only this time when you can stay longer and be more at home.<br/><br/>Best wishes,<br/><br/>Keith B. Hughes.
 As a lifelong HP fan, I was excited about The Cursed Child.  I don't regret reading it, but to me it reads like a bad fan fiction, and I don't "buy" most of the characters.  Without leaving spoilers, I will just say that I found many things highly unbelievable of the characters and world that JKR created.
 I purchased this for my husband, who is a Harry Potter fanatic, he was really excited to receive it, but the minute he opened it, he looked very disappointed. He is not an Avid Reader, but assured me that he would try to read this book, he did try, but admitted that he could not get into it the same way that he could some of the other works that JK Rowling has done. If you are not totally devoted to reading, I do not recommend purchasing this, perhaps trying a library would be better.
 I did not dislike this book. However, it was a bit of a hit-and-miss for me. I will start off by saying I do miss the original novel composition of the Harry Potter books. I also felt that like other reviewers mentioned, this should have been written by J.K. Rowling and Rowling alone. Having two other writers contribute to this book tainted it in a way that you didn't feel as much of the magic as you did when you read the original 7 Harry Potter books. I could easily feel which parts of this script Rowling had most likely written and which parts she did not. When I found myself most absorbed and familiar with the characters and surroundings, I could sense J.K. Rowling's involvement. Other parts of the book, the characters didn't quite sound like the one's we all had come to originally know and love in this novel's predecessors. Like the majority of readers, I grew up with the books as well as with the films. So, I could not not read this book, nor could I put it down once I started reading it. What I did enjoy about this book most was where Severus Snape was involved. He has been my ultimate favorite since "always." Not only that, but I loved that I could feel and imagine very clearly the Snape as was portrayed by the late Alan Rickman in the films. I could hear his dry sarcasm so perfectly. The only thing that was odd to imagine was Snape calling Ron and Hermione by their first names. As for Delphi (WARNING: SPOILER), it was very predictable that her mother was only non other than Bellatrix Lestrange. I knew it from the moment I found out Voldemort reproduced. So overall, while I enjoyed some portions of this version of Harry Potter, I found other parts to be predictable and not all quite original (thanks to those other two contributing writers). I give it 3 out of 5 stars because I did enjoy it. It wasn't my favorite HP book, but if you are a true Harry Potter fan, it's impossible to give it complete thumbs down review, only because well, it is Harry Potter.
 I didn't read it. I thought it was an actual novel and I was so upset I never got past the first page. Didn't have a clue it was a screen play. It was a total and utter let-down. I guess my excitement over the new Harry Potter 'novel' got the better of me and I didn't read the fine print. Actually, I never considered that someone would put a screen play in a hard bound edition and disguise it as a novel. If this was a new marketing ploy, it failed in a very firm and solid way.
 In terms of a worthy successor to the cannon, HP &amp; the Cursed Child is a bit frothy like a good latte after a lifetime of black coffee. Its plot is engaging but light &amp; sentimental the way visiting the theme park must be. It is a script, of course, which means we're missing at least half the storytelling that we would see on the stage.  The Harry Potter universe is a comfortable place to live in again, but I can't imagine one trying to understand it without having read the books;  it seems like all the requisite explanations are there;  again, I think the art is in the stage production.  Although it approaches being derivative, the play almost counts on your expecting what's next to come. This isn't Doctor Who,  though, in which of late all the old villains seem to pop up, for no particular reason, paving over their previous selves.  In fact, my favorite character, without saying too much, is Draco Malfoy. He is wonderfully-rendered to play on and against our expectations. It is almost his story.  Certainly, no one has a better vantage point on the major theme of fathers and sons.  Reading Shakespeare to ourselves, we are always taught to create a theater of the mind. That's what has to happen here to appreciate this story as best as possible in script form. Otherwise, I'm waiting for the promised Broadway run, which will spawn a traveling performance that I'll be waiting at the station to welcome.<br/><br/>P.S. What's with all the hugging &amp; outing of emotions. I'm American &amp; I got squirmy. If Harry had spoken like this about his emotions, A- He would have received progressively harder chucks on the shoulder from Ron, &amp; B- He would have been so emotionally-stable, the idea of running away from everyone &amp; taking on Voldemort single-handedly would have been  impossible, end of story
 This reads like fan fiction ... and not even good fan fiction. I am an avid HP fan -- I gladly plunked down my hard-earned cash for the hardback book each time a new novel was released. I own all of the books in hardback, Kindle and CD (Jim Dale ROCKS!) and all of the additional books, as well as all of the movies. And I watch, read and listen to them regularly. It isn't just about the simple story line. It was about the symbolism, the mythology, the nuances, the multiple threads, the details that spanned the books from beginning to end and an impoverished single mum who pulled herself out of poverty by her pen.  Suffice it to say, I know this story forwards and backwards. This? Well, I preordered it and didn't have huge expectations (but certainly higher than Snape's expectations of liking Harry). It's a good thing I kept them low, because the end product certainly failed to impress. I can only imagine the disappointment of those who were as excited to get it as Dobby is when he gets Christmas socks from Harry.<br/><br/>As a writer, I have done my fair share of ghostwriting. This feels like a clunky ghostwritten project. JKR may have created the story, which has the potential to be brilliant in novel form. But, the playwrights let it fall flatter than the golden chair Hagrid broke at the wedding in book 7. I read it as one should read a play -- imagining staging, timing, costuming, lighting, etc. The story is incredibly linear (which kind of makes sense given how the story plays with time). The characters are wooden (even the Golden Trio come across as droll). I wondered more than once if there was a LGBT agenda woven into the character development of the two young protagonists (a nod to the Dumbledore-Grindelwald relationship perhaps?). Connections are dropped left and right. Seriously, the storyline feels like a leaky cauldron -- details and continuity are leaking out everywhere. Meanwhile, the first scenes are very fast and disjointed, which I understand if you want to quickly portray the passage of time, but unless the staging is amazing, I doubt anyone but avid fans will understand what's going on. I will say this -- if they are able to pull off the "magic" on stage, that would be very, very cool to see.<br/><br/>This is not a stand-alone work of fiction. If you aren't familiar with the characters and also Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, you're going to be lost.<br/><br/>I hope this is released in novel form ... and that JKR plays a much bigger role in its creation and editing. Several friends have asked if I'll read this play again. Maybe ... if I have three hours to waste. Will I see the plays? Likely, but I'll likely wait until the production comes to the United States. While I love visiting London (and the HP studios and Platform 9 3/4), this isn't worth a dedicated trip across the Pond. Would I watch it in a movie form? Yes, but like I said, I'm an avid fan ... and I can only hope that the novel and movie versions, if they are created, will be better than this iteration. Here's hoping Fantastic Beasts is better than this!
 I love the original Harry Potter series, but this one falls short in almost every way.<br/>The story was ok, but not great. The biggest problem was the script writing style, which i did know about before i read it. It completely ruined the pacing and immersion of the story.<br/>Another major issue with the narrative was that jk rowling completely glossed over the formative years of the main character. She literally condescend several years of character development into a paragraph, leaving us with an emo wizard kid we don't really care about doing and saying things that we don't really understand.
 Let's start with the basics: This is not a J.K. Rowling-written HP book. It's a script of a play that happened in UK recently. So it's not going to have all the storytelling elements of a JK book that we all know and love. Honestly, I was bored after reading 1/4th of the book and decided to return it as it was so predictable. The reason I'm giving it 2-stars instead of 1, is I knew what I was getting into when I bought this book, so it's not as if I was surprised it wasn't that good. Only buy it if ure prepared to read a non-JK HP script (or are prepared to return it).
 I love the story but found that reading a screenplay is not the easiest or most enjoyable thing to do (hence 4 stars rather than 5).  Whereas I would have devoured a novel, it took me several days to work my way through this.  Would much prefer that this story is put into novel form.  Also now understand that this book is the rehearsal edition and a "final" script will be published probably next year with the changes made to the rehearsal edition.  I, for one, do not plan on buying another copy just because of some modifications.  If you have not purchased this book but are thinking about doing so, it might be something to consider.  Am disappointed that, at this time, Mz Rowling is NOT planning on putting this story in novel form.
 I have devoured every Harry Potter book, except the first, the moment they each came out.  I love Harry Potter.  I do not love this book.  It was obviously not written by Rowling.  Maybe the general idea of the play was hers.  This book is missing what makes Harry Potter books magical, Rowling's colorful descriptions that immediately snatch you into Harry Potter's world.  It is a boring read and I tried to make myself read it, but didn't get far.
 First of all this is my hubby's account. I've read and reread the books and was really looking forward to this book. I was willing to accept that it was a play and was really excited to get it. I've also seen all the movies repeatedly and accepted the disappointment over them not mirroring the books enough, but I lived with it and enjoyed them.<br/><br/>I preordered this book and like others excitedly waited for it's release. Then it gets here and I read it.<br/><br/>I'm not going to fully break down all of the disappointments in it, but say I whole hardly agree with most of the things that folks had to say about it.<br/><br/>The story itself didn't have that HP feel to it. It just felt rushed. The main plot idea of the story goes against the original ideas and character understanding or our understanding of the characters. I know people can change as the grow up, but some of it was just too much.<br/><br/>Now, the plot itself if they'd done it differently, but the person they used was impossible based on the original stories.<br/><br/>And I agree, the new movie is a lot better than this book and if they want to do a story, why not do what they did. Create new characters and touch on the HP world. Core characters can interact but the story doesn't have to be centered around them again.
 Although it was great to revisit Harry and the rest of the gang, the storyline was interesting and very much a J. K. Rowling thriller (I read it in 4 hours), but was disappointed with it being written in play format.  I felt it detrimental to my enjoyment of the book.
 As a longtime Harry Potter fan, perhaps my expectations were too high for this new work. It should be emphasized that this is a script for a play, and therefore the differences in medium don't allow for J.K. Rowling's typical wonderful detailing, plot intricacies, and character work on the page. Additionally, it's not solely by J.K. Rowling, and I think that shows.<br/>If you buy this, be prepared to not get the same level of fully fleshed out story, with the same level of detail, warmth, humor, and complexity of her original 7 books. Perhaps if I had seen the play, and therefore seen what the actors brought to the stage, this script could've been a nice companion piece, but as a standalone piece of work, it is a little bit lacking for me.<br/>If you are a hardcore Harry Potter fan, however, and want to read every work she's written, you may still find this enjoyable, as there are some surprising revelations in this book that build and expand on the original 7.
 I'm actually glad this book was written as a play because it easily separates it from the series.  I'm unsure of how much influence JK Rowling had in the writing of this book as the writing style wasn't as thought out as her previous HP novels.  It could best be described as field notes or "over coffee" conversation of "what ifs".  In the end, the book is a bunch of fluff and gives fans some material for unanswered questions from the series.  Honestly the same could have been accomplished by a blog series on Pottermore or similar.  All in all, if you read it for some slight entertainment value over what would have happened if one detail of the real story changed, then you can enjoy the play / book for what it is.
 Of all the fanfic in the world, why this one? It just kept getting worse. The plot holes, character issues, not to mention the offensive presumptions that someone must be just like their parents (ie the Voldemort thing and some of that dialogue). At least this saved me a couple hundred dollars by not buying tickets for the Broadway show. It's truly awful and I began reading on vacation not knowing anything about it and looking forward to a good story.
 As a lifelong Harry Potter fan, I was very excited to read this story. Unfortunately, The Cursed Child somehow cheapened the story I grew up with. The original series played a huge role in my life, with the themes of friendship, teamwork, and love serving as meaningful life lessons in my teen years. The weight of the characters sacrifices, in my mind, deserves better then this cheeky script. The underlying story is a nice 'shout out' to Harry's past and the issue he's having with his son is appropriate, but the delivery itself is almost hyperbolic in a way that pokes fun at the whole thing. Especially poor Ron, whose character has clearly devolved into mere comedic relief. Its not a terrible little side read, but its not for those who were expecting or hoping for more of the powerful story we left behind nearly a decade ago.
 Like so many others, I really wanted to like this. Really. Yes, I knew it was a play and got over the fact that there wouldn't be any descriptions of settings or thoughts. I knew I wouldn't get lost in it as I had the novels. But this is totally unacceptable. There is no character development.  There is little consistency. The plot is lumpy and disjointed. I don't feel like I know anyone even though I know almost every character very well. She should have just written a new novel - it would have been more satisfying for everyone (probably her as well). Not to put too fine a point on it, but this sucks.
 WHAT THE HECK DID I JUST READ?!?!<br/>First of all- time travel is SUCH a cop out in sequels. So confusing. It is used as a crutch when the author can not develop well thought out characters themselves, they rely on the nostalgia of existing or beloved characters that readers already have deep feelings for, which coincidentally are the ONLY parts of this book I enjoyed (Cedric, Snape, etc)<br/>Second of all- It is written AS A PLAY, which I get, doesn't make it any easier to read or enjoy. Breaking that 3rd wall between the audience and characters takes a lot of the magic out of it (pun intended). I don't even know HOW one could make this into a play (how do you do magic/shape shifting/time changing on stage?!?!)<br/>What an atrocity on JKR.
 Harry Potter and the Cursed Child... Where to begin...<br/>Just know, I always have been and always will be an avid Harry Potter lover, supporter, fan. I grew up with the books, went to all the midnight premieres, watched all the movies a million times over, did it all.<br/>At first, I was really reluctant to read it; I was more so nervous than anything because the standard that the original series had set was really high in my mind. But reading it with an open mind, I've come to really like it and appreciate it for what it was. it's own separate thing.<br/><br/>I will admit, there are many flaws; it's not perfect. The plot line near the end was a little predictable, and the twists were surprising in a very corny kind of way. I knew the dynamic was going to be different because they're older, their lives are different, everything is different.<br/><br/>But a big thing that I loved about the original Harry Potter series was there: the development of friendships and relationships, sometimes even between unlikely people. For here, especially between unlikely people. It also gave me the opportunity of getting a glimpse (however small) into their lives after. Bringing all that in, with all of these characters I've loved for all these years, I liked it. Didn't super "LOVE" it, or thought it was incredibly amazing. Just...liked it. Still would recommend it.
 J.K. Rowling PLEASE redeem yourself by writing the book that us potterheads really want to read.  And that is the story of Lily, James, Sirius, Lupin Snape, Wormtail etc.This was just disappointing.
 While it IS a must read for fans of the HP series, it is very different.  Characters do not seem well developed... for a while I reminded myself it is much harder to develop characters in a play (we are all aware this is a play, right?  In fact, maybe two... or just one in four acts).   mild spoilers ahead?]  But even many of the familiar characters seem relegated to serve as plot devices... this one to insert humorous lines even though he/she is too smart to say them; that one to serve as the voice of authority even though he/she appears less mature than in the novels.  The plot might even be a little strained for the purpose of including a number of unexpected (i.e. deceased) characters from the novels.  A family member described it as a lot like a fan fic.<br/>All that is not to say it isn't imaginative and dark and a welcome exploration of some of the emotional issues confronting old and new characters.  Someday I expect I will try to see a performance just to see how the scripted effects will look.
 I fell in love with the book immediately... In the sense that nostalgia flooded back to me, desperately looking for the feeling of reading a brand new Harry Potter book again-- for the first time in 9 years.<br/>When you get further in the book, however, you realize how much is missing. After all, it's written as a script. No descriptive paragraphs, no narration of Harry's inner thoughts.... Just dialogue. That loses a lot.<br/>For years I have wondered how Jo would write another book. Would it be about Harry's kids? Harry's Parents? Random wizards? I personally think it would be difficult to grip the audience without the unique situation of Harry and Voldemort. My thoughts were confirmed by the direction of The Cursed Child. SPOILER---- the use of time-travel to characters and events from the original 7 Harry Potter books was a huge crutch to the imagination for the wizarding world. Most of the book was a "throwback".<br/>I think it was painfully clear JKR was not the main author. From the way each character spoke, to the entire plot. It seemed like fan fiction. It was rushed, not extremely substantive, many things go unexplained.<br/><br/>I enjoyed getting a hint of the world I knew and loved as a kid. But next time, I hope it is a full-on book, written by Jo, and written with depth, passion, and detail.
 Have not read the previous novels so may just be I don't follow the stage play format very well. Having seen all the films the hardest part was connecting the written "voice" of unfamiliar characters Albus and Scorpius, and visualizing the new relationships between them and the now "grown up" Harry-married-to-Ginny, and his old chums, the now-married-Ron-and-Hermione. Also, the physical layout of the text often left me wondering - mid speech - which character was speaking.  I even tried visualizing the action occurring on a stage, with associated limitations, but even then, finding a compelling story line was not possible. I'll of course be very interested to eventually see the produced stage version.
 As a huge Harry Potter fan, I am terribly disappointed. I feel like I've just read another fan fiction (let's be honest, I've read much better fan fiction than this too). The main characters don't even feel like the same people, the story is incredibly jumpy, and it's just so inconsistent to the original Harry Potter story. I can't believe that JK would actually slap her name on this.
 Been waiting forever for this, and it finally arrived!!! Love you amazon!<br/><br/>I just finished reading it, and it's really good, though I can't see it as the "official eighth book". For me, it's a really well written fanfiction. I can tell JK Rowling was not responsible for the actual writing, because at times the characters are a bit ott and not quite canon. They don't always sound like the Harry, Ron, and Hermione from the book. And Draco Malfoy is far too cheerful and friendly with the trio (even calling them by their first names). Professional McGonagall is also way out of character. The ending was kind of rushed and also too good to be true (everything fell into place all at once), but otherwise it was a cute, funny and heartwarming read. Like I said, it's a really well written fanficition, but definitely not the eighth Harry Potter book!<br/><br/>I would recommend this to any Harry Potter fan, but don't read it with too many expectations! The storyline is definitely not as complex as the Harry Potter series, but if you're looking for a light, enjoyable read to pass time, then you'll like it.
 My first thought or word is "yearning" I realized  a miss my characters, my trio Harry, Ron and Hermione. Make me feel eager to re-read HP Series all over again.<br/><br/>Please let it know, this script it wasn`t write by JK Rowling, it was created for the London Play, All I can said is after a finish I feel eager to watch the play, how is the production of the play? stages,? clothes? special effects, in the end everything. Of the new characters, I loved Scorpius. (I will not say why for not to give spoilers).<br/><br/>It has many flaws that maybe Potter fans, like me, will notice, but it wasn`t so bad. I recommend it if you are truly a fan, you must read it even for Potter culture. I recommend it.
 I liked it, i know a lot fans did not but both my daughter and I liked it.  We were aware that it was the play script, so that wasn't a surprise<br/>There are some parts we could do without , that I won't give away but other than that we have no regrets.  It was an easy read too.  No more than a couple of hours.
 You know when you read the book, then watch the movie, you're disappointed at the things they had to leave out, including the characters' thoughts and part of the plot, and that sometimes things aren't pictured as you imagined them?<br/><br/>Then imagine reading just the script of the movie, without the pictures and wonderful visual effects, without the expressions on the faces of the actors -- and of course all the extras that the movie left out are STILL left out....<br/><br/>And that's kind of how reading the script of "Harry Potter and the Cursed Child" feels. It's okay, but it could have been so much more.
 I'm crushed! I could not wait for this book to be released and it feels like a student writing fan fiction.  The characters, including Harry, were wooden and uninteresting.  I gave up on it.
 I watched my wife read this and become more and more disappointed until the final act.<br/><br/>The scenes are too short.<br/><br/>The pandering is too obvious.<br/><br/>The characters are not believable.<br/><br/>The plot devices are predictable, but the story is not really believable.<br/><br/>It's okay. Just okay.<br/><br/>But when you trot out one of the most successful stories of all time and it's just okay, you're in trouble. It takes the lustre off an otherwise stellar corpus.
 I really, really love everything Harry Potter. I mean, I started the Harry Potter Book Club in my high school. That being said, I wouldn't read this book again. It took me 2 hours to finish and for the first time since I started reading the Potter books, I didn't want to read it again.  I understand this is written in script format, but I expected something more given the fact that JK Rowling's name was written on the cover. There seemed to be so much lack of setting the scene and character development. This fell utterly short of what I love about the works JK Rowling had previously published. If they release a full novel based on this story line, I can see this being a big success. I wouldn't personally open this book again in the meantime.
 Having read all of the Harry Potter books prior, this was easily the worst of the lot. The story is very disjointed, plot lines and characters are underdeveloped, and the finale is a giant train wreck leaving the reader asking, "that's it?"<br/><br/>PRO<br/>- This is written as a play. At first this annoyed me, but it is somewhat refreshing to see a play that will receive such widespread release. Hopefully this can help renew interest among readers for plays.<br/><br/>CON<br/>- The writing is just not good. I question how much involvement Rowling actually had with this story. I definitely question her actually putting pen to paper on it.<br/>- The story is so disjointed. It skims by characters without any kind of introduction or background. This should have been expanded into two or three books to have made any sense.<br/>- The ending is awful. Throughout the play you know it is building towards some big apex which then fails to materialize. As a result, you are left with no sense of closure.<br/><br/>I do not recommend this except to the die hard Harry Potter fans. If you have only watched the movies this will be a poor intro the books.
 I was very excited to read this as its been so long I've been able to check in with the world of Harry Potter.  First, I found it a little difficult to read due to the fact that it was a script, but I can overlook that.  The storyline, however, was a bit convoluted for my tastes.  It is blatently obvious that JK Rowling did not write this book as the feel and actions of all the characters save Harry himself felt foreign.  The friendship between Albus and Scorpious was strange and bordered on a love story (which I have no issue with, but if thats what its supposed to be, play it up guys!).  And perhaps the strangest part was learning that VOLDEMORT and Belatrix once did the horizontal mambo and gave birth to a child... geeez.  That makes Voldemort seem too human and normal, kinda like finding out that Emperor Palpatine in Star Wars moonlighted as a pasty chef or something.<br/>All in all, a decent read, but I look forward to more content from the imagination of JK Rowling.
 I'm a huge Potterhead.  I even have a Deathly Hallows tattoo.. so I feel like I'm almost betraying J.K. with this review... but... I just did not like this.  It seemed almost like a fan-fiction.  Sorry, J.K.  To leave on a positive note, if you enjoyed reading about Dumbledore and Grindelwald's history in the original series you will LOVE Newt's storyline in the new movie series... Pick up the book (Fantastic Beasts is in a 3 book set along with the book on Quidditch and the short bedtime stories) and read up on the Beasts before watching the movie and you will be able to recognize Newt's Beasts as they're introduced in the movie.  It made watching that much more personal... yes, Potterheads are cray and PROUD of it!
 I am a true Potterhead and am totally "confunded". This play was ridiculously confusing, badly dialogued and not at all true to the Rowling characters. I won't detail all the glaring horrors about this script simply because it doesn't deserve the effort. I cannot begin to imaging having to sit through this play. If it made little sense reading it, with the advantage of understanding every word, I only cringe at the thought of having to sit through not one but two sessions of this mangled mess without a replay button. One star is one too many!
 I am quite surprised Rowling approved this garbage. She's so protective of her creation. You can't even buy alcohol when you order a Butterbeer at Universal because you may mix them because Rowling demands Butterbeer not be changed in anyway. The story is bad but more importantly, the dialogue between the characters is horrendous!! Don't waste your time or your money. IT'S AWFUL!!!!!
 I couldn't even give it a half star . I wish I had checked this out further . I'm a huge fan of Harry Potter and I foolishly bought it thinking it would bee written in the beautiful prose as in all the former books..hugely disappointed..waste of time and money..don't waste yours . Had to give it a star or no review
 Fast forward 19 years to the relationship between Harry Potter and his teenage son, Albus Severus.<br/><br/>At the beginning, I had a little bit of a hard time getting used to it being a script. But very soon, I was sucked into the story... and the lives of the characters. It was sooooo good, and I couldn't turn the pages quickly enough, especially towards the end. Reading this makes me want to go back and re-read the whole entire series. A huge thank you to J.K. Rowling for taking us back into the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. It is a marvelous, unforgettable place.
 I have to begin by saying that I love Harry Potter and this book was a welcome trip back to the passion I have for the rest of the series. As I read the last pages I was both sad that the book was over and sad that it had only offered a semblance of the main series. It didn't pave new and interesting aspects of the magical world and it lacked the whimsical and well written scenery that was depicted in the main series. The "magic" of Rowling's magical world was something the reader got as they read between the lines and put together the scene, the play, perhaps by venture of being a screenplay, fails to capture that same slowly unfolding magical scene that enchants the reader. Writing style however is not the real crux of the issue here (SPOILERS AHEAD) is the use of time turners as the central plot point, in an entire magical world with endless possibilities for other stories we just get a collection of time travel tropes. However beyond any amount of bad writing and poor plot devices, I was appalled at the poor facsimiles of our former heroes. I won't even begin to bring up the newly created plot holes should you accept this book as canonical. (END SPOILERS) In summary, it's a fairly good fan fiction at best or an insult to the long standing fans of the series.
 Ron is on a rampage and only yoda can stop him with the help from starfleet. this riveting tale will have you on edge the entire time. you may miss work, kids graduation, even your own funeral. shameless money grab now that original series has ended. or continuation of a beloved universe who knows? surely not some random review on amazon. I'm not random and don't call me Shirley!
 So disappointed.  I'm a huge HP fan and have read the series over about 8 times.  I understand that this is a script and reads differently than any of the books - I was expecting this and accounted for it.  However, everything about this felt wrong.  The characters did not embody the same traits as the original series and felt like different people altogether, the storyline was farfetched and flawed, and the writing was poor.<br/><br/>The only redeeming quality of this book is that because is was so unlike the other books, that I finished it feeling like it wasn't a piece of the collection so I was able to completely disregard it. Definitely felt like fan fiction written by someone who didn't understand who the characters really were in the original series.
 I was very excited to get a glimpse at how the story progressed after the epilogue in book 7, and fully understanding this book is a screenplay knowing it wouldn't read as a novel... I still feel a bit disappointed in this story.<br/><br/>It was interesting but I just felt like all the characters we knew were terribly out of cannon. I'm sure seeing the play live is magical but I'm just disappointed in the story. Not what I expected I suppose.<br/><br/>On the one hand I am grateful to have something to read from the harry potter universe again but it really did give off a sort of fanfic vibe, as in it didn't seem like this was real... like this isn't really what JKR would write if she were to write an 8th book.<br/><br/>Ah well. Still enjoyable for what it was. Mixed emotions. I'm am happy there was further redemption for Snape (my absolute favorite character) but I certainly missed his snarky wonderfulness. My beloved Snape, you live on in my heart in all your dry wit and ensnaring intellectual glory... always.
 This was a huge disappointment of a book. There were so many plotholes and the dialogue was ridiculous. Rowling worked really hard in the third book to work with the paradox of time travel that are trampled all over in this book.
 Meh. As a long time potter fan who grew up with the books as they were published, I didn't hate this new stage-play script as much as a lot of other fans are hating on it. It wasn't the most amazing thing ever, and I felt like it lacked that mystery element that made all of the books so engaging, but it was nice to return to the wizarding word in an official way, even if it wasn't as drop-dead fantastic as I was hoping for.
 OBVIOUSLY its not going to be like the other Harry Potter books.. its not freking written by J.K Rowling. Get this fact through your head first before purchasing and expecting the same phenomenon we had with the books that were written by her. I was so intrigued to see how one of the outcomes could be for life for all the characters from Harrys life and how it turned out to be put into a play. Overall it was great. I had 0 complaints, the plot was cheeky, had unexpected turns, and its very nice and warming inside to see life after Harry and Hogwarts for all of our favorite characters. Especially reading about everyone's kids and how they are all to continue on to hogwarts and how they all cope and which adventures they run into. Ofcourse id love to see JK Rowlings actual Adaptation of life for all the characters after ther books but we all know that, that wont happen because it just isnt right. Nevertheless this was a nice distraction, a nice reminder why im so obsessed with the wizarding world of Harry Potter and it was a nice plot. Dealt with alot of feelings and it was certainly touching and very beliveable.
 I am a big Harry Potter series fan, so I was looking forward to this work, and the chance to reunite with the principal characters.  I was also  ready to make allowances for a play/dialog format.  But...how disappointing to be presented with such cloying, over-sensitive kids, and such one-dimensional versions of Harry, Ginny, Ron, and Draco.  Even Professor McGonagle was a shadow of her once-potent self.<br/>At times, I felt like I was watching felt-board figures being moved around.  The time machine plot was contrived to somehow get all the characters from the books involved, however superficially.  Please, Ms.<br/>Rowling, do a book to replace this unfortunate work!
 Overall, I liked this story.  It is written in script form, so that took a little getting used to.  I liked the plot and seeing how the characters interacted as adults as well as their children.  I felt the story line could have been a little more developed, though.  We see Albus start first year and then we are in the fourth year with little to expand on what happened in between.  James is hardly mentioned, which was disappointing.  I understand this was written as a play and not as a novel, but perhaps a novel form would have done it more justice.  Still, a good read.
 Apparently this was great on stage, but Rowling (or whoever wrote it) doesn't know how to write plays (directions like "their minds are in hell" don't belong in scripts), nor can she punctuate. This can't have been edited; I didn't notice any such errors in her books, which I loved.<br/><br/>The plot was disjointed - how did Harry know Delphi's name? - and the characters apart from Albus and Scorpius were badly drawn. I couldn't see Ron or Hermione in their adult versions. I did rather love Scorpius though; his dialogue was witty and funny, but the scenes without the boys were awfully flat.<br/><br/>And seriously, how did they stage this with all the emotional directions and special effects?
 Good seeing characters again but...they had no maturity. Sounded just like they did in teens. When do they get to actually grow up? This wasn't even written from albus' pov either, so no excuses. The characters also didn't seem true to themselves. The loving father who dropped his child off suddenly doesn't get how hard Hogwarts is? None of these characters sound any older than 12_13 and certainly not how they would have developed as parents/adults. It's not Peter pan, for heaven's sake!
 It's nice to read about harry potter's world again. this book is the script of the play, not the novelization of the script, so it reads like you would read a playbook. I saw before the actors who were going to play the main characters and have read a lot of the families and work details, so i don't really need any more explanation on what they look like and why they were in a specific job. Having read all of the Harry Potter books through my childhood and teenage year, i liked it. this is a nice read. Could seriously be read in one or two days. Be open-minded given that it was a collaboration between two writers.
 Reads like low rent fan fiction written by someone who didn't read the 7 main books or didn't understand them. I have no issue with this being a script book and not a novel, the issue isn't that it's a script, the issue is that the characters we know so well don't sound like themselves. It dares to inexpertly violate the original story. The very basic premise just doesn't resonate with what we know about Voldemort. JKR should have never endorsed this. I'll try my best to forget this exists.
 I would give the book half a star if possible.  The book is such a disappointment. This is clearly not J.K. Rowling's work.  Story line is predictable &amp; writing more on the level of a child's homework assignment.  I really wanted to like it &amp; kept hoping it would get better.  Character did nott act or behave like the other books.  I was a big fan of the Harry Potter series. Not the Curse Child.
 I am a huge Harry Potter fan, so I pre-ordered this the day it became available to do so. I stayed up to read on my Kindle as soon as it was released. I was so excited for the next chapter! However, I was rather disappointed. I knew it was written in "play format" and would not be in a regular format, so that played no part in my feelings on it. The story itself was interesting, however I will echo others who have said that it seemed more to be a FanFiction. The story itself was interesting but it seemed to jump around almost too quickly. I know that this is meant as a play but it still was disappointing to not get to delve deeper into the new characters. Overall, it was a good read, but perhaps it would be better to see in it's intended format.
 I'm giving this book 2 stars because I don't think I could ever give something Harry Potter just one. I started this book well aware that it was a script and not written entirely by JK Rowling. However, she was missing from the whole thing! It is missing all of the beautiful details that she brings to the HP world. It's poorly written and at times painful to read. I had to force myself to finish it. This is coming from a total Potterhead. This book just makes me sad. I'm sorry I spent money on it.
 I get that this is a play and couldn't go into great detail but seriously j.k. this is as phoned in as it gets.  The plot is just complete garbage compared to any other Harry Potter book.  What an awful way to finish off the Harry Potter story.  Here are a few of the major problems without spoiling the story. 1. Favorite characters are shoe horned in for fan service. 2. Harry Potter acts in ways that Harry Potter would have never acted. 3. TIME TRAVEL, time travel is where good stories go to die when the writers are out of ideas and this is no exception to that rule. I could go on but I don't want to ruin plot for people that haven't read it.  I have never read a Harry Potter fan fic but I'm willing to bet that there are ones out there that are far better than this stain on the Harry Potter series that I loved reading while growing up. So disappointing
 Good, Could Be Better.<br/>I miss J K Rowling's writing, yet, for the most part I enjoyed the play. I wish I could have gotten to know more of the characters; all of the children. I think there would be more depth if there was a novel written. I would enjoy delving into the characters more.<br/>It was nice to visit most of the characters I love from the books. I did not find Harry full of angst; I enjoyed that he was a caring if a bit neurotic dad at times. I enjoyed seeing a new side to Draco- people do change. I enjoyed the time travel and thought the play was creative. I would like to see the play or a movie. I would love to read another Harry Potter novel and be able to revisit all the main characters in the book.<br/>By the end the play ended too quickly for me! I liked what I read and would have liked more...
 I'm very disappointed that this was in stage play format. I know there was a big to-do in London about the stage play, but the format is a poor substitute for a novel, if you're reading. There were no details in the writing: the kind you found on every page and in every sentence of the original Potter books.<br/><br/>I didn't even get a true sense of the characters. And because the format was designed for a finite amount of time on the stage, some characters got short shrift, particularly Ron, who hardly appears at all.<br/><br/>It was a good story: a VERY good story. I just wish Rowling would have given it the broad narrative it deserved.
 As so many other people my age I grew up with the HP books and reading the newest addition to the HP universe did make me feel a little nostalgic. Obviously as a true HP fan I had to buy it, but it's not a masterpiece like the other books. To be fair, it's a screenplay and it's not necessarily meant to be read but watched, which I have taken into account in my review. But the story has some obvious plot holes and timelines that just don't add up. The first few pages were fast paced and the story line irritiated me so much I even stopped reading it for a few days. But it did get better towards the end and it gives you a glimpse into what could have happened, if a few things had been different. It's entertaining enough but probably only really enjoyable to die hard HP fans.
 I could not wait for this book to arrive.  Then I saw the ratio of 5 stars to 1 star reviews.  I was nervous.  I decided to go into this book understanding that this was not part of the original seven books.  It has Ms. Rowling's name on it but it is not solely her project.  I am glad I took this stance before cracking it open.  I enjoyed it while I was reading and am happy to add it (as a companion piece) to the rest of the collection.  The more I think and talk about the book, though, the more excited I get.  I mean, it's Harry Potter!<br/><br/>I do understand why some have said that there is little to know character development.  Things move quickly - almost whiplash-inducing quickly - but, again, this is a play; a script and (much like a movie) three hours cannot be spent on character evolution.  As an admirer of the original series, I missed "growing up" with Albus like we did with Harry but I was also thankful that, as the reader, I was spared the nitty-gritty details and was placed directly into the story.  Besides, it picked up precisely where Deathly Hallows left off.<br/><br/>I laughed more than I expected and there was definitely a few instances where I sighed and placed my hand over my heart at the mention of certain characters.  I would like to see the performance.  Given the stage directions, I think it would be an experience for the senses - as it does not just seem to be visual/audible cues.<br/><br/>I recommend this book to the lovers of the HP series so long as you do not try to fit it in the same pretty and precise little box.
 I have to preface this by saying I'm a huge Harry Potter fan. I've read and re-read the series at least a dozen times. I was excited to read this book to catch up with my favorite characters' lives. Because it's a script, it lacks that detailed description I loved about the books. It's easy for die-hard fans like myself to really believe some of the events that unfold. However, it did draw me in and keep my attention. It was nice to have my favorite characters back for a couple days. And. If nothing else, it makes me appreciate the other seven books even more. I definitely recommend reading it, but I'd advise fans not to get their hopes up too high. You have to take this book for what it is.
 I was initially disheartened by the lack of "flushing out" that comes with script writing.  The essence of the scenes are reduced to minor commentary that may or may not make sense.  It's simple.  More like reading a cliff notes version of a good book, except this book is just ok.  Harry hasn't grown at all, the most interesting character is Draco and he has a rather blandly normal aging arc.  Everyone else is fairly flat or boring.  The plot is fair, but the only twist being a witch we never learn much of anything about leaves me wanting.  This is my least favorite Harry Potter installment by far- the movie will likely be better than the book.
 It's not news at this point, this does fall short of the standard set by the previous stories in the series. I'd be crushed if I didn't have faith that we'll see a return to form in the new film series. As others have said, the characterization too frequently feels wrong, and too much of the past is revisited. It just isn't inspired. There are lots of spells but no magic. The live experience may make up for at least some of the script's shortcomings, though, and I do still hope the stage show comes to America. Likewise, I hope for more Harry Potter stories in the future, set farther in the future. Let's leave Harry's past well behind and see him move beyond You Know Who.
 This book is now holding up my Tv as a stand, as I do not intend to read it again. As an avid Harry Potter fan, I was utterly disappointed in this story line. It is as if the characters were completely different people than those I grew up with
 This story just did not work in the format in which it was presented. As I was reading, I could see glimpses of the genius storytelling of the first seven books, but this did not deliver. It was like reading JKR's outline for the book she could have written. If you're a Harry Potter fan like I am, you're going to want read this no matter what the reviews say, but I can't say I loved this "book."
 I just wish J.K. Rowling (alone) wrote this story as a novel not a play. I was thoroughly disappointed when I received the book and realized my error. Had I known it was a theater play I would not have bought it. Perhaps it will be re-written with all the magic we've come to love as a novel. I hope so.
 Meh.  It's sort of okay, but the plot is very, very odd and has a lot of "what the hell?" moments.  I feel like there were a lot of plot holes.  I won't post any spoilers here, but I was pretty disappointed since I was expecting a lot better from Rowling.
 NO SPOLIERS. Let's face it, JK Rowling could write a haiku about Hagrid on a piece of toilet paper and millions of people would fork over $10 for it. This was a great story, it fed my desire for a new HP story, a hold over until Fantastic Beasts comes out. It's a very quick read, maybe quicker if, like me, you are already familiar with the script format. Most characters remain true to what we expect from them, there are a few disappointments. Yes there are some gratuitous appearances but I appreciated them for the most part. The plot is kind great if you don't overthink it... just enjoy it for what it is.
 So beneath the quality of the original Potter books. I was very disappointed, bored even.
 This is written like a bad fan-fiction. I was /so/ happy to get this book, super excited to read it. I was let down, super disappointed. It has its moments but it is almost like JK had nothing to do with it. I honestly hated it and Harry Potter has been with me since childhood. I grew up with it, this book is a huge let down.
 It's certainly not like the original Harry Potter novels, but it's still worth a read. You'll get used to the play-style writing. My biggest disappointment was that the dialogue just didn't sound at all like the original characters and I found them to be very...flat and unimpressive. I will say that it wraps up the end of the saga pretty well. All in all, if you're a true Harry Potter, you've got to read it. Knowing the writing style would be different and having already read many reviews before purchasing, I decided to buy the Kindle edition because it was MUCH cheaper. I'm glad I did. I won't miss this book sitting on my shelf in physical form.
 I wasn't able to read it but I suspect that is because the character interaction or more specifically the affinity J.K. Rowling writes with was missing and while I am sure the author intended well . . . that was a huge reason her Potter books were so successful  (the tremendous joy, humor and love we all held for Harry, Ron, Hermione and eventually most of the Hogwarts students and Professors.) However in all fairness to the author of this work . . . I put it down too quickly and perhaps it would have improved had I continued reading it. So this review may not help because the bottom line is . . . make up your own mind and do not let me discourage you!
 If you’ve read all the rest of the books about Harry Potter, you owe it to yourself to read this book and decide for yourself what you think.<br/><br/>Ignore the reviews that tell you how to feel.<br/><br/>I wish this had been a movie or a series on some streaming service. I want more adventures with the Potter/Weasley/Malfoy kids.<br/><br/>Hopefully I’ll at least catch this on Broadway.<br/><br/>Cheers to J.K. Rowling, John Tiffany, &amp; Jack Thorne. The play is brilliant.
 A big disappointment. The characters did not behave as one would expect, based on the past seven books. It’s hard to believe J.K. Rowling would put her name on this.
 I was so disappointed with this story. I was even more angry that JKR, herself, slapped her name on this. The writing was poor, and the story line was weak and in no way had the "voice" of the HP books. The characters were not even similar to those in the original HP series, and.... ugh! I JUST DIDN'T LIKE THIS AT ALL! I've read plays before, but never such poorly written plays. This was a big train wreck. As a Potterhead, I was saddened and confused as to why this was even produced. It's fanfic, not a continuation of Harry or the trio.
 I liked the movies. I loved the books. This? I'm pissed about.<br/><br/>15 bucks for the kindle version down the drain.<br/><br/>I was able to get into it despite it being still just the literal script. But that stripped the entire world from it. The actual books had the nuance of the day to day life of a schoolkid. The snowball fights. The taste of butterbeer.<br/><br/>I'm sure this gets more as an actual play, because the play lets the actors bring the characters to life. But when reading it, I need the "stage" to be the extra words describing the scene. This felt like an 'artistic' minimalist play of one actor up there just delivering the lines and expecting us to appreciate that. I didn't. Maybe that's on me, who knows.<br/><br/>The characters also didn't feel like themselves. There's some lines from Harry I just can't picture him saying, despite him being 40 now. And there's some 'youthful adventurous' scenes, one specifically on the Hogwarts train, that just seems absolutely silly.<br/><br/>I also agree that it feels more like a fanfic. The returning characters seem more written with the surface personalities, not with the nuanced other personality traits you sensed under the surface with a whole book.<br/><br/>The bare bones maybe gives me hope. Maybe if a legitimate book is written around this it wouldn't be bad. And maybe with the actors bringing the lines to life, the play may be great. But this? Not worth the money at all.
 This is NOT the new Harry Potter Book you've been waiting for. It resembles them in name only. This is a tough review... I think it manages to squeak an extra two stars only because I missed the characters so very much. It was a tough call, I thought about two stars, and the spiteful part of me wanted to give it one star. But at the end of the day it did hold my interest for the two days it took to finish it. But to repeat, and--this cannot be over stated: This IS NOT A HARRY POTTER BOOK. This is a shadow of a Harry Potter Book. I'm not even sure after reading this I'd be inclined to see the Play, unless the cast is exceptional and not just there because they looked like the characters.<br/><br/>Everything about this is a let down, as the title states, its missing the magic. The brilliant writing, the excellent descriptions, the fantastic characters, and even the magic is reduced to one word and maybe an extra couple result words if it worked. Listen, I knew this was a draft of a script. I don't mind scripts and I know their inherent limitations... but this is just embarrassing. You get so little *anything.* Harry has a somewhat unexplained anger problem and he's a straight up dick to his child. You get no sense that this is even Harry in anything but name only--ditto for every other character. They act in unexplained and seemingly unfamiliar ways.<br/><br/>In this "book" you have nothing that made the books great. The writing is sub par even for a script. The characters are mere card board cut outs of their old selves with no depth and seemingly bizarre reactions, anger, stupidity, more stupidity and no charm or love. Nothing in this is shown, its all told, but with 0 set up to really make you feel... and then there is the story itself. God what a terrible and played out story. Its like JK was toying around with a cute little short story and friends or her editor at the publishing company begged her to let them run with it to save their jobs. I can't imagine she was especially impressed or happy with this. Because of Hermione's incompetence terrible evil is unleashed on the world. And what incompetents it is! Not to mention the ministry has about the worst security ever conceived. They could using something as simple as a password? And the rest of the story will be familiar to ever science fiction fan ever... what a predictable snooze.<br/><br/>So on the plus side official harry potter that at least kept me entertained over a couple days... but it was a short predictable story missing all of the magic both literal and figurative that made you fall in love with Harry Potter. The characters don't seem real, their crappy attitudes are never explained, and that Hermione--now the big boss--would keep the most powerful Macguffin ever someplace anybody with a polyjuice potion can get to it--and that the whole ministry can be infiltrated this way--is 100% stupid and hard to swallow.
 I love Harry Potter. This is NOT it! I liked the idea and even some of the story line. My issue isn't even with the script format. There are many instances where the past is intertwined with the present. Problem is the past is wrong and some of the magic used is ignored! EXAMPLE: The keeper charmed used to hide the Potters (and their home) would have stopped anyone except those told by the keeper from seeing the home and or finding it. This is conveniently ignored. So many other things are off but that is my BIG issue.
 The characters are well written, the dialogue is charming, and the scenes are well described. But the plot? It goes against some of J.K. Rowling's writings on Pottermore, and seems childish. I literally read a fanfiction a few years ago with the same 'twist' at the end. And if you think about it, the twist doesn't make any logical sense. Good attempt, but you can tell that Rowling did not write the majority of this. It falls flat of what I've come to expect from the magical world of Harry Potter. I've enjoyed the Pottermore writings more than this. I greatly look forward to Fantastic Beasts in November.
 The working script of a play, it does not contain the usual quirky prose we've come to know and love from Rowlings.  The play starts with the last scen of Deathly Hallows, and through the magic of time travel revisits the events of Goblet of Fire.  Key elements of the story are the relationships between Harry and his son Albus, and Albus and Scorpio Malfoy.  The ongoing theme is how small changes in the past can mean large differences in the present.  As an adult who has read a lot of science fiction, I pretty much figured everything out halfway through the play.  Still, it was enjoyable to revisit the world of Harry Potter, and while I didn't love the play the way I loved the novels, I did enjoy reading it.
 I have a few things I really didn't like about this script and I will try not to spoil anything for those who have not yet read it.<br/><br/>My biggest negative after reading this as a Harry Potter fan was that the dialogue of the returning Harry Potter characters (Harry, Hermoine, Ron, etc.) felt very unnatural to the characters from the original series. I understand that Harry is now in his late 30s, early 40s in this play but there were times when I was reading his lines, and other returning characters' lines, where it just felt like that isn't something that character would say. There was also some dialogue that was really "cheesy" and felt like the writer was trying to force a laugh which made the line seem unnatural.<br/><br/>It is also missing the descriptive quality that made the original series so good, I understand it's a play and that quality would be lacking a bit but it was almost entirely absent in the scene descriptions.<br/><br/>The story line was pretty predictable (even the "twist" at the end was predictable) and was used much more effectively in other movies that had used it before.<br/><br/>I hope this review helps and I didn't spoil anything. I think any Harry Potter fan will check this out regardless of the reviews, as I did. But, if you're new to the Harry Potter series please read the original series and don't make this your first impression of Harry Potter.
 I enjoyed visiting with the now middle-aged principals of the Harry Potter books, but even though J. K Rowling may have suggested this plot, the writing was below her standards for teen-age or adult fiction. My grandson, now 23, who had devoured each volume the day it came out in the US, was hugely disappointed. He would have given it no better than 1 star.<br/><br/>To look at the consequences of actually being able to revisit a historical choice was an interesting premise, but the teenage revolt against parental domination was old hat and the generational misunderstandings unrealistic and too easily resolved.
 This book was horrifyingly bad. As an avid Harry Potter fan I have read the books multiple times and seen the movies more times than i care to admit. This book was like a glorified fan fiction. Why JK Rowling would put her name on this is beyond me. The characters are not true to themselves—the story line is incredibly obtuse and it lacks the profoundness and morals behind the original Harry stories.
 I'm so saddened by the potential I saw that was never fleshed out. I even tried to dramatize it by reading it out loud in voices, cause I know sometimes scripts aren't really best read like books, but nope. This felt like a story written by an amateur fan, or the Phantom Menace. I felt like I was reading a draft rather than a finished product. There are seeds of good ideas in there, but the whole time travel thing is mishandled and out of control.
 For those of you reviewing this book and marking it with 4 or more stars, or maybe even 3 or more, I do not know what you were reading, or how you can consider yourself a true Harry Potter fan. This was so obviously NOT JK Rowling's well researched and timed books. It is like bad fan fiction. First, unlike the original series, readers have no time to build any relationship with the characters at all, and they are cardboard and 2 dimensional. We rush through 4 years at Hogwarts and see none of the interactions between the students and teachers that help build this relationship between character and reader. Albus comes off as a whiny git and I do not feel sympathy for him whatsoever. I could have felt differently if the characters were given the time they deserve. Ginny is too nice - she would have told Harry off and maybe even cast a bat-bogey hex on him. Other characters were not true to themselves either. The antagonist and how that person comes to be makes no sense and is wimpy. Preserve the wonderful story line you have in your head without reading this train wreck. I realize that the intention was for this to be a play, and they should have left it at that and never published it as a book. I have to wipe my brain clean of this by rereading the original again...for the umpteenth time.
 This book was not written by J.K. Rolling, I want my money back, I would not have paid money to read this crappy fan fiction!
 I love, love, love all things Harry Potter and was very excited for this book. This book read like bad fan fiction- I just can't fathom why JK Rowling would allow this book. The character development didn't ring true to me at all. I wished I had just skipped this.
 I will forever be a huge fan of the Harry Potter series. Of course, whatever format something new is presented, I'm going to happily read.<br/><br/>This was hard for me to enjoy as much as the series of novels given its format, and perhaps part of me was sad to see Harry and the gang grown. That being said, there were plenty of poignant moments that brought back so many memories from the books and I find myself wanting to read the series from start to finish once again.<br/><br/>It was a quick and easy read and of course, all I want to do is travel to London and see the stage production immediately!
 Well, it's more of the same, but written to be performed as a 3 hour play, so there is a lot less of it. The character chemistry was really the highlight of HPATCC. I found the characters afinity (or antipathy) to be surprisingly palpable and both of our two new young heroes, Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy, are quite engaging in their own right. The plot is servicable if a bit same-y. The only real failing - and I can not overstate the magnitude of failure here - is that despite ostensibly revolving around the misadventures Albus and Scorpius, the story is never really theirs. Rather than being given their own 20-years-later version of the Potterverse to pluckily fumble about in, they are cordially invited to join our other Potter favorites in their world, under the strict guidelines that no matter how much stage time they get, Harry is the star. Some element actually feel like a late season TV clip show, with the characers emotionally retreading their pasts, pasts that we have already experienced with them. Some fans may be interested in the day-to-day domestic trials of the Boy Who Lived, or in revisiting the 80s and 90s with the HP gang, but I am not that fan; and with all the untapped potential energy of Albus, Scorpius, and Rose Granger-Weasley, I feel like HPATCC is a missed opportunity.  I would not go so far as to recommend against reading HPATCC, but as HP canon goes, it is a cutesy, disposable light read, and nothing more.
 Without giving too much away, HP's son, Albus, travels through time and revisits familiar scenes. Keep in mind this is a play- there are more punchy jokes to get the audience laughing, and the plot is simplified (not nearly as many angles or reveals as previous books) but I really think this is the only way the final part of the story could be told. The books are untouchable and there's an absolutely magical quality that can't be recreated. Go into the script without comparing it to her books and you'll find that this is an elegant end to the HP story. Giving only 4 stars because it's apparent to me that this best translates on stage.
 I've never read a screen okay before. It was interesting not having all the surroundings to read about. But, it was interesting reading about the children of our favorite Harry potter characters. I just don't know if i was a huge fan of how the original characters were after they had grown. But, give it a read and see what you think.
 I love the Harry Potter books.  Although I also read other books, I reread the HP books continually.  When I first got a new HP book I couldn't put it down until I got to the end.  I'm struggling after three days to finish this cursed play.  I agree with another reviewer.  I'm just not feeling JK in this writing.  It seems more like some unknown trying to continue the HP saga and coming up very short.  The story is fanciful in a far fetched way.  The adult characters come across as strangers to me.  This is not a good way to end Harry.  I hope JK reconsiders and gives us one of her own tales in which to say good bye to Harry and his friends.
 Definitely not one of the better Harry Potter books. Due to it's format, it's a quick read and in just a few hours you could read it from start to finish. It definitely has the tone of a fan fiction and the way the characters are portrayed in their voice and behavior is unlike the original Harry Potter books...it does not fit in. Overall, considering how much my husband and I LOVE the first seven books, this was a huge disappointment. Not JK Rowling standards at all. The only reason I didn't give it a one star is because it is still a Harry Potter book and did have some interesting plot twists.
 I was disappointed. I really was hoping to like it. It felt like Harry Potter mashed up with Doctor Who with all that time travel. I grew up with the books (same age as Harry when he first entered Hogwarts - I was 11 when the first book came out) and this made me want to cry. I am upset that J.K. would allow this to occur, since she claims she's so "possessive" of Harry and his Universe. Idk, I am just upset that she sanctioned this play. Yes, the experience will be different seeing it, but the actual dialog is corny and just plain awful and poorly written. I am going with the other fans with saying it reads like bad fan fiction and it kills me to give ANYTHING HP related a 2-star review. : (
 I grew up reading the HP books and I truly believe that they are what they are because of Rowling's excellent writing, especially her ability to give her characters unique voice through dialogue. It's obvious that she's not the primary writer because the dialogue (which since this is a play is everything) was lacking, off, and discordant with the previously-established voices of the characters. The way the kids talked, which has been a strong suit of hers, was stiff and just sad by comparison. Sorry. I just really hated this. Plus some of the major plot points, including THE major plot point, were clearly fabricated to conjure up a story and seemed completely implausible given the characters that she had established. I'm just wondering what the hell got her to put her name on this. Ugh.
 I was very excited to read this new Harry Potter book!<br/><br/>Having high expectations, even though I knew it wasn't solely written by JKR, I read it in one day.<br/><br/>The way I describe it as such: while it's a great story, it's not the same. The flow and way the characters act do not correlate with the original books. You can tell that JKR didn't write a lot of it, it just doesn't have her flair (her imagination is there,  but character development was very much lost).<br/><br/>That being said, good story,  but don't go in comparing it to the other books, if you compare it,  you'll be very much disappointed.
 This was not reminiscent of the Potter series I grew to love.<br/>Yes. I know it's a play... but why. For what.<br/>I'd rather have had a true jk 500 + page masterpiece come out next year than read this play. Seems like a play for junior high school. Ugh. So utterly disappointing.
 The play is just that, a play. Doubting that most Potter fans read plays often, this play might be something they dislike. The story telling is alright. The characters don't truly grow until the last few pages, and the direction is very very limited. This is not as immersive as the books in any way. The structure of each writer is fairly easy to pick out, and a lot of it feels bland.<br/>All that being said the play was ok. It felt like a good introduction to higher level play reading, which is good for the younger generation of Harry Potter fans. If you're an older fan that grew up with the books/movies this might not be for you. There are a number of plot-holes as well as unanswered questions, and completely missing characters.
 It was fun to go back into the world of Harry Potter. At first, the play structure distracted me, but before long I didn't even notice it. I think my only issue with it can't be helped. Because it is a play, it's considerably shorter than a normal Harry Potter book. I think one of the best things about those books is that you can get fully engrossed in the world and stay a while. The Cursed Child is so condensed in comparison. It's still a full story; you're not left hanging. It's just not quite the all-consuming experience that Potter fans are used to. The story line is fun, though. Overall, another great read.
 I eagerly awaited my copy but am really sorry I bothered. I'm one of the many who have read the Potter novels more than once so I am a big fan but not with this story. I knew this would be a script and that is not my problem with the book as it seems to be with some other people. To be honest I have not finished the book. In fact, I have read to page 38 and can't seem to muster up the interest or heart  to continue. That, to me, says it all.
 I was surprised at how clumsy the dialogue is. Then I discovered that J.K. Rowling didn't write it. She came up with the story, and a playwright fleshed it out. It's not nearly as magical to read as everything she has written herself. However, I hear the production is amazing, and I'm looking forward to the opportunity to see it!
 I had read/listened to some of the play spoilers before purchasing the book but it was still great to read it. Because Jo was one of the writers, this is tied to the Harry Potter series and I have been reading these for the past 17 years, I had to purchase and read The Cursed Child. I agree with many other HP book fans that this play is more of a standalone entity than a continuation of the series. The characters aren't very true to themselves, however, it is great to learn a little more about the next generation and see some interesting explanations (that could be true) for the original seven books.
 This was a great follow-up to the Harry Potter series. While I don't normally read plays, I couldn't have hoped for anything better. I bought the book without knowing anything about it and was worried that it would disappoint and not live up to the greatness of the prior books. I was pleasantly surprised by the format of the book. It was an intelligent way to get a peek into Harry's future without  tainting his rich history and instead creatively tying in some of the more memorable moments of his childhood. The play was enjoyable and I was happy with my purchase.
 I love J.K. Rowling and the Harry Potter series. I read them all as an adult so therefore don't romanticize them simply because I "grew up" reading them. I knew what I was getting into with this book. Screenplay format, Rowling only as "co-author", sequel set many years after Book 7, etc. Given that, I frankly expected it to be not as good as the original series books. But this really wasn't good. The richness of the original Potter books was missing. The characters lacked any development or depth. Even characters original to the series seemed like hijacked versions of themselves. It was like instead of becoming wiser and more introspective with age as one would hope (expect?) they actually became more ignorant and pathetic.  The plot wasn't completely terrible, although it was extremely thin as far as Harry Potter books go. I know some people might argue that it's not fair to hold this book to the same standard as the originals, but if we're expected to believe this is the next extension of the Harry Potter world, then that bar is already very high and this just doesn't measure up.
 Missed Harry Potter, so was extremely excited to hear about this. I thought a play sounded different, but love Shakespeare, so figured no big deal. But this is soooo poorly written, the corniest "jokes", the most unemotional contrived scenes, with hardly a plot, and just plain hard to get thru. Normally with the other books I would pick them up and have trouble putting them down - the last book I missed the exact same bus stop 3 times. I am not sure I am going to be able to finish this one other than to prove to myself that I am pretty sure I already know what is going to happen and who is really who...
 I'm a lifelong HP fan, and this is just absolute nonsense. Its like JKR took the worst tropes from fanfics written by 13 year olds in 2007, and made a play out of them. Its literally laughable at times, and not at the parts that are meant to be funny.
 It's always fun to return to the Potterverse. I enjoyed this glimpse into what would be a more modern-day wizarding world. Albus and Harry's strained relationship is intriguing, and the I love the friendship between Albus and Scorpius. I was, however, more than a little disappointed itn the offhand way the female characters were dealt with--very un-Rowling-like, in my humble opinion. I know she co-authored this, but it appears to me that she let the male authors deal a bit too much with Hermoine and Ginny. I'd have liked to see the stong women they should have become. Overall, though, worth the price and enjoyable.
 Harry Potter was always a magical experience. As a child, I never wanted to put the book down until I was finished reading it. Understandably this play reads a lot differently from a book, and maybe that's part of the let down, but I was quite disappointed. The plot focuses on Harry and Malfoy's sons and they fall short of bringing magic to life. The plot was horrible and seem more in tune with being a poorly written fanfiction. I'm surprised JK Rowling had a hand in this. I would definitely not recommend purchasing this book.
 The book arrived in good condition. It is an interesting read. It is formatted in a way like you are reading from a script. This would make a fun read in a classroom having multiple parts for well characters.
 I do not think that these characters would behave the way they did. Story rushed and seemed slapped together. Kept wondering how much input J.K. Rowling actually had in this story. Wished she wrote it herself.
 The writing style sucked. The action sucked. The character development was mediocre. I wish I never read it. I wish she wrote a real sequel.
 ***SPOILER ALERT!!!***<br/><br/>Don't<br/>Read<br/>My<br/>Review<br/>If<br/>You<br/>Don't<br/>Wish<br/>To<br/>Scroll<br/>Across<br/>Any<br/>Plot<br/>Ruining<br/>Spoilers<br/>Thanks<br/>I<br/>Hope<br/>I<br/>Dragged<br/>My<br/>Warning<br/>Out<br/>Long<br/>Enough<br/>That<br/>You<br/>Dodn't<br/>See<br/>Any.........<br/>.....<br/>.....<br/><br/>I wish this were a novel instead of a screenplay, and I also wish the antagonist was not Moldy-Voldy's kid. That is OOC to me. I can't see The Dark Lord, who was not only determined to not share magic, but also to not die, ever thinking he would need to possibly procreate. Shame on you, JK..Voldemort (most precious, in his own words) would not think himself fallible, nor would he be willing to share even the tiniest piece of his magic or DNA to create an heir. "Bad guy" should have had a different origin.
 Although I loved getting to immerse myself in the Harry Potter world again (and those feelings of childlike nostalgia are pretty sweet), this play is downright bad. If you want to read lukewarm fanfiction, perhaps you will enjoy this play on some level. I must admit that I did a little. But beyond that level, this play offers little to really inspire fans of the original Harry Potter series.
 I wish I could get my money back on this purchase... It was a disappointment on every level. I felt like the characters and the plot were very rushed and one-dimensional. It read as a poorly written fan fic, and I'm disappointed that I preordered something with such high hopes. Here's hoping the stage production is actually better?
 Like the majority of Potter fans, I eagerly awaited this final installment in my favorite series. However, the second I started reading, I got the impression that J.K. Rowling had absolutely NO influence in the "book". There were some interesting parts of the script, but the remainder, to put it simply, sucked. No teenage boy acts like Scorpius or Albus, and I found it disturbing that Albus genuinely thought that he had it bad when Harry grew up without parents or a life. I do not, however, regret reading it, partly because it made me appreciate the first 7 books so much more.
 This is a rating of the sorry material not the condition of shipping so ease be aware. If you are a big fan of HP like I am I do recommend reading this book because it helps you realize how good the originals were and how much J.K. Rowling has lost touch with her own book's lore and audience. This is a sad attempt at a cash grab and it sullies the HP name. Fan fiction is better than this mess and it irritates me now writing about this wasted opportunity of a story. I won't spoil it for those who haven't read but HP fans do read this no matter how disappointing it may be.
 It was OK. Gave me all the feels, but I think it would have been a better book if written as a book, not a play, and only by JKR. JKR is the only person who knows all the characters inside and out. If she wrote this as the 8th book, it would have been an amazing story with even more feels and the reader would have been able to picture everything in the book better than picturing it on a stage.<br/><br/>Also  disappointed Amazon for not delivering on the release day. Amazon knew it was being released on a Sunday for months and did nothing for their customers.
 I was so excited for this and was left with a "bad taste"<br/>This just isn't Harry Potter. I'm not saying to just ban the book out of your life but don't expect JK Rowling's magical words to come surrounding your imagination again. It won't. I kept cringing inside with how untrue the characters were. This is just one big whole fanfiction that managed to get published. I'd still go see the play but I just can't feel that excitement anymore. It's a shame to call this the "new final" book. I just push it off as a spin off not meant to happen in my head to make myself feel better... be warned.
 Somewhat predictable. Definitely not J.K. Rowling's best, but still an OK read. This is a really fast book to read, for the simple fact that it is printed in script format, which means it tells you who is saying what and what is going on with the staging for the play. If you are a Harry Potter fan looking for a detailed explanation of time between the defeat of Voldermort to the how and when Harry and Ginny get married and what happens when Harry and Ginny see their son Severus off on the Hogwarts Express, you will be disappointed. Enjoy this book for what it is: a story that takes place over a small snippet of time.
 It is a very fast read and written well. Others dislike this because it is in fact a play script and therefore doesn't read with all of the wonderful details and descriptions that a novel would have. However, it does follow the Harry Potter world and it is a wonderful addition. This product is definitely aimed at younger children in concepts and language, more so than the original Harry Potter series which I have read as a child and as an adult. Overall, I would definitely read this again and perhaps to my future children in a few decades to come.
 I'm giving a 3 star review, which I never thought I would do for a Harry Potter  book. I was disappointed with the length and really the story line when it came to Harry, Ron, Hermione and Jenny. I know this book is the screen play to the play that was done in London but I think it could have been better. These characters who have been through so much when they were young were made to seem so weak. At least that's how I see it and that's why I am giving this 3 stars. I wish it was better and it would have 5 stars.
 The book really kept my interest and I enjoyed it. A little past the half way mark, it began getting a bit too touchy feely with everyone discussing their emotions...then it picked up. The end was way too halmark and didn't give us that big bang I would have liked....I don't know what I was expecting; but I didn't get it.
 Like my title says.  Do yourself a favor and go read some of the more popular Harry Potter fan-fiction if you're looking to scratch the Harry Potter itch.  Methods of Rationality is a good place to start.<br/><br/>This work was clearly a product of "too many cooks in the kitchen" and shouldn't have been published in its current state.  Maybe it's better when seen acted out in person, but from what I've heard from people who've seen it, it's not.
 This book is a huge disappointment to the whole Harry Potter series.  It's written in a play format and doesn't have the same descriptive information that all the other books had.  The book is extremely easy reading but lacks in the same powerful images that the other books had.  Overall, the story line is ok.  I think if it was written in the same way as the previous books, it might have been on the same par.  I would still buy it again as a Harry Potter fan but don't expect much out of this book other than a little insight into present day Harry Potter world.
 Picks up where movies and books ended, some good points, definitely read it, but may want to go ahead and forget you read it afterwards. Plus the play as described would be an expensive and difficult play to put on stage--how to change scenery so much and do magical special effects?
 This play/book casually picks apart the characters from the books I love so much.<br/><br/>Harry Potter, the boy who grew up unwanted told his child "I wish you weren't my son." Harry the orphan would never way that to his child. The book also tries to begin with the original series left off.However where Harry told Albus not to be afraid of being a slytherin, in this book Harry is disappointed by that outcome.<br/><br/>Ron is nothing but a jokester, and the series out right says Hermione would hate men if it weren't for Ron. Its a hot mess, don't read.
 I am sure it is better on the stage, but jumps around so much and forces scenes to fit together that I found the whole read unsatisfying. I don't like where she took the characters. Like the new Malfoy boy. That was a good introduction, but other than that there was nothing in this script that got me excited. I simply did not enjoy it. Will see the play if I ever get the chance, hoping that it translates better on the stage. However, the scenes change so quickly this thing is either a stage directors nightmare or wet-dream. I am sure their are sadist in every profession.
 I wanted to love it, I really did, but my expectations were so high I'm not sure they could have been met. That should attest to how brilliant J.K. Rowling's writing is. She has created a world so vivid we all know it, really know it.<br/>I was able to wrap my brain around the format. That was ok, if not slightly annoying. It just doesn't have the same feel or depth as its predecessors. I'm glad to have read it. It makes me nostalgic for the "real" thing. I sense a series re-read in my future.
 I couldn't even bring myself to finish this. And yeah yeah, I'm horrible for reviewing it without finishing it first. But as a loyal and long time Harry Potter fan, this work really did upset me. The fact that it was written in a play format was one thing. Just watch 'A Very Potter Musical' if that's what you want. But on top of that, the characters were two dimensional, the plot was forced, and the world seemed to have a lot less magic in it this time around. I could go on about all the little things that bothered me (WHY would Hermione Granger leave a riddle for people to follow in order to find the super top secret, dangerous time turner??? She's way too smart for that!!!) but I won't.<br/><br/>Basically, if you're a long time Harry Potter fan, don't turn to this book expecting to have your hunger satisfied. The most you'll get from it is an allergic reaction and some indigestion.
 This book is utter crap. It is a case of someone writing their own fan-fiction, and they were somehow lucky enough to get it published with J.K. Rowling's name attached. While there are some good ideas in the play, they are childishly under-developed. The stage directions try way too hard, the references are overly involved with every detail of the original series, and the characters are clearly derived from the authors'  personal fantasies and wishes, and not from the great character sketches Rowling provided throughout the series. Congratulations to Jack Thorne for riding the Hogwart's Money Express. I only gave it one star because I had to give it a star.
 I read some of the negative reviews before buying and reading Cursed Child. I wasn't to excited to get started reading the play format so finished a couple other books first. BUT... Once I got into the story I could not put it down. I disagree with one reviewer who felt the play did not feel like a Harry Potter story. The script format did make for a somewhat ackword flow to the plot. A lot happens from one scene to the next and most scenes were very short. But I could easily visualize the characters and environment as if I was viewing a movie. There were references to many of the events from the movies and I felt this added to my enjoyment of the play. The story is suspenseful and and has some unexpected surprises. There is a cliff hanger between parts 1 and 2 that heightens the suspense. I would like to have read this as a novel; maybe we will see one in the future. I did see a WB teaser trailer on You Tube for a Cursed Child movie... to be released in 2018. It looked legitimate.
 I am obsessed with Harry Potter and J.K. can really do no wrong in my eyes. That being said, I believe this might be her story but the play itself doesn't sound entirely like it's in her voice (in my opinion). This could be because of the use of the playwright to write it in its present format. It was wonderful to enter back into the world of Harry and I enjoyed the themes explored in this book. I've heard many describe it as similar to fan fiction and I'd agree with that. While I liked this story... I LOVED the originals.
 Not good.  This was NOT written by JK Rowling, so the book jacket is very misleading.  The authors are playwrights and they were really WAY off on the voice of Harry and the other characters.  I hated it.  I wouldn't recommend this for true HP fans.  I was so disappointed.
 Disappointing book.  It feels like very little was written by JK Rowling.  I am not sure it that is because it was a play or just a different writer.  This book lost the fun imaginative writing of previous books.  There was very little fantasy in it as with other books.
 This was ok. The biggest disappointment for me was that I loved the world JK Rowling created and how thoughtful and fleshed out her descriptions were. Since this is a play, I didn't have that world creation, just little action. I can imagine it being good on stage, but she should have adapted this into more of a novel for the book release.<br/><br/>As for the plot, it just felt lazy and uncomplicated. Yes, there is a big twist, but it isn't anything grand or shocking. The old characters turned into the parents we hated as a teenager, and the new characters tried to be like Harry's meddling self, but for no reason other than to comfort an old man.<br/><br/>I will say, however, that it is an easy read and it was nice to see how she sees the magic world after the fall of Voldemort, but the nostalgia was not enough to make me want more. I'd rather re-read the seven books than this one play.
 I really didn't have a problem with the okay format. It does make reading fast, but it also allowed at least me personally to imagine my own scenes and what everything looked like. I loved Scorpious.....not so much Albus. I wish they had explored why Harry and his son had such a time communicating with each other. I would have also likes some more of all the other trios kids. I'm grateful for this further look into all of the characters. It was a nice peak into the adult lives of characters I have grown extremely fond of.
 My very favorite thing about the Cursed Child was Scorpius Malfoy. He was setup as a sort of combo Ron/Hermione to Albus's Harry, so he's studious and clever and awkward and jokey and full of heart. As Scorpius himself points out during the play, he has a lot more reason to be angsty than Albus, but he's just happy to have a friend, and I absolutely loved him. I also really enjoyed that Harry and Draco's sons became best friends and seeing the interactions between the two fathers as they navigated that.<br/><br/>I'm mixed on the fact that the plot was setup in such a way that we got to revisit characters or relationships that we thought were done with. Going back to these was lovely, but I'll admit that structuring the plot this way was also the biggest weakness of the play; it felt like a cop-out to deal so heavily with time travel just for the nostalgia. I also agree with other reviewers that the characters were not consistent with who we know them to be, and the dialogue, particularly for the younger characters, was a bit hard to believe.<br/><br/>There's not much in the way of character development here, and the emotional issues are somewhat over-dramatized, perhaps to fill in for the lacking plot. I think I would have preferred if the "adventure" part of the plot were a bit lighter and the emotional story were more subtly explored instead.<br/><br/>I'm sure that this script is hugely better with the great acting, effects, costuming, staging, etc. that I've heard is given to the London production, but I must say that the stage instructions were a lot of fun to read. That's one of my favorite things about reading plays because you get a glimpse at descriptions, sometimes with very specific or interesting wording, that, as a viewer of the play, you would only see translated into the acting. Most of the time, the translation of the acting (and staging and whatnot) is going to add a lot more than you lose by not getting the description, but seeing the exact words can be so funny and so telling.<br/><br/>Overall, the plot was a bit forced, and the characters pretty one-dimensional--which is probably why they don't seem true to the original characters, who were all far more complex than presented here--but this will hit hard in the nostalgia department. I think the Cursed Child is best summed up as this: we were all excited to go back to Hogwarts with Harry, but we actually went back with Albus, and he doesn't much like Hogwarts.
 I am a huge Potter fan and I mean huge.  I have tattoos, cats are named after characters, I re-read the series at least 3-4 times a year, and have watched the movies so many times I lost count.  I've been waiting for this SCRIPT for ages.  Major emphasis on script.  I'm not sure why people are bashing it so hard.  Obviously this was written so it could be performed on a stage, it was advertised this way, there was no deception...did people not look into this before reading?  It takes some imagination to make this story really come to life, you have to read it like you're watching people perform it.  The story needs to be fast, a little silly, and come full circle at the end.  THIS IS A PLAY!  It needs to wrapped up quick and keep the audience interested/entertained in the theater and in doing that, yes details were over-looked over and you don't get the full Rowling experience. This is a collaboration and really we're lucky to even have it. Too many people are going into this thinking it's a new novel.  Get that out of your head, or yes, you'll probably be disappointed.<br/><br/>I love seeing old characters.  I love seeing their lives after Voldemort.  I love being back at Hogwarts. I love a new adventure.<br/><br/>I actually enjoyed reading this, it's something new, and it was fun.  It is your typical "butterfly effect" story line, but with characters I grew up loving.  I'm happy to read anything J.K. Rowling does with Harry Potter.  I appreciate this SCRIPT and wish I could see it performed live.  My imagination is pretty good, but I'm sure this looks amazing on stage.<br/><br/>Keep an open mind and just enjoy it for what it is.  Magic!
 You have to be able to read a play to really like this story. Because it's a screenplay, it's in script format and it has more jarring and sudden changes than a novel or movie. If you're comfortable with this style, it's a good story. It doesn't have the depth or complexity of a book or movie, it's very linear and has a single story line with only one or two very short side threads. A lot of people who I've heard complaints from sounded like they were judging this as the 8th Harry Potter novel rather than a screen play. It isn't. It's still a fun read though!
 I should be so lucky that my flight is delayed by 4 hours and I'm stuck at the airport, giving me plenty of time to read this script.<br/><br/>First of all, let me preface with my own admission that I know this is the wromg medium for consuming the story. This was written for a play, and one will not absorb the entire story simply by reading the script once through. I have not seen the play. I will not be able to grasp the nuances of the detail and deep emotions JK Rowling was able to deliver in her book. To fully appreciate the story, you should watch the play and/ or study the script properly. I have not done that, but I am also not holding it against this format by giving a lower rating due to this. No, I am simply rating based on the story. BTW, yes I am a big time Harry Potter fan. Have been since the very beginning like most of you. The wizarding world of Harry Potter is very special to me, and this breaks my heart a little.<br/><br/>Spoilers from here on:<br/><br/>I think calling it a cheap fan fic is a little harsh, there was some good and some bad... mostly bad. I do not like the fact that Ron seems like a former shell of himself. The book makes it seem like Harry did everything, and glosses over what Hermione and Ron and everyone else did. Ron and Hermoine's daughter seems like a shallow brat, she doesn't even like Scorpius/ Albus until after they have done something heroic. She seems obsessed with status, the opposite of what Ron and Hermione would have raised their daughter to be.<br/><br/>The part about the polyjuive potion was absurd. How does the Ministry not have detection mechanisms for that after what Harry, Ron and Hermione pulled in The Deathly Hallows? I mean, yes... Voldermort having a child makes me want to kick a duck, but everyone's already mentioned that so I won't hammer it again. But I will say that Voldemort having a child is the least favorite part of the whole thing.<br/><br/>Albus and Scorpius's friendship was great, it mirrored the relationship that Harry and Ron's, in that they were both outcasts. Harry felt like he could never fill the shoes that everyone gave him, and so does Albus. I like that parallel. I like the depth that they have given Draco- he gets more of a backstory and his personality doesn't become too compromised to fit the plot. In fact, Draco's story was well done. I'm OK with the time turner story despite it's flaws... I just don't like how they butchered a lot of the integrity of the characters. Back to things I don't like again, as I've just said everything that I do like.<br/><br/>I'm bouncing all over the place here.. OK. I hate the fact that they never explain about the broken arm situation after the first time turner trip. I hate that they've left out so manu key characters- the surviving Weasleys, Luna, Neville, Hagrid?!! None of this is OK! What is Luna doing these days? I need to know these things.<br/><br/>The fight scene- if Harry was weakened by the scar and therefore was struggling against Delphi, I could see that. But no, they made a point to tell us how strong she was. Harry beat Voldemort in a duel! Harry is supposed to be really good at Defense Against the Dark Arts. Harry is older now and presumably got good training from the Ministry and must have evolved. The whole spiel about how Delphi studied Harry just seems.... contrived.<br/><br/>Finally, Snape's character was butchered. The whole thing with Snape seemed very forced just to make the plot happened. It didn't feel like Snape at all, I don't see him saying those things about Albus/ Harry. It seemed so out of character, I was so mad because Snape is one of my favs.<br/><br/>If you are a Harry Potter fan, I'd still say read it. Form your own opinions because everyone took away such different experiences from their Harry Potter journeys. This is simply what I took away from this script.
 This play gets a one review for nostalgia. It is confusedly written as a mash of fiction, stage play, and movie script. The story is pleasant at times, but if you follow it too closely, you'll see there isn't all that much there. What's unforgivable is any marketing is this book as canon. It is not.
 I really disliked this book. It made Harry a middle aged wimp and not the hero his fans know him to be..The story was ok but if you loved the boy hero, this story will change that image forever.. It was not well done and I know JKRowling can do better
 Wonderful ! Insightful!  A great look into fathers and sons. It's awesome how J.K. Can weave such a back in forth STORY and keep it real and not confusing. You'll love it and so will your child. Of course 5 stars. I WISH it was a movie. Please write more what happened to Scorpious and rose.five stars
 This was so bad I returned it.  I liked Scorpius and the idea that Draco could have been mellowed out into a halfway decent person by a decent wife, but Albus?  I *hated* that little whiny, sniveling little attitude monster.  The dialogue was off, the characterization was crap -- honestly, to call this a fanfic is an insult to fanfic; I've seen better fanfics.
 Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is by far the darkest of the Potter novels. I recommend it for ages 12 and up. I was not sure what to expect when I started reading this, but quickly found it was not a happy Potter world to start with. It gets a little confusing in the middle with a time-turner and if you set it down for a while, it may be hard to remember where you are when you pick it back up. This book is ultimately the journey of a father and son trying to learn to communicate, respect and love each other in their own way.
 I was very disappointed in this book.  I was given the impression that it was a sequel to the series.  But written as a screen play it was nothing like the other books.  You do not get the feeling and emotion for the characters and it is not enjoyable to read like this to me.  I do not like the way it was written and I truly loved the Harry Potter books and am a big fan.
 It physically hurts me to only give this book one star. Yet, here we are. The story was flimsy at best. It was ridiculous and unnecessary. It could have been so much more but it was just lazy. It was as if every weakness and hole from the original series was wrapped up and packaged into this play. Save your money, disappointment and fond memories of the original series.
 I came into reading this script after seeing some of the other reviews, so I took their advice to read it as more fanfiction than cannon. Even for fanfiction, it was mediocre. Nearly every element of the story (the spells, the plot devices) was recycled from previous books and many characters were unrecognizable. They were also often nearly indistinguishable - I feel a truly good script is one where I know which character says which line without needing to read the labels. In this script, I wouldn't know if a line was delivered by the teenage boys or by Hermoine Granger. Perhaps the worst representation was of Ron, who frankly, had none of the life of the previous character. He vaguely reminded me of Fred, but frankly, was flat even for Fred.<br/><br/>Harry himself seems to have been transported back to the 5th Harry Potter book, seemingly unaware of the progress he has made in understanding Dumbledore. There appears to be no sign of chemistry between him and his wife Ginny, although she is the best-developed character in the script. His behavior, especially after the 2nd incident (hopefully that's vague enough not to spoil and clear enough to tell you when), is completely nonsensical. For a second, I was wondering whether he'd become possessed by a certain former minister of magic!<br/><br/>The last thing to be mentioned is how feminine all the characters seem. Everyone seems very open about speaking about their emotions (although, unfortunately, not in showing these emotions without speaking), very fragile, and very defined by their attachments to others. Ron, for example, can be completely summarized as "bumbling fool who loves Hermione" and Albus can be summarized as "angsty teenager who is obsessed with his best friend."<br/><br/>SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER: the repetition of what friends the two boys are and how much they need each other and the constant brooding gave me, like some of the other reviewers, the impression that the script was leading up to a romantic relationship between the two protagonists. Either these elements should have been eliminated in favor for more typical demonstrations of friendship, or the ending should have fulfilled this expectation. Ironically, the original Harry Potter books have plenty of great depictions of male friendship that doesn't leave the reader confused about whether the two characters are romantically interested in each other or not. END SPOILER.<br/><br/>Overall, this script is basically rather-flawed fanfiction that bears only a distant resemblance to the Harry Potter series. It is nice nostalgia, and I don't regret the couple of hours I spent reading it, but frankly... I did feel cheated given the price I paid and the quality of what I got.
 Let me start by saying that It is definitely not fair to review a play as if it were a book.<br/>Having said that, I am a huge HP fan and I did not feel as if some of the personalities or storyline assigned to our heroes were credible for me... however some were kind of fun to consider.  I do not want to spoil your read, so I will not go into details of why.<br/>I did enjoy the quick read and I am willing to go to the theater for the play which I believe will give me another perspective into the story.
 I was so excited to get the book! Unfortunately my expectations did not meat reality. Upon closer inspection JK Rowing is listed as just one of the 3 authors. With reading the book this fact is apparent. All previous books are grabbing and one could hardly put them down. With this one there is no new story, just repetitions of ideas of previous books. I wonder if JK Roling wrote any of it.<br/>I could read the book only half way and this comes from an avid Harry Potter fan.
 I got this book a long time ago and it took me a while to read because it was written like a play. Once I got over the annoyance of reading it like that, I started to enjoy it. The First 30% was ok. Then it starts to become sillier and sillier.<br/>But it also got me curious about the play: there are constant changes in scenario, including scenes in a lake, in a stadium and other complex scenes. How did they do that in a play?<br/>I'd never consider this as the 8th book tough.
 As a 14-year Harry Potter fan, the whole Harry Potter story is part of my life. I think of the magic world for 14 years and want badly to be a witch living in that world. I cannot imagine how much joy and happiness I would lose without reading the books. Like every HP fan, I appreciate all of Rowling's works...<br/><br/>But, except for this one. I can hardly believe it is a Rowling's book at all. The plot is problematic and vulnerable. You can easily tell it's not Rowling's way of telling stories. I kinda like the first scene, but the followings are just absurd!<br/><br/>For those who haven't bought the book, you can definitely buy and read it but don't expect this is the real eighth Harry Potter book.<br/><br/>For me, the Harry Potter series ends up with the Deathly Hallows already.
 I'm a Harry Potter super-fan.  I have ALL the books, movies, books-on CD's, all the additional books (Beetle the Bard, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, and 10-12 more). I've seen all the movies and have the music CD's, Harry's wand and other collector items. I have a robe, a Gryffindor throw and sweater, etc., etc.  I can't get into this script.  I got the thing when it came out, and haven't been able to read past Act One, Scene 10.  It has totally disappointed me.  I'd like a J.K. Rowling novel written by her as the others have been.
 You can tell this book wasn't written exclusively by J. K. Rowling as the rest of them were. Seemed like a fan fiction novel I got halfway through and called it quits I was very disappointed and I love the the others and even the movies.  I will definitely see the play when it comes the town though.
 I read a review that said this sounded like poorly written Harry Potter fan fiction, and I agree. The physical book was in good condition, although I did find a small stain on one of the pages. The content of it, I wasn't impressed. I liked it because it was a continuation of the Harry Potter books, which are fabulous and amazing writing. This was just okay. Some surprises here and there, but it was just not J.K. standard.
 I expected more from this book, but of course, this was not J.K Rowling writing it. The writing format did not bother me as much as the writing style. I am just surprised how J.K. Rowling was not bothered by the role played by the original characters in this story. Although Harry is older, it should have some of the characteristics of his youth, but I felt like he was a completely different person.
 Compared to the other 7 books, it's a key down. The writing is not as good. More childish. And sometimes you just feel like a character just would not say something written here. If you know well. But, being a die hard fan, I had to read it. Go on with low expectations, and you might enjoy it.
 Sigh. I am an avid reader and a huge fan of Harry Potter. J.K Rawlings's well thought out original series is one of my favorites. This composition was just bad. Of all the rich possibilities to consider, to use a cliche plot device and rehash the old storyline was just disappointing. In fact, it was ridiculous to think that you-know-who would have a child. It comes off as a poorly written play designed purely to cash in on the Harry Potter legacy. Read it if you want, but be prepared to be disappointed.
 While it is great to revisit old characters that we loved from the prior series, don't be expecting a novel with all its narration and backstories.  It is a play, mostly dialog.  The rest of the descriptions are up to what you can remember from the original stories.  Some of the character decisions seem to be cringe worthy.  However if you put aside the above and want to know more about what happens in the Harry Potter universe, you will enjoy it, and in my mind it finishes the redemption of one character from the novels.
 My name is Shannon and I am 9 years old.  I am a Harry Potter fan and have read all the books and The Tales of the Bettle Bard. This book was pretty good.  I liked it as much as the original series, except I did not like the play format.  I would have preferred it be a novel, but I liked the story.  The story is so good!  I agree that HP did some things that seemed out of character, but obviously he would be different as an adult than he was at 17.  I absolutely loved the character Scorpius!  He is smart and funny and helped them in a lot of situations.  All in all, I recommend Cursed Child to other HP fans.
 I would have given this book a five because JK Rowling reads do not deserve less. However, it gets a four because I miss the detail that  JKRowling novels create for my vivid imagination. A great read usually stops me from watching "any movie" because my imagination is typically greater than any portrayal. Because this book is written for a 'play' it falls short for creating images. The play may get a five star rating, but I'm unsure because the script is somewhat vague as to scenes, settings and intended portrayal.
 This book was a disappointment at best.  Rowling should have written it herself and NOT in script format.  I read it as any true Potter fan would, but can honestly say it was a waste of time and money.
 As a life long Potter fan (I read the first book when it came out and have been hooked ever since), I was greatly disappointed in this story. I have read the whole series at least 10 times and watched all the movies countless times too. I liked the idea of writing it as a screenplay to carry the characters to the live stage instead of a new movie series, but it didn't sound like JK Rowling's voice at all and Harry wasn't Harry. It was too reminiscent of the teenage angst from Order of the Phoenix (book 5) and that was really just annoying more than anything
 While it was clear this wasn't JK Rowling's work (she just has a way with words...), it was wonderful and comforting to revisit these beloved characters. The story was clever and well-written, and I was able to clearly visualize everything. I read it in one sitting, so it definitely had me engrossed (and it was an easy read). I know others have complained about the play format, but I knew when I ordered it that it was a script, not a novel. If you are a big Harry Potter fan, I recommend at least giving it a shot. I think you'll enjoy it.
 J.K. Rowling's name is on the book but the quality of the writing differs from her previous works which makes me question -- why?  Granted, this is the script for the play which would naturally differ.  I've read the Harry Potter series and liked the earliest ones best.  To compare those to this is like comparing apples to raisins.  Both good but very different.  However, this will be the last one I buy.  My husband, who was a local actor in his youth, was a huge Potter fan.  He enjoyed it more than I did and he thought it was okay.  Quick read.  Pretty artwork on cover.
 I wasn't sure if the format was going to be a problem. I missed the prose. It made me use my imagination more, but I got used to it. My main problems were the dialogue and characterization of certain characters, especially Ron. I hope JK Rowling rewrites it someday.
 I was happy about getting to return to the wonderful world of Harry Potter. Unfortunately the story that was told was pretty terrible and extremely predictable. The only thing I liked about this story was Scorpius.
 I thought the story was good. But I agree with a previous reviewer. The characters and the background was flat. There just wasn't enough substance to bring it all to life like the books are known for. I didn't care for the screen play writing. I liked how they continued the story but felt like it needed much more substance.
 This is truly the bastard child of the original series and it reads like bad fanfiction. I'm really disappointed, honestly. If you simply MUST read this, buy a used copy and spend as little as possible because it is definitely not worth the twenty dollars being asked.
 Was JK Rowling so hard up for money that she needed yo write another Harry Potter book? And why did she have to write it in the form of a play? Could it have been a great book? Yes if JK Rowling would have written it like the other 7books. I love harry potter. I still read them. But this book is a disappointment!
 If you are a Harry Potter fan, don't read this book. I've discussed this book/play with my friends that are HP fans and we all agree that this is a major letdown. I can't see any of the characters acting this way, Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, etc. Even Harry's son Albus is a jerk. The only character I liked was Scorpius, Draco's son. It just doesn't fit with the 7 other books. Ginny lost her fire, Harry is an a**, Hermione is just not that stupid. The concept of the cursed child may have been JK's but the writing certainly was not. I could go on, trust me, but I won't. So sad
 If you are a true Harry Potter fan, don’t bother reading this garbage. It is just very ill conceived fan fiction. It is full of grotesque continuity errors and butchers everything about the characters. It really ruins the story and is absolutely not canon, regardless what anyone says. It’s crap.
 But it felt rather juvenile.  I think it might be more interesting in person, on a stage.  Obviously it is mainly dialog with stage directions.  Fleshed out as a novel, it could be a better story.  But I still think maybe more juvenile than even the first HP book.  I realize they started out as children's or young adult books but by book four in the HP series definitely more dark and adult.<br/><br/>Love anything Harry Potter though and can't wait for Beasts movie this fall.
 This play wins many nostalgia points, but otherwise falls short of expectations. The storyline feels silly and pointless and the "twist" is neither shocking nor surprising. It also lacks that certain something in the narrative that J.K. Always brought to the books that leads me to believe that her involvement was less than they let on - and I don't think this is only attributable to the fact hat it's a play and not a novel. However, the emotional story between father Harry and son Albus feels genuine. It's worth a read, but I would say it hardly felt like the "eigth installment" in the HP series.
 Since I've been highly involved with theater my whole life, I had zero problems with the fact this was a script, I'm used to reading them. However, this is not Harry Potter. It's sad...and is a complete miss of what the story should have been. I truly wonder how involved JK Rowling was in the writing of this script, because if her name weren't on the front cover I'd say she wasn't involved at all. The characters are just wrong. Original characters personalities are a miss, new characters are inconsequential, overall, I wish I had just left Harry Potter be done, and hadn't bothered reading this. If you are on the fence at all about whether to read this book, just leave it be. Allow the memory of Harry Potter to remain unblemished.
 I thought it was hugely chancy and creative for J. K. Rowling to write about middle-aged Harry Potter and in the form of a script for a play, no less!  While I am a fan of the original Harry Potter stories and would have given every one of them a 5-star rating, I had no such expectation for "The Cursed Child."  When I read it, I was pleasantly surprised.  It has many of of the intricacies of plot twists, the creative wizardly content, and elements of real mystery that the original Potter stories contained.
 It was fun to get back into Harry Potter.  Reminders of the original story come up all the time.  Yet the plot and the characters seem to be forced into an uncomfortable role.  Harry a bad dad?  It is a quick, fun read, so plunge in.  It won't leave the same warmth in your heart that the original did. But it is with the time to read it.
 I just got the book - I have been on pins and needles waiting for months to get my hands on this book only to be let down. With every release of HP I typically call in sick to work and read the book cover to cover.  However, the book is written in a play format which is horrible for reading. I understand that the play recently released, but why do you have to put the readers to this format - it's very distracting to stay on track with what's going on. I'm sure for those people who are used to reading plays this is ok, but I don't care for this at all and I can't read this book fast and have to keep going back to see who is talking. Please do not do this with your next book installment (if there will be a book 9).  I can't believe that you took away my favorite reading pleasure - totally disappointed!
 I can see how this could look spectacular on stage. And I'm sure the actors make it really enjoyable. But the plot...as canon is horrible. The characters didn't seem like the original characters. There were major plot holes that didn't just affect this book, but the previous series. I'm sad that this is officially sanctioned by JK.
 Eh. That's mainly what I have to say about this book. I'm obsessed with Harry Potter. That being said, I couldn't wait to get my hands on this book or play (whatever you wanna call it) I pre-ordered it and received it about two days after the release date. I was slightly annoyed but it was expected. I finished it in one day and boy did I have a lot of feelings about it. I won't ruin it but I will say that I basically read it as a poorly written fanfic. It felt NOTHING like reading the original books.I was prepared for reading it like a script, I didn't care about that. I just didn't feel the magic that I still feel when re-reading the original series. I'm talking about the feeling you get when Rowling describe the great hall and I feel like I'm there. There were also some unexpected character uhm shall we say developments? Those were interesting... Overall, it wasn't a terrible read, it just didn't live up to my expectations. And some things I just had a hard time picturing *cough* trolley witch? Delphi? wtf *cough* OKAY IM DONE HERES TO HOPING FANTASTIC BEASTS WILL BE FABULOUS. Cheers.
 Personally, I felt that this was an awful story. It felt contrived and missing all of the "magic" that made the other books an absolute joy to read. The stage direction format of the book definitely gives it a different feel, but that is not my big issue. The new characters seem paper thin. There are deep, fundamental flaws in how some of the literary devices play out in this book as well. All in all a terrible addition to the harry potter family and entirely skippable. Please J.K., no more of this.
 I've blocked most of it out, but this book is a poor excuse for canon Harry Potter. I was so eager for this to arrive, but from start to finish I was shaking my head and rereading bits to make sure I had comprehended them correctly. Many people say that the book version doesn't do the story justice, but I am not in the position to see the live play. My advice, write it off as really bad fanfiction and move forward with your life.
 I was so disappointed to find this script for a play written by John Tiffany &amp; Jack Thorne. It reads like fan fiction. Not the story I was expecting! So, if you don't mind a script written by someone else (fan fiction), then go for it. The story is not boring. Rather, it's like going to a dinner date where you're expecting another meal from your favorite celebrity chef at your favorite fine restaurant, only to find it's a knock-off restaurant with an unknown chef who bases your meal on the style of your fave.  ....]
 Don't buy this, rent it from the library.  I was disappointed in how much the characters personalities changed in this compared to what they were in the original series.
 Rowling did not write this book, yet her name is larger than the author's. This is false advertising! This is nowhere like the originals, but a playright.
 (Spoiler alert)<br/><br/>It was enjoyable to read a new chapter in the world of Harry Potter. For that, i am grateful. This story, however, has two primary plot holes that made the character motivations feelvunrealistic.<br/><br/>1) Why was Albus so focused on saving Cedrick Diggory? This was the entire premise of the book, and it just felt like a reach to me that someone who he'd never met could motivate him so much to jump off a train, flee campus, and go back in time.  Perhaps if it were rewritten there could have been a stronger motivation from Scorpius? I didn't buy Albus's, though.<br/><br/>2) Once they returned, after rectifying the past, why did Scorpius lie about having the timeturner to the older wizards? It seemed to me like they had learned their lesson after returning. For Scorpius to "take matters into his own hands," it just feels out of character for "timid Scorpius" and overall it is at odds with what it seems they've learned from the first half of the book when they went back in time.<br/><br/>The two above details are incredibly important because they motivate progression in the book, so for me not to believe them, i couldn't buy into the rest of the book.<br/><br/>Again, it was enjoyable to re-experience the characters, but otherwise this did not live up to the Harry Potter name.
 As a fan of the Harry Potter series I find it difficult to believe that this was written by the same author.  The book is written in the format of a play, which is extremely distracting.  Instead of something like "there was a boom in the distance", the book read as "offstage a boom could be heard".  VERY distracting.  The characters are not endearing, and Harry seems like a completely different person.  All in all, wish I had waited until this was free in the library instead of purchasing.  NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL.
 As a Harry Potter fan, i felt that i needed to read this. It wasnt bad but not as good as  the first series. Keep in mind with this book that Harry and his friends are in new roles and face very realistic troubles that come with adulthood, such as parenting and focusing on a career. But i did enjoy some unexpected turns, heartfelt moments, and connections to the previous story.
 What a disappointment.  None of the characters we have all come to love so much had any personality at all.  In this Harry and Ginny are both total wimps.  Ron &amp; Hermione act idiots and Dumbledore's character was completely ruined.<br/><br/>I forced myself to finish it, hoping that somehow this would get better......it didn't.<br/><br/>I was so looking forward to a new Harry Potter story.  I wish this one had never come into being.  None of the Harry Potter "magic" was to be found in this book....it was awful
 I understand that this is a play and the plot is interesting. That being said the characters don't act/speak or behave as the characters in the book. The intricacies of JK Rowling's writing and character development are totally lost--the magic that is Harry Potter is lost. Parts just seem thrown together, adding spells,characters,and trivia from the books as novelties. A great idea that was lost in translation.
 I enjoyed the story overall. Although I realize it's a screenplay, I did not feel the connection with the characters, especially Albus, Scorpius and Delphi. The climax at the end was underwhelming but since I am such a Harry Potter fan my expectations were very high and it read so quickly it was difficult to connect. I would still recommend this book as I did enjoy the creativeness of taking peeks back in time to meet some of the older characters and adding flavor to the original stories by bringing texture to the original characters.
 I got this last night at midnight and finished it around 4 pm on July 31st! All in all, it was definitely entertaining BUT as it is a script and as it is NOT written by JK Rowling, it is not the Harry Potter we know and love.<br/><br/>I won't get into the details of the plot, but I will say that the storyline was entertaining and it was interesting to see a glimpse into how things may have gone if Voldemort had triumphed. Unfortunately you can't really savor any part of the story for long because it was written without any of the frills and beautiful description from JK Rowling.<br/><br/>Now before you criticize me, I GET that it was a play and that you can really only write what can be seen on stage, but with the previous 7 novels setting the bar so high, this was fairly disappointing in comparison. Some of the other reviews are pretty accurate in saying it reads like a polished fan fiction.<br/><br/>All criticism aside, the story was fun and because it was a script, it was a very quick read. Overall, it was exciting to go to a midnight release party for an HP book again!! Nostalgia!
 Story seems too outlandish to be canon and the writing is mediocre. Protip: you don't have to say a person's name every time you address them.<br/>Ron: Hey Hermione, would you like to go to dinner?<br/>Hermione: Why yes Ron, I very much would.<br/>Ron: That's great Hermione! How's McDonalds sound?<br/>Hermione: Ron, you're so silly!<br/><br/>(Obviously not really from the book, but you get my point).
 My daughter is extremely disappointed with this rendition of the "Harry Potter" series.  The hype and excitement burst like a balloon . .  readers would be better off checking this book out from a public library. Not worth any space on her book shelf.
 While it's not the perfect ending I would want for the Harry Potter series, it definitely does give a good closer to the story. People give this book/play a very harsh reviews, probably because they have high expectations for the series that was a big part of their childhood. I would recommend giving this a read if you are a Harry Potter fan in need of more to read about Harry and his world. I enjoyed the story and couldn't put it down for the 4 hours it took me to read.
 Disappointing.  Lacks the depth of character of the other books.  Super fast read.  Like 1.5 hours.  It looks like a weighty book, but it's really not.  The characters are all over the place and lacking explanation as to why they're like that.
 It was a very quick read and I guess I didn't realize before that this was the play - reading of a play is a little more jerky because of all the stage direction so that through me a bit in the beginning. I really enjoyed Rowling's Harry Potter series for how she pulled you through each book so smoothly. With stage direction, you had less control over your own imagination and the read was a much more bumpy ride. Still - a great concept and I would have really loved a full length novel with the same plot.
 I wasn't quite sure what to expect from a play before reading this. But as a die hard HP fan, I had to read this no matter what. I'm so glad I decided to read it but I'm so disappointed that Rowling let this piece of garbage be a Harry Potter book. The plot was weak. Characters weren't built properly. I'm not so sure when it began and when it ended. Everything seemed to move so fast. Unlike the other HP books, this lacked any and every detail possible.<br/>To any Potter fans out there, read this if you must. But don't keep your hopes too high.
 I think that seeing the play would be a fun experience, and I was super excited to read the script book when I got it for my Kindle. I definitely had a fun experience reading it, but a month or so on it doesn't sit with me as being a true "Eighth HP Story." First off, it re-uses a lot of story and scenes from previous HP novels as time-travel is a central theme of this story. The characters from the original series seem a bit off in some places - especially Harry himself. Oddly enough, my favorite character was a new one - Scorpius Malfoy - he's hilarious and all-around entertaining!<br/><br/>If you're an HP fanatic like me who's read the books many times, you'll have to read this - but just understand that it's not a novel - and they even take minor liberties with certain dialogue that was in the existing series. 3.5 stars would be my rating if they'd let me do half-stars.
 If the first three acts drag a little, persevere, because the last act is worth the wait. I have seen criticisms of CC because it uses some tried and true fan fiction themes (it does), and because some of the new characters are a bit under-developed. But Act Four contains some excellent, dramatic scenes, especially between Harry and Ginny, whom JKR has rehabilitated in this work, rescuing her from the forest of obscurity she dwelt in in the seven books.
 Not very well-written and comes off as "fan-fiction" Few if any of J K Rowling's characters "feel" right, and overall the story just seems very unlikely plot-wise (and unworthy) as a true sequel to her wonderful 7-book series.<br/><br/>I found it altogether a disappointing read.<br/><br/>If a sequel is ever written, Jo needs to do it herself. Tiffany and Thorne come off as amateurs.
 I read this because it had J.K. Rowling's "blessing".  I gave it two stars because it held my interest enough to finish, and I didn't throw the script across the room in frustration.  It doesn't feel like the overall story or any part was written by J.K. Rowling and just reads like a tribute story.  None of her nuance or personal flavor.  It's like all the parts of the wizarding world you didn't want to know..."Grown up jobs are hard and full of paperwork even if they're with the Ministry of Magic", "Teenagers are moody and feel misunderstood" (like we didn't get THAT from Order of the Phoenix), "Being a parent is hard".  Snore.  I won't be re-reading and I'll definitely lend this book out so no one else will have to buy it if they feel the same way I do.
 I realize it was a screen play but more character depth was needed. If this every gets made into a movie a lot more is going to have to be written. It was very easy to figure out what was happening next. Overall if your a Potter fan you definitely need to read it! Not sorry I did.
 Let me start out by saying that I'm a HUGE fan of everything Harry Potter and I was terribly excited when I found out J.K. Rowling herself was working on a HP play.  However, after getting the script for it and reading it in under two days I was a bit disappointed.  J.K. Rowling thoroughly contradicts herself with the way she has written the majority of her characters, especially Draco Malfoy who she originally said would never get along with Harry and the gang, but in the play she even goes as far as mentioning that Harry and Draco see each other as friends for the first time.  I love Draco, and I'm glad that he finally gets redemption, but it's weak, rushed, and he's out of character for most of the play.  Other than a lot of the characters being very different from their original selves, the play is completely unoriginal and all over the place.  It seems as if J.K. Rowling, John Tiffany, and Jack Thorne took popular elements from Harry Potter fanfictions and stuffed them all into the play.  In fact, even minor elements seemed to be based off of fan's headcannons rather than original ideas from J.K. herself (I'd give examples, but I don't want to spoil the story for anyone who still wants to read it).  If you're a die-hard Harry Potter fan, like myself, I'd still recommend reading it as it is considered cannon, but I know many other fans, including myself, who are refusing to recognize certain aspects as true cannon.
 When a new Harry Potter book appeared I jumped on it.  Set somewhat in the future as Albus is leaving for his first year at Hogwarts.  On the train he meets Scorpius Malfoy.  Despite the past difference of their fathers, they hit it off  During their first year at Hogwarts, they come into possession of a Time Turner and decide to correct an error in the past.<br/>This is the print version of the stage play.  Consequently it moves mores fast and the characters and plot aren't fully developed.
 Due to the book being written as a play, the development of characters was weak, and the description of the situation was poor.  Since the story went back in time to a previous storyline in a Harry Potter book, there is a stark contrast in depth of detail.  I'm sure as a play, the scenery, the props, the animation of the characters would help to bring this story alive.  But in it's written form as a play, it left the reader wanting.  As with most time travel storylines, it had some major flaws which can not be resolved.
 I Have always loved the Harry Potter books, but was so disappointed in this one.  I didn't know when I bought it that it was written like a play, which made it really hard to get into the story. It also didn't sound like it was written by JK Rowling, which put me off. I couldn't finish more than 10 pages because I was just so disgusted.  Really wish I could get my money back.
 To put it bluntly, I wish this book did not exist. The language, prose, style, etc. was all completely inconsistent with the rest of J.K. Rowling's books. I agree with other commenters who speculate that her involvement in the writing of this play was very small. It left me with an uneasy feeling that I had read a bad bit of fan fiction rather than a substantial addition to the HP Universe.
 this is an insult to the world of Harry Potter. I've been a huge fan of the series since the release of the first movie. Which inspired my 7 year old self to love reading. Once you get past the fact that we're getting a "new" story, and that its harry... please... sit down, and think about how out of freaking character everyone is. I wish I hadn't gotten the Kindle edition. I hate it so much I wish I could return it, and get my money back. The fact that JKR even put her name on this is embarrassing.
 I have loved every book in this series and was so very excited for this final piece of the masterful puzzle. I very much enjoyed the characters including the old favorites but also the next generation but this format was just not as fulfilling for me as reading a novel. It felt like it ended abruptly without full satisfaction to the reader. In fairness to J K Rowling this was written to be performed not necessarily to be read. I truly hope I can have the opportunity to see it performed in the near future. However it still felt wonderful to reconnect with those literary friends and reenter into the wonderful wizarding world of the Potter universe!
 This finale is a bit disappointing because of it's format and the limitations of its length.  Lot's of places where the reader, or at least I thought " no one would ever do/think/act like that...but because I was fond of the characters, I enjoyed this and didn't find it a waste of time.  Overall a a good experience.  As I was reading this, I kept imagining how it would be staged - and I suspect it would be great fun.  Will look forward to this coming to a "theater near me."
 The concept of Harry's son struggling with his Dad's reputation is incredibly fascinating to me. Execution wise, it definitely missed the mark. The characters we fell in love with were not here and the storyline really struggled. Everything we loved about the books (all the details, side storylines, really interesting supporting characters, multi dimensional characters) were missing here. A large part of that is a casualty of the play format. I preordered and finished this book within 24 hours of receiving it and felt really disappointed. I felt like the magic of the books was missing.
 My wife and I bought this because we're HP fans and...cmon, you gotta do it. We'd heard mixed reviews on it, but we still had to see for ourselves. We both liked it, though. A lot of people knocked it because it's in play format, which can be a bit jarring to read if you're not used to it or mentally prepared. It's definitely a different read than the original series. But it was still an entertaining read, and we'd both recommend it to any HP fan.
 This review pains me beyond belief. I am a huge fan of Harry Potter. I've read all of the books 3 times and always on the same day they were released...<br/>The plot in the book is thin, and the characters are completely unrecognizable. Harry disgustingly rude to Prof. McGonnagal? Ron --barely present-- is an idiot, not the smart, funny and supporting friend he was. And why is he running a joke shop? that was his brother's, he was an Auror...<br/>I will proceed to confound myself with a memory charm and pretend this didn't exist.<br/>There's no way on earth J.K Rowling contributed in any way here... at all.<br/>Whether you are a fan of the real Potter books or not, don't read this. Not good at all.A HUGE disappointment.
 As a fan, this book was a little disappointing. As a person who was trying to remain objective and unbiased, this book was exactly as promised. I had a hard time hearing the characters I fell in love with so long ago until the final 50 or so pages of the book. It was a little predictable at times, but it also brought the world full circle. I was more satisfied with the ending of Cursed Child than the epilogue of Deathly Hallows.
 Just no.<br/>I'm sad to say I couldn't finish it because it lost my interest.
 Fun and fast read.  I found this to be a fun story, however less believable at times than Rowling's first 7 books. This is probably due to the fact that there is much less detail in a script when compared to the original books. As a play I can see where they can fill in those details with talented acting and set props to make it very entertaining. This book reminds me more of an outline for a full story. I was hoping for more details about their lives over the past 19 years but not much was offered. Instead it really built upon the friendship of albus and scorpius and their complicated relationships with their fathers.  Overall a fun read and just enough of a peak into the current life of Harry Potter to satisfy curiosity. Would definitely recommend to harry potter fans. As for those who haven't read the books yet (maybe you have been hiding under a rock for the last 15 years) they are definitely worth reading before diving into this one because absolutely nothing will make sense to you if you have not read the books.
 I did not like this book (play) at all. It was very poorly written. The characters were mere shells with no depth or believability. It was terrible.
 I am a die hard harry potter fan and with a blatant excitement, I got the book as soon as it became available (no pre-order though, should I lose my fan membership?) I usually don't read plays and it took me some time to adjust to the format. I enjoyed the story and the focus on the father-son relationship. It feels familiar and comfortable to get ahold of the current wizardry world affairs, almost as if I had been following them the entire time after the last book. Now I need to see the play, hey producers, please come to NYC!
 I fun dive back into the world of Harry Potter, however, the playbook format may be off-putting to some readers, and it really does read like fan fiction. It relies heavily on book four of Harry Potter, and honestly Harry as an adult is not a whole lot better than Harry in Order of the Phoenix. That being said, I enjoyed Scopio's character (he was more interesting than Albus), and I did like seeing the gang back together. Long story short: Fun jaunt into nostalgia, but sort of misses its potential. Still enjoyed it and recommend it to fans.
 To explain my review....I give it 4 stars because it doesn't "feel" like J.K.Rowling. Having said that - I like it better than her usual writing. I only give it 4 stars because if you're reading it hoping to get the Harry Potter/J.K.Rowling feeling again.....I don't think you will get that. However - If you're reading it to read a really well-written, interesting story about a world you care deeply for......you will get that. I absolutely loved it! There was a more grown-up, philosophical feeling to this book than there was to the HP books, which I liked better than the HP books, but that's because that kind of thing really appeals to me. But whether I'm right or not, you should read the book. It's great!
 I was disappointed with this one, sorry JK Rowlings. I loved all Harry Potter books, but this one fell short. I guess because of the (PLAY) format it is written in. At first it was hard to read it like a script, but one gets used to it eventually. I wish the author would write about the period in between where Harry leaves Hogwarts and this play. There are a lot of gaps. Please bring back the original format and you have my attention again!
 The story was great and its message profound, yet it was written as a dialogue for use in theater, so I missed the great images that JK Rowling created through her prose. Even though the story is good, the absence of any information about the scene or background thoughts of the characters made it seem "plain". If you are a reader that focuses totally on dialogue in the story, you may be happy with this book.  For me, it was a shadow of the former books, but I award points to the writers for the story, though NO HOUSE CUP!
 5 stars for fulfillment of the preorder.<br/><br/>Honestly, I can't imagine why JK Rowling put her stamp of approval on this.<br/><br/>I agree with every 1-star review and don't need to rehash the details from the ones I read. The characters WERE horrible; the story WAS ridiculous. But what put it over the edge for me...<br/><br/>SPOILER...<br/><br/>Snape is told Harry named his kid after him and he shows warm &amp; fuzzies over it?!?!?! No!!! GTHOH with that!
 SPOILER FREE<br/><br/>With 9 years, millions of works of fan fiction, a world of fan theories and wild shippings, since The Deathly Hallows, The Cursed Child is stepping into dangerous waters to call itself canon.<br/><br/>So does it float?<br/><br/>First, I really wish I could see the play – there’s so much in how a good actor can bring something to life that the page can’t capture, unless the playwright has the sparkling wit of Oscar Wilde. And unfortunately, Thorne doesn’t. While a few characters do shine on the page, many feel off.<br/>As a “canon” sequel, this play could have taken the Harry Potter story, for better or worse, in some new direction. Instead, it chooses to play it safe and function as a curtain call of old favorites rather than exploring new ground.<br/><br/>That’s both a positive and a negative. The story as a story suffers for it, but those same choices also serve to insulate the Harry Potter the world grew up with from any changes or damage a sequel could do. So while it doesn’t add anything new or wonderful to the story, it also doesn’t really detract from the original either. It just is.<br/><br/>But is it worthwhile?<br/><br/>The best parts of the story are with the characters who are wholly new to the story – or at least one in particular. He’s a bright point of dry humor and a bucket of cold water on the obligatory-angst-filled pity parties many of the other characters indulge in.<br/><br/>And then there are the cameos. And depending on who your favorite witches or wizards were, you may more or less enjoy them. One had me as excited as possible, and it was handled really, really well. (That means me literally dancing around my kitchen with my Kindle.) There are the inside jokes – though there could have been more – and the intentional? unintentional? references to famous works of fan fiction.<br/><br/>There were the obligatory deus ex machina moments, some heavy handed character growth dialogue (what can you do with the short space of a play?) There were also some meaningful conversations about growing up.<br/><br/>All the same, I wish they would have marketed it as a “one off” rather than a “eighth story.” I know, I know, people wouldn’t have bought it otherwise, but still. It made the moments of incongruity more jarring and annoying than they would have been otherwise. Because, with or without JKR’s input, yes, there are moments in the play where real, important details from the books are either glossed over, shrugged at or ignored. Not little side things. Things that are key to the play’s conclusion and are a big deal in the books. The kind of things that render this play *not* canon, no matter what they say.<br/><br/>So my conclusion? It was fun. I’m glad I read it. But if you please, I’ll be the judge of what I care to consider “real” and those things I’ll shrug off as fan fiction. Because, quite honestly, that’s mostly what this is.<br/><br/>I’ll take Scorpius though. Scorpius makes this worth reading. I’ll very gladly add his character to canon.<br/><br/>******A final note: *don’t* read the HP books before reading this. Start with this, and let this play launch you back into the much superior world of the books. This would be a lame note to end on after all that. In fact, I think that’s what I’m going to go read next……
 It doesn't feel right at all. We know these characters and Rowling's writing so well, so a lousy attempt won't work. You can't just name drop, and expect us to be happy. Now, there were just a couple of good things. The plot is the main issue. This may actually be pretty cool to see on stage though. It doesn't take long to read, so check it out. However, I am disappointed.
 It was a disappointment. I mean, how do you explain someone who didn't grow up with parents becoming such a crappy parent? It would have made more sense that since he didnt have parents he would be more involved and more loving towards his children....also, what happened to the assertive, strong Ginnie? srsly? its like they took my favorite characters and created crappy fan fiction. I wish I could have that time spent reading back.....
 I have no issue with this in play format.  I am used to reading plays with stage directions and cues.  But the overall work reads like poorly written fan fiction.  I have read every Harry Potter book numerous times (including the smaller works), listened to the stories 1-7 on audio files, and even watched the movies ones or twice each.  This work does not measure up to the previous works.  Maybe it would have been enjoyable seen acted on stage.
 I was expecting a novel like the other Harry Potter books and this just isn't what I received. It is more of a reading of what the play was that was performed in the UK. I am sure it is a 5 start copy of what it is, it just wasn't what I thought I was buying. I am keeping it and, who knows, I may learn to love it for what it is someday whey I read it again.
 Being reunited with Harry Potter and the gang in script form is tricky business. The storyline holds to Rowling's twisty standards, but the format does not allow for her rich descriptions, which are so much of her writing charm. The tale is solid, but it is a quick read, which for many HP fans will not be enough. I loved reading the tale in script format, as my imagination could fill in the blanks, but I long for more Harry and friends and am sad that I have already finished it. I can imagine that the play is quite entertaining.
 This book is written as a play which is an adjustment when you're used to reading traditional books.  It takes some time to get into this style of writing.  I LOVED all the original Harry Potter books, but this one didn't quite live up to the same standard.  Don't get me wrong, it's still worth a read if you're a Harry Potter fan, but it just wasn't AS good as the original series.  This book started slow and improved greatly toward the end.
 I will start by saying yes I know this is a screen play and I know it wasn't written by J.K. but I really wish this was "j/k" as in "just kidding". By giving her stamp of approval she was basically writing them a check. There is so much wrong with this story that I can't see how it would play out any better than what I read. It was horrible. The characters were out of character, the plot was not plausible, the timing was terrible. But even if I'd read a review like the one I'm writing I probably would have still read the story. I wouldn't be able to help myself because I love Harry Potter. The title of this play had such promise. The Cursed Child. How can you mess that up? The story almost writes itself. One question, what's the deal with the word "learnt"? Is that a British thing? Oh well. Good for them I suppose. Maybe I'll write a play. Harry Potter and the Half Eaten Sandwich. Harry and Ron open their own detective agency and try to fight muggle crime. If you want to save yourself a few bucks just search online for spoilers and you may even find the summary slightly less disappointing.
 I do not follow or read fan fiction, so I do not know how this compares. I understand that this reads like fan fiction. For me I was very happy to be re-inserted into that wonderful world again after so many years, so I was able to look past the poor dialogue and somewhat predictable character development. If you have a high standard of fan fiction then you may not be impressed. I look forward to watching the stage version, because that is guaranteed to be even better.
 Very disappointing. I knew when I purchased this book that it wouldn't be a normal Harry Potter novel, yet I was unpleasantly surprised that none of the characters even remained true to themselves.<br/>  Harry Potter, the boy who grew up with no family and whose hearts deepest desire was to have a family, suddenly becomes the kind of father who tells their child that he wished he weren't his son?<br/>  Not to mention Hermione's (top student in her class every year of school) success in life now dependso on wether she and Ron end up dating? No. Just no.<br/>  There are so many things wrong with the essentials in this story that it leads me to believe J.K. Rowling had zero part in writing this.
 I was very excited for this re-entry into the magical world of Harry Potter, unfortunately the tone of the writing just did not feel like JK at all.  I'm wondering if she really contributed story line at all in the script, or if she was just sent copies and said I don't hate it.  I'm hoping that JK's next foray into Hogwarts and the Magical world get to harken back more to the original series, or at least maintain JK's tone of writing.
 I've been a total, uter fan of Harry Potter ever since I read book once. I read every book eight times or more each book. I've watched every movie more than three times. I'm still obsessed with Harry Potter. However, this story felt nothing close to what we've been accostumed to. Every part, every plot point, felt forced, struggling with the common sense of reality. Most things happen by the hand of randomness, almost every conflict solves itself by casual chances too. I'm very pissed off Jo let something like this be published. I didn't feel her hand in here. I didn't feel most of the old characters were true to their motives and objectives. Some of them react—too—by randomness. Nevertheless, the conflict between Harry and his kid was touching and moved me. That's the only reason I don't totally hate this book. Besides, I loved the personality of Rose and I totally loved Scorpius. Albus was good too. About the old ones, I couldn't help but totally emphitise with Harry, Draco, Ginny and Hermione—although the last one had thoughts and actions way dumber than young clever Hermione. Ron was so stupid... And Minerva McGonagall, oh my God, they totally destroyed the character and made her very soft.
 As said in the title, I truly loved being in Harry Potter's world again.  I loved getting to know the characters again and the over all flavor.  I do not know much about plays or why this was written as such, but......I felt that an element of their world, the wizarding world, was missing because of that. I cannot help but feel it could have been so much more in novel form.  Alas, I will take what I can get!  So thank you, J.K. Rowling!!!
 I knew just reading a script even with the thorough details of stagecraft, would never be as satisfying as reading it in book form. Guess I need to win a lottery scraper to afford a ticket to the theater. It's a fine plot, great dialogue my imagination helped.  Nevertheless, the script form just doesn't hold up against all the other great Harry Potter books.  Hope J.K. comes up with another book, not another script.  The poor retired like myself get left out with the script form.
 My sister asked me what I thought about this book, and I told her it had me spellbound. It pulled me in so quickly that I read it in one sitting. While it doesn't equate to the in-depth delight of reading the previous 7 books, anyone who likes Harry Potter should read this book.<br/><br/>It's hindered, of course, by it's format. It's a script, and so much of the magic of the novels is missing. Being limited to dialogue and stage direction means that this story, while enchanting, lacks the full bodied delight of the novels. The setting descriptions are very sparse, we don't truly "see" the characters, and without being able to watch the actors on stage, we miss the nuances that would be given to us through introspection and narration.<br/><br/>However, I truly loved this glimpse into the future of our beloved Harry, Ginny, Hermione, and Ron. Seeing them navigate adult responsibilities and parenthood is a lot of fun. And the glimpses of other beloved characters (McGonagall, Draco, etc.) was like finding out that while yes, you did indeed already eat the whole cake, there was still a bit of frosting left over to enjoy.
 Of course nothing could live up to how I feel about the original 7 books, but this was okay. I felt that the story development wasn't really there and it jumped around a lot. I understand that this is a play script and not a book, but I still would've like to see the story be less choppy.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of the Harry Potter Universe, this is still a must read. Lots of interesting story about the post Epilogue world. Just don't expect this to be book 8.
 First of all I must state I'm a HUGE Harry Potter fan, and second I should state I really do not enjoy reading scripts. Those caveats aside this was far from my favorite story, I felt there was not enough depth or participation by some of the historic main characters. I have not seen the play I might be able to understand the flow more if I ever get a chance to see it.
 If you're a real Harry Potter fan hold on tothe gems JKR gave you and leave it at that. This book is a sad attempt to continue the story we love. It's tainted my feelings towards the series as a whole and I hate that. Definitely not worth the money in my opinion
 I'm a huge harry potter fan and was so excited when i heard there will be a new book. i preordered it and was full of excitement when it was delivered. all of that excitement left once i opened the book. i read the first two pages and couldn't get passed the format. from what i hear from people that were able to get passed the format, it's a terrible story. huge disappointment. my dog came into my room and peed on it and i couldn't even be upset
 I love the Harry Potter series but this book was absolutely awful. I think the plot idea was good but the characters were flat. They all talked the same way and there was way too much love and crying.  I cannot imagine how this even got published. Nor can I believe Ms  Rowling would think so little of her fans to allow something this dissappointing to have her name associated with it. She is an excellent writer so I am truly baffled.<br/><br/>Usually I can find positives in any work of literature but this one is a record for me. If you are thinking of buying this book please think before you purchase. It really changed how I look at the Harry Potter series. Since it was by far my favorite I very much wish someone had stopped me before I bought this travesty.
 This book did not have the intenseness I have found in the other Harry Potter books.  Perhaps because it was written in play form, but I don't think the characters were as developed as in the original series.  Perhaps I was expecting too much but I don't think a lot of effort was put into it.  Seems they were expecting it to be a success because of the name.  I enjoyed the book but will probably not reread as I have done the others.  (Probably have reread the series 3-4 times.)
 There are two parts to this book.  The first part, which introduces us to Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy, is quite good.  The complicated relationship each boy has with their fathers, and their father's own rather tense relationships, make the friendship aspects between the two compelling and sweet.  Scorpius' crush on Rose is likewise adorable.  I liked this story about the burden of being the son of a legendary hero - and the son of a legendary villain.<br/><br/>Then halfway through the book, the two wind up jump-starting a time war between Voldemort and Harry Potter.  The various characters wind up having to try and use paradoxes as weapons, causality as a defense, that sort of thing.  I found that to be rather odd, because I generally do not associate Harry Potter with trying to copy from Star Trek Voyager or Star Trek Enterprise (the temporal mechanics for those shows actually works with HPCC).<br/><br/>So yes: interesting characters, bizarre execution.
 Wow, where to begin? This play, much like "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull," nearly destroyed my fond memories of the original. I give this two stars only because it is something new in the Harry Potter universe, but I could have lived without this. I hope the play production is better than the writing.
 So, the script for J.K. Rowling’s play Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, billed as the eighth Potter story, was released on July 31st.  Naturally, I and the world and his dog rushed to pick up a copy.  Here are my thoughts.  I should point out that I have not seen the play, worse luck, and am going from the script alone.  Note that there will be total and complete spoilers, which I will hide after the cut.<br/><br/>First, the non spoilery section. There was a lot I loved about it, and some things that didn’t work nearly so well for me.  I loved that the same themes that pervaded the book series – love, friendship, family, loyalty – still form the core of Cursed Child.  It was wonderful seeing how Harry, Ron and Hermione coped with adult life and parenthood (being an adult myself, it was especially fascinating.). The new characters, Scorpius and Albus and their friendship are completely adorable – Scorpius really does get all the best lines.  And, naturally, it is simply wonderful to revisit the Wizarding World in any shape or form.  Rowling’s world is utterly breathtaking.  I really wish I could see how certain scenes played out on stage.<br/><br/>What I didn’t enjoy so much were certain plot points.  I didn’t feel they gelled too well with what we know about the Wizarding World and the characters in it.  Some character development points I didn’t feel worked too well in a play setting.  They might have worked better for me in novel format with more space to expand and develop them.  Also, while it’s not necessary to have devoured Pottermore, certain interactions do have much more meaning if you are aware of some of the character’s backstories.<br/><br/>All in all I enjoyed Cursed Child and gave it four stars out of five.
 I can't believe J.K. Rowling had anything to do with this other than lending her name.  And she should be ashamed about  doing that.  This is not a HARRY POTTER BOOK OR A HARRY POTTER SCRIPT.  It's awful. I have read and reread all the books.  What a letdown this is.  I can read scripts very well having been employed in film and tv for many years.  That isn't the problem.  The problem is that it is silly and awfully written.  If you loved Harry Potter keep that in your memory.  Do not bother with this script.
 I didn't read the book. I bought it for my elementary age kids. They love Harry Potter so I thought they'd like this new book. NOT SO! It's written as a play so it's confusing to them. I'm not even sure they finished the book. Wish I had waited and just borrowed it from the library.
 Back into the medical world of Harry Potter.<br/><br/>  The twists and turns keep you guessing along the way.  Who would have thought the day Draco and our beloved Harry would find ac cause to get behind, together!<br/>  A very quick read...I finished in just a few hours while doing other things about the house as well .<br/>As a Theater arts  major reading a script is far from New for me, for some it may be a bit awkward if they are not used to it.
 I wanted to like Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.  However, it just didn't hit my needs for another Harry Potter story. First of all the way the story was written as a script made the story tedious to read. I just couldn't get absorbed in the story like I could have if it were a novel.  Secondly, because it was written as a script character development seemed lacking. I couldn't imagine the characters of Albus and Scorpious nor could  I related to other characters new  to the storyline.
 It's a play so it's a fast read. But it lacks that certain something that makes it's predecessors so great. Beloved characters are given only a mention but not seen, belived characters that are seen feel like charictures of themselves. The plot gets a little murky and jumbled at points. It would be a terrible gateway into the series, it relies heavily on knowing the characters, and as I mentioned, some of them don't quite seem to be themselves, time passing and maturity can't account for the changes. I read it in three hours; I may go back and try it slower to see if I like it better.
 I am a huge fan of the series and have read the books more times than I can count.  I was so looking forward to this, but it wasn't what I'd hoped for.  The original characters weren't true to themselves at all, and the new characters weren't well developed.  The story itself wasn't nearly as clever and well thought out as the original series.  I wish I had realized going in that JK didn't write this herself.  It doesn't sound like her at all.
 I bought this from my kindle so I didn't realize it was a screen play. The adjustment took a bit but I got used to it. I have to say that I don't think it the story makes for a very good book. It is about going back and forth in time and the things that change in the past that then has (sometimes) disastrous affects on the future. While the idea is a good one, because the main characters are kids I found myself continuing to roll my eyes by the choices of the characters. I know that is the point but it left me unmotivated to actually read the story.
 Quite disappointed in this. It is hard to read and drags on. I hope when you add actors, sets, and visual stimulation it will be interesting....as is it distaste of money.
 I wish I hadn't read it, and instead had held out for maybe seeing the play someday. Reading a screenplay didn't have the magic of watching a play or of reading a full-length novel. I missed J.K. Rowling's beautiful prose and writing style. The plot had holes. The worst part: the character development. I couldn't get over the thoughts of "Hermione doesn't talk that way!" and "Why is Harry so... pathetic?" etc. If you're a Potterhead, I doubt you'll be able to resist picking it up. But don't say you weren't warned!
 J.K Rowling obviously did not write this book. There were no clever British History inserts, no jokes, none of the plain ole' mischievous Harry that we all know and love. Frankly, I didn't like it at all. Sure it was an OK book, but "OK" doesn't cut it in the Potter fandom. There is no Harry Potter without J.K Rowling, and it showed. To be realistic, I would never recommend this book as a HP Sequel because the only thing it will ever have in common is the fact there's a Potter on the title. I'm still hoping for a real, justified book about HP next gen, (and of course a prequel about our favorite fantastic four, the marauders) one that put very own J.K Rowling writes, because honestly, this was a Cruciatus Curse to my heart.
 While I was excited to see where Harry Potter might do as an adult. I was disappointed that he apparently didn't learn much from high school days to middle age as a more effective wizard. Frankly, his son's adaption to his father's fame might be reflective of some children's behaviors, I found his character pathetic including his final actions. Oh well, time has passed and Harry Potter's time to hold our interest should fade too. Bye, Harry Potter and crew.
 I really liked this book. I'm not going to write a huge review on the book. That's been done. I was disappointed when I learned that Rowling did not write it but only consulted. And it is very obvious when you read it. The characters are just a bit off. Things they would do or act like. But other than that the story was fun. I couldn't put it down.
 No! Poorly written. Looks like JKR hardly contribute with anything. As a HP fan, I'm totally disappointed. Messed up with book 4, and with main characters. I wish I could forget this book.
 So sorry I bought this.  I'm a huge Harry Potter fan and curiosity got the best of me. I will finish it but I do regret spending the money.
 Spoiler in this review!<br/><br/>I honestly did not like it at all. I was so disappointed in where this story line went. Voldemort having a daughter had to be the most ridiculous, unbelievable part of this sequel. If I thought I could get my money back, I would.
 I just could not get into this book.  Too unhappy.  Too sad
 It was like taking a bath in nowhere near warm water. The names are familiar... But that's about as far as it goes. There is no excitement... There is no Harry Potter Wonder... It was pedantic and a waste of money...
 This book actually made me sad (knew it was a play going in) - I wasn't expecting much more than "fan fiction" - but hey, if you are fan that is ok - but honestly, this wasn't even good fan fiction.  The book and all characters were flat - so horribly disappointed in this "book" -- my son and I were "early adopters" of Harry Potter and this was just crushing - will need to re-read the REAL stuff to remove the memory of this.
 Read more like a bad fanfiction than a Harry Potter book. I'll just pretend this book never happened and remember the series as it was.
 Perhaps it is only the weight of the legacy dumped upon this poor play that makes it disappointing. It was instantly clear that Rowling was barely involved in the writing. Nevertheless, this play feels like a novel hastily converted. Driven by plot, it moves like a roller coaster, so fast that the scenery becomes a blur. Only the most crucial details are stated, much, including a great deal of character development, happens off stage. Without the luxury of exploring an intricate story over 800 pages, with time to develop characters slowly, set up meetings in advance, and gradually weave a plot together, the writing becomes far too urgent. So often I felt that the play needed to sit, to breathe, to flesh out conflicts and feelings. Frequently was the scene quickly set for such a thing, and just as quickly ripped down for the next piece of fast paced action. The plot, already incredibly convoluted, drives the dialogue at breakneck pace. it is impossible to truly explore the impact of words on the characters because to move the plot forward everyone must be on the same page at the same time. No misunderstandings. No localized conflict. Instead one is presented with essentially three teams, driving scavenger hunt style through a murky maze. The dialogue, the centerpiece of any play, the real reason to drag oneself out of his home to the theatre to see real people pouring their hearts out to one another, their pain, their joy, their hopes all bared before the world, is related instead to servant of the ruthless plot. Like a train conductor it has a timetable, a route, and no time to wait for conversations before it moves out. This is not to say the plot has intrinsic problems, but that it is unsuited to a play. Like a turbocharged engine dropped into a scooter, a sedate ride through the countryside, with time to meander and see, becomes a high speed chase, where to take ones eyes of the road would be catastrophic. Nonetheless, I'm sure all harry potter fans will read this, and they should, if only to stay up to date. They should also brace themselves for high speed confusion and moderate disappointment.
 Who are these people??? They have the same names of the characters in the Harry Potter but besides the names they don't have anything else in common. It looks as the people who wrote the script just skimmed through the books just to cut and paste some scenes. I can't believe they treated such iconic characters and story with such disrespect. I have no words to express how disappointed I am. I wished I had not spent a penny in this rubbish and not wasted my time reading it. And no the format didn't bother me at all, I had read many plays before it's simply that it was a terrible plot that didn't make any sense and was not true to the essence of the Harry Potter storyline.
 I first heard people criticising this new book, so I didn't start reading it until recently. But once started, I was surprised by the clever twistings of the plot and he development of the story just kept me reading. I could never have imagined Voldermolt could be involved in Harry Potter's world again after ao many years. I could definitely use my imagination to picture how the story goes while reading. It's a lot of fun and excitement, and another story filled with love.
 No this is not JKRowling and therefore does not run as smoothly as the books concerningplotline but this is a play which involves the visual sense that is so brilliantly written in JK's prose.  I liked the characters and the time turner plot does not bother me. It allowed us to revisit some characters that we would not have had without time travel.  I enjoyed it for what it is.  A play based on JK's world and characters. Would love to see it.  Understand it was very good!
 I read Harry Potter to my kids and we all fell in love with the books.  This was fun but a very light and disappointing read. It really only fully engaged me emotionally a handful of times which is in stark contrast to the series. It is written as a play script. My 14 your old daughter read this in one day and I read it in about 6 hours.  Harry Potter fans will want to read it but don't expect much and it might be worthwhile to wait and borrow it from a friend. They will finish the book quickly
 I liked this book for its ability to put me back into the Harry Potter Universe. This was the biggest plus for me.<br/><br/>A word of caution for other readers is to remember that this is a script. It isn't as detailed or character driven as the books themselves because it is meant to be performed. And as a piece that is meant to be performed I felt that it was well done. I would enjoy seeing the characters make this come to life.<br/><br/>There were somethings that I did not like in terms of the story - but I felt that the money that I paid for the book was worth it - especially to have the ability to be placed back in the Universe of Harry Potter. It was also nice to have a real closing to the story more than the chapter at the end of the 7th book.<br/><br/>Overall enjoyed the play.
 Maybe it works better as an actual produced play, but the writing in this is all over the place in quality. At points it could work as an extension of the series, at others it reads like fan fiction.<br/><br/>The marketing of this book as another harry potter work when it's the script for a play that is only supervised by JK Rowling is disingenuous. It crumbles under the limitation of a short play, the long span of time in the books, with the characters and plot developments and tangents is missing. The plot that is available is as if someone wanted to push a storyline that was separate from Harry Potter in Harry Potter, using a time travel concept that forces the story to work on past events instead of creating anything new.<br/><br/>I understand it's JK ROWLING's right to do anything she wants with the series, but between this and making pronouncements on twitter undermining her work and retconning it, I am kind of glad she won't be making a full sequel to this series again.
 Reads like bad fanfiction.  The original trio are completely out of character, and the plot is garbage, but Scorpius Malfoy is hilarious and amazing (and is why my rating is two stars instead of one).  The book is almost worth reading for him alone.  Almost.  I can easily list a dozen actual fanfiction stories that are better written and more true to the original books, though, so unless you're really feeling like you have too much money in your bank account right now, maybe take a pass on this one.
 I have read and heard a number of negative reviews from people that expected this screenplay to be the dynamic storytelling of the HP series combined with the cinematic powerhouse effects of specifically the last 4 movies. This is a screenplay that is built for the stage- not the screen and not just simply the imagination. The story telling was therefore more subtle, but in my opinion more emotionally profound in many ways. Definitely worth the read.
 I think it's important that readers remember that this is A.) a Rehearsal Edition Script and B.) It wasn't written by JK Rowling.  I wonder if a few of the ideas introduced in this are a bit better flushed out now that the play has opened in London.  Overall, I enjoyed revisiting the Harry Potter universe.  I'll take any excuse to immerse myself in the world that has been so influential to me throughout my adolescence and adulthood.
 This is just bad. I understand it's meant to be seen rather than read, but it's terrible reading. Old characters have completely different personalities (body snatchers edition maybe?) and the Hogwarts experience/culture is off too. Plus, the while story is ridiculous and actually contradicts the books (specifically Prisoner of Azkaban). On top of all that, it reads like bad fan-fiction you'd find online. I wish I could forget this exists.
 This review has a spoiler in it:<br/><br/>Our family loves Harry Potter, so we had to get this book.  It was entertaining but left us wanting more.  It would be great if JK Rowling would change her mind and so another full blown book about the wizarding world with Harry, Hermione, Ron and their kids.  This book, which is the run down of the play which is showing in London, is limited, but there is an opening there for the villain (daughter of Voldemort ).
 This review title says it all. I'm sure most fans have read this already, but in case you were holding out- don't bother.<br/><br/>This book reads more like a poor fan fiction.The message of the story is so tired and cliché. She also ruins characters by introducing these far-fetched (even for a magical fantasy) relationships and storylines.  I'm really surprised that this is what JK Rowling envisioned for her characters.
 Amazing just a little confusing i love the book but think it would have been better if it was a novel like the other harry potter books. this is coming from a ten year old so dont be surprised
 I hesitated ordering this because I had always wanted to read the complete book,<br/>but I found the play very interesting and informative, and I found myself completely<br/>immersed in the plot as it played out.
 This wasn't exacatly what I was expecting but I love the fact that the Harry Potter story line continues.  It was interesting to read parts of the story from another perspective and I enjoyed the insight I gained from different characters personalities.  I don't want to go into too much detail in fear of spoiling the story.  I would read this again, but maybe not as frequently as the original series.
 I did not think I would enjoy this book as much as I did considering it is written in play form. It is very fast reading because of the format.<br/>I wish the author would have just taken the time to make this into a real book, and then derived the play from it. I would have preferred more detail and background, more developing of the story. That being said, all in all - I feel it is worth reading. Had it been in book format and not play format, I would have given it 5 stars.
 This story has a much different feel from the other books. Some parts were a bit dragged out. I feel that some of the characters did not act as I would have expected them to from previous stories. That being said, I still enjoyed the story and hearing about the later lives of some of my favorite characters
 I was very excited to add the final Harry Potter book to my collection until I opened it and it was shredded
 Lazily written, cliche, plothole-filled story. Many cringe-worthy lines of dialogue. The main villain is so boring and devoid of characteristics that I can't remember her name for more than five minutes at a time. This is not Harry Potter. This is poorly written fanfiction.
 Bear in mind reader's that this is not a novel, but a play script and that Rowling did not write it alone. She provided guidance, kept it from veering outside the Harry Potter cannon, and gave it her blessing.<br/><br/>If you have never read a script, it will be an adjustment and you may decide that you do not like the story.  Give it a shot, sleep on it and come back to your decision.
 Like a lot of reviewers who've posted, I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter series and its massive universe. I think J.K. Rowling is an absolute genius. I was excited at the idea of getting a small taste of what that world would have evolved into two decades later. Having read  The Cursed Child, I've decided to use wand and pensive and remove it from my memories. All the original characters are written as flat, one dimensional, woefully lacking shadows of themselves.  And while Albus and Scorpius are better developed characters (and should be), they come across as disconnected from the series, from the history and the legacy. Rowling didn't write this, and it shows. There's probably fan fiction out there that's done a better job.  I'll just have to be content with re-reading the original series now and again.
 This was a horrible disappointment.<br/><br/>Let me begin by saying I am not bothered it is a play. I love plays. I knew it was a play when I bought it. This review has nothing to do with the format.<br/><br/>The characters in this book, my beloved characters, the characters that I practically grew up with as a child, were not handled with the kind of care and reverence I would have desired. Many of them acted very differently than I would have expected, behaved very differently than I felt their character would.<br/><br/>The story, the plot, felt forced and was bland and practically boring. It was somewhat cliche, a bit all over the place, with no real path or purpose. Harry Potter is the pinnacle of coming-of-age stories, and this falls far short of that. Instead it feels like just some way to parade our beloved characters in front of us to earn a fast buck.<br/><br/>The "villain" has no depth, no purpose beyond just behaving the way they do because of who they are. Evil just for the sake of evil is boring, and makes for a boring story and a unsatisfying conclusion.<br/><br/>In the span of a single play, this book attempted to build all of the same relationships and touching moments as the original series so that it felt rushed and poorly planned. It tried to create a strong friendship between the two "main" characters, it tried to create tension and fall-out between Harry and his son in order to provide a touching reconciliation.  In the final act when things came together and we got the reconciliations between multiple relationships I felt nothing.<br/><br/>The story attempted to make the two main boys into heroes like the Harry, Ron and Hermione in the originals, but instead they just come off as rebellious teenagers trying to prove something to themselves and their parents, and almost destroying the world in the processes.<br/><br/>The characters we see all grown up, Harry, Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Draco, and others, none of them really feel like they do their originals justice. Like another reviewer wrote this comes off as a poorly written fan fiction, as whoever wrote this fails to grasp the personalities and characteristics of any of these beloved characters. (HOW is it that Hermione of all people hears that Boomslang Skin and Lacewing Flies are missing and doesn't immediately know what that means and start looking into it?)<br/><br/>I was severely disappointed in this book and would vehemently urge anyone who holds Harry Potter in their hearts and souls to not muddy it with this addition to the series.
 As a Harry Potter fan, knowing going into it that it would be a play (and reading so many bad reviews) I was expecting just another edition in the series - but not holding my breath.<br/>This book was an enjoyable read, and I do not regret my purchase.  Though it is not as great as the main 7 books, I read it for fun, not for critical thinking or as a "fine piece of literature". I don't find myself overly analytical of books unless I get bored reading them - and this book definitely kept my attention.<br/>The characters weren't my favorite, and I was a little disappointed at some of the development of Harry, Ron, Hermione and the other adults as compared to their childhood selves. But that's ok - and now I want to see the play!
 I do actually like reading plays, so that wasn't the thing that detracted from my rating. The story was entertaining, but there were some flaws in the time travel progression (I'm rather picky about my time travel) and some of the stage directions/actions were contradictory. It's fun to think about the Harry Potter universe all grown up. I was just hoping for something a little better... different... more (not sure what)?
 Not fantastic. The format is less than enthralling and the story itself lacks the originality of the series. Not much of a read.
 This is a terrible book not at all like the original Harry potter books. It has a terrible plot and is not very well-written either. I would not recommend buying it a waste of money.
 I was hesitant to read this for two reasons:<br/>1) that it wouldn't live up to the Harry Potter name and<br/>2) that it would live up to the Harry Potter name and I would go right back into the Potter withdrawal so many of us went through after Deathly Hallows.<br/>I was right about the second reason. This was a truly beautiful tale with more twists and turns than I thought were possible in a story this length. My only recommendation is that if you are not familiar with reading scripts it could make the script a bit more difficult to follow.<br/>Love it.
 The format didn't bother me at all. I expected it b/c they never marketed this as a new HP book but it was marketed as a new HP play script. That being said, the story is just bad. It's not very good. It's boring and is very much recycled from a previous HP book. I'm sure seeing the actual play would be 100% better, but I can't even say that b/c the story is recycled material. I wish I would have gone with my gut and ignored this.
 I really enjoyed this play.  It thrust me right back into the world of Hogwarts, magic and muggles.  I like how Rowling went back and forth in time to weave a captivating story that included multiple generations of characters.  Reading a "play" script takes some getting used to, in fact my wife found it so off putting that she hasn't yet finished the story.  I chose instead to charge full speed ahead through all the scene changes and finished the read in a matter of days.
 It's good but not great. As a huge harry potter fan I was disappointed with this book. I could look past the fact that it's a screen play and not a novel but the story was just weak compared to the original books. You can definitely tell this isn't Rowling's work. If you're looking for a masterpiece like the previous series, just walk on by but if you're interested in getting a glimpse of the hogwarts clan as adults, this is an OK read.
 I really enjoyed the Harry Potter series and movies.  I was excited to see that a new book was coming out, but I was disappointed with the screenplay lay out and how much story was reviewed.  I was really hoping for a more detailed and updated story line.
 I was spoiled by the previous series. Sadly, this one is way to short. Not due to the money, although you do expect more than a couple hours reading when you spend $10-12 dollars. It was nice to pick-up the story again now that Harry and Ron had families, but the format (a screen play) took a little getting used to. I'm sure there was some rationale for this, but I suspect most avid HP readers will be less than fulfilled.
 First, this is not really a book, but a script for a play, so that definitely needs to be considered when reading this.  The play is probably highly entertaining and some of the effects described in the screenplay are probably pretty cool.  I would be interested to see how the some of the magic was done onstage.  And if you read it expecting the detail that is contained in the books, you will be disappointed.<br/><br/>As for the story, I have mixed feelings.  I am a huge fan of the original books and I thought the ending of the Deathly Hallows was done perfectly, and the series itself was amazing, so I would be perfectly happy if everything ended right there.  However, I don't have an issue with the story continuing and it is quite interesting to see what the characters are doing later in life.  However, I would have preferred that the original story be left alone and not tampered with, which is not the case.<br/><br/>In writing this, I will try to describe the story as best I can without giving away too much.  The story starts the way the epilogue in the Deathly Hallows ends with Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione sending their kids off on the Hogwarts Express.  Harry's youngest son, Albus, is going to Hogwarts for the first time and is very worried.  On the train, Albus meets Scorpius Malfoy and the two become friends.  Both are outcasts, Albus living in the shadow of his famous father and Scorpius because he is rumored to be not Draco's real son, but the son of Lord Voldemort.  Albus resents his father and Harry has a difficult time in handling Albus.  The two don't get along.  Harry makes some efforts, but they fall flat, Albus drifts further away and Harry then says some things that make it even worse.<br/>With this strained relationship as the basis for the plot, Albus decides to take some action to right what he feels is one of his father's wrongs from the past.  From there, chaos ensues.  I will leave it at that to avoid any spoilers.<br/>If you are a Harry Potter fan, you obviously have to read this.  How much you like it depends on your perspective.  I'm sure there are fans out there that just want to see the story continue and will really like this book.  If you are like me, however, and you feel the original story should be left alone, you may have some issues with this.<br/>If you have not read the original books, you will probably need to before reading this or much of it will not make much sense.
 It's cute and thoughtful. It teaches good lessons, but it is no where near the caliber of the novels. While I was happy to experience characters old and new, the plot felt contrived, and issues resolve almost too easily. It reads like an abridged performance of a classic that's been condensed and simplified for a performance that travels to elementary schools to get them excited about books. Mediocre at best.
 The story starts out well - I like the new characters and the setup. The first third of thes cript is entertaining and feels almost (but not quite) like Harry Potter classic. There are a few fun details and backstory, and it just feels good to be back.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the rest of the script is quite disappointing. The characters are superficial and always act exactly as you expect. The plot is ridicilous, implausible and yet without any surprises whatsoever. The dialogue reads like a speech by Donald Trump: It tells you in black and white what the world is like, and how you should feel about it; there are no nuances, no room for interpretation.<br/><br/>I ended up skipping pages to make it end sooner. I was left with one question: Why did Rowling allow this?
 Poor story line, if you are diving I to time travel you are writing yourself off unless you have very good an detailed story. This one is, however, full of ex-machina moments and generally its disappointing. The only good Potter-fan moment I found was the interesting parallel universes as well as the connection to. The very beginning of the Harry Potter story.
 Don't go in expecting a novel. It's engaging and it's an interesting experience to engage with these stories in this format. The story is interesting and satisfying, though, as many have remarked, it is bizarrely bad to Hermione (and women), and many character choices are highly implausible (though that's not the hugest departure for the Harry Potter stories). In this case, you may find you don't quite recognize these versions of the characters you've come to know over the years.
 Being a big Harry Potter fan, I knew I had to read this despite all the negative reviews. It's best to remember before starting to read that this is a play! There is not near as much detail as the other Harry Potter books. Overall it wasn't bad, it  was nice to read about all the characters lives outside of Hogwarts. But yes it wasn't the greatest and some of the characters were portrayed oddly. The plot may be a little questionable (without giving anything away). My advice is to read it yourself then make your opinion!
 Reads like fan fiction, not a true Rowling book. The characters are simplified and not complex. The loopholes make the book read like one of those essays that ends "and then I woke up, it was all a dream". Huge Harry Potter fan so I had to read it and would recommend it to anyone because it is more insight into the Wizarding world but trust, you will be disappointed.
 All the other bad reviews you've read are right. I know it's Harry Potter  and you don't want to believe that it's awful. But it is. I didn't want to believe it either. It's got no soul, no heart, no trace of the wonderfully descriptive world of magic we all love. And like a lot of reviews have said regarding the storyline, I agree-- what the? Sigh. Save yourselves. The reviews are a better read.
 I'm pretty sure Rowling did not write this. There were so many inaccuracies between this, the books, and pottermore. It was filthy, casual, and poorly written fan fiction. I'm not saying this because it was a screen play. I knew it was one when I bought it. I have a theater background and the dialogue was terrible. Save your childhood and just skip this!
 Reading this felt like I was reading fanfic, and bad fanfic at that. I'm a huge fan of the original series and generally reread them all every year. I really hate that this mess is now part of HP canon.
 If you're a Harry Potter fan, read all the books and seen the movies, you will enjoy this play. It is easy to visualize the scenes and be transported back to the wizarding world. The story begins with the last scene from the books and goes forward with the next-generation, but all your favorite original characters remain. I hope that more sequels will follow.
 This screenplay felt like the ghost of an idea that should not have reached publication-- an attempt at finding success in writing once more and failing. Old characters are nothing like what seven prior books portrayed and new are two dimensional, flat constructs unworthy of the Harry Potter universe.
 WARNING: SPOILERS<br/><br/>I’m disappointed.<br/>That shouldn’t shock you, Rachel, or the rest of the die-hard fans. Do you think there is any possible way an 8th story would have met expectations, even if it was in a book format? You should listen to the warnings the original series gave us about bringing back the dead. Harry Potter is basically your childhood. The stakes were astronomically high.<br/><br/>Wait, did Back to the Future and Twilight have a baby?<br/>I’m not sure. I got lost. Too many time turners, and I’m not buying that “Voldy” (how sensitive, after a generation of genocide) had a kid.<br/><br/>How could J.K. Rowling write this?<br/>She didn’t. If you read it as fan fiction, you will be less disappointed.<br/><br/>“It is a script, dummies. You aren’t experiencing the real story because you have to see it in person.”<br/>What percentage of the fan base can feasibly fly to London and secure a ticket? Why on earth are they selling the script for twenty-bucks a pop if it can’t stand alone? And I’m sorry, but a plot hole is a plot hole. Why revisit and muck up the great, iconic scenes (as much fun as it will be to re-read the Triwizard Tournament picturing two dorky boys lurking around)? Why not create an original story?<br/><br/>Wait, did Ron just turn into Fred or George Weasley?<br/>Love potion gag gifts? Didn’t he almost die from one of those once upon a time?<br/><br/>Come to think of it, are any of the characters themselves?<br/>I’m not sure I’ve ever seen Hermione so incompetent or Harry so blah. And I’m totally buying that a little humiliation from the ever-courageous Cedric turned him into a raging death eater.<br/><br/>Serious question, why is Draco not in Azkaban?<br/>He was a known death eater. Why is Bellatrix rotting away while he is out and about with his secret time turner?<br/><br/>Come on, wasn’t there anything positive?<br/>The nervous, I-might-throw-up emotional excitement I felt for a sustained five minutes before I could muster the courage to open the book was thrilling (it is not every day you think you get to read Harry Potter again for the first time). To be fair, I also had a hard time putting this script down. Humanizing Slytherin was a good move. Scorpius is a decent character. Meeting Snape again was nice. If this was published and recognized as fan fiction, I might give it a 3/5. I’m holding back my final judgments until I can see the work as intended, a full performance.<br/><br/>Does this merit “Obliviate?”<br/>Unclear. My initial gut feeling says stick with the original canon. I’ll accept this as fan fiction and save my pennies for Hamilton.
 Not as enjoyable as the original series. I am not fond of the screen play format. I miss the rich descriptions of locations and what characters are actually thinking. The story was ok but not as complex as in the past. I did enjoy the actual new "generation" of characters though. I just thought the story could've been more forward-looking instead of reminiscing about the past.
 This is about as fulfilling as seeing the movies.  The story is interesting and I love the characters, but where are all the great words??  There is so much more story to be told, and I know the Potter world well enough to fill in the blanks.  Where the books were like drinking a rich cup of good coffee, this book is like having the drink pass by you on a tray being served at the next table. You know it could be good if only....
 Feels like poorly written fan fiction that J.K. Rowling would never write. Just pretend it doesn't exist.<br/><br/>Also, I pre-ordered this months in advance and didn't get it until after it came out in stores so returned it and bought it for cheaper at Sam's Club.
 This book was poorly written, it read as fan fiction. It had so many twists and turns it did not seem plausible even in a make believe world. The author rewrote some characters that have previously been presented as old and caring witches into some sort of weird monster. The whole book was outlandish with holes in the writing. I'm not quite sure how JK Rowling approved such a play script.
 So I actually read this when it first came out and really didn’t like it. It read as fan fiction to me. BUT I just saw it on Broadway and MY GOD it was brilliant!!! What was so ridiculous on the page was absolutely magical on the stage. I take back all the bad things I said about it before.
 This is a disaster from cover to cover. Severely disappointed. How could Rowling lend her name to this? It's a swiss cheese of plot holes, it's terribly written and the characters are entirely one-dimensional. I may come back later and expand this review when it's not 2am, and provide specific examples.
 Everything about this is wrong and has completely destroyed the series! This will not be placed next to my Harry Potter collection, more like as a door stop should I need one. I don't care that it is a play but sheesh a 12 year old could write a better version of this. The dialogue between the characters made me want to cry. Ron and Hermione's relationship is still awkward after years of marriage, and the scene with Dumbledore... Worst book ever! Borrow from the library or buy at half price books, it's not worth buying a new copy!
 Like everyone else, I had expectations for this story. I found it interesting and engaging, but now I feel that I need to see it on stage for I feel like from the book alone I'm missing a certain something that I can't quite put my finger on. It is definitely not as well written as the novels and feels, at the same time, both a natural extension of the story and completely out of place. Maybe seeing it on stage would make me like it more...
 The usual review questions (How is Author Writing... How is story narrated?) sort of apply .. this is a script for a play with notes describing the scenery and position of the performers.  I've read plays before ... this one goes slowly and seems to follow the same theme and line as the early books.  Definitely not something you are reluctant to put down and do something else.  Loved the books.... not in love with the play.
 I'm not rating it down simply because it is a play script as I knew that when I bought it.  But, (probably not fair of me) I am rating it down, because I guess I don't like reading play scripts.  I tried to read this, but eh bleh couldn't get through it at all.  It will be nice to use as a reference though.  (Even though the internet is really the best reference).  No more play scripts or screen play scripts for me.
 This is the stage play that other authors collaborated with Rowling on. It has her name on the cover and promotion, but lacks her care in crafting each detail and knitting it all together. My gifted students really struggled with this plot, but loved the title.
 Spoilers: the biggest issue I have with this story was Harry. I just do not see someone who has overcome so much and experienced working with different types of people to have that hard of a time accepting his son. It just doesn't make sense to me and was the hardest part of the story to believe. Harry experienced not feeling like he was like his dad in the 6th book so, why would he treat his own son so differently. I just didn't believe it was Harry.
 I do, of course, love everything J.K. Rowling has written has written as herself, or Robert Galbraith.  This is the first play I have read - it was not as different as I thought it would be and in no way distracted me from the terrific storyline!  J.K. continues to deliver and the older Potters/Weasleys/Malfoys/etc are great.  Just how they should have grown up......more please?
 I knew it was a play, but I didn't notice Rowling wasn't the only author. In my mind, that almost explains my disappointment. In fact, Rowling shouldn't put her name on it at all.  The characters have strangely different personalities, especially Ginny, Ron and Harry. The only person that's still more-or-less true is Hermione. The story is based on a magical world, but there's nothing magical about the story. The story is not different from any other time-travel stories in any significant way. I don't know about anyone else, but I could  totally predict what happens next when reading it. The first half of the book was so boring that I almost decided to throw it away. (Had I known how Rowling didn't have much to do with the book I would have) The story is conventional and full of the cheesy hollywood value about love and family, which is fine except when it's executed in such a bad way. The bottom line is: any Harry Potter fan is capable of writing something like this, and better.
 Very dissatisfied with this rubbish of a story. How could you publish this crap!
 I found the formatt to be a very interesting presentation and enjoyed the introduction from the standpoint of the director. This<br/> definitely enabled myself enjoyment of the material. Most Potter fans would like the stories that bridge so many gaps and  expands possibilities.
 Big book. Lots of white. Read in a day.<br/>Story is very morality about father's and sons. Not as good as the series. Disappointed.<br/>Do your pocketbook a favor and look up spoilers on the net. Book really can be sumarized in a paragraph.
 A fitting end to the Harry Potter story line.  Suitable for completests who insist on reading everything by a given author (frequently guilty as charged) or those wondering what "Harry Potter, the Next Generation" would look like.  But frankly, I found it weaker than some of the earlier novels.  And I'm really tired of seeing time travel stories -- and usually time travel paradoxes -- everywhere.
 The book was creative and interesting and it was a nice visit back into the wizarding world, but the characters seemed not like themselves. While understanding they would be different with maturity, the book still felt like it was a screenplay written by someone who had only ever seen the movies and decided to write a fan fiction. I would hardly consider it the next in line book after the 7th Harry Potter. More like an interesting spin by a fan.
 I've read some fan fics on the internet that have been better than this story. Although I realize the format is for theater, I don't think it changes the overall quality of the story. There were some elements I liked and expected, however there were some plot twists that just seemed utterly ridiculous and something out of like an alternate universe. While I realize, it was not written by JK, I was hoping it would still have more of her thoughtful tones, but I was disappointed. It's a quick, easy read, and I'm not sure if I recommend it.
 There are a few nuggets worthy of the first 7 Harry Potter books<br/>I was disappointed in this, and, worse, often bored. Some of the writing is ok, some is dreadful.<br/>Skipping ahead to the ending, to my horror, I found, a Touching Moment straight out of the land of cliches.
 It lacks the palpable emotion of the books.  Obviously, given that it is written in theater format, it is difficult to get a feel for the characters.  It is has interesting possibilities but I think JK Rowling would greatly help things along if she were to write the STORY now that the play version has been released.
 I adore Harry Potter!!!!! I have read the series so many times I've lost count. I have even read fanfiction stories mostly due to me being an H/Hr shipper. THIS BOOK READS LIKE BADLY WRITTEN FANFICTION!!!! I don't feel like the characters stay true to canon, the plot is super contrived, and some major plot points of this book only work if you disregard canon ( though at least one they try to explain another is left unexplained).
 I don't think I can even finish this book.  I am so disappointed.....
 Too childish. I'm disappointed in J. K. Rowling. She shouldn't have written anything else unless she was going to make it not only good but maybe even better than the original books. I read all the Harry Potter books when I was younger (28 now) but have reread them recently. They were still good but I found this new book to be predictable, childish, and cheesy.
 So I read a few reviews before purchasing this book and I thought it was going to be rubbish, but it turns out it was a pretty good book. I had just finished The Deathly Hallows and I decided to get the next in the series. However since it is a playscript  it is not really like a JKR book, but more of a story told through character dialogue. The only other negative I can think of is that it didn’t take me that long to finish.
 JK Rowling, did you really write this? I totally get the fact it was written as a play, but I'm very skeptical as to how much input she had on this book. I'm half way through the book and I'm just disappointed. I've read all of her previous books and I am a Harry Potter fan, but something is just off with this book.
 ... but the story was fun.  I'd like to see J. K. Rowling expand on the story line with another novel or two.  If you're a serious fan, of the movies, you'll see how much better it could have been if done with film's CGI special effects.  Even though the reader needs to imagine much of the back ground, I enjoyed the story.
 I delayed reading this for as long as I could so that I could go see the actual play first. But I couldn't resist anymore and picked up the script. This was a real page turner just like Rowling's other works. Finished it in one evening.
 I'm not sure if I can even put into words how disappointed I was after reading this story. But before I get into it, I want to make a few things clear. 1. I knew it was a script and not a novel; that is not what I have an issue with. 2. I am a massive Harry Potter fan and I absolutely love the books and movies. 3. I'm sure this is a very entertaining play to watch, but it does not belong in the Harry Potter franchise/universe.<br/>Okay. The biggest problem with Cursed Child is that it wasn't written by Rowling. She can pretend that she had something to do with it, but she didn't, or if she did, she must really no longer care at all what happens to her precious wizarding world. This story had so many major plot holes that would never fly in a HP novel. Part of what makes Harry Potter so special is the amount of details that JK put into it. Nothing in the HP books was an accident, and even today almost 10 years later fans continue to notice amazing details that no other author would take the time to put into a "children's" story. Cursed Child reads like fan fiction, and there is nothing wrong with fanfiction, but it pisses me off to no end that Rowling is calling this an official sequel to her otherwise perfect series. This writer was lazy and decided to recycle a cliche story-line while ruining our beloved characters in the process. What is the point?We did not need this story. It gives no new insight to the wizarding world (unlike any of the short stories that were actually written by Rowling, those are great) and it does not tell us anything that we didn't already know about Harry. Spoiler alert (but not really): Harry works at the Ministry of Magic! His relationship with his son isn't perfect! But after useless conflict that only rehashes the past, everyone lives happily ever after! The magic of Rowling's books is not present here, and there are at least 3 major plot holes that ruin the entire integrity of the story. I don't want to actually spoil anything, because I do believe that you should read it for yourself, but this book is a disgrace. What makes me the most angry is that this piece of sh*t was given to us, and then Rowling says "that's it for Harry! Cursed Child is the end of his story!" when it should have never been part of his story in the first place. I could go on and on, but basically, this book sucks and it is ridiculous that it is considered canon. Jk Rowling was my queen, I thought that she could do no wrong, but after reading Cursed Child I have been seriously rethinking things.....
 I have to think of this as fan fiction (fan fiction approved by Rowling so now canonical).  Wish I 'd waited and checked it out of the library instead of buying it. Maybe it is good that there is no real forward motion with the characters. Still, I'd rather read the lost diaries of Hermione Granger. To be more specific means SPOILERS AHEAD:  in book 3, Rowling handles time travel beautifully; no alternate timelines. Everything happens as if Harry and Hermione already went back in time. Not so here. Cursed Child turns Rowling's world on its ear and spins. . And then there's the rumor not only that Voldemort had a child, but that time turners were involved. Come on, Harry would be the first to explain why Voldemort would never do this. Time travel or not, V did not have a kid even if people in this story say he did--someone's lying. Finally, now that you have fans and HP following, please Ms. Rowling,  write about a female main character.
 I am a huge Harry Potter fan so naturally I was over the top excited when I learned I would be able to read this play. Unfortunately it was not able to hold my attention and I got bored/annoyed with it multiple times,often putting it down and starting different books. Hopefully on stage the actors will be able to bring it to life in a better manner than the written script. I am looking forward to reading the short stories J.K has announced will be coming out. This was just a miss for me.
 It's not like the good old classic Harry potter books, but still pretty good. The script format for it makes it a bit harder to read for me, and towards the beginning I didn't like it too much because it ruined my perspective on the series, but towards the middle you have no doubt that it is truly a great book. Advice for new readers: stick with the book until the end.
 If you love Potter don't read this. I wish I had read and headed the reviews instead of excitingly downloading this the day it came out. This is clearly not something crafted by Rowling - it just felt forced and unnecessary. The plot was absurd and the characters we know barely contained a hit of their previous fully developed selves. There were a few slightly redeeming points but overall, it didn't add anything of value. I will try to forgot this as soon as possible, and remember the Harry Potter series the way it was.
 Do not waste your money. I loved the real Harry Potter books. I hated this book. I hated the characters, yes, even Harry Potter. Poorly written from recycled bits of the original books but with none of the mystery or heart of the originals.
 It was mediocre at best. I had no problem with reading it as a play (as an actor/director, I'm used to scripts), but the story just really wasn't doing it for me. It's not bad, it's just not superbly good either.
 I really waited a long time to read this book because i didn’t think I would enjoy reading a script. Boy was I wrong. I really enjoyed it. I especially enjoyed reading about the characters now that they are adults.
 It reads like particularly bad fanfic written by somebody who actively hates the Harry Potter franchise.
 Very fun to read, but the plotline just isn't up to JK Rowling's usual well-thought out standards.  I was very disappointed with the plot, as a long time Potter fan.  But the novelty of having a new Harry Potter story made it plenty exciting and fun, anyways.  I just choose not to think of it as part of the real story.
 I'm glad I read it, but the characters from the original books were not much like the characters in this play.  I had a hard time believing that Harry was Harry, that Ron was Ron, etc.  I hope that the actors chosen for the play will bring out the qualities and personalities needed for character development in the context of the story.  As for the story, it was plausible.  It was easy to get through this read in one day.
 A blind person with no fingers could read this book in about 20 minutes. So if you think about it - this is probably the most expensive piece of writing ever created proportional to the amount of time it takes to read it.<br/><br/>So maybe you want to own a piece of literary history in the form of an over simplistic adaption novel?<br/><br/>Or maybe your the kind of guy who likes to read an entire book mid-step?<br/><br/>Either way - dont be a melon and buy this book. Just have a 1 year old explain it to you.
 I'm a huge Harry Potter fan, and this did not live up to expectations. You can definitely tell that JK Rowling didn't write this and I feel the quality of the writing doesn't live up to the author's standards. Different tone, character development, even inconsistencies with previous works.  I understand that this was a play script, and not a true novel.  It was wonderful to return to the magical world again, but this just didn't fit in with the Harry Potter series.
 I did not like the way this "book" was presented.  Very difficult to get into it.  I loved the other Harry Potter books.  This story was almost predictable.  For a ' play' that I could read in such a short time, it was overpriced.<br/>I gave it 3 stars instead of two because it gave a little more insight to characters that were not brought out in the previous books.<br/>As much as I looked forward to it, I was disappointed.
 Before reading this I reread the entire Harry Potter series so make sure I remembered any critical details necessary to understanding the plot of the Cursed Child. Overall I think this story was just okay especially compared to the original books. The story was enjoyable but the plot seemed almost shallow and a little cheesy compared to the original Potter books. If you’re a Potter fan it’s worth a read, but in my opinion doesn’t hold a flame to the original books.
 Compared to the others, its pale in comparison with details and intricate story line.  I mean, I am a huge harry potter fan and have read everything.  This is just ok.  I can see making a movie of it, but a play?  and it really needs some exaggerating.  You forget that you are reading a play after a few chapters.  If youre a harry potter fan, you have to read it, but don't expect to be blown away.
 Love the Potter books, this was a waste of money and felt like a money grab by J.K. The play format was annoying, the characters were written poorly and after reading less then half the book i found myself highly disinterested. J.K. needs to get off her high horse and write something better herself.
 My daughter likes this. She loves Harry Potter.
 oh boy.  did not like this.  could not stand the feeling of part missing,  sort of disjointed
 I'm not sure why J. K Rowling would allow for her name to be put on this horribly written piece of work. I know its written as a play, but these are NOT our characters. These people have no emotion ties to the magic Rowling has given to us previously. I was extremely disappointed, there are no words....
 I was concerned about the reading quality of a stage play script, but it was fine.<br/><br/>The story focuses a generation on, and the children of the original characters.  Not too many surprises, but enjoyable nonetheless.<br/><br/><a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Harry-Potter-and-the-Cursed-Child-Parts-One-and-Two-Special-Rehearsal-Edition-The-Official-Script-Book-of-the-Original-West-End-Production/dp/B01BMJWU4Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Harry Potter and the Cursed Child - Parts One and Two (Special Rehearsal Edition): The Official Script Book of the Original West End Production</a>
 The screen play book is something to be desired. I think the fact that they made it into a book it should of been so much more.  I would really like to see JK Rowling write it as an actual  book. It is missing key details being a play.  It's a very fast read which is also disappointing. I would hope that she throws her fans a thank you and writes as a book.  Story line was okay but jumped around Alot which made Alot of questions left unanswered.
 Another disappointed HP fan here.<br/>I grew up loving these books. It is beyond a doubt my favorite book series. I have worshiped JK Rowling for most of my life, I even have a HP tattoo. But what she has done here has broken my heart. I can look past the script aspect of this book, but the plot is absolutely not realistic. There are dozens, and DOZENS of plot holes that I will not go into for the sake of not spoiling whoever might be reading this. I cannot tell you how sad I am that JK Rowling had anything to do with this. I purchased tickets to see this play in London next year. I spent hundreds of dollars on these tickets, and will likely be selling them and cancelling our trip. There is no way that I can justify spending hours of my time on this nonsense, let alone flying halfway across the world to see the play in person.
 By all means, this is not as epically charged as the original book series. Some characters return, and that is where the magic is its most powerful. As an avid HP fan for over a decade, I can honestly recommend this story to HP fanatics that have always wanted kist that little bit more from the magical world.<br/><br/>I do believe that to see this on stage would change the way most view this script; it's meant to be watched and not read. But it's a great compromise for fans who cannot attend the London show.<br/><br/>Is it perfect? No. Did I smile, and laugh, and feel? Absolutely. And those familiar Potter feelings are all I could have ever wanted from a new HP book. Even if it did feel fanfiction-y. I'll read it again, and again, and again.
 Although I was initially thrilled about the book, after reading it I'm only happy to have experienced the old rush of getting the next HP book. We have raised our kids on the books and have made it a family love.<br/>I knew going in that a play is not a novel, that being said, my wife and I just didn't like the characters that we once loved. Ron was a shell with none of his personality from 1-7, Harry was kind of bipolar, Hermione was unpleasant, Draco was all over the place...it just felt like someone messed up the personalities of our characters. It did feel like JK Rowling wrote this story, and she's who made us fall in love with all the characters.<br/>All in all it's not bad, but it's not book 8.
 Read the whole book in one night! Couldn't put it down. Must read for Potter fans who are now Parents themselves.
 I gather many of the reviewers who disliked this book hadn't read many plays or scripts before. If you read the script from the first episode of the television show ER, I guess you may find yourself stunned by how "not good" it is. But when you watch those words come to life with acting and sets, it's a different story.<br/><br/>I did enjoy getting a glimpse of the next generation of wizards and witches in the magical world of Harry Potter. This book would be confusing and frustrating to read for those unfamiliar with the other books and films because it implies and references past storylines.<br/><br/>I would love to see this come to life so I hope the play will be in the states one day. Thanks, J.K. Rowling, for giving us a little something to scratch that itch we get from missing this very magical world.
 Oh my lord this is bad. I walked into this realizing that the book was not written by JK Rowling and as such would be different in tone, but this was honestly not good. I, like everyone else here, have read all the Harry Potter books and am an avid fan, so when I saw an 8th book was coming out to expand on the short epilogue, I was obviously excited. One page in I already knew that this was not going to be what I expected. The dialogue between the characters was awkward and stunted, the jokes were painful, and the way the writer worded some actions just didn't make sense. For example, can we talk about this line? "The Sorting Hat walks through the students, who spring into their houses". Since when does the Sorting Hat walk around? I haven't even mentioned how odd Ron is in this book. He cracks Dad jokes and pranks people, which would be fine if he was George or even Mr. Weasley, but Ron had never struck me as the dad jokes and running a joke shop guy. Everything just feels wrong. There was even a line in there about Professor McGonagall walking around with a large smile on her face. Since when is Professor McGonagall a cheery, wide-smile kind of lady? There just seem to be inconsistencies all over the place. I really don't understand how this got published and to call it the 8th book in the series is just a crying shame.
 Like other Harry Potter stories, Ms. Rowling captures the emotional essence of the lead's friendships, and now family, and makes us experience the Wizarding world through his eyes. I would have preferred this have been written in prose as opposed to a script, but still a worthy addition to my HP library.
 Started slowly, plodding along, but really picked up in the latter acts and overall told a really interesting story. I'd love to see the actual production, how they pull off all the scenery changes and magical effects.
 As a large supporter of the Harry Potter books this story falls flat. The voice and feel of 'Potter world' is lost in the tale of the next generation. Lacking character development, intertwined stories, and a forced companionship it feels like a rough draft for a school paper.
 Preachy and  totally annoying. The only person  even remotely like themselves was Professor McGonagall.  I have regerts, would not recommend.
 I just found it hard to believe that Harry Potter after the life he had as a child would talk so unkind to his son. Of course that got the action rolling...I enjoyed the other books more. I like the richness of vocabulary, settings, and descriptions in JK Rowling's other books. Didn't enjoy reading this as a play.
 I was both excited and nervous about reading this play  because I loved the books. This was an enjoyable read for me, though it was not as enchanting as reading the books. I imagine that some of the magic is lost when you read a play instead of seeing the play performed. I didn't have an issue with the story like many readers did, although I can say that it does read a bit like fan fiction rather than a genuine J.K. Rowling story. If the play does come to the U.S. I will likely go see it if only to see if the magic is more reminiscent of the books when it's performed. I did enjoy revisiting the characters and the world so it was a fun read.
 I am a huge Harry Potter fan and have been since PoA came out in paperback. I've re-read them more times than I can count, seen all the movies, even been to Wizard Rock concerts. This is just not what I've come to expect from something with J.K. Rowling's name. The plot is terrible and full of holes, and there are so many continuity errors I can't even list them all. The big twist makes no sense and it doesn't even seem remotely possible that the characters wouldn't have known about it during DH. I had no problem with the script format, some of my favorite stories are scripts! It's just that I have read plenty of fan fiction that does more justice to the Wizarding World universe than this rubbish.
 I was super excited about this book. I’ve been a fan of the series from the start. This isn’t a book. It’s a stupid script. It was awful to read and I was really saddened by this.
 As an avid HP I was both excited and nervous for this new "book".<br/><br/>PROS - it was a quick fun read, fun bonus bits for HP fans, new characters CONS - too short (could just be me wanting more), kind of weird storyline, where a typical HP book would talk about in a chapters worth is condensed into one page in Cursed Child.<br/><br/>TLTR: If you're a HP fan then of course you have to read it, if you haven't read the HP series at least twice then no rush to pick this up.
 Enjoyed catching up on my favorite Harry Potter characters.  It was an interesting enough plot without being too complex.  Interesting to see the adult Potters and Weaslys interacting in the grown up world.  Light the whole collection of Harry Potter books, wou will have to have read the previous novels to make sense out of this play.  It was like a nostalic look back on old acquaintences.
 I'm not a fan of this book, mostly because it's written like a script for a movie or play. I would have preferred it be adapted to book format. I guess they're getting lazy. I ended up reading the plot summary on Wikipedia to know how it ended because I couldn't stand to read the script any longer.
 While the story was great and a good continuation of the Harry Potter series I felt, it would have been a much better read as a story format rather than a play/role play format.  It was often hard to feel the flow of the conversation when reading the narrative parts. Would recommend as a story not as a writing style. Plus with all the spacing the book itself could have been reduced in page count.
 I just felt like some of the characters were wrong. Rose for example would never act like that with her parents being who they are. Overall, it was a let down - the books are so much better.
 As a fan of all the HP books I was happy to delve further into the HP universe with Cursed Child, but felt that the storyline and characters could have been further developed. This really needs your imagination to read through so you can extrapolate the rest of the world of HP between the lines.
 I went into this hoping Rowling, Tiffany, and Thorne had pulled off what Tolkien did with the Hobbit and LOTR. They failed. This is not an original story about the adventures of the next generation of wizards/witches, but a poorly developed story built around a mashup of the highlights from the original series. I actually had to walk away from the book on several occasions because I became so annoyed with their poor depiction of original characters. There were also several parts/twists of the story that I felt were not believable because they did not coincide with the details/explanations we know from the original series, i.e. Delphi's parents, Harry's lack of knowledge about Dumbledore's feelings, etc. I love the Harry Potter series, but regret ruining it with this story. I plan on shoving the memory of it into the recesses of my mind in the hope that I can forget it ever happened.
 Terrible. Not at all along the lines of the wonderful characters we love
 I am about to see this story come to life on Broadway in NYC.  I thought it helpful to read the book first and was I ever surprised. Not being an avid reader I absolutely could not put this book down until finished. JK Rowling... You are more than MASTERFUL. I WOULD LOVE TO MEET YOU!
 Book was in perfect condition, new, and love the story.
 The story in itself was good once you got over the way it is written - in play form. However, that makes it very hard to stay engaged in the story.  When they first time traveled, it took me awhile to figure out what had happened. If it had been in book form, it wouldn't have been as confusing. I will not recommend this book to others. I have heard of many people being disappointed in the format with which it was written. Now I know why!
 I really did not like this play. It did not flow. The story line was good but failed to develop the characters. It just seemed to feed off of the Potter phenomenon and not really develop it further. If you are a complete Potter fan I suppose I could recommend it, but not if you are a purist with your own delightful imagination.
 Ok, so this did not suck me in like the other books did. Perhaps I expected too much. I was a bit disappointed how it dragged at first, I actually walked away from it for awhile disappointed but, since I loved the other ones, I finished it.  It was good. I might have enjoyed it more had I not expected so much from it. But if you're a Harry Potter fan (which I am) you'll want to give it a chance.
 I want to say first that I am a Harry Potter fan... and I have no problem with this being a script. I knew it would be when I bought it. The problem I have is with the entire plot. It's pretty terrible, and it comes off like a fan wrote it.<br/>I mean, let's see. Time travel using devices that aren't supposed to exist. Rumors of Voldy's secret love child. Voldy actually having a secret love child who becomes a villain because she could... boys being in love - but not really, they're just REALLY good friends. Alt universes. SNAPE. Cedric as a death eater...<br/><br/>I wanted so much to like this book... but I've read better fanfiction. Maybe the play is better? I don't know, I'll probably never have a chance to see it.<br/><br/>Sorry Mrs. Rowling, I still love you but... yeah this was pretty terrible.
 Disappointing in light of all the other Harry Potter books. Should have left well enough alone. It's like the author went back to try to make everyone happy with a possible alternate ending with who ends up with who. Brilliant series, the author made her money and a name for herself. Now go write something else...
 If it wasn't for the original series I would have given up half-way. If I want a theatre scrip I'd read Chekhov, where there is a much more character and debt. The original books were famous because of the whole atmosphere and alternate world that was well presented. There is none of this in book. What a shame. Had Rowling kept her original style, the loyal followers would have been happy with the story. Could have started another epic. But this was sloppy and I am not sticking around for re-run.
 Being an HP fan, of course I HAD to read this next book. It was good but I was a little disappointed.... Harry was, for the lack of a better word, a "wimpy" dad and his son was a smart-mouthed brat.  That is not what I would have envisioned Harry becoming or the type of Dad he would make. It was an okay story but certainly not Rowling style.
 The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars (It IS J.K. Rowling after all!!) is that I absolutely hated the format of it being a screenplay! I really, really needed the depth that a full novel could bring, and I found myself frustrated at times. Having said that I loved that the story wasn't over, and that we could go back to our beloved Hogwarts and revisit happy reads. Hopefully we'll get a proper book and more to boot!!
 I really enjoyed the book and the story line. Reading it was a little harder since you are just reading a script and it wasn't as descriptive as reading the other books.  I still feel this book would have been better had it been written in the same story as the other Harry Potter series. But all in all, Harry Potter stories and adventures are enjoyable. This one just might make for a very good movie.
 If this was a fanfic, I would have thought this was a lovely killing time story, but as a canon - disappointing.<br/>Perhaps this is because this is a script intended for stage production with effects that I cannot catch from the book (and also intended for younger age audience), but the pace is quite fast while I do not quite see the character development I saw in the original series.<br/>The new characters are quite similar to the typical mary-sue/sidekicks in many fanfics, not necessarily limited those of Harry Potter series.<br/>I hope they create a DVD out of the stage production and can persuade me otherwise.
 I will be honest - I haven't read the whole thing yet, it was so hard to read and poorly written I couldn't get through it.  You can tell Rowling didn't write it!  The Potter books I have read 3 times, and enjoy then each time.  This was a waste of money.
 I was taken aback about many of the choices the writers made for Albus' life at Hogwarts, and noticed that the book varied MUCH from Ms. Rowling's original style. A disapointment and disgrace to Harry potter lovers (like me). Honestly, I think the only people who would like this book would be people who absolutely hate the Harry Potter series. I only gave it 1 star because I'm not able to give it 0.
 Loved it and found it to be very much like the characters from the original series.  There was not the depth that is expected in the novels but this was a different format. So it was great.
 I certainly wouldn’t mind following more adventures of Albus and Scorpious with of course the occasional cameos of their families and friends as well as the occasional Hogwarts alumni or staff!
 This is a script for a play. And it is kind of boring.<br/><br/>Give it a miss if you enjoyed the Harry Potter books. It will disappoint you.
 If you're a big fan of the Harry Potter series reread the original 7 books. Much better than this this story. Does not do the characters justice and reads like bad fan fiction.
 Good book overall, but the script style writing loses what makes a book great. You get very little insight as to what the characters are thinking, because everything is about the dialogue and action in the script. The reuse of previous themes of the original series leads to lack of originality that I have come to expect in a Harry Potter book, though there are some nice "turns". Nonetheless, I am so hooked on the Potter series, I still really enjoyed it.
 I LOVED the original books, and most of the movies as well.<br/><br/>It is so so hard not to compare the screenplay version to the original books. The huge lack of details. The lack of content.<br/>But, for what it is it was ok. Not great. Not amazing. But eh....ok. Seeing into the past and future was kinda cool.<br/>I didn't get a real AUTHENTIC Harry Potter-JK Rowling vibe from it.<br/><br/>I hope she writes a real book version of this at some point to do the characters justice.
 Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is interesting if you are a die-hard HP Completest. The trio of authors kill suspense and damage the literary universe with a dopey time travel plot. Whoops - gave away the book  reminder: put "spoiler" at top of essay]. It's probably adequate as a play, as one can almost picture the special effects. But don't expect a real Harry Potter book.
 I liked it as a fan would it had all the elements of JKR's writing, but it lacked something. Sometimes the dialogue didn't seem to match up.  Also it lacked a continuity with the American version of the books especially The Minister for Magic was in The Minister of Magic in the U.S.  Some british slang needed to to be retranslated to American English or a glossary would have been nice. Also some next characters seem to disappear entirely after the first act. Maybe show illustrations or pictures of the cast. It was hard for me too picture the characters in my mind and its usually the first thing I do to build up the Head Canon of what the characters look like.
 Some people know when to bow out gracefully, Rowling isn't one of them.
 I Love J.K. Rowling,and I was devastated when I discovered that I cannot read a script with the ease I expected!!!!!<br/>I am well over the age of majority, and was surprised to find this failing in ME!!  I adore this series, and will be forced to wait until<br/>YEAH the movie comes out (or still yeah!) or the books do!
 So many plot holes! All I could do was focus on the plot holes while reading. And terrible writing style. It's just bad to begin with, and changes in obvious style at some point. Goes from absurdly bombastic to like casual at some point<br/><br/>Still, as a HP fan for literally like 17 years, I just had to get it. Although honestly I don't consider anything past the epilogue canon ;P
 Can't beat the originals but this was a good follow-up. Good way of including old story parts and building on them.
 All in all its very hard to read. Characters and muddled confusing. Have to keep looking back to see who is speaking. Lacks flow. Don't like this type of writing. It is however and interesting story. but not like the other books. I know its meant for the stage or a broadway show but  not how I like to read J.K. Rowling.
 Being a huge HP fan, I was skeptical that the magic of those books, which increased in volume with each new volume ;-), could possibly be replicated in a screen play format.  So skeptical in fact that I wasn't even planning on buying this, where I had pre-bought each of the HP books just as soon as they were available.....but once we reached the publication date, I couldn't resist the allure of buying it with One-Click for my Kindle.....I was delightfully surprised with how much I enjoyed it.  My one complaint, as you might expect, was that it ended much too soon.  Whereas the HP books would give me days of reading pleasure, I finished the Cursed Child in only a few hours.  But the magic was definitely still there!
 I think the play is probably a lot of fun to watch. I looked up the cast of characters. Harry Potter in particular looks like himself. (I am one of those Harry Potter book lovers. who detested the films -- all but the last--mostly because of Daniel Radcliffe's terrible acting and the HP character's completely wrong cinematic interpretation).<br/>So, although I sort of enjoyed reading the play, I doubt very much that I will read it again.<br/>I am sorry I am unable to answer questions two and three. I just can't remember. That shows how shallow my entire experience has been.
 Enjoyable but fails to capture the magic of the original series. A good way to stay connected to the HP world and follow the stories of our childhood heroes. The play format is easy to read but the lack of description and narrative text makes even the most exciting passes a little flat. Worth it if you're a fan. Not a good way to get into Harry Potter if you haven't read the originals, start from the beginning as this one will spoil several storylines. Enjoy!
 Disappointed actually!<br/><br/>I expected more character build for Harry's children, as well as Ron &amp; Hermione's children...I found the story to be predictable without any new twist or adventures, that long awaited fans were expecting.<br/><br/>I am aware it was written for the stage, but it doesn't mean more development could not have been provided!<br/><br/>I am a fan of J.K Rowling, and will continue to purchase other writings, but I just wanted to be honest, about this project
 I'm a little heartbroken about giving a Harry Potter book only 3 stars. But a lot of it was because a play was very different than the Harry I know and love. The twists were also not as unexpected as in the books, but I still loved being reunited with old friends and seeing what their lives turned out to be. Especially Harry and Ginny. Ginny is my favorite character and I rooted for her and Harry from book 1. It was so good to see their lives. I recommend it, but don't expect something with the caliber of the original 7 books.
 While I enjoyed it, this story was not my favorite in the Harry Potter series and just didn't have quite the same feel as the original books by JK Rowling alone. I won't spoil anything, but I was a bit disappointed with the big reveal and ending. However, the new character of Scorpious Malfoy steals the show. Worth a read, but definitely remember it's a play and therefore not as visually descriptive as the novels were.
 You have to read this book and constantly remind yourself that it's a screen play and not a novel. As a screen play it's pretty good! It felt obvious to me that JK Rowling wasn't the only writer. I bet it's great seeing it performed live though. I wouldn't necessarily recommend this to a lot of people. I would hold out for the actual book if one is eventually written!
 The Cursed Child is just as magical and wonderful as the Harry Potter books. You are thrust into a funny, sad, exciting, scary and heart warming story; written the way only J. K. Rowling can write. I wish she would rewrite it as a novel. I would love to read about Delphi's birth and childhood, and the back stories of all the other characters. I can't wait to see the play when it comes to Broadway!
 I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I will say, however, that it feels a little bit like fan-service. That being said, it was a pleasure to read and the storyline touched on many memories from the original book series, using them as a point of reference for much of this adventure.<br/><br/>As an avid Harry Potter fan, I think this was a great read and I look forward to someday seeing the screenplay!
 I wish this wasn't canon? Weird book. The characters do things you do not expect them to do. After having 7 long books about Harry- we know how he'll react to a situation; but he does something different here. Lots of time jumps. I recommend you read it because it's canon, but I won't give it much though. Kinda depressing book.
 This is horrible. I had to read it because I totally Stan the original Harry Potter series... but this? This is just trash. I wish I could undo all the memories and terrible fan fiction that I consumed via this book
 I love harry potter so much but this book was terrible. The story isn't good and the writing style is horrible. I realize it's a play but I wish they'd taken the time to novelize it then maybe it would be better.
 Is this Harry Potter? What on earth? Such a bad -I won't even call it a book-... Don't bother reading. Not among JK Rowling's best.
 Let me start off by saying I love Harry Potter. I grew up reading these books from the day they came out. That being said, I read the reviews on this and noticed most people were discouraged by the fact that this was set up like a play and the JK Rowling did not actually write this book. I knew going into it what to expect because I read reviews about the book. I knew how it was set up and still decided to read it.. and I think it delivered. There were some plots that I had not expected and I thought it was sweet how they included the older characters. This was a VERY quick read because it reads like a play.
 I was dismayed at first with grown-up Harry and Ron. Expected Harry to be more flexible and Ron to be less a clown. Liked the way the old trio came together again and added Draco.
 The reviews on here make me laugh. It's a script. Did you read that correctly? A SCRIPT. It lacks the depth and richness of a novel because it's up to the actors to provide that to the audience in the theater....because it's a SCRIPT. S.C.R.I.P.T. Look up the damn definition if you still don't get it. The people complaining about the plot..I don't get it, I really don't. It's a classic Rowling fly by the seat of your pants action. If she would have taken this story and weaved it into a novel it would have been better than many of her later books in the HP series!! In fact, the ending of this story was magnificent and tragic and I can only imagine how it would have looked like acted out on a stage. The people trashing this story are idiotic and need to go back to reading 50 Shades of Grey for their normal mediocre entertainment.
 This book is garbage. The story line is unoriginal and I'm embarrassed that it's considered part of the HP canon. J.K. Rowling shouldn't have put her name on this.
 It is probably a good story, but after reading the 7 books, a stage script just doesnt have the depth of detail and insight I so appreciate in the novels. This may be the only time I say dont bother with the book, wait on themovie.
 The cons of this book have already been beautifully detailed in other reviews, so I won't be redundant.<br/><br/>Suffice it to say that I'm greatly disappointed in the story line and the fact that it was heavily promoted as the 8th book in the series but is really a fan fiction script in book format.
 I love the Harry Potter series. I adore the fandom. This book was a huge disappointment. It was difficult to get through it because it was written so poorly. At least it was short, so I could grind through it.
 I'm a massive Harry Potter fan so I feel like any fan should absolutely take the time to see what's going on with their favorite witches and wizards.  It does not disappoint!
 Long time HP fan and very skeptical I would like this, but I absolutely did!  Would be awesome if they could get the original cast together to make this into a movie!!!
 The format (written as a play) made it difficult for me to get into the story. I've read all that J.K. Rowling has written and seen the films, and this story does an excellent job of keeping the story line going and keeping the characters ... well, in character. I get why it was written as a play, but would have liked a book format better.
 Wow, did not know it was a Script. My wife told me and she was disappointed, she loved reading the Harry Potter  books, we have a number of each of them, we made sure we had them for our kids to read and enjoy, not this on.
 I almost feel like this shouldn't have been written, but was written anyways to appease fans. A lot of this story-line seemed extremely out of character and some things didn't make a lot of sense. Maybe it was different as an actual play, but I wasn't very satisfied reading this. :/
 The book comes in good condition. I did not like the actual book, however. I've read fanfiction better than this. I don't want to give away the plot, so I won't. There are very few redeemable qualities about this book; Scorpius' characterization is one of them. If anything, read it to discover one of Harry Potter's worst fears (SPOILER ALERT: It's pigeons).<br/><br/>If you want to read a Harry Potter spin-off, just read fanfiction. The cursed Child isn't really worth it.
 I'm not sure that this needed to be written. It was an ok story and I think it was more that Rowling just wanted to give the people what they wanted.
 I thoroughly enjoyed this book, even though there were a few canonical errors and that one scene where the guy lost his wand and then suddenly had it again.
 I'm glad there's a play, I like the concept, but the story is not all I had hoped for. But I did buy it and enjoy it. I think you can tell the parts that JK Rowling wrote herself, and which were by the collaborator.
 It was intriguing to read and bright back the exciting getting of trading a new Harry Potter book, but don't buy it thinking it's going to be like the books or you could be disappointed. I didn't have that expectation, so I was able to enjoy it. I'd rather see the play, but will settle for a script. I just don't accept this story as part of the original books.
 I liked that this was an addition to a classic. I understand the story line had to be edited to fit a play, but I did not like the story plot as much as previously. Some of the actions that are done by the characters I wouldn't necessarily say that they would have ended up that way, but like I said it is nice to have another read added to a great collection of stories.
 This book was so disappointing... it was painful to read. I am a huge Harry Potter fan - I had high hopes for this book (even though I already figured I would not like reading it like a screenplay). It was boring, I had no emotional attachment to any of the characters. It didn't even seem like J.K. Rowling could have written it because the characters from the old series were so unlike themselves. I finished it but only because I bought it, not because I was excited to see what happened.
 I love the Harry Potter novels.  So in depth,  new and interesting. This script has the makings of a great novel where more details can be implemented but in my opinion, way too short. To be honest, I would not have paid what I did if I had realized just how short this was going to be (Kindle edition) .  That being said, I wish the play amazing success! Keep the Harry Potter world turning!
 I'm a big Harry Potter fan to start off and I love J K Rowling's writing style.  This is a great book that's written as a stage play.  It's a great next phase for those of us who want to know what's happened to Harry and his family.  I love the fact that some roles are reversed - Harry's son vs Draco's son and that the two boys have some interesting adventures.<br/>It was fun reading
 Disappointed fan. I ordered it on pre-sale and it so not worth it! Does not go with the story, does not reflect narrative as JK Rowling and is just a bad book. Was excited at first because of another book, disappointed as I read it. Is so simple I read it in 1 day. Does not give you the emotion the HP books use to give me. To be honest is better to have the previous ending in your head than this.
 I rated a 3 because once I got into book I was compelled to finish but I don't feel need to read again and there was no great moment or line that I will carry on with me.  It was a different format and not being a regular reader of plays, I spent a lot of time thinking how this could work on a stage and if I would like it.
 The story is like something out of a bad Harry Potter fanfiction.  Many previously established rules of the universe are broken just for the sake of fitting a rather lazy story into a very short narrative.  There is some good in there, not to give any spoilers but a theme dealing with Harry's parenting style is well done, but it very much outweighed by the bad.
 It is written like a play book so it might be hard for some at first. This book closes the Harry Potter series.  You aren't left wondering what might have happen as they grew older. The book takes the very last scene in the movie where their children are boarding the train. Now all the characters we read and watched are parents and their children are the new generation. I enjoyed every minute of it and this book has given the closure that I feel was needed.
 I wasn't sure what to expect from a stage play, and I can't say I was disappointed...but I would have loved a novelized adaption of what really is a well-conceived and potentially complex story.  The plot is great, with laugh-out loud moments and real character development, but it just felt so rushed.  Makes me long for one of those sprawling 8-900 page novels with all the tiny details and languorous exposition.
 Really looked forward to this, kind of disappointed. The story is too straightforward and has less richness and complexity then Sorcerer's Stone, let alone the later books.
 I have been a die-hard Harry Potter fan for years. I've read all 7 books, about half a dozen times each, if not more. They never bore me.<br/><br/>This however, is very disappointing. Why JK Rowling associated her name with this script is beyond me. The character and the locations may all be Rowling but the rest is just a bad script of fan fiction. While the plot, in the world of Harry Potter, is not far fetched, it is pretty ridiculous. Never could I imagine JK thinking her fans would really like this.<br/><br/>I'm 80% through the book and I don't think I will finish it. I'm going to pretend it was never associated with Harry Potter in the first place.
 Wonderful to get back into the Harry Potter world, but it's hard to compare anything to the original. Harry Potter fans of all ages will enjoy it simple due to the nostalgia that arises. Unfortunately it left me wanting more, and only increased my want to be brought back into a world of witchcraft and wonder. For those on the fence, enjoy the magic, as brief as it may be.
 Unimpressed with this low quality fanfic style writing. Perhaps it's better actually performed but the way the characters were reduced to the broadest strokes and none of the actions they took made much sense based on what we know of them ( Harry, who always wanted a family is going to be awful to his son based on him being in slytherin? please.) really not worth reading, but if you can actually get the effects called for on stage, it might be worth youtubing.
 The book is actually better than what I expected. As a die hard fan of Harry Potter I did not have much expectation when I received the book. But once I started reading I found out that the book I found it is not bad although it is still below the Harry Potter level. Script form of the book was not a problem after finishing a couple of chapters.
 The dialog in this book seemed like it belonged in a comic book. I really missed J. K. Rowling's excellent writing. That being said, once I got started, the story pulled me in. I'm guessing the outline of the story comes from Rowling at least. What I'd really like to see is for Rowling to write a proper novel (or two) from this story.
 Ok the story i liked a lot. Enjoyed the characters new and old. Revisiting old friends and making new ones. They only thing is why couldn't they have put it out like a normal novel instead of a play. Or if you are going to put out a play, video tape it and have the option of seeing it as well. Overall the story was fantastic and definitely worth the read and i would love more.
 Interesting plot, but I felt some personality components of certain characters were inconsistent with those from the original series. For instance, Ron's sort of bumbling, almost insecure nature in this reading made no sense against his teenage self. Looks as if marrying Hermione really turned him into a wuss. Also Harry seems to have lost some personal fortitude over the years. There are points in the cursed child that Harry feels a little too ordinary and thin compared to his younger days. Overall, I would say that the storytelling itself is inferior to the original Potter books. Perhaps some sacrifices were made to adapt the story as a play, but it made for a somewhat disappointing read. Still, it had a lot to live up to.
 I'm currently trying to make plans to see this in London. It's that good. I loved the story, loved seeing new characters, old characters, new relationships, the works. While I'm sure we all miss JKR's witty and funny narration, the stage directions really help flesh this out into something you can see in your mind's eye. Just good luck on not reading it in one sitting.
 I'm sure given the beautiful set design, costumes and special effects, one could easily be blinded by the dazzling theatrical environment and not focus on the content, so I agree this could be a wonderful play in the theater. It has been reviewed that way thus far by critics, but given that most fans out there can't afford a ticket or travel to the UK to see it, they decided to release the script, which is very disappointing. I agree with others in that this does not read like Harry Potter at all, even Harry himself sounds very odd. I kept thinking to myself  while reading the dialogue "Well that doesn't sound like Harry, or Hermione!" which lost all credibility with me. I, like others, am writing this one off and ending the story in my head at Deathly Hollows. I think all fans out there wish JK Rowling would put the time and effort into furthering the world of HP and the series, I would have loved it if she just took 1/4 of this plot line and developed it more so we could immerse ourselves into this Voldemort free, new world and it's new generation characters..
 Like others, I was excited about a new HP book by J.K. Rowling. Unfortunately, this has none of the charm, complexity, depth, or inventiveness of the 7 book series. I seriously question how much J.K. Rowling had to do with it. It really reads like shmaltzy fan fiction. Not only do the new characters have no depth, there's a parade of the old favorite characters that feels like someone had a checklist. "Did we work Hagrid in? Check! How about Snape? Check!" It's all very contrived with none of the nuances of the beloved series. Even the three main HP characters suffer from a depletion of complexity. This won't be one that I ever re-read. I think I may be giving it a pity star just because I loved the original series so much and think it may rightly deserve 1 star.
 this felt like someone trying to justify the story line of the original Potter series by giving some demonstrations of what would have happened if things did not come to pass as the original cannon dictated.  I was really hoping for something a bit more independent from the original story line.  this was more of a re-hash.
 Was so hoping this would be a "omg - I loved it" Harry Potter book. I purchased the hardback book and feel it would have been even more difficult to read in kindle format. Not impressed with reading the play format and I felt it was just a back story to get people interested in the Harry Potter Franchise again.  Disappointed but as it was the only way to catch up on Potter - I slogged through it.
 This is not the original Harry Potter books, but it was a great read. I enjoyed that we learned more about Harry and his life after Hogwarts. I also loved how we got to learn more about Draco and that Scorpius was not what I would have expected. I wish we could have gone more in depth with the characters like a typical HP book, but we have to remember that this is a play, not a novel. I really enjoyed it overall!
 Exhale, inhale, repeat. Like every Potterhead, this is a disappointment.It just seems that the characters I love and still love are just not there. I like the cover and the title.
 Cheap advertisement<br/>They print “JK Rowling”so big, to mislead buyers to think it’s a real Harry Potter book!<br/>What a cheap way to make money off of someone else’s name!
 Reading a play again was like being back in school. Definitely a lot more fun to read than King Lear! I would have preferred a novel. The storyline was good and ticked along at a rapid pace. There was a large cast of characters but it never became overwhelming. Personally I would have preferred more character development and in particular the adult Harry, Draco and Hermione could have been fleshed out a bit more. Instead they were more or less the same as their teenage selves and it was hard to find them credible. The next generation characters were also heavily reliant on the previous Harry Potter books for their development and motivation. A fun read for Potter fans but could do with an accompanying novel to fill in the gaps
 I'm a 68 year old woman....who loves everything Harry Potter.  I did enjoy this book/play, as I enjoy all of Ms. Rowlings books, whether written in her other pen name or as herself,  I enjoyed reading about Harry's relationship with his children, and friendship with Malloy.  It was a little difficult to read it in play form, but on the whole was a fun read.  Joyce Dial, Wichita, Ks.
 Absolute rubbish. JKR, why did you put your name on this and taint everyone's imagination with this "canon"?
 This book is not written by J.K. Rowling. It reads like a poorly written fan fiction and its plot could have been designed by an 8 year old.
 I ordered for example reading.  My son heard from his friends and said it is very poor story.  I've not ask why.  But maybe movie could be good which we are waiting for that, coming up soon.  Me and my son loved any movie or book of "Harry Potter" but this book "Harry Potter and the Cursed Child" with story was not good story.  :-(
 Confusing and disjointed at times.  Sure it would translate better to the stage.  Fun read - only because the characters were familiar and I wanted to see how they developed.  Not J. K. Rowling's best work - though I'm not sure how much she contributed to this.  Will go to the theater performance if I'm still alive when it finally makes the road circuit.
 It was amazing!! My favorite part was how cool, creative and ingenous the special effects were!!! I also loved the story and how it stayed true to the original but added so many wonderful twists. Go see it!!
 Needed this! Been way loooooooong since my last Harry Potter fix. People just need to realize that this is not a regular book/novel. It's a play script! Takes some getting use to, but after if you are a true HP lover this is the real deal! What a great premise for a play and will keep your attention to the end! Thanks J.K for bringing me back!
 I really love the Harry Potter series (so much, I've read it all through at least 6 times and will continue to re-read it).<br/><br/>I knew this was for the play, but I didn't realize that it would simply be the script.  I should have checked out the sample download before buying.  If I had, I definitely would not have paid money for this.
 I was dumb enough to think this was actually Rowling's work. This is unbelievably bad fan fic, at its absolute worst.<br/>What a waste of time and money.
 What a disappointment.  After being in love with JK Rowling HP series for so many years i expected far better than this.  This, THIS is what happens when you sell out and collaborate with others and put your name on it.  JK should have either retired the series completely or written this as a book on her own.<br/><br/>Well, at least the thought of flying to London to see the stage play is no longer even a second thought.  Utterly disappointed.<br/><br/>I intentionally did not comment on the story line itself as many have not had a chance to read it.  Just because I was disappointed does not mean someone else will like, or even love, it.  A few weeks after release, I'm good with commenting on the story itself, but not quite yet when so many are just making their way through it.
 This book is the fix needed for Harry Potter fans. So pleased the story continues. Hopefully this will be made into one great movie, not two. This book brings us back and forth --- past and present which is great for recalling the past books details.  Cannot wait for part two. I thought I'd be put off by the script formatting but I was able to read this book as a book not a script.  Again well done.
 This would have been better if it was written in the same style and with the same details as the series.
 Read and felt like a fan fic. The "surprises" and "twists" were absolutely typical, and the writing style was basic to say the least. Pretty disappointed I spent money on this, but, I went in expecting nothing, and came out really disliking it and that's the risk I accepted with my purchase. Definitely would not recommend to any die hard Potter fans.
 I give Harry Potter and the Cursed Child  by J.K. Rowling (sure there is some dispute on how much she wrote) 4.5 out of 5 stars in my book review that I promise to not give any spoilers.  HP and the Cursed Child is an all around is a fun fast read for high school students and up.<br/><br/>I know there are a lot mixed review on this book, but I still say definitely give it a read.  Though, there are a few things that it is best to remember going into this book.  First, you have to remember that this book is a script. Scripts are different from your traditional novel.  To be honest, I forgot that at first.  The first 20 pages or so was a little frustrating b/c I wasn't getting the detail in the setting, characters, story development, etc.  However, after I remembered that little, but crucial, detail I really got immersed in the story.  I have always felt that it is too hard to compare the books to their movie counterparts.  They are different, and they each have different strengths.  I feel the same thing applies with a script to a novel.<br/><br/>There were several things that I really liked with HP and the Cursed Child.  I really liked reminiscing with the old characters.  I really liked seeing the story continue.  There are some awesome quotes/lines found in the story that I had to write down.  I'd love to share all of them with you, but I promised you no spoilers.  Therefore, I'll share just this one from Scorpius, Draco Malfoy's son. "I, uh, I opened a book.  Something which has- in all my years on this planet- never been a particularly dangerous activity." This quote makes my librarian book loving heart smile.  Even though Scorpius is not my favorite (I was never a Malfoy fan either), I LOVE this quote.<br/><br/>Now, it is true, and somewhat shocking that a Harry Potter book didn't earn a perfect 5 star rating.  Though, I've always been a tough grader and that doesn't change.  I'm not comparing the script to the other books b/c they are different (script vs. novel), but I am judging the book as part of the series and that is where it falters.<br/><br/>Since Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is a continuation of the story I was disappointed that the characters were not always consistent with who they were in the first 7 books.  Hermione was known for being clever in the original series, but I didn't think she was her consistent witty clever self in this book.  I felt there were inconsistencies with Ron and Harry's characters as well.  I don't want to give too much into why they were inconsistent b/c I don't want to spoil a single aspect of the story.  However, it is the inconsistencies with the characters that is the major reason for the less than perfect score.<br/><br/>I still thoroughly enjoyed reading the script book.  I found myself feeling many emotions in the reading.  I was incredibly happy. picking up the book, and concerned, worried, sad, curious, surprised, and more.
 While this script was an attempt to continue the Harry Potter story to some degree, it was nowhere in the same realm as JK Rowling's masterful novels. I felt confused, bored, and disappointed for the lack of creative dialogue and intriguing plot. I found the main characters were portrayed so inaccurately that they were mere shadows of their former selves and didn't even seem like the same people. Where was the "spark" that made us fall in love with them? I adore JK Rowling's fabulous writing, and this publication confused readers into thinking that it would be a tasty morsel ack into Harry's world. Sooooooooo disappointed.
 Oh Harry, after all these years I hadn't realized how me we have in common! We're both Leos. We both turned 36. We are both parents to teenagers. We are both magical and fictitious. I did walk away from this story feeling like you weren't fully there. The overall story gave me fan fictiony vibes. Maybe, given that your mother didn't completely write this. I get the format. I get the development wouldn't be quite the same as a fully fleshed out JK novel. I bought you just thirsty to feel your presence. I felt shadows of you and that at the very least was good enough for me.
 This book was very disappointing. I am not even sure exactly what I was expecting, but this was not it. The characters were not very well developed and there was very little explanation of what was going on outside of the characters conversations. I understand that it's meant to be watched, so you would then see those details but if they are going to release it as a book then it should be a complete story. This felt like I was catching bits and pieces of a story. I don't recommend this at all, very sad waist of $14.99 and makes me fairly unhappy with the whole series.. which is a bummer.
 I love the Harry Potter series, and so I was excited to read this book. I knew it was in play form, so that didn’t bother me. The plot was very strange, and although it had all the Harry Potter characters, I knew from page 1 it was not JK Rowling. I don’t recommend reading this book.
 Terrible, absolutely terrible. It was obviously not even written by Rowling, and it is a disgrace to anyone who has grown up with Harry.
 Clearly only has Jos name on it because they were using her characters. Even though this is a script (and I've read many) this is like horribly written fan fiction. Not her voice at all. I'm going to pretend this book/script doesn't exist. Such a let down.
 It was ok. Enjoyable but no where the same enjoyment of the Harry Potter series. I gave it to my daughter in law to read. She has read the Harry Potter series more than 15 times. She read about 20 pages and returned it... totally unimpressed, drawn in or intrigued. I personally thing having J.K. Rowling name as the larger bold name is deceptive promotion.
 This read is a good book ONLY if you are well adjusted to the world of Harry Potter. This story is written like a screenplay, so if you are expecting a lot of scene development you will be greatly disappointed; however, if you are a TRUE fan of The Potter series this book will just further expand your love for the world of Harry Potter. The story was great, character development ok, scene setting minimal. Overall, I really enjoyed this book, but it wasn't a traditional Harry Potter book you are expecting. I enjoyed the read, but the lack of scene setting seemed almost lazy to me. Either way, JK Rowling creates a wonderful story to further my love for the magical world, and I will continue to read anything she puts out about the subject.
 Hard for me to give a full heart review since I am still reading it, I love the writer Harry Potter series, this one in particular I keep having to stop and reread, since it has been a while since I read the books, I get a little confuse with the back and forths. I will fully review again once I am finally done reading it.
 I personally could never get into the story while trying to read a play format.<br/>Most people probably love it but I didn't make it very far before putting it down.<br/>The other Potter books were all consuming and I hated to put them down for basic necessities such as preparing meals and eating.  Disappointed  would describe my opinion
 Ok, I am a huge fan of HP , I knew exactly what to expect from a play script ,just a storyline was kinda lame for me all that stupid Cedric thing was so bad , I liked a Scorpius character though : smart kid and Voldi/Bellatrix daughter was a good idea ,I wish it was more of her than silly Ron/Hermione jokes ! In general it is just ok , definitely worth 3 hours of your time.
 I actually am a bit disappointed with this book. I understand this is a play, so its quite different than other Harry Potter books. Some parts seemed stretched for no reason, and some parts I wished had more details to help me picture it. I liked Scorpious a lot. And I felt sorry for Draco. I wish we had been introduced to some other Sletherins like Pansy or Blaise. Also I couldn't really get how Ron's character changed so much from what were in the books.
 Disappointing.  What else is there to say?  JKR was obviously trying to tie old players into the plot, but she spent entirely too much time on Albus' disdain for his father, harry, Albus' and Scorpius' "relationship/friendship" and Dumbuldore's ghst/spirit coming back to tell Harry he loved him.  Disappointing.
 Quite honestly the play reads like a poorly developed time travel fan fic. I've read much better and more well thought out stuff on fanfiction.net I was sadly disappointed as I am a huge fan of Harry Potter.
 Let me start off by saying I am a huge Harry Potter fan.  I read the books three times a year, have a season pass to Universal Studios, and have been to Leaky Con.  I started this play and barely made it halfway.  This is time wasted that I will never get back in my life.  I have a hard time believing that JK Rowling even read this, the characters were so off.  Another review described this as a poorly written fanfiction and I 100% agree.  Don't waste your money.  Rent from library or don't bother at all.
 I love Harry Potter to death. I even have Harry Potter tattoos. But this books feels like just a cheep money grab to take advantage of fans who'll buy anything Harry Potter. There are many things characters do in this book that their characters in the original series would have never even considered doing. This book was a complete waste of time and money.
 The books is great, but if you expect a 'Harry Potter' book, you will probably disappointed. I imagine JK and whoever had some great ideas to a fanfiction, and then turned it into a play. It resembles a fanficiton A LOT. I mean, I read A LOT of fanfiction, and this is some of the stuff I've been looking at, so seeing it as an official book was pretty crazy!<br/><br/>Still, it's a great addon to the world, but don't expect it to be in the style of her other books. The writing is more basic (because it's a play), general vibe is more straight forward.
 Of course I wasn't expecting anything as well done as the J. K. Rowling books... The play format was not a factor in my rating.  I didn't think ANYTHING was developed--characters, action, dialogue, plot...  Remember how you read the 7 Rowling books in the series numerous times to pick up all of the little details?  Not happening here.
 I liked this play! It was fun and light hearted, but hardly anything that I would consider cannon. I know that the cursed child ruffled more than a few feathers, but hey, why not go for it? Go wacky! We don't see enough of that in these major series.
 I love all things Harry Potter and this was no exception. I was thrilled to be opening a HP book again. I won't pre-order something I'm excited for again though - I recieved the book 3 days after it was released. I could have gone to walmart and had a copy in hand for the same price on release day or any day after - as it didn't sell out. Live and learn.
 I only give this 4 stars due to the fact that it is written in the form of a script. I do not prefer that particular style. But the characters are familiar, the story is very in line with other HP novels. I thought it flowed well and the new characters held my interest. Its not nearly as detailed as a typical Rowling novel, so you do lose that feeling of being in the book. But overall, I enjoyed it.
 Did not enjoy this book. Found parts of it disgusting; especially where Young Albus kisses his aunt Hermione and Harry has a nightmare where he's wet the bed. (The two men responsible for this monstrosity do not have a very good grasp of the characters from the original series - which I love.) Thankfully I skipped ahead to the end and I don't feel that I missed much; so I'm not sorry!
 While the story is interesting, I found the actions and lines of the characters did not fit who we have known them to be based on the original series. It did not feel like it belonged in the Harry Potter universe and felt more like mediocre fan fiction. JK Rowling signed off on it so I accept what is said and done as Cannon, though reluctantly.
 It's Harry Potter so obviously it was good but not as good as I'd hoped. I was a little frustrated with the portrayal of Harry, Ginny, Ron and especially Hermione. I would say it's still worth the read, it was enjoyable but not up to the high bar jk Rowling set with her first 7 books.
 Harry Potter fans here. Bought this because it was a continuation of the story my 10 yo son loves. He had never read a script before, but he really enjoyed it, ate it up actually. Now he wants it to be a movie!! We were happy to see the story extended beyond the previous books and look forward to further developments.
 I tried to like this, I really did.  Characters are not true to themselves, and the "plot" was klunky at best.  I had no problem with the format, but the storyline itself...  I have read much better fan fiction.  Truly disappointing.  If you must read it - borrow someone's (They WILL loan THIS one!) - or hit the library.
 The Boy Who Lived has turned into a colossal joke. The characters were hollow imitations of themselves, emotions were said rather than felt by the reader and the plot...cancelling Christmas would be less disappointing.<br/><br/>Plays can be amazing but only if the story is solid. The Cursed Child falls so very short of the beautiful world J.K. Rowling cultivated. Shocking she would collaborate with two Budgers that clearly never read the books.  The only other explanation is J.K. Rowling is losing her touch.  It makes me feel bad that I should ever have to give such a Malfoy-worthy review on something that could have been so spectacular.<br/><br/>This book should be placed in the Restricted Section unless you're a glutton for punishment. The only consolation is to know so many other Potter fans are as disenchanted as I am.
 It's nice to see all the familiar characters again.  By it's nature, it is written as a play/screenplay so it is MUCH shorter than the previous volumes...it ALMOST doesn't even qualify as a book.  However, if you like the Harry Potter series, you will likely enjoy this as well.  It is shallow, by comparison, but enjoyable nonetheless.
 So did she just decide to let some fan write a fanfic for how life was going to be after the books? This reads like a bad fanfic, if you want to ruin your memories of Harry Potter then go for it I guess.
 Sorry, I don't know what happened to J.K. Rowlings but this just wasn't up to her standard, so that's all I can say about it, I didn't even make it to the middle before I gave up.
 This was not worth waiting for. I had reserved my Kindle edition well ahead of the release date and then waited till vacation to read it. I read it fully aware that it was a play. That didn't bother me. What I can't get past is that there was none of the color, details and descriptions that are the hallmark of the previous books. I had trouble following the plot and I felt no connection with the characters that made the other books so enjoyable. As another review states, I have to wonder just how much JK Rowling actually wrote.
 As a fan of Harry Potter I have waited a long time for the new book. After I read it I was disappointed. The book has a horrible plot and the ending of Harry Potter and the Deathly hallows (which is the epilogue) did not match up with this book. Poorly written and you could tell that J.K Rowling was not the only one that wrote it.
 Because this title was written as a screenplay first, and not by JK Rowling, it doesn't seem to flow as well as the original series. Starts off very slow and finishes OK.  If you are expecting a book as well  developed and engaging as the first 7, you might be disappointed.
 After two decades of loving Harry Potter, along comes this cursed book, which is nearly dreadful enough to extinguish any affection I've previously felt for Hogwart's.
 as some one into the HP universe, I am happy to have read this. It wasn't a ground breaking HP story, but it was an interesting addendum to the series and worth a read. It's a play, so that style took me personally a minute to get used to, but all in all an entertaining read that I will probably read again.
 While there were some things that struck me as odd about the story line, there was a lot to enjoy. The characters we know and love are all grown up (as are many of us), and the book reflects notable changes of personality and maturity. I'm looking forward to seeing the play and thought it was quite clear that I was purchasing a script and not a novel.
 How could someone so talented write something like this after writing all those wonderful Harry Potter books?  It's like watching a bad movie.  You just want it to end.
 I had high hopes for this installment. I love and still do read Harry Potter all the time. However, this seems like a piss poor attempt to keep it going. There are elements I like but most importantly, the book raises more questions than it answered
 Thought I would have trouble reading in a script form, but I got used to it pretty quickly. Really enjoyed it!
 J.K. Rowling didn't write it, so don't expect the best writing. If you enjoy a book that remotely touches on some Harry Potter lore than this is for you. If you are expecting powerful writing, don't buy it.
 I hate to write a negative review for this. It brings back all of the characters that we love. They seem to be written in ways that do not describe what we know about the characters. Everything seems a little off and the excitement is lacking compared to Harry Potter series.
 I have loved the Harry Potter series and was looking forward to a new episode.  This book was very disappointing and I feel that J K Rowling  decided to write this just to get the fans off her back to continue the series.<br/><br/>I am very disappointed and would definitely NOT recommend this book to anyone
 You can't think of this as a sequel to the JK Rowling books because it is told in a different format (play vs book) and because ... ahem ... it is not actually written by J K Rowling. So if that's what you were expecting you will be disappointed. In addition, it tends to violate some aspects of the HP canon and unlike each HP book, it does not introduce any interesting magical or cultural aspect of the HP world to the reader.<br/><br/>Having said that, the story itself is quite interesting and really compelling in the 2nd half. I would recommend this as an interesting read on its own. But for the HP purists out there, give it a swerve.
 I'm sorry. I love Harry Potter, but this book just made me upset the whole way through. Honestly, while reading I had to walk away because I was getting a little worked up on how ridiculous it was. It was like the creators of the play saw the harry potter movies and decided to write a play about it. I'm very disappointed.
 I am a through and through HP fan but this just did not do it for me. It wasn't the plot or even that it was written as a play. It was the characters themselves. I didn't feel like they stayed true to the original characters as far as personality. Some of the lines just felt strange and unbelievable.
 SPOILER<br/><br/>Did anyone else notice that Delphi disarmed Harry in the final battle and he is wandless and then he somehow has his wand back five minutes later to throw a bolt at her. Albus also mysteriously has a wand in this battle but Delphi snapped his back at Hogwarts. While I loved being back in Harry Potter world I still was so disappointed that JK Rowling allowed one of her stories to be released unedited.
 Arrived when promised and in fine condition.  I'm a huge Harry Potter fan.  I read the book in a couple of hours on the day after I received it.  This story was written in play form and does not have the in depth descriptions that the original seven books have.  It picks up with the story nineteen years after the defeat of Voldemort, with Harry and Ginny, Ron and Hermione taking their children to King's Cross Station to put them on the train to Hogwarts. Then it tells about the adventures of Harry and Ginny's son Albus.<br/>  The story is not of the same writing quality as the original seven books but it is a different form (play) and if performed, would be fleshed out a bit.  I enjoyed reading it.  I am interested in reading anything Harry Potter and hope there are more  books, plays,  etc. coming.
 I love Harry Potter. Everything about Harry Potter. I read fan fic and it is mostly good. This was just bad fan fic. I doubt Rowling had much input. Maybe the play is better since there is much more to fill the senses that way? But the character's interactions were cringe worthy. I kept hoping it would get better, and it never did.
 I mean in terms of production. Because this story feels more like a Harry Potter parody than a Harry Potter story. Almost all the characters are a bit aw-come-on. It starts out well as an extension of the "Epilogue" chapter in "Deathly Hallows"--younger son Albus worried about getting "sorted" into Slytherin by the Hat, and Harry's sage answer. But Albus strikes me too much as that son of a famous man who has an attitude problem. You can easily imagine him totaling his old man's Ferrari (except to keep the Union Jack flying it would be an Aston Martin Vanquish). Ron growing up to be a smooth entrepreneur type--I was expecting him to address his old bud Harry as "baby", almost a Gilderoy Lockhart patronizing. Hermione becoming the Minister Of Magic is a bit much--she was a bit of a know-it-all in her youth, but not THAT much of a know-it-all. All those great marks at Hogwarts so she can turn out a bureaucrat. Yeesh! Ginny remains "sweet Ginny", the lady who as a young girl had an unrequited crush on her big brother's best bud and got the guy in the end. She serves as the standard Earth Mother as an adult, balancing out the emotional highs and lows suffered by her husband and kids. Scorpius Malfoy DEFINITELY NOT inheriting his father's mixture of school bully, bourgeois snob and a wizarding equivalent to a Muggle neo-Nazi--he's actually a nice kid. I almost sympathized with his old man coming to Harry for help because his son being picked on at school. And it would stand to reason that when wizarding kids become bullies, they become high-horsepower ones. But some of the stage directions contain special effects more consistent with a film. Especially time travel. That whole concept was another aw-come-on--I was expecting characters to arrive at their temporal destination with pratfalls and oofs like an old American sci fi time travel TV series which I can't recall the name of. Until I got a ways into this story, I'd been hoping for this story to be "novelized" by Rowling or a performance of it filmed. Not anymore--the story premise is just too fragile. That's why I mentioned Eric Idle as a what-if producer earlier on--it feels like a parody.
 I enjoyed the story but was disappointed  that the characters were hurried through the full 5 years of school. This story could have occurred during the 1st or 2nd year allowing a new series to begin with the children of the original Harry Potter series. Instead this story felt final.
 Unlike many other fans, I felt this story had JKR's fingerprints all over it, and I enjoyed it. Not as deep a read as an adult novel might be, but you have to remember, this is YA fiction, and even at that, like the rest of the HP-verse, it gets surprisingly dark at times.<br/>Now, however, I want more of the other characters!
 Good fast read but felt it was more like fanfiction. Not really true to the HP universe.
 I will admit it was hard at first reading as a screenplay but the story was so fasinating I forgot about it. I would have liked the character of Delphi to have been a bit more developed. All in all i would read this afain and recomend it too
 Huge Potter fan. This book sucked. Unrecognizable characters and the script was overly dramatic. Hated it.
 This is a continuing story of Harry, and his son, and it shows that they are all more real and flawed than we thought. The storyline with Draco was also a nice wrap up too.
 So I can't give this one-star, because I'm too big of an HP fan to do that. And also because, in a vacuum, it would be a fine, entertaining read. I'm sure as a play, it's pretty thrilling to see. But as a hardcore fan, it was a huge disappointment. I actually am surprised that JK Rowling would put her name on such a mediocre much-anticipated sequel to her series.<br/><br/>I don't want to give away any spoilers here. So I'll do my best to review this without revealing any plot lines. For starters the HP books, in my view, were brilliant on many levels, but particularly good due to their character development, twists and super-tight plot lines. This sequel fails on all those levels. It seems that for some very important characters, Rowling throws her previous character development down the drain. It's really troubling. The plot was also oddly predictable. The play's main twist I saw coming from the first possible moment. (I don't think I saw any of her previous twists coming in the HP books.) And the plot/story itself seems wildly implausible in several areas (whereas in the HP books, if you accept the premise that magic is a thing, the plots/stories seem very tight and believable). There are also a ton of holes.<br/><br/>With spoilers, I could name a few dozen problems I have with the play, but I won't do that here. It's just odd that Rowling seems to ignore the canon she carefully established in the HP series and subsequent writings. I just don't get it. With that said, it's entertaining enough, if you can ignore all that stuff and just treat it as a fantasy play without worrying too hard about it fitting with what we know of the HP universe. But for major fans, it's pretty disappointing, I think. As I've seen written elsewhere, it really reads like bad fanfic. I know I've got high expectations for Rowling, but that's what she's established. They weren't nearly met.
 I love The Harry Potter Series. I couldn't put the books down once I started reading each new book.<br/><br/>I was surprised it was a script and not a story. JK Rowling should have written her own story. Not fun or exciting to read in a script format. I waited five months and I am disappointed and not interested in reading it.
 I just hope the movie is really coming in 2019.<br/><br/>I have read the play and while I enjoyed it I can't afford to pay for a trip to the cities where the play is currently being staged.
 I hated the script as opposed to a written novel. The characters were insufficiently fleshed  out<br/>and the plot failed to develop into anything remotely interesting.  what should have been a very interesting look at Harry Potter's life as an adult and the adventures of his children turned into a juvenile attempt.  next time JK Rowling should leave it to her fans to write the next novel. What a shame.
 I agree with many of the disheartened reviews here, they all read much like my own. Not worried about it being in play format at all. but this is about as harry potter as a boggart is a tulip. This review feels more wizard friendly than the muggle garbage I cant even bring myself to finish. This is coming from someone that's harldy obsessed.
 This is really not what I had hoped for. I liked some of the new characters, but I really HATED how some of the existing characters, especially Ron, were treated. I get that you change when you grow up, but I thought they were totally different. And she made poor Ron just stupid.
 If you have read all the previous series, you will will probably not LOVE it, but you will find the story to be neat and nostalgic.  It's different than the rest of the series because it is written in play format, but it doesn't take long to adjust to it, and enjoy reading about the characters we all love and meet some we haven't met before.
 Huge Harry Potter nerd here. Simply seeing a piece of artwork involving Harry Potter can send me into tears. Met my husband in a Harry Potter chatroom. Have read all the books MULTIPLE times each, etc etc. I am a HUGE fan.<br/><br/>J.K. Rowling has disappointed me a couple of times since the last book came out (mostly when she said Hermione and Ron should not have ended up together), but I will say this is the single biggest disappointment. I know she didn't write it - but the fact that she endorses it, and that I am to take it as canon, is frankly sickening.<br/><br/>Time for me to get spoiler-y:<br/><br/>***********SPOILERS***********<br/><br/>The characters were SO OUT OF CHARACTER. I could believe Harry having struggles with fatherhood due to the fact that his was dead. However, telling Albus he wished he wasn't his son? No. Never. Those words would not come out of Harry's mouth, not matter how provoked. Rose being prejudiced towards Scorpius? ROSE WEASLEY, the spawn of Ron and Hermione? They would have taught her to NEVER judge based on house, I feel that she would never behave like that, shunning her own cousin just because he wanted to be friends with Scorpius. You're trying to tell me Draco Malfoy would be okay with his son befriending a Potter, and would have taught his son as much, but Hermione/Ron did not pass this along to Rose? Hermione was not her normal witty self, Ron did at least have some humorous moments - but Harry was just so off. Shunning family for work, telling Albus he couldn't be friends with Scorpius, his BEST FRIEND. That is something Harry would NEVER do. He knows the importance of friendship more than anyone! That is practically the whole point of the books. I just don't believe it.<br/><br/>Don't get me started on Voldemort having a daughter... He was never the type to be interested in procreating. I guess I could look over this, maybe he wanted to pass on his name, WHATEVER, but the fact that she is just kept hidden for years, and reemerges as Amos Diggory's nurse... why wasn't Harry's scar hurting the whole time? Why did he just now start to feel her presence? Why on earth would she choose to save Cedric in order to save Voldemort?! There are so many other ways she could have done that, much CLEANER ways, that perhaps wouldn't spawn a million different alternate timelines. And the time turner.. not even freaking canon, although I guess now I am supposed to consider it canon - going back in time as much as you want apparently, not to mention all of the things that doing that would change, and the fact that some people even had problems with how the third book handled messing with time. WHY CHOOSE THAT AS A PLOT? It's so hard to believe even when done properly. There are INFINITE other possibilities (as many other, BETTER fan fictions have explored). They could have done such great things with the story of Harry's kids. Instead they did this.<br/><br/>And Cedric becoming a death eater? Because he got humiliated at the triwizard tournament? HAS THE AUTHOR EVEN READ HARRY POTTER? Cedric was a purely GOOD human being, he would NEVER go to the dark side, especially over something so trivial. I don't even know if Cedric had the ability to feel humiliation, he was so confident in himself and his abilities. The fact that the entire plot of the book rests on him becoming a death eater like that is so ridiculous, it makes me sick to my stomach. He would've made a joke out of it and moved on, he didn't care if he won the tournament. I cannot believe this book was allowed to exist.<br/><br/>There were a very few select moments that I did enjoy. The flash of Hagrid as he picked Harry up out from Godric's Hollow (but, then again, anything involving Hagrid makes me melt). The fact that Albus was sorted into Slytherin was great, and the fact that Scorpius had a crush on Rose was great as well. Hermione being Minister of magic has long been my head canon. I admit I did shed some tears when Harry watched his parent's die, but only because that's a sad moment from the actual books. I don't like that he was there to witness it, along with all his friends and Draco. He saw it in his dreams, that should've been enough. There were some funny moments, mostly from Ron or Scorpius, but other than that, I really find nothing redeemable.<br/><br/>So, so disappointed.
 I know, I know...it's Harry Potter.  I am a big fan too but found this script (I liked that it was a script) was rather messy for her normal fare.  It got better as one got into it, but didn't ever like Harry again.  Good story and plot as always though.  I can't in my wildest imagination think of sitting through five hours of it in a theater however.
 I read all of the Harry Potter books (literally 5 times each); I bought the books on CD and listened to them at least 5 times each; I own all of the movies (even though I do not particularly care for the movies).  I thought this script was terrible.  I was a theater major in college and I have done some professional stage work, so reading a book in script format was not a problem and I have found this very entertaining with other scripts.  With HPatCC, I could not even finish the 1st act.  The writing was not up to JK Rowling standards by any stretch of the term.  Harry did and said things that I frankly could never picture Harry saying.  This was one of the biggest let downs and I would not recommend this book at all.
 NO SPOILERS HERE!<br/>I have read and enjoyed all the previous books in the series. I liked visiting old friends again, but the story here is sorely lacking.  I understand it was written for the stage and so the detail is not as in depth as a novel.  The problem is that the story itself doesn't make a lot of sense and doesn't feel like the next logical step from the originals.  Read it if you like, but borrow it from the library.  As another reviewer states, " it's like poorly written fanfic".
 I paid $15 for a play transcript, which is fine. But i was expecting something of the quality of writing that the novels were.<br/><br/>If your a true hp fan. Then your not gonna stomache the fact that they made ron a complete moron, and harry a bad father.<br/><br/>It was a hug let down
 Terrible!  I love, love, love Harry Potter and eagerly anticipated this story. Perhaps this is wonderful as a play, but reading it was painful. Honestly, did we have to bring Voldemort back up?  I'm over that story.  These new characters are intriguing, and they could have their own series..... without Voldemort.
 crap fan fiction. End of. I'm going to just pretend this horrid mess never happened and go with the REAL ending, "all was well."
 Ir wasn't up to her slandered.  It was boring..  At this point I won't be buy any more of her books
 This is not a very good story if you have read any of the other Harry Potter books. If you really love the Harry Potter characters and were missing them for so long, then this book is a welcome throwback to those bygone days. It's just not up to par with what you're used to. Sad, really. Truthfully, it's not a horrible story, but it's just not a very good one either. The new characters seem a little wooden and shallow and just not done with the depth I've come to expect from JK Rowling. Bottom line, tho? If you're jonesin' for a little more of the Harry Potter world that's burning in your brain, this will satiate your desire for a little bit, just don't expect your high to be that good :).
 The bad news: It is not another Harry Potter novel by J.K. Rowling. The good news: It is a delightful play, even when experienced only on the page, that is true to the Harry Potter world and its characters, involving, and surprising. I read through it without stopping—and I look forward to reading it again after I see it on stage.
 High hopes somewhat dashed. Although we enjoyed reading the book out loud as a family like we used to do with the other books when the kids were smaller it was to shallow of a story and to predictable to really grab the imagination like the other books could. This might work better seeing it on stage or as a movie although I won't be running to buy tickets to the show if it ever makes it's way over the pond.<br/>Let me just go back to re-reading book 1-7, I can keep doing that forever.
 This upset me greatly as a true Harry Potter fan. It felt like a fanfiction, and didn't have any of the true Harry Potter feel. The plot was a bit ridiculous (some sections extremely ridiculous), and the characters were not true to their previous personalities at all.
 I don't ever plan to read this book because I've heard it sucks.  But I'm a huge potterhead,  like a real one.. one that's read the books several times and hates the movies... I bought this to add to my HP collection.
 I found myself wondering how this play could possibly be staged for it has much of the rich imagination of the original series. The narrative is just as magical as the novels, and I loved both the new generation of wizards and the evolved versions of our original three heroes. The only disappointment for me is that the story doesn't continue. This episode focuses primarily on Albus - perhaps James and Lily will get their moments in the spotlight as well? We can only hope.
 ....to anyone who grew up with and loved the Harry Potter series this will feel like incredibly uncoordinated, unprofessional fan fiction. It is truly awful. The characters are not remotely themselves, the language is juvenile and oversimplified. I can't quite summarize just how terrible of an experience this was for someone who cherishes the original. Harry Potter 8 it most certainly is not. Don't waste your time.
 I like this book, however if you are a huge fan of the 7 books like me you may be disappointed or upset actually. It is not in the same style (is a play instead of a novel). It is much shorter and takes too many turns from the storyline of the books. It was not what I expected but I did like it.
 Just don't understand why Rowling would agree to put her name on this book..... It's a very amateurish work to begin with. The story is not strong, characters are flat, and the script relies too much on magic (CGI in movie) so I can't imagine how it could be put on stage. Avada Kadavra would look super cheap without CGI on stage...
 When I purchased this, I was not aware it was a play.  I am generally not a big fan of plays, so I was unsure if I would enjoy this book.  But once I got past the first five pages or so, I quickly forgot that I was reading a play, and instead just really enjoyed reading the book!
 Great for fans.
 Looking forward to the play. I want to see the words connect with the visual elements described. All in all I loved it I just wish it were a full novel or two because I think it could have and maybe should have easily been that. And still made into a stage play. It was short but cute and most importantly, JK Rowling gave us all the characters back and THAT is a gift.
 I definitely enjoyed it, but the screenplay version of a Harry Potter story was disappointing in comparison to the richly detailed stories of the past. I felt like you couldn't get to know the characters in the same way and I read through it so fast. Looking forward to seeing the play though!
 I have to say i quite liked this 8th part of Harry Potter. I was quite worried that the book was going to be bad, due to the previous negative reviews I had read stating that it read like fan fiction and not like Rowling, however i was quite please with the outcome. I have to admit at times the characters did seem to act a bit too childish for my taste (compared to harry, ron and hermione's mature look on life.. but then again, they had harder life experiences than their children), but over looking that,  the main story was quite good and if you just really remind yourself that Rowling DID write this,  you can overcome the negative parts and learn to love the story as a whole. Recomended for any Potterhead out there!
 It was okay. Just okay. I was disappointed. I expected it to be written like a play, so that was no surprise. I guess I missed the in-depth character development. All the characters were, well, half-written. Some explanation would have been nice. I was greatly disappointed and sold my book as soon as I could.
 Fantastic story but small print with thinly inked font makes it hard to read. Suggest getting a different style in print.
 It doesn't live up to the Harry Potter standard.  Was more like a fan fiction.  I, personally, am not considering this cannon.  It just wasnt that believable with everything we know of the characters.
 I fully understand that this is about the "cursed child" and it isn't a Harry Potter book. Even so, I want a refund. This play/story added nothing to the Harry Potter universe. There were only 2 things I liked about it. It was tedious, poorly written and there were grammatical errors. If the need was felt to contribute anything more to this series, by the author or otherwise, it should have been to properly end Harry's journey. What did Harry, Ron and Hermione do after Hogwarts? Other than to get married and have children. Did Harry become a professor? Where is Hagrid? There were so many loose ends that really should have been tied up. I wanted more from The Deathly Hallows than to know the victor of Harry's battle with Voldemort. (I am still very disappointed with the ending.)
 Self-referential and slow with more re-hashing of old plot than new creativity.  Rowling has been so inventive in the books, it makes me suspect she didn't have much to do with writing this play.
 I went into this book knowing it was a play and that I would be reading a script. I also knew that it wasn't written by J.K Rowling herself but was approved by her. Even knowing all this before reading I was still disappointed. It felt like some off brand fan-fic. I don't accept this story as canon and even the dialogue from many of the characters doesn't seem to fit them.
 I reread the original 7 books for the third or fourth time in anticipation of this one; I was so eager and excited, I finished book 7 yesterday and immediately picked up "...the Cursed Child". To put it nicely, it was a huge disappointment. It didn't read like any of the rest of the Harry Potter series, and not because it was a script - I wonder how much Rowling actually wrote. There were a few (a very few) interesting parts; none of the characters had much depth to them; the original characters weren't themselves; there was very little (if anything) to take you into the "world of Potter"; the storyline was not well thought out; there was a huge detachment from the original series (and not because so many years have passed);... Maybe the actual play is better, but I won't be wasting my money on it to find out.
 Overhyped by everyone. I could not enjoy it with its massive plot holes and cheesy moments. The characters also in many ways are not true to the original series but that can be explained by the fact that they are older. It had a few good moments but overall a disappointment.
 So bad . Not believeable at all. Had maybe 2 funny parts . The rest felt forced and rushed.
 Who: Our favorite Harry Potter characters all grown up<br/>Positives: The book its self is very well designed. The story explores other options then the one we know<br/><br/>Negatives: Collaborative writting always seems to miss the mark across all genres. It feels even worse knowing that the mark was missed on my favorite book series. J<br/>K disappoints. I wish I could time turn back and not read it.
 As an avid Potter fan, this was a sad departure for me. The characters didn't evolve and were somewhat flat. Perhaps we were spoiled by the rich language used in the other books, and so the lack of meaningful prose was sorely missing.  Although this was meant as a script, and perhaps the play will be great, the book was less than inspiring.
 How could this lousy piece of garbage be touted as brilliant?  Nowhere did I see the world and characters Rowling had created. If we had met this Harry Potter in the first book, there never would have been the sequels or the movies. No magic, none of our beloved characters, none of Rowlings great story-telling. Just a money-grabber.
 Once you got the rhythm of reading it, it was a good story.  This is a fast read and can be done in a couple of hours.  Also this book isn't for the 4th grader that just finished the series- so don't hand it to your kid without reading it first to make sure you're ok with the contents
 When I first read about this story, I was not sure what to think. I took a chance and bought it. It picks up at the of the deathly Hallows part 2 and works through the story of great characters. It keeps a good place and answers a lot of questions.  It easily ensnares you and you cannot put it down.
 Had a hard time with the format (it's the script from the play) - felt it didn't develop the characters much, I think it could be rewritten into an actual story/novel.  Did not read like a j.k. rowling/ Harry Potter book, so if that's what you are looking for, this is not it.
 Before anyone complains, remember that this is a stage play and not a "book" or novel. If you take that into consideration then it's great. If you were expecting the typical novel then you'll probably be disappointed by the length and lack of descriptors and character development.
 The book is out and its one to be loved. The narration is of a play and I was really concerned being a long time potterhead whether I would ever accept a style which I have never accepted in any other book. But the authors do a magical job, your heart and head become the theatre and its a great book! A must have for us collectors.
 A lot of people have conplained that the book so quickly skips over the hogwart years of albus potter--and it does--but we have already seen the hogwarts years.  A little mote time couldnt have hurt but was not necessary.  This story has a lot of good in, and is a worthy edition for any potter fan.  It is not the 10/10 that the books are, but its not bad.  There are some silly or cliche time travel things (minor issues) but no biggy--the story is about characters--and how past has affected them and thats the endgame and as a play, is the sole purpose.  4 stars, 7.5/10.
 A pollyjuice potion has disguised this bad book as a Harry Potter book, it's not worth a read (and I grew up reading the books and watching the movies), this adds nothing to the series and actually kinda tarnishes it...
 This is written in screenplay form, so if that isn't something you like, avoid it.<br/><br/>I liked the additional details the story adds to the canon of the original Harry Potter books, but to be honest I've read better HP fanfiction online than this. I really wanted to like it, but I doubt I will re-read it.
 This was a good story, and it was fun to revisit the old characters. However, this shouldn't be taken as part of the original, absolutely amazing, series. I wished it wasn't billed as "book 8." It's a decent side story, but not a necessary addition to the series.
 It was really nice to revisit beloved characters and learn about new characters but the format (play script) was disappointing. I miss the rich details that Rowlings brought the Harry Potter books. This reads nothing like the original books. I know it was planned that way but it was still a let down. I just didn't enjoy it as much as I wanted to.
 -this book was a fun read to hold on to Harry Potter<br/>-I was extremely excited to see how the future of their lives and their kids lives turned out<br/>-Slytherin concept is perfect<br/>-plot is rushed through and too jumpy due to play concept<br/>-actual cast for the play terrible if you enjoyed the movies, having set looks and personalities that defined them in the movies changed will throw You off<br/>-worth the money just don't get to excited<br/>-it should be re-written in a book format not play to fill in the missing spaces
 Like reading bad fan fiction, too much material taken from previous story lines, they had 10 years to think of new material. If J.K. really was done writing about Harry's world, she would have stopped cold turkey. Don't waist our time and yours writing past and present stories for characters or writing out Hogwarts school books. I'm never going to embrace Pottermore and as a super fan I have tried. Put all that information in one place, a novel. I do like that she wrote the screen play for Fantastic Beasts, it's an interesting premise and steamed from the the kind of writing I just put down, but it took a long time for a good idea to come from this. She just gave the play write a few tips then added her name to this project it seems. Ron is like movie Aron in this play, Heromine was cold, Harry would never have said what he did, he would be the best Father ever since he never had family until now, and sure fine go back in time or to a portrait to get yourself a Snape or Dumbledore moment, but why flash back to Hagrid multipul times yet never see him, ya'll know he would be around. Was this Harry Potter or Star Wars?
 Very happy with this purchase as an avid Harry Potter lover. It wasn't exactly what I was expecting, but I'm extremely happy with the story line nonetheless. No noticable damage was on the book (pages and dust jacket included). I highly recommend it as a good read.
 It took me a little time to embrace the stage-play format of this story, but once I did, I really enjoyed this book. I'm sure I'm not alone in wanting to see this turned into a movie.
 I am a huge Harry Potter fan and love everything J.K Rowling writes about that world.  That being said this did not have the same feel as her previous works. This will not make me very popular with other fan but it felt like fan fiction. Good fan fiction, just not Rowling's usual feel.
 I'm glad she released this because I will never get to London to see the actual production. But, there were character inconsistencies throughout the book, and several disappointing behaviors of characters we've come to know and love. Also, the main character switched about three times through the book, so it was difficult to really invest in the story.<br/><br/>All in all, I would buy it again because I adore the original 8. And, I commend Ms. Rowling's courage in releasing this. And, I'm so glad she made this a play, thereby leaving the original 8 alone, but still revisiting the magical world of Harry Potter.
 It was nice to be back in the HP world, even for a bit. It's a play so don't expect it to read like a novel but I thought the story line deviated too far from the original which made it less appealing. As a HP fan it is worth the read (although I've read better plays).
 The story was great (many surprises) but since this was all dialogues (I can understand this was a screenplay or a script) it lacks the details I was expecting from the original books that would make this book great! Hope this will be made a movie! I do not think the theater play will be showed near where I live.
  spoilers] I was so excited to get another Harry Potter story, but this doesn't have any of the traces from previous installments. The very limited descriptions I could deal with, because J.K. did such a great job creating this world that I could SEE everything in my mind without it being described to me. The big problem being all of the characters are unlike themselves. I understand people change in 20 years, but not to the point that they're completely different people. Also, I don't think Cedric was a big enough character to base a whole book around. If you want to reverse time to save someone, why not go for Dumbledore or Harry's godfather? Ya know, someone important. The pace and content is way off, too. It starts off great, dives into bad territory, gets better, gets into worse territory, gets better and ends on a very average not. It wasn't the journey to Hogwarts that I was looking forward too. Not bad, but far from great.
 After seeing the 2 parts of the show and not getting everything, this book is necessary to understand the nuances.
 Honestly, I love the Harry Potter series.  What it did for me as a child I can never forget.  I read it multiple times as well because I am so in love with the stories. With that being said I have to wonder how much J.K. contributed to this play. I know plays are not books but everything about this story seemed so unauthentic and not true to the Harry Potter we've grown to know.  The book in short was dissapointing.  I'm glad to have an 8th part so I can continue with the adventure but this was a let down.  I think if there are to be more Harry Potter books it needs to just be J.K. alone and written as the other 7 are written.
 I read many of the reviews which made me think this book would be complete trash. I don't think it was actually that bad in fact I would suggest you do "waste your money" on this book. The book was written in such a way that I couldn't put it down there were a few aspects I didn't appreciate as much but it was an overall good book.
 Of course it's different from the original novels. But it was still really good. It felt like visiting old friends. I wish it were longer!
 I'm too big a fan of Harry Potter - and JK Rowling - too think this is anything other than glorified fan fiction to which JK so how affixed her name.<br/><br/>Come to think of it, most fan fiction I read is better than this.
 (Spoilers)<br/>This story starts out slow and a bit dull but grows to be increasingly interesting only to fall flat at the end.<br/><br/>The bits where there is time travel and alternate realities is a lot of fun but it all culminates to a rushed ending. I'm sure this was better as a play overall.
 wish it took a narrative rather than screenplay liked the old series better, wanted the series to turn out differently but just happy the potter world is continuing
 Unfortunately I just didn't like the story.  I could really tell that it was not written by J. K. Rowling.  Also, I know it was a play, but it definitely would have been better served if it was rewritten as prose for this format.
 Wow. How great was it to return to Hogwarts with another new adventure? My overall thoughts on The Cursed Child - loved it - and would absolutely love to see it on stage if I ever get to London again. My aim is not to include any spoilers in this review, so here goes.<br/><br/>It's widely known that The Cursed Child is the product of J.K.'s world and that it isn't a book completely penned by her as such, but a script for the London play. So, the first thing you need to do is keep that mindset ... it's full of dialogue that reads differently from a book but draws on the reader's own knowledge of the HP world for atmosphere and detail.<br/><br/>The focus of the story is on Harry's son, Albus, and Malfoy's son, Scorpius. Who would have thought I would find any son of Draco Malfoy likable? But they're not the total focus ... fans are rewarded with the return of all of their favourites, in one way or another.<br/><br/>We've all wondered what happened to Harry and Co after that last scene at Kings Cross in Deathly Halllows. Well this amazing story shows us what was, and what may have been. It's a great way of exploring how things in the past can impact the future, and of all the different possibilities, which I know have been thrown around by fans since HP7.<br/><br/>IMO I think that this one sits with true fans, in that the storyline pays tribute to many of the great things that we've read in the other books over the years. It's like we are returning to events and scenes, but with a slightly different perspective. We all have our own imagined visions of what happened in books 1-7, and of course, we've seen the movies that give us a great visual reference to look back on. I'm not sure that readers who haven't read HP or at least seen the movies (Are there any muggles like that?) would be able to translate the script into their imagination without prior knowledge of the settings and events it refers to.<br/><br/>Other reviews that I have read for HP8 have been mixed, but that's natural given that this series means so much to so many people. I had been looking forward to this book since I first heard it was coming, and now that I've read it, I have a tinge of sadness that it really is the last of the HP tales. They say .... all good things must come to an end ... but ... at least we have Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them on the horizon to look forward to.<br/><br/>IN A NUTSHELL - Loved it.
 Would have been easy to not tell Amy more stories, but Cursed Child risks much by taking us back to Harry Potter's world.  Yet it succeeds by telling a new story with familiar characters with several Suprising twists along the way.  Clearly written with theatre in mind;  it is still a great read and you just can't put it down!
 If you're a Harry Potter fan, you'll probably love it just because.  I liked it, but, because it's written as a stage play, it isn't as involved as the stories.  I read it in less than 2 hours, and I'm not a speed reader.  I did like the story line though.  I would love to see a series of books on the next generation of Potter folks.
 Im a huge fan of the HP books. I preordered this one and was so excited. But this book sterts so so then it gets soooo bad is umbrearable to read. I just wanted to slap the characters over and over again.
 Did you ever wonder what sort of adult Harry Potter became? A traumatized child and teen, a world savior - what hope he had to not retain some neurosis.<br/><br/>And JK delivers on thar promised - a kind but confused man, struggling to raise a son who lives in the shadow of his famous dad. All the elements of a traditional conflict of generations play are here, but they are wrapped in the always entertaining world of Magic and that makes a predictable journey actually enjoyable.
 The hardcover edition is really beautiful and will fit right in with your hardcover collections. I was really happy with the quality and I hope they allow us all to see the actual play someday.
 This was nothing like the original series and ruins the world originally created. Some plot lines make no sense to the original story and a disappointment.  If you loved the original series, leave it on Book 7.
 A engaging read but characters are not to true to the Harry Potter series.
 So disappointing. Because it is a script, it lacks all the moodiness, exposition and ambience which made all the other books such an immersive experience. Took me forever to finish because it bored me so.
 It was strange reading this 'play' version of a Harry Potter story.  It flowed pretty well and the story line was good but truthfully, I would rather have had a full blown, full length story in book format.  I still reread the Harry Potter books regularly and still enjoy them.  Thank you J.K. Rowling!
 Huge HP fan and the hype was more than the book delivered. I still enjoyed it even though I am in agreement with others that it doesn't seem like JK Rowlings work.  Reading as a script might turn people off as a lot is left up to imagination. I almost wish this would have been written like the other HP books so we could have more details, but I'm just happy we had a glimpse into Harry's future.
 This was the most disappointing read, I couldn't even finish it. Regardless of whether or not it was a play, it didn't even feel like the original characters, even aging doesn't turn you into these 'grown up' versions. Wish I hadn't wasted the time or money on this. I would not, in any way, recommend this to anyone.
 Not the characters you loved, a plot full of holes (and contradictions with the books).<br/>Ron becomes a drunkard idiot, Harry contradicts his statement given at the end of book 7 about being in Slytherin, Hermione becomes a hysteric woman.<br/><br/>The plot is banal (with the time-turners and the patching of time). You loved book 3 because events were written so that when the modification of the past happened, everything made sense: the past was not modified at all. Here they actually change the past.<br/><br/>If you consider it as a fanfic, it is almost OK. But as a book from JKR, and a canonical one? No way.
 The story line is underdeveloped,  the characters are flat und the writing itself has no spark. I quite enjoyed the first 4 books as they managed to convey a lot of the emotions behind the characters dialogue. The quality after that has gradually decreased. And this last story could have been so much more. Sad to think they were just written for the money, not the love of storytelling.
 I hesitated to buy this bc it wasn't actually written by JK Rowling. I decided to give it a chance and now deeply regret it.  I would give zero stars if I could.  These are not the characters that I know and love.  The author was not able to capture any of Rowlings' magic in any aspect.  The characters were bland wannabes, fake and unfamiliar.  The tired plot is one that has been done many times, think Butterfly Effect or more recently 11/22/63.
 Great book. Huge fan of the Harry Potter series. Anyone that is this is a must own. Written like a play so its a different read just a heads up. Definitely worth the money. Don't miss out on this book go get it.
 Okay, it's got some sizeable plotholes, but the nostalgia factor and its sheer Potter-ness mean I really, really enjoyed it. I hadn't realized just how much I missed reading HP until I got this, and tore through it with my sister as fast as we could read it. So much fun. Don't expect a fully fleshed-out novel (remember it's a play!), and enjoy the ride.
 I knew it was a script from the play.  I did not know it would be so boring.  I did not know that the character's actions and decisions would seem so out of character compared to their personalities in the original Harry Potter books.  A waste of time and money.
 There were many cursed children, immediately nullifying the title of a "single" cursed child. Right off the bat, my expectations of were not met. Secondly, since JK didn't actually write this book in its comprehensive form, the veracity of this branch of potter-history (forgive me for my terminology) remains unverified. For all intents and purposes, this is what we deem "fan-friction". Q.E.D.
 I wanted to love this book. I've remained a loyal HP fan since my childhood and was estactic about the new book. However, the screenplay format is a tough read. It loses the charm and story telling which made Rowling famous. I'm sure seeing the actual play would be wonderful, though. But overall, I am glad for the look into Harry's adult life.
 Not great. Skipped over a lot, didn't develop characters well. Ruined established characters. I will ignore this as part of the series. It does not fit at all. Waste of my money.
 This book isn't just bad, its so bad that it actually takes away from the greatness of the rest of the series. The dialogue is artificial, bland, and completely unbelievable. The plot is unoriginal. I cannot believe Rowling actually put her name on this, and I'm sure she didn't write any of it. I'm halfway through so far and each time I put it down, I debate not finishing it.<br/>If you love everything Harry Potter and want that world to stay magical in your imagination, avoid this book. It only serves to tarnish the name.
 I really liked the book and the plot.  It was different, in that it was a play format instead of novel, but still delightful.  If anything, I wish it could have been a full fledged novel which gives you so much more detail and lets you be with the characters longer.  I just love the second generation of Hogwarts students.  A great read.<br/>Brenda
 Probably written as a quick  fix for all the Potter fans still missing Harry…<br/>I kept hoping for more sustenance, but it was just a quick peek into their adult lives.
 The book came in perfect condition! Thanks, Amazon.<br/><br/>However, don't waste your time buying it. The script is a major let down and ruins the previously established magical world.
 I bought it for the nostalgia. It really is an okay book but it's written as a script and I personally could feel the underlying message building throughout. That wasn't my favorite but I'm glad to have read it. Probably won't read it again... but I'm glad that I read it.
 I refuse to acknowledge this as part of the Potter universe. It reads like a play made up by 7-year-olds. The more you think about the plot and characters, the more you realize this contradicts the amazing world Rowling crafted. I'm not sure why she decided to give this her blessing (she did not write it).
 As a play, I can imagine this is fantastic. As a huge HP fan, I was not big on the story and it did not read too well, either.
 IMHO, this has nothing to do with the wizarding world of Harry Potter that we all know and love.<br/>The characters have the same name, but are not the same characters. If you try to read it as a different universe, with different names... nope, even then I wouldn't recommend it.<br/><br/>I don't think JK Rowling contributed more than signing her name, it doesn't feel like Harry Potter. It doesn't read like Harry Potter. It's just not Harry Potter. Don't read it thinking it will be a sequel to the story that pre-ceded it. It's not.<br/><br/>It's not expensive, it's not a long read, and I still don't think it's worth it. Sorry :/
 I'm a huge Harry Potter fan - read the series multiple times, seen the movies so, so many times, done all the cosplay stuff.  You get the picture.  But this was absolutely awful.  Really, truly, awful.  The characters were completely out of character in so many of their "lines".  Maybe it works on the stage, I haven't seen the production, but this did not work.
 Interesting read. The only flaw would be it is written as a script, but you are told of that so it is not a surprise I just didn’t care for it as much. But as a lover of the Harry spotter series this one is great also!
 should be 3 1/2 stars......i enjoyed the storyline but felt the tone of the dialog between Albus and Scorpious was unrealistic. Have read complaints about Albus being whiney and a jerk.  Teenage angst, people!! Remember Harry in Order of the Phoenix?  I could barely stand him.  Some characters remained flat and I felt they turned Ron into a bit of a brainless buffoon.  You can tell this was not pure JK Rowling...in fact I would be surprised if she did more than read the story premise and give her approval.  It is a play script so takes some adjusting to.  All that being said...this is a must for any Potterheads!!
 Very disappointed. I bought this book for my son because he has read every Harry Potter book at least twice. He loves the Harry Potter series. I thought this was a new book. I had no idea that it was a script. I haven't given it to him yet but I have a feeling he isn't going to like it.
 I have loved it. I saw some critique before reading but I am saying you - read it.<br/>It's really the masterpiece. I won't' spoil but the twists...Ummm. I sit before the book and all the time thought authors will fix it? Or not...?Til the END!
 I, like may other reviewers, grew up on the Harry Potter books and they hold a special place in my heart. In the series, J.K. Rowling draws readers in with her descriptive imagery and character development. If you read the books before watching the movies, I'm sure you experienced that moment of "Wow! That character came to life on screen exactly as I imagined." This new expansion of the Harry Potter series completely lacks the magic of the original seven books; there is neither imagery nor character development. Albums Severus's problems seem like the trivial banalities teenagers often feel during their adolescent years. The original characters seem at odds with their book descriptions -- Harry is weak-minded, Ron a "hilarious" jokester, and Hermione's spells were unable to keep out a few teenagers?<br/><br/>The character I most enjoyed was that of Scorpius Malfoy, as it seems that the writers put most of their character development into his persona. Also, the idea of Hermione as the Minister of Magic was smart, but poorly executed and underdeveloped.<br/><br/>I agree with many others that this does not read like a storyline written by J.K. Rowling. J.K. Rowling's words brought magic into the homes of people all over the world. In this story the magic falls flat.
 Story line was so so. Hated how it was written as lines for a play. If it was written in a book format the book would be very small.<br/>Not worthy of J. K. Rowling. Glad I bought the kindle edition and not full price for hardcover. Waste of money.  So disappointed!!
 This book is like Fantastic Beasts. its written like a script not an actual book. So if you haven't seen the play then it would be a good read. I bought because we are big Harry Potter fans so we didn't mind
 Another great success by J.K. Rowling a lesson of love, for all to learn and appreciate today. Also the action was interesting and unpredictable! One more brilliant book and very entertaining, such a drama with all it's ups and downs.Love it !
 When I starred reading this, I knew it was play and I knew it was based on a story by J K Rowling, not written by J K Rowling. I've been a big Harry Potter fan for years, rereading the books multiple times. I also enjoy reading plays and watching plays. With all those caveats in place, I sat down to read this.<br/><br/>It's awful. Really, really bad. Just don't even bother.<br/><br/>The dialogue is weak. There is no character development. The scenes are 1-3 pages long, quickly jumping to the next sad, poorly thought out, painfully bad scene. I can't even figure out how this would be staged as there are 4 acts and 75 scenes in 45 different locations.<br/><br/>Reread the REAL books and imagine the characters' futures. Don't waste your time on this play.
 She said she was done, then we get another book that is basically a transcribed play. Fine, I'm cool with the format. What I am not cool with is the quality of the story. It was rather boring until the last act. Too much time traveling. Ending was dull. Not a lot of evil to battle. Voldemort has a daughter...ridiculous all of it. If you are going back in time, make the ending spectacular.
 Harry Potter and the Cursed Child by J.K. Rowling, et al, is a welcome return to the magical world of Harry Potter.  A visit with Harry and his friends as adults who have children at Hogwarts is enjoyable, and though danger is involved, at times quite amusing as well.
 Do not spend the money for this book.  Love the Harry Potter series and have read them multiple times, however, this book is very predictable and at times boring.
 If you are looking for a follow-up novel that touches on the lives of Harry and the gang...keep looking. I understand the purpose of this book...but I was hoping for more than what I got. I loved the previous books and would recommend all of them...but I would not recommend this book and even told my sons (12, 14, 17) that it was a waste of time.
 First of all, you miss a lot not having it written by Rowling. Some of the dialogue feels really stilted and unnatural. Having said that, the plot is good and shows some promise. I wonder if it would be better live (remember that it's a draft of the final play script). What I really wish is that Rowling would write the novel version...THAT would be a great read!<br/>To sum up, if you can't stand reading things in play format, don't purchase. BUT, if you don't mind different writing mediums, go for it!
 This book is definitely different from the original Harry Potter books because it is written as a play and not a novel.  The book tells the story of Harry Potter's son as he goes through Hogwarts.  It is a good story and you are able to see what became of the original Harry Potter characters.
 You can tell it wasn't written by JK Rowling. It didn't stay true to the characters. Maybe should have just stayed a play and not been published. Disappointed.
 This is not a fair review, the story is pretty good but it is written as a play. I tried to image it being performed live on stage while reading and that really helps. I think Rowling needs to go ahead and fill in the story as a book or film the play so fans in fly over country can enjoy it.
 I don't like the play format. You lose the amazing descriptions and charm of the original books. I wouldn't see the play either.
 Like other reviews have said, I felt like The Cursed Child read like fan fiction. I still would like to see a live action play to see if visually it holds up better, but overall I felt like they had some good characters with potential and then just threw it all out the window by the end.
 I thought I was reading a parody, the trolley cart lady grows beedril arms. How is this cannon?
 Wow, profoundly disappointing. The characters don't even feel like the same people from the original series. It read like a middle schooler's fan fiction...
 While it is nice to be back with characters and universe of Harry Potter. The play does have some issues. The dialogue is a bit cheesy in many places, and many of the plot points a pretty cliché. If you have read other Harry Potter books, you can easily tell that others are adapting Rowling's original script. But it's not too offensive and a pretty quick read.<br/><br/>If you have read to other Harry Potter books, then definitely get the book, but don't expect the same level of writing as the others.<br/><br/>If you have never read a Harry Potter book, then don't start here.
 Good story line with accurate Harry Potter facts.  Great characters.  I just wish it had been a full book instead of just a screenplay, as it has such great potential for another full-length book in true Harry Potter style.  It was very hard to read, being constantly distracted by the stage references.  I am thankful, however, that the screenplay was shared with the world, since not everyone has access to live theater performances.
 If I only could unread this book and block it from my mind.  It really ruins the HP franchise and adds zero value for devoted fans.  Absolutely awful.  I haven't decided whether to donate my copy or burn it, but I am banishing it from my house and pretending it doesn't exist.
 It's HP so I was thrilled to get more of the story, but it doesn't come close to the original story. I was very disappointed in what they turned Ron into, the story felt a little forced and I left the story unclear on who exactly the cursed child was.
 If you want a more qualified, professional review, please see the Super Carlin Brothers and/or Seamus Gorman youTube videos.  They say it better than I can.
 There are a lot of complaints about this book, but I thought it was really fabulous.  A great addition to the HP universe.
 If one can get over the fact that this is written in a very unique script-style, it is actually a very fun read. I quite enjoyed it, though it isn't that large of a book as it might first appear, I was able to read it all in a day.
 As a huge Harry Potter fanatic, I  so desperately wanted to love this screenplay. What a disappointment. It felt nothing like the seven books and the whole thing was just upsetting in general.  Not a fan.  I would definitely still go see the show though,  maybe the character  development and interactions will play out differently (read: better)  on stage.
 To me this was a disappointment. I never thought Harry's child would act the way he did toward Harry. JK wrote as she usually does, in good form and kept the story moving. I would much rather think of Harry's life after Valdemort in a different way then portrayed in this book.
 An interesting addition to the Potter series. You either like it or hate it.. i don't know a lot of people who love it. I hear the play is much better.
 I am so disappointed.  That could not have possibly been written by J.K. Rowling.  There is nothing about the content or dialogue that even comes close to her usual work.  I hope "Beasts" doesn't follow this path
 Reason number 1: the whole "play, script" layout? I guess? It's hard to get used to if you've never read one before, which i hadn't. So it was difficult to just kinda dive right into the book like a regular novel.<br/>Reason number 2, if it weren't for this story being designed to be a play, it could have been a lot longer, like a real 8th book that would have followed the pattern of the first 7 getting longer than its previous book each time.
 Loved all the Harry Potters to death and read them all several times but this was an embarrassment to the series. I purchased this immeadiately when it was released and have never been so disappointed. I didn't mind the set up as a play, I actually liked it in that aspect. The story itself was so ridiculous it read like a poor excuse of a fan fiction. So far fetched and stupid. I read the whole thing hoping it would get better... it didn't
 I tried and tried. I loved the original HP series and read them multiple times. I was so excited to get this one, but I was quickly disappointed. It seemed as if it wasn't even written by JKR. It was cold and stilted. Yes, it's a screenplay, but even so, it had no comfortable flow. I found myself drifting off to other thoughts and eventually gave up.
 This is definitely a Harry Potter story, but I felt like it was a book-length story crammed into a play-length format. The events happened so quickly that there was no time to build up any suspense. It was, of course, enjoyable to be re-united with "old friends," but it would have been nicer in a full-length book.
 After reading some of the reviews, I was a bit hesitant to read Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. I'm glad I decided that I couldn't not know and after getting used to the script format, I really enjoyed the "rest of the story." It made me want to start all over again with the first book.
 I was upset over the writing. I know JK Rolling didn't write it, but I would never have put my name on this if I were her! She has a great writing style and I wish that she would have just written this herself! It could have been really good if she had just taken the time to do this herself. The story had a few problems and was not in my view the same kind of story JK Rolling would have turned out on her own. I didn't enjoy this and it makes me feel bad to say this.
 The book is written like a movie script, which detracts severely from the reading of the book.  I could not finish reading it for that reason.  (The movie goes through it without the stage direction, so is fun to see.
 Did not clearly understand the concept of the book before purchase in the fact of it being a screenplay. Might have thought twice if I had. The nature was clearly represented but I failed to grasp it. Might not have purchased it if I had. Found it to be distracting. Having said that----always love Harry Potter
 The book was not written like a story, it was written like a screen play with the names inserted as to who was talking etc. Not a great read and the story was not that great either. Characters not as brite as the original Harry potter Characters
 I say it was just okay because the narrative of screenplay and that of a novel are much different and harder to follow.  The story line was typical Harry Potter but second generation.  It seems the children are following in the parents footsteps.  I'd like to read this in a novel continuation of the Harry Potter saga.
 This wasn't great and it wasn't terrible. I liked it, did not love it. It helped fill part of the Potter void in my life but would prefer JKR herself would do the job. I'm glad I read it but not 100% fulfilled.
 You will laugh, I guarantee it. Out of genuine mirth or out of a growing sense of horror, I can't say. Perhaps a bit of both. Lifelong fans of the series will get this for the sake of lore, probably, but... Quality is not why I'm here. Hilarity is.<br/>And if characters taking a turn to be ooc isn't your thing, then maybe you shouldn't read this, because our golden trio are... not themselves.
 Bar set too high by the series. This one though promising, fell flat. Too formulaic and the transitions were disjointed  and forced. I wanted to like it, but was disappointed.
 Why on earth would J.K. Rowling allow her name to be attached to this drivel?  I can't give much of a review without spoiling things,  but I'll say this much:  poor story, character inconsistencies (both from the original series and within this story), clichés clichés clichés,  plot holes, lousy dialogue, and utter abandon of the source material.  This reads like really poor fan fiction and tarnishes the Harry Potter legacy.<br/><br/>There are still only seven books. I will not accept this as cannon.  I am undecided as to whether I will resell my copy, or throw it away so as not to inflict it upon anyone else, but I will be adding a note to my children on the last page of every copy of Deathly Hallows I own that warns them not to read this absolute disapointment.
 I was disappointed when I saw that this was not a novel written by Rowling, but the script for a theatre play written by several authors. Nevertheless, once I started reading, it was difficult to stop, as even in the absence of detail regarding the environment, feelings, background or motivation, the dialogues carried out the story quite well.
 I have loved Harry Potter all these years and really looked forward to reading this. I should have waited until the reviews came out instead of preordering, I would have saved some money. The plot, if you can call it that, is terrible and there are so many things that go against who Harry and Ron were in the books, it's like the playwrights never read the original books. By act 3, scene 5, I was so disgusted, I closed that book, never to be opened again.It was so disappointing I couldn't finish it. If you want to read it, do so forewarned.
 What a great story! Even without the descriptive narrative that I love so much from JK, this is a magnificent story. It still feels like Harry Potter, the time just flew by while reading it. I with there was more. I will miss these characters so much. Thanks for the adventures Jo!
 Reads like bad fan fiction, and the screenplay format is awful. No character development, feels very thrown together. Why you wouldn't write a proper, well developed novel first...then develop it into a screenplay is beyond me. This feels like a lame attempt to keep capitalizing on a popular franchise with no real effort put into maintaining the quality. I really can't believe jk Rowling put her name on this.
 I think I first need to say this...To sell a book as a follow up when it is just a play is ridiculous.  I think we are dealing with an issue where someone made millions and now doesn't care any longer about the plot or writing a book.  The story could have been great and it is a great story but it is so rushed.  It is just a money making scheme to capitalize on both the play and a book at the same time.  I am still reading the "book" so these are my thoughts at this point.  I can't blame her.  I just think she is tired of the whole story and this is the attempt to add on to it without having to actually write a book.<br/><br/>I just don't have any words for my disappointment.  I think the more I read from other reviews, the book was not written by JK, so I think we just need to go with it and hope JK will one day write more stories.  I may just read fanfiction
 I have to give this four stars because it's a continuation of everything I've been waiting for since childhood, but I was definitely a little disappointed. The story really pulls on our nostalgia to get to us, and doesn't display much original thought or creativity.
 After waiting so many months for this book to come out, I was so excited to read it! It definitely didn't disappoint! I'm thrilled that J.K.Rowling honored her fans with another spectacular Hogwarts story! I'm not into spoilers, so I'll just say... If you haven't read it, you are missing out!
 If I could give it zero stars I would. It's a book to make money on. One of the worse pieces of drivel I've read in a long time. Definitely don't care for Harry Potter and company as adults, at least not this version - who are these people??
 Recommended book for any Harry Potter fan. Arrived on time and as pictured/described. I didn't like how the book was written but that's more of the authoring instead of this review.
 Harry Potter and the Cursed Child was a good read, but the stage directions were not specific enough.  It lacked the flow of the books written as novels.  I still read it twice and the second time it made more sense.  You need a good background and imagination to read this screen play.
 So extremely disappointed in this book. I didn't mind the play format so much, but the storyline was poorly designed. It was written in a way that screamed money grab. The character development was horrible and it was a cheesy Plot. Don't waste your time.
 Wife can't put it down
 As a Harry Potter fan, I thought this was poorly written. Understanding it was adapted from the play, it was hard to read, boring and totally predictable. A lot of hype for nothing. Only good thing is I am now NOT waiting for another book. This book ended the desire to go back to Hogwarts.
 Although I agree with the overwhelming negative reviewers that this is Fanfic. However, I genuinely believe any potter head can at the very least find themselves wrapped in the "story" here. I know it's not true to JK Rowling, although I know she put her two cents in, if only just that. It is still Harry Potter, and I love the characters, the world it's set in, and despite the fact that it's really kinda weird. I still love it and wish there was more to come.
 Very clever story though it's hard to understand how Harry cannot connect with his own son. It was difficult to read in a screenplay format.
 It brought the story foreword. I could see no reason for Dumbledore being brought in. Not enough description to just read. Had this been a book maybe it would have been ok.  Frankly I couldn't read the other books, with made up words, but the audios are Fantastic.<br/>I would see the play if I could find it.  A film would be much better.
 My granddaughter loves anything Harry Potter and loves to read. She was excited with the book.
 I'm pretty sure JK Rowling had nothing to do with this. I love theater, but this reads like a really bad fanfic set in the Harry Potter universe.
 Go into this knowing it's a screenplay! Difficult to get into the flow at first. All the old characters are there but I still ended the book looking for more. I wanted to be more involved in their lives but again it's screenplay so we aren't going to keep people in a theatre for 5 hours. Loved having the gang back one more time.
 Meh. Not up to Ms. Rowlings' usual exacting standards for writing; the plot was lackluster, predictable, and thoroughly unengaging. I found myself rooting against the protagonist, who is nothing but a spoiled brat. Your time would be better spent reading one of the original Harry Potter novels which were decidedly more...well, original.
 Service was fine. The book was absolutely an abomination. I refuse to believe any parts of this book are canon. Its almost like the authors looked up adult Harry Potter on Pinterest and fanfiction websites then poorly combined ideas from them into a play. Bad. Horrible. All poor reviews of it are completely understandable. Wish I had never tainted my mind with this.
 As a super Harry Potter fan, this book was very much a let down. I found the story very hard to believe and it tainted the first 7 books for me.
 Interesting layers added to the themes of choice and identity found in the original series, but the story eventually just seems to devolve into mediocre fan fiction.
 Spoilers probably.<br/><br/>The characters didn't feel true to themselves. Harry was cruel to his son, Cedric inexplicably is a death eater, and Ron and Hermione don't end up together because of the Yule Ball? It doesn't make sense. For the people that read all the other books the inconsistencies of the characters are distracting.
 I was so disappointed when I got this on my kindle. It may be my own fault, though. I love the Harry Potter books and in my excitement for this one I didn't throughly read what it was. I actually preordered this one (which I don't usually do), expecting a book. When I downloaded it to my kindle I found out this was actually a script. I tried to read it anyway but I couldn't get past the first few pages.
 I suppose I was expecting something of the quality of the writing of any of the Potter novels . It isn't . The storyline is a maudlin short story based on Harry Potter characters . Marketing as the eighth book in the series is simply to generate sales, as it does not add to nor live up to the prior works .
 J.K.Rowling' s story is written using a play format. It is easy to read and shows great character development.  Harry's son Albus is the new mischief maker to watch trailed by Scorpius Malfoy.  They are an unusual pairing!  Much to their father's' dismay!
 Having read all of the books at least twice (and many four times), I missed the level of detail offered in the normal series. The book's format leaves many things out that made the HP books so brilliant. Overall, the story is solid and it's a great glimpse into our beloved characters' futures.
 There are no words to describe my disappointment with this book. I read it and the only solid character is Scorpius Malfoy. All the rest is an insult on JK Rowling work.
 This is not a typical Harry Potter book as it's a screenplay. It's not as in depth as I'm used to, however, it was nice to see where some of my favorite characters ended up. I'd have liked to see a movie version as reading a screenplay doesn't have the same effect as watching it put together. This was a play, which sadly I could not see.
 Great book after finishing all 8 books.  No more harry pottor books to read now.. what to do...
 I don't regret reading this, but I definitely didn't connect with it on the level of the original series. If you're an HP fan just looking for a little more, go ahead and read it but don't set your hopes too high.
 I have read many plays that I have enjoyed so the problem with this, for me, is not that it's a play.  The problem is consistency within the narrative.  Many established characters act in a way that seems out-of-character.  The new characters aren't developed particularly well and often state things that should be apparent to the viewers/readers without being stated (how many times to actual friends discuss the fact that they're best friends?). A first year college English class will tell you why it is better to show the reader details about your characters' personalities/actions rather than just blatantly telling them. There were some things that happen that actually broke rules/events set in the actual Harry Potter Series, but I won't discuss what they actually were in order to avoid spoilers.  I know that J.K. Rowling didn't actually write this, but given that she endorsed it, I was really expecting a lot more from this.
 It was interesting and kept me guessing. I wasn`t able to put the book down. I enjoyed how the characters linked up with the original Potter characters.
 I love everything about this series. J.K. Rowling truly changed all of our childhoods and for those generations to come. This was a must have as soon as i heard about it. Glad i pre-ordered it, and it arrived while i was on vacation. Cool present for myself to come home too.
 I have read better fanfic.  I got halfway through and gave it to a friend.  Hope that was not too spoilersh for her.  I tried, I really tried, to like it.  Sigh.
 Enjoyed the book, but not necessarily the portrayal of Ron. Book moved the relationships of those we loved in the original books forward.  Their children now have to deal with who they were.  It was hard for Harry to be the boy who lived, now his son has to deal with being Harry Potter's son.
 Bought a paperback copy from my local store. I grew up loving Harry Potter, and thought I would enjoy this one too even though it's a playscript. Sadly though, it's confusing and hard to read.
 given as a gift so can't comment on the story. but do note that even though this is considered the 8th Harry Potter book it is not actually a 'novel' - it is a -script- of the play of the same name and as such it is printed in actual script format (not in novel format as the previous 7 books were).
 Fun and entertaining. Also a very detailed and imaginative screenplay. But I miss the more detailed description of the novels.<br/>Furthermore, I find that in the effort of making Harry Potter more of an adult, he's became a less interesting character and instead transformed himself into one of those gray and shallow adults of the wizarding world.<br/>Finally, the book's name is misleading since Harry Potter plays a secondary role in this adventure.
 I loved this! I’ve always loved Harry Potter and I’ve read all the novels. It was good to read about him as a man.
 Hubby and I have read all the books together and enjoyed this one.  Yes it strays a little from the normal "Harry Potter", it walks the line between the books and the movies.  Which makes sense because it is a play.  Those expecting it to read  like a book and are looking for all the little imagination details thrown in for them will be disappointed.  However, if you know the WW of HP then you should be just fine, you can imagine away without the extra details that everyone is used to in a typical Rowling release.  You may not love it has much as the original series but it is certainly worth the read.
 I've read all the Harry Potter books. They were very entertaining. Reading a script is a "different animal," if you will. The story fits the HP universe and I can see how it would make a good stage play. I enjoyed the general storyline, but prefer the non-script books.
 I was very nostalgic for the Harry Potter reading experiences I had in my childhood when reading this screenplay. It's a different format than a novel, so it read quickly, and I was sad to see it end. It made me miss the old characters immensely, but I still liked the brief extension of their stories.
 A wonderfully imaginative addition to the Harry Potter series ! My son and I loved it!<br/>Everyone will love it ! I was skeptical at first, because I couldn't imagine another book be as good as the first set, and I was pleasantly surprised! Thank you J.K.Rowling!
 Exciting to have another Harry Potter, we start with Harry's son best friends with Malfoy's son, off on a series of adventures.  Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Draco are all there, older and more set in their ways.  Nostalgic and gripping, I loved every minute.
 I grew up anxiously awaiting the release of each new Harry Potter book and was so excited to read this play. Instead of waiting in line for hours to get my copy, I ordered online to be electronically delivered at midnight to my Kindle. I delved into the play looking forward to stepping back into my favorite book worlds ... instead I was disappointed.<br/><br/>I was expecting the play format, and that did not bother me, though, like all other fans, I would have loved a novel. Given the constraints inherent to plays, I think this would be a good, fun play to see in person. I also really liked the Scorpius character. However, unfortunately, I found many things lacking.<br/><br/>First and foremost, there were some continuity issues. For example, all polyjuice potions tasted like fish in this play, when we were previously told the taste depended on the person one was transforming into in the novels. I also was disappointed that some much be love characters, such as Hagrid and Luna were not mentioned in this book in the present, while other less important characters were. (Hagrid was mentioned in the past.) Additionally, I found the storyline to be trite and rather predictable, along with some things being implausible or unlikely given what we know about the wizarding world or our beloved characters. (I don't want to give away any spoilers, so I will leave out the details.) There were many things that could still be fleshed out or more developed, such as what happened to Astoria Greengas Malfoy.<br/><br/>All in all, it wasn't a complete train wreck, but much to my disappointment, it lacked the magic of the original 7 novels. It was worth reading, but $14.99 was a little much for the length, depth, and format of this story. If the play comes to the States, though, I would love to see it.
 Nostalgia draws you in, and nostalgia keeps you reading.  Book physical quality was in perfect condition, no damage or blemishes what so ever.  Be prepared for the format, presented in play script making it much more segmented requiring a more unique approach to reading then a typical Harry Potter novel.  It has plenty of the previous elements that make you love Harry Potter books but it just isn't the same deep connection as previous installments.  I still enjoyed the experience
 It was a little difficult to get into a play rather than a novel. But quickly,  the play works to expand your imagination.  The story vuilds on the early Harry Potter stories in a convincing way. It is very enjoyable. I  couldn't put it down. I just hope that Rowling has more stories for the future. I  read the early Harry Potter stories to my young children until they could read for themselves. Now I look forward to starting with my grandchildren .
 I was excited about this, but ultimately it was disappointing. Filled with missed opportunities. Seems to betray what we know about some of the characters we love. I cannot recommend.
 I love the harry potter books and was disappointed that this was not a book.  I did not enjoy reading a screen play
 It was good but it just didn't have that magical feel to me that I so enjoyed from the series
 Unbelievably good book at a jaw droppingly low price. LOVE IT!
 Enjoyed the story of a young boy under pressure from his peers and how he finally works through the problems.  could have developed the character problems that Harry deals with his son?  Will probably not be the last time we hear of the Cursed Child.
 Not the Harry Potter books of the series, but all in all I enjoyed it. Was a bit strange in the beginning getting used to the play format.
 As a consumer, I want my money back! As an HP fan, I demand an explanation for this utter tripe. The internet is peppered with scathing reviews that cover the crappiest aspects, so I'll move past that. However, this seems like a cheap money grab and Rowling should be ashamed for giving it her blessing. Ugh. I also would like to call out all the "expert" reviews and news articles claiming it's a joy and a bestseller. Sellouts!
 I actually got this for a class, can you believe it! I had to read Harry Potter for a class, doesn't sound like school to me. Anyway, I love Harry Potter, and this book is another addition to the awesome work of J.K. Rowling.
 There is NO WAY JK Rowling wrote The Cursed Child, or pretty much any part of it.<br/>Harry Potter takes up space in my heart. He, Hermione, and Ron have been a part of my life for 13 years. But this book (yes, I knew it was going to be a play before I read it) SUCKS. Like really, really sucks.<br/>I'm very disappointed and a little angry with Rowling for attaching her name to this, or approving it at all. At no point do the characters even SPEAK like themselves, much less act the way they would. It's incredibly obvious it's basically a fanfiction by Thorne, and should in no way be associated with the Harry Potter Series. Besides that, there are MANY fanfiction writers out there who are much better writers than he is. I wish it didn't exist, because it puts a bad taste in my mouth, having read it. I'm going to try my best to forget it.
 Let me start saying I love harry potter! Read all the books 3 times..  and when I got this.... I totally thought it was a novel and I was so confused , sad and disappointed when i realized it was a script play... I guess I was so excited to see there was a new Harry book I didn't even look closely at the cover that it was a script... *****sigh :(*******
 It's pretty obviously not totally written by JK Rowling. Not really her style, and the characters do things that are a bit...out of character. I would be interested in seeing the play. It just fills a small part of the hole left by the end of Deathly Hallows.
 All in all it is a good read if you want to know what happens 19 years later but that's just about it. Don't expect this book to take you into the world of magic and that of Hogwarts.<br/><br/>What I liked:<br/>1. The story after 19 years.<br/>2. It is in the form of a play.<br/>3. That Albus and Scorpius are best buds.<br/><br/>What I did not like:<br/>1. They have seriously messed up the concept of the time-turner.<br/>2. The story is predictable.<br/>3. It seemed more like watching (reading) one of the Harry Potter movies (I didn't like it as much as the original books).
 This "book" would have been much better if it had been written in book form, not in script form.  I found it hard to get into and keep my interest.  To be totally honest, I didn't like it much and found it to be a waste of money.
 A very enjoyable romp set in the world of Harry Potter, a generation after Harry's schooling, dealing with his son and an unexpected friend at Hogwarts.  The story is set as a screenplay, which in no way diminishes the fun.  A great read!
 Other reviews are right, as long as you start the booking knowing Rowling didn't write it but signed off on it and you remember that it's a play it's a decent book. Some scenes are a bit exaggerated for the characters which I assume was done for the theater so it's not as true to the Harry Potter we know and love. Remembering those caveats it's worth the read to continue the future of the wizard if world. But some will be disappointed if you wanted a true Rowling Harry Potter continuation.
 Sadly, the read wasn't as enjoyable. Maybe because it's in play format, you can't get into the characters' minds and feel more connected. Fairly predictable for those who read/watch a lot of books/movies regarding time-travel. Not one that you'd re-read multiple times.
 Good book.  Reminder this reads as a play.  Not a standard book like you're used to.  Explores Harry, Hermione, Ron's and Dracos families and their adventures.  Has many guest appearances from past books. Slightly disappointed by the story line as a book but then had to remember it was written for the stage.  Not a ton of background and character development.  Still... It's Harry Potter and you can never go wrong.
 I would. The worst type of fan fiction ever, clearly not written by JK Rowling. None of the characters act like themselves, the dialogue is terrible, and story is totally unbelievable. I wish I could return it, but that feels unethical, since I struggled through the entire thing.<br/><br/>Just read the summary if you need to know what happens, but my advice is to keep the true memory of the real 7 stories as canon.
 Do not read this if you value your possessions because you are going to want to burn the world around you to the ground in fury when you read what's been done to some of the most beloved characters in modern literature history, and their intricate, brilliant world.  I wish I were exaggerating.  I really do.  I haven't felt this personally affronted over how bad a book was since The Davinci Code.  If Rowling wrote a even single punctuation mark in this, let alone a word, I'll eat my hat.  And yours.  And possibly even the Sorting Hat because he would want to be put out of his misery for being involved in this travesty.  I need to go drink now.
 Play format and not really a satisfying read. It doesn't progress the story, and it's missing all the storytelling of the books.
 It reads like a screenplay, but I kinda liked that.  Follows right in line with the end of the HP series.  Nice, easy, fun read
 Arrived in a timely manner. Well packaged, not bent or torn. Thanks for the wonderful product.
 I'll keep my response short and sweet as there aren't enough literary terms to express my lifelong obsession with the HP franchise. Immensely disappointing on so many levels and extremely obvious JKR did not write the actual script. If you are a true Potterhead, don't waste your time.
 I enjoyed returning to the world of Harry Potter. Who is to say what is what other than the women who took us all on great trip for years. J.K. Rowling is a true story teller, and I hope to read more about the Potters. So read and enjoy. I did.
 This reads like bad fanfiction. Severely out of character. As a hardcore Harry Potter fan, I found this to be so disappointing that I've discarded my copy. It does not deserve a place of honor with the other Potter books on my shelves. I would give it zero stars if that was an option. Save your money.
 I was honestly disappointed. It just replayed a bunch of events that have already happened with Harry. It was awkward. And since it was more of a screen play it was pretty slow.
 I did not enjoy this as well as the other Harry Potter books. I think it would be great to see as a play, with the special effects and everything, but the written play lacks the charm of the books.
 The story line was okay after I got into it but I didn't like the play format. I would have rather read a short story with the same results. Disappointed with the overall book. I have read, listened to and seen all of the Harry Potter books but this was not what I was expecting
 I will always love the Potter world but this book felt like it used the same formula and lacked vigor and originality. Also, because it was a play, it seriously lacked Rowling's vivid descriptions of the Potter world. I'm not sorry I read it (because I've been missing the books) but I wouldn't recommend purchasing this. Borrow from a friend or your local library!
 This was a fairly decent book. I am a big fan of Harry Potter and it was good to get to know his son. Maybe it was the format, but the his rendition just did not grab me like the books did. It did however make want to go back and read the books again.
 Great read. I enjoyed it for what it was...a play, and was not caught up in what it was not..a novel. I liked the addition of new characters, the unpredictable nature of all the characters (old and new), the vulnerability showed in all the characters, and the mystery as to who was really the cursed child--even after the work is finished, there is still the lingering question that has more than one answer.
 Loved it as much as I loved the play on Broadway. Just keep in mind you are reading a script for a play.
 I love going to see a play.  Have been to several throughout my live time.  Both Broadway and small theaters to even school plays and everything in between.  While reading this book, I was so intrigued by the pace of the story, but also could not see how you can have 15 to 25 scenes in a Act.  So what did I do?  Well thanks to this book, I booked a week in London to go and see the play.  Thanks JK.
 An officially endorsed fan fiction which lacked the emotional depth of the originals and added nothing new to the wizarding world universe.
 I very much enjoyed the story and how it fit in with the originals and would like to see this be a film at some point in time.
 This is disappointing.<br/><br/>The review is somewhat spoiler free.<br/><br/>Formatting.<br/>1. The script formatting over book takes some getting used to but is okay after a while.<br/>2. The special effects that make the play supposedly wonderful are simply stated.<br/>3. Since there is only dialogue with little scene, emotional inner dialogue, scene setting it feels very different.<br/><br/>Characters.<br/>1. Harry and Hermoine seem like different people. Their adult versions are off, and flat.<br/>2. The two main characters are Albus and Scropius are okay. They get better in the middle and end.<br/><br/>I"m sure those Potter fans will read it no matter how many bad reviews there are, but be warned it is simply meh.
 The play was good, however the Harry Potter books We're/still are my favorite books, so the bar is set pretty high for me.  It took me back to book 1 &amp; 2 of Harry Potter easy flow, not so dark, but definitely good.
 I thought this installment of the Harry Potter series was only okay. If you're a fan, I would suggest that you read it, only for some closure. If you've never read Harry Potter, don't start here. I would have enjoyed it much more as a novel, not a play.
 It was good to be back in the Potter universe, but it didn't have that same feel of the original stories. The overall story was interesting--it was the handling of a couple of characters that kept me from completely loving the play, particularly Hermione &amp; Ron. They were...weirdly handled.
 I'd like to preface this review by saying that I have been a Harry Potter fan ever since Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone came out in 1998. I was a teenager at the time and my dad came home with a copy of the book. My whole family got hooked instantly and every time one of the new books came out, we would all argue over who was going to read the book first. When I went off to college, I bought my own paperback copies so I could read them over and over while in the dorms and when the later books came out, I repurchased them all in hardcover because they are books I will re-read and hope my kids will read them as well. I love the books and have read them a number of times each. That being said, when I heard that another Harry Potter book was being released, I initially got very excited but then considered not purchasing it because it's actually the script for the play that recently premiered in London. Curiosity got the best of me and I obviously purchased it.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child - Parts One and Two is the "Special Rehearsal Edition Script" that is based on a story by J.K. Rowling and the playwright is Jack Thorne. The play is broken down into two parts, which are further broken down into two acts in each part. It takes place 19 years after Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ends when Harry is happily married to Ginny (Weasley) Potter and they have three children together. This "story" mostly focuses on Albus Potter, Harry's youngest son, but many of the characters from the Harry Potter books appear in this script as well.<br/><br/>I don't want to give away the plot but I want to say that the entire play is written in a script format so it has stage directions and is written like this:<br/><br/>HARRY: XXXXXXXXXXXXX<br/>ALBUS: XXXXXXX<br/>GINNY: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX<br/><br/>The format makes it a bit awkward to read since it doesn't read smoothly and a lot of times scenes seem to end abruptly. Some of the scenes are fairly short and overall, this play is a quick read but it obviously doesn't have the same effect as a novel. A lot of times the characters seem flat and bland, without much emotion but it would probably come across a lot differently to see it on stage. I had to get myself into more of a theatrical mode to read this and that helped slightly.<br/><br/>In summary, I feel this script is okay but I actually would've been content to have only read the original seven books because I am happy with how they ended. I think the play will come across better seeing it on the stage but as a book, it isn't too exciting. If you choose to purchase this, know that it is written in a play format so it doesn't have the same feel as the original seven books do. In any case, the hardcover edition fits in nicely with the rest of the books I have and it was interesting to see the characters after nearly two decades.
 Very disappointing. First, I find it implausible that Voldemort and Bellatrix would have a child. Secondly, it is entirely too long for a play. Perhaps I might have enjoyed it more if it had been a fleshed-out book like J.K. Rowling's other HP books. Also, Harry, having grown up without parents, would probably have been a better parent, knowing how hurtful remarks are since he grew up in the Dudley household. This is like fan-fiction rather.
 She hasn't lost the magic of Potter.  I think she did a great job of writing all our fears about Harry and his ultimate end in the book series and exorcising those fears in the play.
 I'm still reading on this one but it a lot better than I at first thought it would be.  It puts insight on the kids as adults and back when they were children.
 I don't quite understand why Rowling published the stage rendition as a book.  Maybe the kids are enjoying it,<br/>but I certainly did not.  I'm 73 years old and I've read and enjoyed every Harry Potter book written, but this one was<br/>very disappointing.
 So much fun to read abiut the characters all grown up. I wanted to know more abiutnthe characters, but in this setting it was difficult. You can't really know waht someone is thinking and feeling as clearly when it is a play script. Potter fans will love it though.
 Susan<br/><br/>This play started slow, but after the first 15%, it took off! It feels just like one of the original books in play form! Ended up loving all of the characters again.
 Not a good read... and I'm not even a really big fan, so If you are a big fan of Potter, you will most likely like it less than I did.
 I personally think that this book is very funny. Especially the part where Albus drinks polyjuice potion and becomes Ron. And kisses Hermione about a dozen times. I've read it about a hundred times and it never gets boring. Hahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!!!!!
 Longtime Harry Potter fan. Have read the books multiple times and adored them growing up. Very disappointed in this final installment. Characters are not true to themselves. It's corny and predictable. What a terrible way to end such an iconic series.
 The storyline was good and I went into it knowing it was a screenplay and would read differently. However, there was a distinct lack of character development. It missed the depth that we have all come to expect from the Harry Potter stories.
 If you love Harry Potter and don’t read this book you’re a liar.
 I really enjoyed this script.  No, it is not a book written by JK Rowlings and certainly misses out on her storytelling ability, but it was fun to delve back into the world of Harry Potter.  I would love to see the play and would love to have a book rather than a script, but it was an enjoyable read.
 Loved the story!! It was wasier to read than I expected.  I felt the ending was a little lacking however. Kind of like they just ended it to end it.  Like they just couldn't come up with a super great finish. Still very entertaining and followed along with the original story!
 Some folks struggle with their parents because they are just like them. Some folks struggle<br/>With their parents because they never had an example of what parenting is.<br/><br/>Add some darkness, and many fates....you find you can change the past.
 In play form,  this is not a book that interest kids and will appeal old to a few adults.<br/>Not worth the price or time to read.
 I found the 8th installment to be a fun and fast read.  I enjoyed being immersed in the wizarding world of Harry Potter again.  This story focuses on the next generation of wizards, specifically Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy.  These two sons of famous nemeses form an unlikely friendship during their first year at Hogwarts.  The play fast forwards time quickly through their years at Hogwarts while also presenting the reader with each sons' difficult relationship with their fathers.  Harry Potter, the beloved orphan-turned-wizard hero who everyone loves has difficulty bonding with his middle son.  What an overwhelming reputation for a son to live up to!  Scorpius has to deal with his own problems and devious rumors that make him an outcast as well.  The friendship between Albus and Scorpius plays out nicely and leads to a fun and eye opening adventure that causes many problems to be solved.<br/><br/>As much as I liked this book, I felt it was a fast read and left more to be desired.  I missed the detailed descriptions of the wizarding world that I loved in the original books.  This book/play moves faster and doesn't have the same attention to detail.  But that shouldn't stop anyone from reading this book.  I loved the way the angst of being a teenager and parenting a teenager was played out.  The story still focuses on friendship, courage, and love, which was so much a part of the previous books.  I would recommend this story to all Potter fans, who I am sure have already finished it!  I do hope to see the play one day.
 It was a little hard to read as a screen play, but I so enjoyed the story line! I wish Ms. Rowling would follow thru with more books on the Cursed Child, it could be a whole new series. I can't tell you how much my grandchildren &amp; I have loved the Harry Potter books &amp; movies! Would love to see Harry Potter the next generation!
 As a huge potterhead, I was excited when I heard that this was coming out. It arrived quickly, but I just couldnt get into this story. It had its moments, but there was a lot of times where it just didn't flow right. Maybe you just have to see it on stage.
 Pure fun. I was a kid again at Hogwarts.
 Huge disappointment! The play format was awkward but I could have dealt with it had the content been superior. The storyline was just bizarre and not in-keeping with the integrity of the HP books.
 Loved it so much. My only complaint is that the story did not have Luna Lovegood.  Whoever heard of a story without Luna!
 Being a Harry Potter fan I was so many expectations with the book.truly heart broken.it just does not live upto the series
 An avid Harry Potter fan, I tried to read this and got almost halfway in before starting another book and forgetting about this one.  I don't mind that it is in the format of a play, but because of this, it's mostly dialogue (contrived dialogue, at that). What so many of us loved about HP was the vivid imagery Rowling gave us.  It's not in this book.  Giving it three stars because I didn't get very far...maybe the other half is better...
 OMG!!!! Was dying and left me for more!!!  My jaw dropped just a dozen times.  Oh heck yeah RECOMMEND!
 It was a very interesting read - as always from JK Rowling.  We will take it in any form we can get it!<br/>We enjoyed the story!  I saw it as how it is difficult and important to establish one's own identity from one's parents, even when one loves them.
 I've read on the internet that this works much better as a play than as a book. Apparently the special effects in the play are 90% of the fun. I hope this is true since the story itself is tired and cliched. You've probably read it before, only now you can slap the "Harry Potter" name onto it. I prefer to think of this as an alternate universe story since it's hard for me to reconcile the original series with this.
 There were some neat things that happened in this book. I was disappointed that the story used so much of Rowling's success in the other Harry Potter books. I guess I was hoping it would be more of a new story. I wish Delphi had been someone else's daughter or at a different time....that part wasn't put together well. Bellatrix was never pregnant in the books. There were a few other issues like that.<br/>I definitely enjoyed meeting all of the characters again.
 My daughter is a HUGE Harry Potter fan, and wanted this for her birthday.  She really loved it, and said it was a perfect addition to her collection of Harry Potter books.
 To be honest, it was difficult at first. Don’t read it directly after the series. Give yourself time to curate your journey. It is, of course brilliant. Keep going. Give yourself time. Understand it’s called the “cursed child” for a reason. Now you may proceed. Enjoy the journey.
 I thought the book was as good as the other Harry Potter ones.  Had to get used to it being in a "play" format, but wasn't too difficult.  Ready for the next one and a movie to be made from this book..
 I enjoyed this quite a bit -- it's a quick, fun read.  Due to the limitations of time for a live stage production, though, the climax might feel rushed compared to the original novels for some readers.  Having worked in children's theater for a number of years, I understand why it needs to be that way, but if you're not used to reading scripts or to the pacing of live theater, it may seem a bit less satisfying.
 completes the series
 If you are a Harry Potter fan you will love it! I hope it gets made into a movie! More Harry!
 It was fine for fan fiction but definitely not a JK Rowlings book. It's wasn't too hard to get passed that the book is written as a script but the whole story was underdeveloped. You never felt like you were involved with the story. I also didn't like the original characters. Harry was a jerk, Ron was a loser, Hermione was a workaholic and Ginny was meek.
 Could not read it very well.  Not like the other Potter books, a play it is, and would be better left as a script for actors and not published as a book.  I enjoyed all of the other books, but this one is not easy to get into.
 It was good simply because it was a Harry Potter book. If I had bought it and it hadn't had the Harry Potter label I would have thought that it was cheesy fanfiction. That being said fans have needed a new book to keep us content, and I think that this works for that job. But there were some HUGE changes between the main characters personalities in the original book and the current ones.
 I love Harry Potter. This was not up to expectations.  The good thing was it was a play so you could read it quickly. I missed the detail of the books and the lack of an intricate, connected plot.. It seemed thrown together.
 I was hesitant about the play format this was released in, but overall it wasn't distracting. It was a fun read even for someone who is almost 30 so if you were ever a fan of the Harry Potter books I definitely recommend reliving some of your childhood with this book.
 Very different style from the rest of the HP books due to it being a play. Interesting story continuation for the characters, but wish it was longer to have more character development.
 An interesting follow up to the Harry Potter world post original books. Not a full on novel, but instead a screen play. Still enjoyed it though
 I didn't know it would be a script. Was expecting a novel.  Wish I could get a refund.  No imagination to it.  It's a waste of time.  If I could give it no start I would.
 Since the advent of Kindle, I've rarely bought paper books any more. Digital books are easier to store and a lot of time they're cheaper too.<br/>When Harry Potter and the Cursed Child came out, I thought about getting a hard copy...I love the Harry Potter series and what better way to celebrate the new story than to buy a book that I can display on my shelf? But old habits die hard and I got the ebook instead.<br/>Halfway through the Cursed Child, I became terrified that Rowling would release a new edition of the Deathly Hallows (my favorite in the series and one of my all-time favorite books ever). Being a Star Wars fan as well as a Harry Potter fan, I'm well aware of the tendency to change the older, more beloved stories to fit the "new stuff" instead of taking care to make sure the new stuff doesn't contradict the real story--and I don't want my Deathly Hallows changed, thank you very much. It's Harry and not Ginny who tells Albus that "He likes a laugh, your brother". I know kindle periodically sends out updates to books and what if one day I accidentally hit a button and my Deathly Hallows gets "updated"? What if Harry isn't a good father in my epilogue anymore?<br/>Having worked myself up into a complete panic, I hurried to Amazon and bought myself a paper copy of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. There. Now the story will always end like it's supposed to: Harry's a great dad and his scar doesn't hurt. You'll have to break into my house and vandalize my beloved book before that changes.<br/><br/>In the interest of fairness, I will say that I thoroughly enjoyed the character of Scorpious Malfoy and had the play followed his schooldays' adventures with Albus Potter, I would have willingly purchased a paper copy of that story...instead of whatever it was the play actually was. It wasn't just that I didn't like how much it changed things and characters, the script just really didn't hold my attention. I kept drifting off while reading (and I used to read Shakespeare's play scripts as a child, so it wasn't the format that bored me). It just...wasn't good and wasn't Harry Potter.
 Did not like the play format. If you are expecting JK Rowling quality writing you will be disappointed too. Very dull, non-eventful. Not even close to the descriptive, edge of your seat Harry Potter books.
 After all these years, it was very nice to get a held on this book, even if it is a script.<br/><br/>Reading is not so easy if you are not used to reading plays or similar kind of documents but story is amazing.
 Super hard to read in playscript form.  The story line is OK, but not as riveting as the original books.
 Arrived later than expected. Good book for Harry Potter fans, but definitely not my favorite. I like the plot but it wasn't what I expected from the series. Still glad I got it though! Amazon definitely had the best price for it.
 The story of Harry Potter continues.  The plot is ingenious and reunites many of the characters in the original novels.  The reading of a script is quite different from reading a novel and is not as satisfying.  The production of the script may be a better vehicle for the telling the story.
 really sucked, this book was not ready to be published, so it was published as a theatrical play, ya right, how stupid do you think we are
 The fact that this was in script form did not bother me. What I didn't like about this is it reads like a bad fanfiction. We have super time turners,m every other cliché fanfiction plot line that could be thrown into this. There is also no consistency with the characters from the book and this. Your telling me this is the Harry from the Epilogue reassuring Albus?? Ginny's son is missing and the only member of the Weasley family is Ron, who barely shows up. Oh yes I can see how Albus Grandparents and Aunts and Uncles wouldn't even bat an eye that he is missing in time. The only good thing about this was it was in script form, that meant there was less of this horrible thing to read. Don't waste your time or money.
 EXCELLENT!!!!!
 As a Harry Potter story, it is very well done. The plot worked well, and the development of the young characters was good. Wish there was more development of the older characters. They seemed too flat. As a devoted reader of the original series, I want to know why they a r e the way they are. Overall though, an enjoyable read.
 If you are a Harry Potter fan read it.<br/>This book is written like a play and lets your mind imagine the settings. I really enjoyed the Cursed Child and the twists and characters. It took about 3 nights of reading after work (total of 5-6 hours maybe) and brought me back to my middle school days.
 I’ve read every Harry Potter book from cover to cover in a matter of days but this was a bit different, took longer than expected. While I enjoyed it, I wish it was like the other books.
 Just a variation of the old science fiction theme of what would happen if you travelled back in time to change things and the unintended consequences that would come from it. A disappointing sequel to the series. Still, it's Harry Potter so it is a must read.
 I always LOVE J K Rowling's books.  A thoroughly enjoyable read for all Harry Potter fans.  It is written as a play which is somewhat different from the usual J K Rowling technique but is still a good read.  Highly recommended
 This book is not your typical Harry Potter novel as it is written as a play. When I first started reading it I didn't think I was going to like it as it was skipping through years so quickly, but I continued to read and was happy I did. It was nice going back into Harry Potter's world and getting to know his son. I also enjoyed seeing a different side to Draco and how he is as a father. It is a quick read but all in all it was worth reading.
 I expected more.
 i loved all the Harry Potter books this one was a little hard to follow. But after you got into it you started to understand it. I wish they would of wrote it like the other books. Than the plot would be easy to understand and you would of got more details in it
 This story ruins quite a few characters for the sake of story, and then gives us a poor excuse for a time travel story for our trouble. The cliche daddy issue plot thread does not help things either. It's obvious that story was not as important as theater tricks, but since we're reading the script and not seeing any of those tricks, this is a disappointment. Maybe the new movie will be worth the wait but this wasn't.
 I enjoyed a different kind of reading experience through using your own imagination.  Story was intriguing as Harry and friends becoming parents and trying to safeguard their children.  I was disappointed when story ended suddenly without any real climax.
 Everyone knows it's hard to make a "sequel" better than an original. She did well writing this. I'll be honest, I was sceptical in the beginning. Then I got really into it like I did the others. It's not an original series masterpiece, but I believe it was a fantastic "sequel." Maybe someday I can say I read all her books. Well, it's on to the next thing...<br/><br/>Thank You JK Rowling. For everything.
 Im a huge Harry Potter fan but I honestly can't say anything good about this. Wish I could get a refund.
 Not what I expected. Maybe watching it in person would be better. Most of it felt okay but there was one aspect of the writing where I started thinking it was more like a fan fiction than something JK Rowling wrote.<br/><br/>Stick to the original books<br/><br/>Also, I think Fantastic Beasts is going to be awesome
 Depressing. I wish I could wipe it from my memory because it ruined the entire HP series for me.
 I'm glad I read it, and will probably read it again. Would absolutely love to see the play. However, you can tell that this isn't just J.K. Rowling's writing. The characters have lost some of their charm from the original 7.
 Came in good condition
 I loved the first Potter books , the writing was easy to read and flowed well , I found the book hard to read, I could not get into the style of writing. The story was fine.
 A quick, enjoyable and nostalgic read for any HP fan. Downside is that, as a script, it leaves your thirst for the excellent prose of the original novels un-quenched and you'll be left wishing J.K. had written it as a novel. That said, it's a fun ride with a few new characters as well as a few surprises from old friends. I'm sure it's fantastic as a live play.
 This book doesn't match the charm and intracies of the original series but there are some unexpected twists.  I can't understand the advantage to using the format she chose.
 This reads more like a fan fiction than something co-produced by Rowling.  I am not a fan of the alternative narrative, especially surrounding Hermione.
 I loved this book! I just couldn't put it down!!!! It was so nerve racking and cliff hanging!!!!! This is one of the best books I've ever read!!
 It has it's moments.  It's short and not as detailed as what we're all used to from Jo - of course since it's a play and not a novel, it has to less detailed.  I liked the story. No spoilers here.  I could see it being a decent movie someday :)
 I thought it this book might be a let down after the Harry Potter series, and I was wrong.  I loved the book and the fact that is written as a play did not take away from the book in the least.  Buy it, read it, enjoy.
 This book did not disappoint!  I was glued to it from the first page. I had to go back and reread The Goblet of Fire with this fresh perspective and it fit the storyline seamlessly.
 It was Ok. I really wanted another Herry Potter book, so this was a reasonable substitute, just not as captivating as the original series. Don`t get why the author isn't just sticking with the successful series.e
 The story line is good.... BUT....<br/>JK Rowlings knows how to tell a great story.... this one because of it being written as a Broadway play... did not deliver.<br/>We would have enjoyed it more as a novel rather than a script for a play.
 Sorry Ms. Rowling... was really, really looking forward to this but just don't buy the story line or characters.  Love beyond belief the Fantastic Beast movie, though!
 I don't know why it seemed normal practice to release the script for a play as a book and market it as the next book in the Potter-series. It took a bit of getting used to as I usually don't read rehearsal scripts for plays, but instead watch them. Either way it was a good story, nice to see the gang again and revisit previous situations from new perspectives.<br/><br/>I can't shake the feeling of this being a money-grab however as it wouldn't have taken too much effort to actually write a novel based on this story.
 I am an avid Harry potter fan, this is dark. advise I have is to remember that this is in play format so it's disappointing because I don't feel like I get all of JKR's wit in the after thoughts that I love about her as a writer.
 This didn't meet my expectations. Rowling is a wonderful storyteller, and this story, as a play, is sadly incomplete. A novel with her delightful characters and use of language, is what we fans really wanted (or at least this fan...).
 Go into it with an open mind. I had high expectations which were not lived up to. As someone still obsessed with Harry Potter and have reread the books too many times to count I felt like it was missing JK Rowlings voice. The characters we already know all had traits that seemed wrong based on the previous books and the story just felt kind of empty. However I am not used to reading scripts and am hoping that the story comes across better on stage than it did on the page.
 I think this book had good intentions, I just can't get past some of the inconsistencies throughout. I don't mind calling this a fanfiction, but I wouldn't accept this as canon no matter what J.K Rowling says.
 Good book, not as good as the first ones.  It is written in play form, which is not bad, just different.  Interesting to see how<br/>Harry and Ron's lives changed as they got older and how their kids lives were progressing.
 Guess I didn't read enough about it to discover that this is a stage play, written with stage directions. I could hear middle schoolers reading the parts in my head. Story line was okay... But why didnt they turn it into a book?
 Albus is going to Hogwarts.  He's nervous.  He has a fight with his dad.  Not a good start to his first year at Hogwarts.  Then he meets Scorpious, son of his father's rival, on the train to Hogwarts.  This is where his dad met his best friends.  Let the adventures begin.
 I love all the HP series of books. This one was diffrent. Not as fun and grabbing like all the the others. It was nice to see Harry's son and see that all continue on as far as Harry and his friends becoming parents etc. But this book had 10% of the excitement we expected. I love HP, but this book was a bit of a let down. Expected more, but still happy to have a little more HP in our lives again.
 Great story themed around manipulating time and the consequences. We all wish we could change some things...<br/>JK should just continue with the next generation...do it for your loyal readers. You remember, the people who saw the magic in you.
 I have to say I miss the books, this play is lovely. I wish I could have attended the first performance but am happy to have had the chance to get to read the script. Bravo!!!
 I enjoyed reading this book more than I expected. It had a great storyline and the same characters we all know and love. I wish it was in book format. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.
 I'm a fan of the originals &amp; always will be, but his book should've been a series or a trilogy.  As is, it's incredibly rushed.  It's bare-bones plot and contains none of the quirky, loving details that made those first seven books so spectacular.
 Very let down by this book. I do not mind that it is written as a play, I love to read plays. But the story, plot, and characters are just not up to Harry Potter expectations.
 I honestly don't know how J K Rowling allowed this to happen. I'm sure the staging and acting are magnificent, but the story is awful. Just awful. The dialogue is stilted.  The characters are drab. I want to scrub my mind of this bad fan fic.
 I love HP. This book took me away, just like old times. I hope there will be more coming.
 Massive Harry Potter fan listen to the books on tapes read and have my dog Tonks by my side. After reading through the play I was overall let down. I knew it wouldn't be like the series but it felt like a well written fan fiction. Maybe it shows really well on stage. But the story I just don't fully believe it. It doesn't feel full or well rounded. I think of you have any love of Harry Potter you Have already bought and read this. I just wanted to share my feelings. I feel a bit sad, like a half full feeling. Not fully satisfied with what was placed in these pages.
 Wonderful! Harry Potter fans won't be disappointed! It allows us all a look at what happened after the original characters left school and what is going on with the next generation! Bravo!
 Enjoyable read
 Felt rushed. It was reminiscent of the original 7 ... But doesn't compare. It's still nice to go back in time to my 10 year old self and have the feels for Harry Potter all over again. I would still recommend this book. Just be prepared that it won't be like the originals.
 I'm a Harry Potter books fan, I still read them all every couple of years, but I'm very disappointed with this additional installment. It is clearly not the work of JKR. I understand that they're all grown up, but the original characters often don't act like themselves. While I enjoy some bromance, I found it too romantic and awkward. There are a lot of cheesy moments and the time traveling was very messed up.<br/>I have decided to forget all about this one and I'm excluding this story from the original seven.
 It took nearly the entire first act for me to warm up to it and the. I got into the story. Interesting direction to take with the story but I am not terribly fond of the mechanism they used. It worked out in the end.
 While excellent as a play, this is not a novelization and therefore lacks some of the introspection that we have come to expect from Harry Potter novels. I am certain this would be wonderful seen in person, but it lacks as a stand alone "novel."
 After a slow start (perhaps because it's play and not a novel), the story picked up nicely. The struggles between fathers an sons are clearly presented and could occur in almost any family. I'll be interested to see the play when it comes to Atlanta
 This is in play format, which is different than reading a fictional narrative. I found it well written but not as fascinating as the previous Harry Potter books, but this will satisfy the Harry Potter fans .I found the pace to be quicker than the other books.
 The wait was more than worth it. When we reenter the world of Harry Potter this is exactly how I expected to find it.  I can't wait to see this onstage and then when it's brought to life on the big screen. For fans of Harry Potter and new fans to come what a great way to continue the story.
 Ok, so it's HP and I love HP...This seemed like a badly written fan fiction, and perhaps seeing the play would be better than reading it. However, I did enjoy a few parts and my middle school students love this play! That earned it a star. Also, just simply being HP earned it a star. Eh, but please read it anyways. It's a very quick read.
 I knew it was a theatrical script going in, but I would've liked a little more exposition and character development. This and the fact that Harry is not the lead character makes it feel a little distant from the rest of the Harry Potter universe.
 written as a play, and shorter than expected, but a nice add-on to the HP stories
 A very fast read that allows you to use your imagination to fill in the blanks.  The story gets right to the heart of the story without all of the excess descriptive details that some people find annoying. The story continues where the movies left off, only with adult Harry, Ginny etc.  I found it an enjoyable read.
 Finished this book yesterday. I must admit I didn't like the format. Its written for a play and continually takes you from present to past and is much "darker". Also confusing because Harry named one of his sons Albus Severus, an then Harrys having conversations with Albus's headmaster portrait. Because of my eyesight i used "text to speech". I believe I will have to breakdown an try to physically read the book.<br/>All and all this was a OK book. Many stories within the story and a very surprise ending. Not the intricate weave of story telling that JKR is noted for. I didnt realize that JKR was NOT the author until after I'd read the book. All she did was approve it.
 I didn't like the characterizations of either Harry or Albus. .<br/><br/>***** Spoilers******<br/><br/>I didn't like the way the 'hug' was handled between Albus and Scorpius. It seemed to come out of nowhere. Another thing that bothered me was that I expected Harry to be more accomplished at Magic. He's head of the Aurors for gosh sakes and had years of practice besides. And I didn't like that Ron was now part of The Joke Shop and not working at the Ministry with Harry.
 I understand Rowling didn't write this and I understand this is s play. But the story/plot are predictable, boring, and over-the-top. The personalities of the characters, including Harry, Hermione, and Ron, are terribly developed and quite wrong. There are even plot holes that don't make any sense! Just terribly written.<br/><br/>If you feel that you have to read this because you're curious as to how everyone turned out, it's still not worth reading. I even had the thought that maybe it's better as a well developed play, but I doubt it.<br/><br/>Frankly, I would not recommend reading this script or watching the play.
 While I am a true Harry Potter fan, this one disappointed me. It is obvious that, while J K Rowling created the story, she did not write this one. The style is not hers. I did like the story itself, but it would have been better from Jo herself.
 Written like the play we are absolutely going to see when comes to broadway next year! I hope Rowling continues contnues writing these fansyastic stories - our family willl never have enough!
 I wasn't sure I would like reading this story in play form, but it was an easy read, and it fits in with the other Harry Potter's.  I would not have missed this book for anything.  Great story and I loved the ending.
 Still pretty great. I knew it would be different since it was a script and not a novel. That being said, I could only imagine the difficulties of putting this on the stage. The storyline was exceptional and funny and it gave me new information.<br/>It was an easy read, despite being in the form of a script. I enjoyed it very much.
 I'm a big HP fan so had to get this new book which is a play.  I was disappointed in the story, perhaps the stage production is better.  It lacked all the meaty details of the original 7 books.
 Fun read. I assumed that the characters were gay so, when it wrapped...let's just say it was a slightly disappointing ending. Still nice to see something from the HP universe no matter what.
 Don't go into this book thinking it will be the 8th Harry Potter, you will be disappointed. Separate it from the original seven and it is much better. Like reading fanfiction.
 Storyline is great, but I have a very hard time enjoying the story, when it is constantly interrupted by staging. I would much prefer to read it as a story. I love the Harry Potter books! Read them all more than once, but I still haven't finished this one.
 Not that great of a story and didn't fit into the entire series very well.  Bad purchase.
 It is a faster paced read &amp; enjoyable; the playscript format helped provide needed info for those who may have not read or watched all of the previous movies...Definitely worth your time!
 I pretend that I never read or bought this book. I knew it was a playwright but I cannot believe this fanfiction was published. It really reads like a bad joke.
 Loved this new book. The layout of putting it into a play format, really pushed the imagination and helped you visualize the scene more, even without the same detail that was put into the original books.
 Overall pretty good story. Sometimes hard to follow the way it switches back and forth so quickly. It did have a good moral. Interesting to see all of them grow up and still went back to remember the way they were.
 I liked the story but would prefer a novel to the play, as the novels all had such wonderful detail about the characters and the wizarding world.  The play was okay because we already know the characters and can imagine them from the detail that had gone before.  However, new characters seemed one-dimensional because there was not that same type of character development.
 This brought me back to my teenage years. I did not want to put it down. Just like the original 7, this play was amazing. It’s great to know what my heroes have been up to all these years and now have new characters to root for. Absolutely amazing JK.
 I want my money back.  I feel I wasted my time reading this.  I really enjoyed the past books- but this one is garbage.  What happened?
 You know, at first I was not thrilled about reading a screen play, I wanted something different, but I loved every moment of this story. Getting to know Harry as a father and what his children are like, it was great. I would suggest any Harry Potter fan read this one!
 A bit disappointed. I know it was written as a play but  reading this book I feel that I am reading a fast version of what has happened in the future. It seems to switch too much from one character to another. I prefer her other books to this one
 This was a good book...but I feel like it would have been better to see it on the stage than read it.  It was hard to get mental pictures like previous Harry Potter books provided.  Looking forward for this to open in America.
 GREAT FOLLOWUP OF ORGINALS .A LOGICAL STORYLINE IN THE FUTURE THAT IS VERY MUCH IN KEEPING WIYH THE ORGINAL NOVELS.
 This is not a Harry Potter book, it is a screen play. The story is enjoyable, but the characters lack the depth the previous novels provided and the plot line between Albus and Scorpius is underdeveloped and contradictory.
 Hated the play style format - story line was ok but writing the story in the form of a play didn't work for me at all which is the reason for 2 stars
 Almost like reading a fan fiction created by a super fan on some vague forum. Only reason that I finished the book was because it was Harry Potter and I was committed to seeing the book through. Probably wouldn't recommend this to a friend.
 Loved the follow up after all these years.  These characters have meant so much to me and was glad to re-visit them.
 I wanted to like this book so badly as I am a huge Potterhead. I wasn't impressed with the storyline.
 Not quite as good as the original Potter books, but still an excellent continuation of the Potter storyline.
 Jkr has set the the potter world a light once again.  Would like to see the original cast.  Great writting
 Good story to keep the Potter fans going.  I'm not as big a fan of the Play script format.  I understand this is the rehearsal edition but I would have preferred it more if it was typed up in a normal book format for sale to the public.
 My 13-year-old &amp; I both flew through the pages of this story, and walked away from it thinking it was okay.<br/>That's a shocking thing for me to say about anything Harry Potter by JK Rowling. Because both she and her series are historically exquisite and worthy of all the gushing praise we willingly gush.<br/>Her writing (sorry for the cliche) transports me every time; the nuances of her storylines, the flaws and frustrations of her characters, the ultimate triumph of good over evil - all of that typically registers deeply with me.<br/>Not this time. The notion written here (no spoilers) raises thoughtful "what if" questions, and the cast presents interesting relationships and conflicts - but it just doesn't ever successfully tap into my own imagination, failing to stick with me during my daily routine, as I've come to expect from Rowling.  To be fair, I haven't read many screenplays, but I don't believe the format detracted from the tale's appeal; I just needed about 300 more pages of tale to be told with the exceptional richness Rowling does so well.<br/>Plays do expect the audience to garner a lot from what is often very sparsely written dialog, I get that.<br/>And I get that Rowling set the bar unusually high with one of the most compelling book series I've ever read.  There's a reason there are 500 million copies in print...<br/>But I also get that this is not that, so I'm left hoping Rowling's got another series growing within her.
 Bought for my granddaughter.  She loves Harry Potter and the script didn't disappoint.
 I could just read for hours anything to do with Harry Potter.  However the storyline was disappointing and it's weird that it's in a play format.  All in all a good read but I would rent it from the library or borrow it instead of purchasing it.
 We Harry Potter fans are used to big giant books of six or 700 or more pages. This was like reading a short story that was over way too soon and was not as exciting and left me just wanting more Harry Potter. So I was disappointed in that.
 It is an ok read, play form is not always my favorite reading.  She takes the characters forward but is almost predictable and I did not feel it was worth the excitement or the price. I was disappointed.
 Must read if you're a Potter fan.<br/><br/>Remember 2 things -<br/><br/>1. Rowling did not write this.<br/>2. It's a play, not a book.<br/><br/>If you remember those two things, you'll enjoy it greatly!
 Haven't finished it yet but as with any J.K book, it's a page turner &amp; I'm liking the new "format"... yay! So exciting to be able to stay in the wizarding world again!
 Amazing! I loved being back in the world of Harry Potter. I wish I could see the play. Makes me want to read the books again. Loved, loved, loved it!
 Hated it
 Once you get over the fact that it is a screenplay I really enjoyed it. It was a fun plot and interesting to see the interactions of Harry's son and life at Hogwarts. I enjoyed the books and this was a fun story to read and enjoy.
 Maybe as a short story or a novella. Not worth the price. The basic storyline had the potential for greatness.  It is too bad  it was wasted here. It was like sitting down to dinner expecting prime rib and being served tuna casserole.  Disappointing.
 I was a little disappointed - the characters were not as rich as they were in the original series. The plot was OK, not too exciting or surprising. I would, however, love to see the play to see how they carry off the magical effects on stage.
 I have so missed the Harry Potter series and loved that I got to see how he and his family are still saving the world. I loved this book and it was really hard to put it down! Definitely a must read for harry potter fandom!
 Don't read this looking for a great Harry Potter story like the originals. This is just the script for the play and reads like one.<br/><br/>Sacrifices are made in the interest of time. Character development loses all subtlety. Everyone is childish in a way, including the adults. You can probably skip this one just fine.
 I purchased this book for a very dedicated HP fan, my wife. Although I cannot possibly say for sure that if it was bad she would admit it,  she has read the book and says it was worth the read and is happy to have read it and have it in her library. Hope that helps if you're thinking of gifting this book.
 Although I prefer a narrative style rather than the play employed here, the story was great, the surprises were great, and the characters simply wonderful. I sure hope we haven't seen the last of Harry Potter, his family and his friends (and enemies!)
 I was able to adjust to the format change in the first few pages. The problem was the lack of everything I love about HP. This was just a stupid waste of time and I've no desire to see the play. Come on J.K., give us what we love, what made you such a huge success!!
 This was a fun story where as the reader I became concerned for the fate of Albus Potter, Harry's son. It moves at a fast pace with many familiar characters and some exciting new characters as well.
 Even though it's a play, and, therefore, one doesn't expect the same plot development as a novel, it has none of the dynamics of Rowling's novels. Would have to see it staged to better evaluate it.
 item arrived quickly and was as described good book A+++
 For anyone not reading the book jacket or other reviews, this is a play, NOT a novel. It is interesting, but lacks the humor or the novels.
 I knew this will be written differently compared to the books since its a script (so no complains there).  the language used was just kinda off you'd know its not JK  Rowling (I let this pass).  the plot had its bright spots (SPOILER: esp the alternate world when Snape, Hermione and Ron sacrificed themselves). its just that even the climax failed to rouse my excitement.  if you're a fan this is still a good short read.  just dont set your expectations too high.  perhaps if and when they decide to make this as a movie, it will be much better.
 I was worried that the play format would be a problem with the story, but it is a good read. Thank you J.K.
 Could be the format, but it lacks the interesting descriptive verbage the author is best at. The story is predictable and unoriginal. Kept reading it to find out what happened to the characters as after reading all the other Potter books they are like family.
 This was a gift. She loved reading them and the book came perfectly.
 Harry Potter is one of those stories that I just can't get enough of, so I was so excited to read this and explore the world further. When I started reading it, I could tell it just wouldn't be as fun as an actual book. The play as a play was good (at least script wise, obviously) but as a read, it was disappointing because there was little character development, and there was no real ability to fall in love with characters. It's definitely one for the shelf and the collection, but a disappointing read for someone who loves the books.
 The plot is not what the teasers have lead you to believe it is.  You get to learn new facts, meet new characters, and see the future. The moral of the story is a bit cheesier than the rest of her books.
 What a poor example of Harry Potter. JK Rowling didn't write this! I regret ever reading it and am trying to forget it!
 I prefer reading a story line, and this is written in play script format, But if you are a JK Rowling fan, you will still enjoy this next generation of the Potter series.
 Loved it.... was a fast read... went down lots of rabbit holes, that were very interesting. Also, gave lite to lots of questions, left by the other books.<br/>I would have preferred not to pay so much for the book, but loved it in spite of it. If you are a Harry Potter Fan, and left wanting for more...here you are, have at it and enjoy.
 Great quality for a used book. As a Slytherin middle child, I'm excited to read on.
 favorite book arrived safe and in good shape
 A great read for anyone wishing to revisit the amazing world of Harry Potter. However, it is very short (took me about 3 hours) and the writing can be bad at times. From what I understand J.K. did NOT write this.
 Ugh. J.K., please don't let anyone ever "write" for you again. Lazy plot lines and poor character development. Maybe it works better in person as a play, but even as a script it was weak sauce. I expect better. We all do.
 This is just a very ok read in play format, not the immersive prose we are used to with Rowling's book.<br/>Rather, this feels like a cheap money grab.<br/>That said, the story isn't too bad - it's not great - but it's not terrible.
 Yes, this is an entirely unnecessary story line. BUT it does put you right back into the the Harry Potter world which is all i really needed from this story. This was a fun and easy read. I have to add a bit of an eye-roll at all of the original character's jobs in this story. Our favorite witches and wizards basically run the wizarding world now...come on.
 Awful. Truly awful. An unbelievable disappointment. I wish there was a spell that could make me forget this drek.<br/><br/>The Dementors aka John Tiffany and Jack Thorne have sucked the soul out of Harry Potter. Clearly they've already gotten to JK to allow this.<br/><br/>Story was weak. Writing was worse. Plot...infantile. What a horrible attempt to cash in. Not even a tiny bit original. JK Rowling should be embarrassed. How she could allow this to be published...and with her name on it.<br/><br/>This 'play' could (might) have been written by a 5th grader, a slow 5th grader. I wonder if JK Was merely drunk while watching 'Back to the future' one day and thought 'gee, I could make another $250,000,000 or so with that.<br/><br/>The reviews do not do the story justice.  Merely calling it terrible is an injustice to all the books and plays that are merely terrible when this is so much worse.
 It took me awhile to get used to the play form of the book. But once I did, I enjoyed the book and the writing style. Too bad it could never be made into a movie. Would not be the same without Alan Rickman.
 It might be a great book, however, the listed author is J.K. Rowling. That is what my 10 year old saw, and what she bought. When the book arrived and it was merely "based on a story by", she was horribly disappointed. How can this be listed as one of her works when she didn't write it? It'll be tough to get her to pick up a play that wasn't even written by her favorite author.
 Loved the book! JK never fails to amaze me!<br/><br/>The cover is like most covers, and falls apart easily, but the hardback book itself has lasted through five different readers.
 Maybe the play was amazing. I don't know, I didn't see it. But this deserves two stars honestly. It gets three stars for bringing me back to Hogwarts one more time, but it doesn't even feel like it was written by JK Rowling: probably because it mostly wasn't.
 Honestly was not very into this book. Anyone who has read Harry Potter (I've read each book 5x through) will realize that there are some major plot holes in this screenplay. I get that it's not "technically" J.K. Rowling, but this felt like a poor attempt just to make more money. It's a 1 time "read it and lose it" kind of book.
 Cannot tell you how disappointed I was to discover book was written as  a play.  First book I think I have ever started and at the end of two chapters just tossed.  Have read all the Potter books and was devastated by this style.
 Could not love this book, not sure if avid fans would, but I could not get into this book and it did not capture my imagination. A dying attempt for a popular series, i would call it a money grab. Dont waste yours.
 This was not as good as the original books, but I enjoyed it. Be aware that it is written as play, and the format is a little hard to get used to at first. Once you get used to the format, it is a nice read.
 Looked NEW and was wonderful to read!!!
 Loved this screen play. I felt it read very well for being written for the stage. Harry Potter is certainly an alternate reality for many of us and I love being able to read more stories of Harry and his life after hogwarts.
 I enjoyed reading this play for the sake of continuing the canon of the wizarding world. However the dialogue and characters are much more shallow than the original books had been. The plot was entertaining and I'm sure this would be a fun play to see, as it was intended to be enjoyed.
 This is something I would have rather read on Reddit. The concept behind the story is good, but they seem to try too hard to go outside the box and throw everyone into situations that fans want but don't necessarily fit into the universe.
 Reading this took me back to my childhood. I always wondered how his parents really died and how they were as a family and now I do!  I wish this would have been longer but it really was a great screenplay!
 I don't know how to feel about this book. It was nice to see our friends again but the play format is choppy and the writing isn't nearly as good as the original series. Overall I thought it was OK but not worth reading and rereading.
 I wish this had been a book. As it is, it reads like a movie script. The ending is a mistake. When the movie is made, I hope she or someone will correct it. I will not suggest one, though I immediately thought of what she should have done.
 I couldn't put this book down! Took a few pages to get into reading a play script.. but after that it was so amazing. I cried twice while reading it, and I don't think it is just because I was pregnant. :)
 A quicker read than any of the novels, this play follows perfectly to the preceding tales. I won’t say anything more than if you are on the fence and reading this, don’t wait a second more.
 It was an interesting tale. I would love to see the play, but probably won't get to.  I wish this had been in novel form. There would have been much more detail, however, I am still glad I read this.
 This book is amazing!  I love Harry Potter and always will.  I am so glad J.K. Rowling wrote the 8th book.  I bought this for my birthday present to myself, such a perfect gift.  This is a must buy for Harry Potter lovers!
 I want a nice thick book, not a play.  part of the magic of harry potter is the fantastical scenery and action of the movies, or the magic you imagine in your mind with a book.  Why limit that to the stage?  it just seems like a cop-out.  Rowling could write and tell this tale for a stage with very little time spent writing.  Harry Potter can't be explained or contained in our puny human world of paper props or canned sound effects.  I dearly miss the books and want more, more, more of them!!
 Realize it's a play but it's a rough read in this format.  The story itself was good enough but wonder if it had been more of a regular book if it wouldn't have been stronger.
 It is difficult to read since it is a play and not a novel.  The depth of the story line is not present since it is a play and not a book.  Harry Potter fans may be disappointed about the fact that it reads like a play.  However, tried and true Harry Potter fans will probably love the story no matter how it is presented.
 This small book is good if you're familiar with the original books.  I think there's enough background information in it to entertain someone who hasn't read the series.  I found it fairly predictable but also entertaining.
 It's hard to read as a play it would be 100% better in book form. When you read a play it can be very boring. I have only read part of this do far. I'm having a problem getting motivated to continue reading. However the story line seems interesting
 This was a quick read and mildly entertaining, but nowhere near the quality of the last few Potter books. Lots of themes and plot twists felt recycled.  Bottom line: If you want to relive a bit of your childhood it's worth a few hours, but don't expect an exciting new adventure.
 Enjoy Rowling.s characters much better. The characters seem to lack the humor and depth of the book characters. Ok. Story, but the books are much better!
 I didn't think I was ready to read more about Harry and friends but, since J K R was behind it, I gave it a shot. I'm surely glad I did. It is so great to revisit old friends and share more exciting adventures with them and their families!
 Too predictable. It turned out that the experts keep being cheated by children. From my perspective this is no added value to the Harry Potter lore. This last book became as lame as the story on the movies.
 Loved the way it was written in play form. It was quite different reading.Loved the continued story of Harry, Ron, &amp; Hermione.
 I could not get past the first chapter....you can tell J.K. Rowling did not write this one!
 As a major fan of this series I clutched at any additional threads in this tale however screenplays leave a great deal to be desired by comparison to a novel. Nevertheless it is rewarding to ponder the challenges for anyone who had to follow after the main characters from the first 7 books therefore many ways these additional adventures unfold are most entertaining. Excellent read notwithstanding.
 When I began reading harry potter I actually wanted to read it non stop. Because than other books are good.This was just so bad I didn't even want to finish chapter 3
 fun to follow Harry and the gang, but not as good as the original series.
 This book is awesome, I bought it for my daughter for her birthday and she has read the book two times since then. It is very sturdy and well made, has an outer cover that can be removed.  If you are a Harry Potter fan at all you should get the book.
 I wish it was a story, not written as a screenplay.,
 Big disappointment. I have really enjoyed this series. But this book was of no consequence. I had to force myself to finish it.
 I must have/ must read for all Potter heads.
 more harry Potter is always a good thing. JK Rowling is a brilliant storyteller.
 The story was really good, BUT it was a screenplay, so not as detailed as her actual books and not as good. It was a good story that moved along quickly but I wanted more of what we got in the other books, not movies.
 I agree with the other reviews; this did not read like Rowling wrote it. I don't mind that it is written in play-form but the character's are corny, there's no character development, and the storyline is terrible. The characters do not line up with the 7 other books. I am a HUGE fan of all of the original 1-7 books and continue to re-read them throughout my life. However, I hope to forget everything in this play.
 I think the last time I read a play script was in high school. Maybe play scripts just need to overexaggerate things to get something across to the audience, but it was really cheesy. I did not like how Ron was portrayed as a total dunce.<br/><br/>This was a let down.
 It was a Christmas present and she loved it
 I went into this not knowing what to expect. I am a Harry Potter fan. I am a Harry Potter fanfiction fan. I think this appealed to both aspects of my fandom. This reads VERY much like fanfiction. Was it fun? Yes. Was it enjoyable? Yes. Did it leave me rolling my eyes? Yes. Did it sort of destroy all seven books by JK Rowling with its ridiculous plot?...Kind of. If you love the Harry Potter series you might as well read it. Read it and judge.
 High hopes<br/>Nestled myself in bed, with some snacks and hot coco<br/>High hopes<br/>And then.... pure disappointment<br/>Unable to read this book, written like a stage play<br/><br/>Niek Ploegman
 Not as great as others but not bad.
 Disappointing.  JK Rowling has proven she's better than this.  Wish she would have written a novel then adapted a play around it.  She's one of the best descriptive writers out there and she blew it with the play format.  Also, the plot  and characters were unbelievable, which sounds strange because Harry Potter is about a world of wizards.  :-)  But I was consumed in the world in the first 7 books and I left this book thinking Huh?  Maybe the play will be better and yes, despite my disappointment I would still go to see it.
 I have to admit I do not like the theater style to the writing, but if you ignore all the theater comments it's actually a good book - just like the original Harry Potter's.
 This book brought together the old and the new splendidly. Certain moments were a bit "fan-fictiony" but as a screenplay this could be attributed to the way going wizards would talk. Moving quickly through the story did lend to some wanting of more detail or end tied up more fully. However, this could be due to the fact that it is a play and the cadence of writing is bound to be different. Overall, a great incite to the wizarding world but no comparison to the written adventures of Harry Potter himself.
 I went back and forth between 2 and 3 stars, but decided to go with 3 because I love every other book in the HP series, and because I hope this play would be better in person. This was somewhat of a disappointment because it lacked the witty humor I loved about the old books, and the characters did not seem them selves. I won't go on about the flaws in the plot and story line, but I will say these weren't the characters I fell in love with. If I have the opportunity, I will see the play in person, and hope it redeems itself.
 As with everything from J. K. Rowling, this was amazing.  I only wish there was more to it.  NOTE:  It is written in a "play" type format, which may make it more difficult for a young reader to follow.
 As a huge fan of the Harry Potter series, I found this book quite disappointing. The characters are shadows of the dynamic characters we either love or hate from the books. I think this probably plays out better as a play. As a book, I found it lacking.
 If this was a novel, rather than a screenplay, Jo Rowling could have created a more complete story with deeper storylines. It feels like more of a Cliff Notes version of Harry Potter than a novel, which it isn't of course. Perhaps seeing it performed would allow me to like it more.
 If you've read all seven books, and really love them like I do... you should definitely read this! Perfect ending to one of my favorite book series ever written. The play format was different, but did not effect my reading experience at all.
 It's a play, and meant to be seen.  It's interesting as a read, but disappointing as a novel.  The story has only one main thread and the characters aren't very deep.
 Just bizarre. Completely defies the rules of magic set forth in the original series. Not sure why JK Rowling associated with such a poor excuse for fan fiction
 Keep in mind, this is a script you're reading.  I love being in the Harry Potter world, but felt that the story line lacked depth which is probably related to this being a script.  It's a great addition to any Harry Potter fan's collection!
 My advice to anyone who was not into the "style"this was written in, read more plays. I'm not saying things as a dig but as genuine advice. I thought this play was deadly. Once again it takes some wreckless children to try and save the world. But the best part is, it never feels formulaic. My biggest hope for the future of Harry Potter, is that off of the success of this play we get more expansion into this rich and (wait for it) timeless universe. Always y'all, always.
 Loved bring the kids in especially since one of Harry's sons was in Slytherin House. His son became friends with Draco Malfoy's son.<br/>together, they had to get over the hate between their two families. They had to come to terms with beings sons of famous dads in the wizarding world. Together, they had an adventure to save the wizarding world.
 Voldemort and Bellatrix were never eleven remotely in a physical relationship.  That story flaw aside it was good.  I love the baby blanket signal to Harry.
 I was very disappointed by this story. It seemed unnecessary and not plausible. Much of the story seemed to be justification of the previous HP stories/results  (such as Hermione marrying Ron). Also, I felt the characters wiuld mot behave in this manner as adults. Instead of rehashing, JKR should have done an orginal idea...no more Voldermort.
 I cant tell you who i am or where i live.Its to dangerous.But there is one thing i can tell you.Hary potter is the best series i have ever read.I was a bit disappointed  when I found out that the last Hary potter was only a screen play but it was still realy good.Make more books.Wherever I am i am still wating for  the next Hary potter.
 I enjoyed the book. I wasn't sure at first that I would like reading a story as a script rather than in the format of a novel, but I quickly got used to it.
 even though it was written as a play, I thoroughly enjoyed her writing. As a parent, you can understand how things happen; as a young adult, you think no one understands.  She is able to bring that across in her writing. Well done
 This book made me sad.  I love all the Harry Potter books.  Or at least I did.  I wish I had skipped this one.<br/>The books starts as the Epilogue of book 7.  Probably copied word for word.  We already know who married who and who the kids are.  But that was ok.  The real problem is how stupid and contrived everyone is.  The "old" characters (Harry, Hermione, Ron) are caricatures of their childhood selves.  Harry and Hermione really have those positions at 40 years of age?  Ron is bumbling idiot.  I hated seeing these guys reduced to these boring people.  The new characters are just as bad.  Albus and Scorpius are whiners.  That is really all I can say about them.<br/>What would have been great would have been to continue the story with the "old" characters and to really fill them out.  Or to pretty much exclude them all together and only concentrate on the kids.  It felt like character development was in short supply.  Yes, I know it is a play.<br/>The story itself is interesting and a lot could be done with it.  Too bad all the the sappy, whiney characters got in the way.
 I have to admit that I was annoyed with the whole time travel thing because SERIOUSLY, but all in all, this fits well into the world.
 This book was entertaining but not on par with the previous books, it was very predictable and did not provide an in depth story about the life of all the protagonists. I did not like the writing as a play script.
 I Loved this story! Harry and the old gang along with his son on an adventure was an Awesome Journey! Couple that with Scorpious and a resolution of the Malfoy conflict......Absolutely Wonderful!
 If you want to go back in times just to enjoy the mood and atmosphere of your first HP reads, by all means give it a whirl. And if you get bored, think it falls flat, stop reading right then and there.<br/>How JKR approved this script is a little beyond me, or better yet, how she approved the book (kindle version and all) to be sold at such an expensive price is even more so beyond me.<br/>The characters have very little, if any, development, and they're not whom we knew when they ended it all 19 years ago. Sure, people change, personas change, but this is just some haphazardly put-together script of characters, locations and little tales, all of which fails on delivering everything magical JKR created over the course of 10 years. If you can help it, let your memories stay with Deathly Hallows, because once you've read this script, it'll stay with you for the rest of your lives.
 Excited that another book was written. Disappointed that it was in play format.
 Fair story but not as good as all the others before it.  A little disappointing that it does not reach the high bar set by the others.
 I enjoyed the fun of the screen writer style of the  book well created and written. Will continue to read
 Gasps from the first few pages. Wish it was an 800 page book instead but came out at the perfect time,start of my Belize vacation and my first Kindle read too. Loved it
 This would have made a great book and an even better movie. Unfortunately since it's written as a script it lacks all the imaginative details that make J.K. Rowling's books come alive. It is a great storyline but disappointing in this format.
 I loves the characters, the development, and the story! This was a very nostalgic read. Anyone who's read Harry Potter should read this book. It ties from the end of book 7 to the beginning of this story beautifully.
 This book lacked the sparkle, words of wisdom, and depth of the previous Harry Potter books.  It was an interesting change of format, I'm glad I read it and I enjoyed reading it,  I loved the idea of the book,  but I was a little disappointed.
 Very difficult to read because it is writtem like a play script.
 Very disappointing.  I can't believe J.K.Rowling add much input other than her name.  The characters were only shadows of their former selves.
 5 stars, how else!
 Great!  This is a gift for not only a Harry Potter fan, but a theater major who is used to reading scripts or plays.
 Loved Harry Potter series, loved Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (movie) and in Cursed Child J.K.Rowling continues to create an imaginative and sparkling world apart from ours.  Can't wait to see it on stage!
 A very well written play with good story! Very interesting and grasping script! Must read this play and i hope they make a movie out of this too!
 Hurts right in the childhood. The story was interesting. Fun to see another side to well know event in the Harry Potter world, but very fragmented. Since it's supposed to be a play I understand but saddened all the same.
 Yikes. I'm honestly not quite sure how to digest this one. Let me preface by saying that I was fortunate enough to see the Cursed Child play on London's West End last week and it was magnificent! Sam Clemmett, Alex Price, and particularly Anthony Boyle did a fantastic job portraying Albus, Draco, and Scorpius respectively. If you get the chance to see the play, you will not regret it. The actors wonderfully bring what is an otherwise bland script to life and make it one of the more enjoyable and engaging live productions that I've seen.<br/><br/>With that said- make no mistake about it, this play was quite clearly not written by JK Rowling or even in the tone that she set throughout the seven books. Harry, Hermione, and Ron (especially Ron!) almost seemed foreign to me. Ron's character is written in such a pathetic manner that it almost makes it unbelievable that someone like Hermione would be married to him. The play leaves you thinking that he has become a man of little to no substance as his character is inserted minimally and primarily as a source of comic relief.<br/><br/> MAJOR SPOILER ALERT] Aside from the integrity of the characters being compromised, the play also leaves some glaring plot holes; the most prominent one being Bellatrix Lestrange's pregnancy. The playwrights expect us to accept that Bellatrix Lestrange gave birth to Voldemort's child at Malfoy Manor prior to the Battle of Hogwarts. Wouldn't Rowling have left some hint of Lestrange's pregnancy in Book 7? If the child was born before the Battle of Hogwarts, wouldn't Voldemort have found some way to use the child to his advantage; especially because at this point he knew Harry was on a quest to destroy his horcruxes? Wouldn't Voldemort have done something desperate with the child knowing almost certainly there was no way that Harry Potter could ever destroy a baby, and thus never destroy him? I don't know-- it just seems too far out from the original story line for me. Voldemort's character in the books was desperate for immortality and power. Based on what we know of him, all signs point to the idea that he would have used that child in an act of desperation or selfishness to quench his thirst for these two things. Marring what was a marvelously crafted fiction series with baby drama seemed rather unnecessary to me. There are so many different directions they could have gone with for a sequel and this "who's your daddy" option was a little too soap opera-y for me.<br/><br/>Although the premise of the play was Albus' struggles with living in his father's shadow and how that affected their relationship, there were too many inconsistencies throughout the play that distracted from this theme. However, Scorpius both on stage and in text was a delight! I would say that his character was probably one of the highlights of the play. Overall, I thought it was a weak follow-up to an epic series. If you read and accept it as something that was intended for the stage and somewhat disconnect yourself from the 7 books, then it's OK. As someone that has been enamored with the HP series since it was first released, I found the play to be underdeveloped and somewhat disappointing. It is definitely worth seeing on stage, but reading it as a standalone makes me wish Rowling would release an eighth book to clear up some of the inconsistencies and reestablish the magical world that we all grew up with and loved. Of course I would recommend reading it, but do so with an open mind.
 This.... was hard to accept as canon, even though I know J.K. wrote it. Because it is a script, all of her amazing storytelling is lost. But it does make me excited to see the play one day in the distant future when it comes to Texas!
 I looked forward to reading this and it was pretty good. I liked it better than a lot of the reviews I read before buying it. I thought it was a good story line and will read it again as I have done with all the HP books.
 Play version was a fast read and the basic story was of some interest, but it certainly didn't rate as book eight of the series.
 Very poorly written and not true to the Harry Potter universe. Jk Rowling did NOT write this. Seriously should never have been released
 Just blah all around. Really was disappointed in this book. I was so excitied for it to come out, then struggled to get through it. It's nothing like the original books. Seemed rushed, plot was extremely weak.
 The script format leaves out a lot of description and feeling that a novel would reveal.  The characters did not speak in a manner consistent with their styles in the novels.  Story hard to follow.  Disappointing.
 I could not get lost in this story. It's  weak to say the least.  A true potter fan will feel the lackluster and miss the Hogwarts escape.
 I love Harry Potter. I've read the books and watched the movies so many times. I'm waiting for my kids to be old enough to go to Harry Potter World so I can pretend it's their idea but really I'm dying to go myself. I was excited about this new story but it is so, so disappointing, I'm bummed I paid for it.<br/><br/>The story just isn't good, the characters don't feel like themselves and there is no depth. I can understand some dislike because it is written as a play so all the details that sets and actors would give, or that would be written into a real novel are missing from this... but even beyond that, it just doesn't have the same feel or style as the original. It's not magical.
 I was very disappointed...I am a big HP fan but this was not worth my money.  The format made it very difficult to follow the story.  I,m not sure what JKR was thinking, but this was a big mistake!  I let my granddaughter read my copy and she didn't, even finish it!
 As a true Potter-head, I went into this book with the expectation of the usual depth of the other books.  It was a bit disappointing that there wasn't the same development; however, it is a very quick and fantastic read for being a script.  Love, love, love the Potters!
 this was a hard read due to that this is in a play format. it s book my daughter really wanted to read and just could get past the play format. so never finished it.
 I’ve always felt that the Harry Potter series had a special quality that was not shared by most children’s books. The play does not have that quality.
 I know my granddaughter will love this. Can't wait to give it to her.
 I am biased. I love HP. I wish it were another one in the series, but a play would do too! :)<br/>Finished the same day I got my copy :) on a weekday, right after work :D<br/>Awesome, feels like school days again.<br/><br/>Thank you JKR! Thanks Amazon!!!!
 Loved getting to meet new characters, and getting to read about the beloved characters from the original series! I found it took much longer to get into the storyear because of the script format. I wish Ms Rowling would write a new series in this world!!
 I read several reviews prior to purchasing and then ultimately reading HP and the Cursed Child. I wasn't going to get it based off some of the reviews, but I wanted to keep an open mind.<br/><br/>I knew it was written as a script; thus, not much detail would be provided. Good thing I managed my expectations. There were plenty of plot holes and characters behaving  uncharacteristically, but I gave it 3 stars because it was still entertaining.<br/><br/>Die hard HP fans will be thoroughly PO'd!
 An enjoyable glimpse into the current days of Harry Potter, and a gut-wrenching view of the past. Love it or hate it, potter fans must read.
 So, did anyone else receive a version that goes to Page 280, and then starts over at page 233?  Once you hit Act 4 Scene 10 in our book, page 280, the next page is page 233.  It then repeats pages 233-280, and ends with the second page 280.
 The physical product is fine, but the story content is horrendous!!  Incredibly inconsistent character personality with the Harry Potter of old, plus  boring and anti-climactic.  Extremely disappointing.
 First and foremost let me say that I am just one individuals opinion, really if you are a lover of the Harry Potter by any means I think you should very much consider reading this script. My heart soared at the prospect of continuing on the story of our beloved characters created by J.K., it was very pleasant to be immersed back into the wizardry world. However that being said I highly doubt that I will ever pick this up again, unlike the other 7 books that I have read time and time again. Many questions that we were all dying to know were in fact answered, but unfortunately I found myself reading just to find out what happens rather than being utterly bewitched by an unfolding plot. At several moments I found myself questioning the actions of the characters that didn't seem to ring true to the dispositions that was so clearly and thoughtfully painted in the original series. Yes I understand that 19 years has passed and time and starting families will change an individual but they seemed to be acting out of character. The plot itself wasn't even half of the quality that I've seen displayed, to be frankly honest if felt as if I was reading mediocre fanfiction. While I loved revisiting familiar places and faces it was a disappointment. By all means I believe potential readers should purchase it and for out for themselves. To me I found it to be as McGonagall explained the Headmaster Portrait's don't even represent half of their subjects and are not to be mistaken as the actual thing.
 This is the play transcript and not necessarily like the other Harry Potter books that's from a 1st person perspective. I like the story a lot and Harry Potter fans won't be disappointed.
 I wish, for the book, it had been rewritten in book format! Instead of keeping the play format. But it had a pretty good story line and it gave a good insight into the future of all our beloved characters from the original series.
 While it's fun to revisit some of these great charters. . .the new charters motivations are silly (borderline stupid).  Every Harry Porter fan must get and read. . .but if this is your first dive. . .avoid.  I'm sure the play is better.
 Somehow this just didn't ring fully true to the Harry Potter universe. The format as a screenplay was a bit distracting and the characters tended to be too angsty for my taste. But still a fun read for most any Fan of the series.
 As with all of the Harry Potter world, you are left wanting more. It's a wonderfully written play, and hopefully I will get to see it at some point, or they will make it into a movie. We can only hope.
 I am a HUGE Harry Potter fan so I definitely had to read this and I am so glad that I did. Definitely had some shocking surprises and I just wish it was longer. I finished it way to fast.
 If I had realized it was a screen play &amp; not a normal book, I wouldn't have ordered it
 Great plot, great book! It took me a little time to get into the groove of reading a "Play" rather than a regular book version. I have enjoyed all the HP books - this one is no exception!
 This was very disappointing... and I did not enjoy the play-script style at all.  I've come to expect Harry Potter books to have great plot depth allowing the reader to immerse themselves into the story.  This book did not fit the bill at all.  It feels almost as if it was just an opportunity to cash-in on the Harry Potter brand.
 I loved having another story to dive into the magical world of Harry Potter. However I wish it would've been a bit longer and more like previous stories. The fact that it was in play form wasn't even that bothersome. Just wish there was a bit more.
 It's written as a screenplay. That takes a little getting used to. But it's a good story, if not a little short.
 Regardless of its genre, the fracturing of the characters' underlying truths made this play shallow and frustrating. The plot really takes on the silliest twists as if the foundations laid by Rowling in the HP series were irrelevant. I embraced the format of a play, but the collapse of the characters into caricatures and slim, one-dimensional reactionaries made this play a weak representation of Rowling's foundation.
 Not Harry Potter (obviously) but I enjoyed jumping back into the Potter universe for a day (the book was very small). Not something I will read again and again like the originals, but still worth reading at least once for any fan.
 I enjoyed the story very much.  Its a quick read with well known characters along with new and interesting additions.  True Harry Potter fans will enjoy it but will certainly be wanting more at the end.  I'm looking forward to the next installment.
 Bought for my better half.  She plowed through then our son did.  They both loved it.  Nice hard back edition and apparently, a great read.
 I love how the story incorporated the main conflict of the first 7 books and building a new plot on top of that. Sometimes when an author attempts to add on to an already completed great story, things can can become excessive and over the top. This 8th book/playwright was written well and fully descriptive and while a new plot, still stuck with the the story points that made the Harry Potter series so great!
 J.K. Rowling does not disappoint! The book doesn't revolve only around Harry Potter and it's important to remember that when reading it! I had fun reading it and would recommend it to all Potterheads out there!
 The problem is that it seems to come from someone else's words, Because it is. I enjoyed this a lot but it is a story that isn't as grand. More along the lines of a really good made for tv production, not something as great as the original but still has some of the same flares. I enjoyed it but it has its flaws
 No where near as good as the Harry Potter novels. Because it is a play script the details were lacking heavily. Nice to have some story line outside of Harry though.
 The staging must be spectacular because the play itself isn't nearly as good as the reviews would lead one to expect
 There are parts reminiscent of the original series' charm &amp; wit, but there are also clumsy attempts to tackle complex things in the space of a stage production that might work with the right performers but make for awkward reading. Still, it was nice to see the old gang again...
 Reading this made my heart hurt. A child who feels unloved and cast aside can create immeasurable darkness. JK Rowling never ceases to amaze me as she creates a beautifully fantastic world of magic while embracing the human condition - we seek to be loved and love in return.
 Arrived on time. Fair price. He loves this book. Almost done with it!
 Strange how so much of the beauty and strength of the books can be undone with such a unimaginative, obvious plot.  This, makes The Whole story weak and beloved characters emotionally shallow and pathetic.
 Captures the heart and expounds on the tricky aspects of the seven novels.  I enjoyed reading it in one day.
 This is definitely a good read. It took a few chapters to get used to the screen play format. If you were expecting a classic J. K. Rowling style then this is not the book for you. However, if you are a true Harry Potter fan, this book will not disappoint.
 I am a Harry Potter fan from way back.. I was so excited to read this. It was a little difficult to get into at first due to the way it is written. But after a couple of chapters I got used to it and LOVED it! I wish it would have been a much much longer story.
 The story is ok. Some of the dialogue is good. Some isn't. But let's not fool ourselves. We all wanted this to recapture the magic of the original books. There's no way it could. This is a story that is nothing more than a quick read with some of our favorite characters. Take it for that and you'll be just fine. Expect it to be "Book 8" and you'll be let down.
 My daughter and I read this together and we stayed up the last night until 3am because we couldn't put it down and just had to finish it! Highly Recommend!
 I'm a big fan of JK Rowling but not thrilled that it's written like a Shakesperian play!!  I like my stories to flow....not Act 1, Scene 1, etc.  I got disinterested quickly.  My granddaughter loves it.  I only got though 1/2 of Act 1.  Nothing against the book, just the style.  As I'm reminded by the girl, it wasn't for me in the first place.
 I had to get this book glad to get this. Who doesn't love Harry potter. Besides the service and speedy I may add, brand new condition. Look forward to reading this book to my grandparents kids.
 Really disappointed. Seemed to me as if author depended on riding on the wave of past successes. Story-line = boring, predictable &amp; unimaginative. Plot kept jumping around, despite that being supposedly integral. Lost the spark of original books. Tended toward the maudlin. Never caught my attention. Definitely Not a page turner. Oh well?! Harry's grown up &amp; moved on - so who cares ...
 Good.
 It is frustrating to me to read a play without some visual stage setting.  I did really like the plot and the action and the switches in personalities.  I hope some day to SEE the play and get the full treatent.
 is written in the form of a play some times hart to follow
 Very poorly executed, all around bad and unbelievable plot, not true to characters, just horrible. Nothing like books 1-6. Would not recommend.
 I am a 68 yr old grandmother and I read Harry Potter with the kids.<br/>This book STINKS!!<br/>Don't waster your money.  If you have to read it get it from the library so you can use your money for a better book.
 It was awful.. Loved the Harry Potter novels.. Hated reading the play... Got through about 15 pages and erased it from my Kindle.
 I did enjoy the story line but I found myself missing the usual first person point of view with every detail being told from one characters POV with his/her thoughts on everything. There were a couple instances I yearned for the usual extensive detail of JKR's other books. But overall I couldn't put it down and really enjoyed the plot twist!
 I liked it but there were a couple of things that made me raise my eyebrows about the validity of it happening.  However, I do like anything that allows me to see into the further life and Harry Ron and Hermione.
 Great!
 It was a bit weird to read a book in a play format but soon I forgot all about the unusual formatting and got really into it! Highly recommended for all Potterheads!
 The book was in the condition as it was promised, but I'll keep my content review for Goodreads.
 Honestly I didn't enjoy it the way I enjoyed Harry potter series. The only good about this book was the relationship between malfoy's boys and harry's boys. If I knew how was written the book I wouldnt bough it or at list the price I pay for it.
 in this book she shows you who is talking..you have to read it till the end, cause at one point you think the book is done but, you have to read further cause its not done till the end..
 So poorly written that I even can't describe how disappointed I am. I am a huge fan of Harry Potter, but let's face it:it's worse than any fan fiction. I feel so ashamed for the author, but if you can't write, just don't do this. I couldn't rip myself from Rowling's books, but here I can't just finish. I regret spending money on it.
 You have to accept this for what it is- a play. It will not have the same plot description, character building, or feeling that time was put into it. It is not like any of the other books in the Harry Potter canon and for that I was slightly disappointed. It was very fact-by-fact with no room for interpretation. However, if you are a Harry Potter lover or liker, then I do recommend checking this out if nothing but for your curiosity.
 I ordered it for my son.  He said it was a great book.  Bert Weisheit
 I absolutely loved it! When I got to the end of the book I almost didn't want it to end at all. It was very beautifully written and rendered in the fact that it was a play script version of the story really answered some questions that had been on my mind since the last book and movie installments.
 The book was written like a script, and lacked the details the previous Harry Potter books had.
 It's not a book and doesn't have the depth of the other stories - I think everyone understands that now.  But it's fun to revisit some old friends and listen to some 'what-ifs' that are explored in the story.  I believe that most HP fans will appreciate the extra time with the characters.
 I first off don't like that it's a screen-play. After that it's obvious this was not a JK Rowling book and the leaps in time were staggering, but I guess if its a play it would have to be. I'll get my Potter fix with Magical Beasts.
 saw a lot of negativity about this but I liked it fine. Anybody who complains that it is a script and not a novel is blind or a moron; it says on the book jacket that it is a script.
 Sorry not at all what I was expecting....I would not have bought it if I knew what I was getting. I was able to get past it reading like a play but it is not like anything JK Rowlings has done. I don't think her name should even be on it other than an honorable mention.
 I bought this yesterday and finished it today! Non-stop excitement and the characters are wonderful! Highly recommended to any Harry Potter fans!
 I loved this book! I cannot wait until it is made into a movie. I hope more books follow this one.
 It isn't as good as the regular Harry Potter books, but I enjoyed the story.  I was able to read it a little too quickly.  I would rather have another Harry Potter book from JK Rowling, herself.  I know that seven books is a lot about one subject, but I'd like to know what happened in the wizarding world after Harry defeated Voldemort.
 Great book- have to read it again. Loved the complex plot and the new and old characters
 Harry Potter fans must have this!  Is a great addition to the series.
 The tone is wrong, the plot is weak and the characters weaker.  Loved the Harry Potter series but was very disappointed in the lack of substance in this book.
 Wish I could have loved it. As a fan from when the original books came out (as a student) I was looking for additional closure to a beloved childhood memory, what I got was a bunch of sugar coated fan service. Just don't expect too much.
 I thoroughly enjoyed this story. I will always be a huge fan of JK Rowling and the Harry Potter Series. Nothing makes me happier than to read about the wizarding world of Harry Potter. I hate to see it come to an end but it's an end of a beautiful era.
 Another installment in the HP series. My husband has begun this book, but hasn't finished it yet.<br/>The only thing I have found odd is that it reads more like fan fic as opposed to the typical Rowling style.
 After thinking we (the fans) would never get anymore true Harry Potter stories, this was amazing.  Within the first 15 pages I had tears stinging my eyes because it was like being home again, like seeing old friends after so many years.  Although they are older and in different places you have the same bonds and the same type of jokes, it was perfection.  I loved meeting and delving into one of Harry's kids.  This story was so relatable and compelling.  I couldn't put it down.  Ready to read it again and can't wait to see the stage version come to the U.S.
 I wanted to like this book for I love Harry Potter. I was disappointed. Harry didn't act like himself at all. In fact in my opinion I thought none of the main characters acted like themselves. It was hard to imagine Harry talking to his son the way he did. The adventure that Draco's and Harry's son go on also disappointed me as well. I would have still read the book but wish it was better then it was.
 1. Reads like fanfiction (which we now know that is, more or less). Obviously not JK Rowling's writing.<br/>2. It violates laws of the magical universe as set in the previous seven novels.<br/>3. The major characters' personalities have deviated dramatically from their former literary selves.<br/>4. Frequently cringeworthy.
 My boyfriend love it
 Good play, but if you're looking for the same things that drew you into the HP books you may be disappointed. It's a cute little story that's not too deep, probably amazing on a stage!
 It obviously was not written by J.K. Rowling. It was not her style and I found it very boring. It could of been a great book with the right story. I wish I would of sent it back and got my money back.
 This is not the book, this is the screen play.  Still pretty cool though
 I raced through this book and truly enjoyed reading it. It is what is it though, a play. Fast paced and not much build up of characters. Save your money and remember the HP series for how it truly ended.
 I didn't realize this was the play version. My daughter still read it even though she was a bit disappointed.
 I really loved this book. I know a lot of people left bad reviews but I think it's a good book. Keep in mind this is a script first of all and doesn't read like a normal book. There are a few cheesy moments throughout but I enjoyed it!
 Interesting twists in the characters and story.  You would have thought the adult families would have been different; however, the complexity formed by the Harry Potter series characters, shows up in the children and young adults.
 My 9 yr old son has wanted this book since forever.  Its written in script form so its different frim her other books.  My son has read to pg. 11 and he likes it so far.
 I sooooo wanted to love this book/script, but unfortunately, it's sooooooo bad. Even just as a play, it's not well written. Plays are mostly dialogue, and the dialogue is so incredibly, weak/corny, it makes for terrible reading. Stage directions are awful ("This scene is all about magic"???) And as far as the series goes, it's completely out of touch, and ruins pretty much every character involved. Ron is reduced to pure comic relief and has no substance whatsoever. Malfoy is.....nice and understanding?? And the plot is just so awful. I'm not giving away any spoilers here, but it makes no sense on so many levels.<br/><br/>So if you're a fan, and you just can't help yourself, then sure, go ahead and read it. But prepare to be incredibly disappointed.
 Came just as described, used excellent condition cover to cover. At the bookstore I would have paid $35 I saved $25 &amp; still made my daughter very happy by finishing her set.
 Just a get richer quick scheme.  No plot, silly format, big disappointment<br/>Kids will find it very hard to follow.  Dumb book.
 Bought hoping it would be mostly regular book style. NOPE it is 100% playscript. I was hoping to buy Fantastic Beasts but it also is a playscript i guess. Really disappointed.
 Short story about an adventure in Harry's adult life. I didn't enjoy the screenplay format or the minimalist storyline.  Sorry.
 While I think the premise is good, I was disappointed that I just spent $15 on a screenplay that I read in less then 30 minutes. I personally would not recommend this download for the amount that was charged.
 If you liked the previous Harry potter books you'll enjoy this. Warning it is a play. I love plays but it is more fun to watch a play. I did miss the narration and added imager a book of fiction.
 Very good story as usual, would love another, the only thing it's a screen play. A true book would have gotten another star Harry potter cannot be long enough.....ever...the best series I have ever read.
 Everything about this play book was written beautifully to piece together the lives of the characters post deathly Hallows. A must read for any fan out there! It is beautifully constructed as a play so you can use your imagination as to how the characters react in their environments in your own way.
 Ditto
 It's not a Harry Potter book - the style, the story, the format, it's very different than something JK Rowling would write. The story is pretty unsatisfactory unfortunately, I really wanted to like it. I think as an actual play it would be entertaining though!
 Some people may not like the script format, however it didn't bother me since I'd done theatre in the past. I absolutely love the new conflict JK Rowling creates and how it resolves....she is an amazing writer and it's wonderful to read a new story years after the original series came out. Thank you, Jo!
 All wrong! I'm not sure how much "input" J.K. Rowling actually had into this piece of rubbish, as the characters that we have all grown to love are so completely out of character it's shameful. Rowling penned Dumbledore as once saying, "We must all face the choice between what is right and what is easy"...this was very clearly the easy route to a quick buck at the expense of Potter fans who trusted that Rowling would not lead them astray. Alas, we were very much mistaken.
 It's like a horrible fan fiction that completely break cannon and the rules of the universe that J.K. built. Do yourself a massive favor and do not read this.
 Didn't think I would like this, but I did.
 I was very disappointed. I had been looking forward to a sequel to the Harry Potter series. Instead, it is written as a play. I found it very disconcerting and could not get into the story at all. It's not a story at all.
 I guess I was expecting a real book. Jokes on me.
 Written as a play and easy to read.  Good story.  Two other authors helped write it but JK's writing came through and keeps the story moving well.  Nice to have more Harry Potter to read!
 I loved this book/play. I thought that this was an excellent addition to the Harry Potter series. While i would have loved this to have been in the same vein as all of the other books it was fun reading it in play format being a former thespian. I think every Potterhead will love reading this.
 It seemed like average "fan fic" to me.  I think I'll go back to pretending that never happened.  I'm a huge Harry Potter fan, and I have no problem with them doing this for charity, nice thing.  I didn't really enjoy reading the play, though.
 While I would have preferred a novel instead of the screen play, I still enjoyed every minute getting back into the story I love so much. It was just enough of the past to make it nostalgic, with enough new characters and twists to make it hard to put down.
 I've read all the books and it is nice to have a conclusion to the series. I thought this book was an excellent read even though it was in book form. Overall I recommend if you are a Harry Potter fan this is a great addition to the collections.
 I haven't read a play before, so this was quite different. But I was thirsty for more Harry Potter and this delivered. Only rated four stars because I would have liked to see it in book form not play form. If it turns into a movie , it had better have all of the original actors!
 First of all, I was not looking forward to reading this as it was meant to be a play and I wanted to see it on stage, but as I live in Argentina and could not get tickets when I travelled to London, I ended up buying the kindle edition.<br/>As a huge HP fan I was willing to give this book a chance, even knowing that it was not written by JK Rowling. I think it was very deceitful how it was promoted (in Argentina people were talking about the 8th Harry Potter book!), but I was willing to overlook this for the love of Potter.<br/>I had very low expectations...but the script doesn't even live up to them.  The characters have lost their essence, the dialogues are very choppy, the situations are unbelievable and the plot is full of holes.<br/>*SPOLIERS*<br/>What I didn’t like:<br/>1. I do not believe that Voldemort would have a child. He is not a sexual being, he is driven by power. Also, maybe this is different in wizard world, but Bellatrix should be too old to be able to carry a baby.<br/>2. If they had had a baby in Malfoy manor, Draco would know about this. They were living in the same house! How come this never comes up? He never tells anyone?<br/>3. I understand that Draco kind of redeems himself at the end of Deathly Hallows, but he is still a Death Eater...how come he raises the best kid in the whole story? Albus is a whiny self-centered drama queen and Rose is a selfish snob. In the epilogue of the books they show that they are not really aware of their parents’ fame, so why would Rose show this entitlement about having to choose carefully their friends because everyone would want to be their friend? I cannot believe that a child raised by Hermione and Ron would be this cold and stuck up!!!<br/>4. Leave Dumbledore alone. He does not deserve to appear in such a stupid, blubbering manner.<br/>5. My biggest problem: the PLOT. If we are supposed to believe that this was all Delphi's plan, how come Albus thinks about it? Did she incept this idea in his mind? if so, this should have been made more clear. In order to "surprise" us with the fact that she is the villain they left a huge plot hole, because Albus decides by himself (after overhearing a conversation) that he is going to help Mr. Diggory, he escapes the Hogwarts express with much difficulty, finds the retirement home (how?), informs them of his plan, finds pollyjuice potion (how?), has parts of Ron, Harry and Hermione to change into and decides to steal the timeturner and go back to save Cedric. How did Delphini plan this? It is really very improbable.<br/>6. In the alternate reality where Ron and Hermione never marry we are presented with a bitter, unfulfilled, cold Hermione...yeah...right. Because she cannot find professional and personal success without a husband and kids by her side. This is so sexist and un-Rowling like that it made me sick.<br/>7. Harry forbids Albus from being friends with Scorpius. This is stupid, out of character and annoying. AND he is nasty to Prof. MacGonagall (who must be really old by now!)<br/>8. I will not believe that Cedric could EVER become a Death Eater. This is stupid. We are presented with a character who is good, and noble. No amount of humiliation would have turned him into a DE<br/>9. So, Hermione is the Minister of Magic but she doesn’t increase or improve the security. To the point that the kids infiltrate it the same way that she already did! She knows that this is a flaw in security! And, as someone else stated in their review, how come the Ministry does nothing to dispel the rumor that Scorpius is Voldy’s son???? Hermione cannot be such a bad Minister! She is supposed to be the cleverest witch of her time!<br/>10. The people who wrote this script are not really familiar with how magic works in this Universe. They forgot how to make pollyjuice potion (Albus thinks that it would be a good plan and they discard this idea because they do not have a part of Voldemort, nobody points out that they need at least a month to brew it!!! And it is not possible to transfigure a person into someone else! This was never presented during the 7 books! It is unacceptable that it is possible now. What about the FIDELIUS CHARM?????? How can they all see Harry’s parents, find his house??????????? They were in hiding!!!!!! This is just sloppy! Or maybe there is an explanation and I can’t find it.<br/>11. I won’t get into the whole time travel plot hole, but it is lazy and stupid. I would have preferred a new story and adventure and leave the past in the past.<br/>What I liked:<br/>1. Taking a glimpse at my beloved characters  again(although they are not themselves)<br/>2. Scorpius. He is by far the best character in the story.<br/>3. Going back to Godric’s Hollow.<br/>4. Finding out that Harry has some contact with Duddley.<br/>5. Scorpius and Albus friendship…maybe even more? I loved them together.<br/>I really hope that the stage version is better: probably with good acting and special effects this could be entertaining. I insist on telling all my friends that this is NOT the 8th Harry Potter book! It is not. I hope that JK Rowling writed something more about this story in Pottermore to clarify this errors and make me love the future Harry Ron and Hermione as much as their book versions!
 I thought this was a good read other than the fact it was written in script format. I enjoyed it finished in about two days. This was more about Harry's son  so that makes it a good read for me.
 It was worthy of being the sequel. I was a little confused at first as I was expecting a book rather than the play. But once i got over that, I was "turning" the pages rapidly! I read it on my Kindle and cannot wait to get the actual book to add it to my collection!
 Enjoyed it immensely and had no problem reading it as a script. I had enough background from all the  previous Harry Potter movies and books that I could fill in all of the magic that was behind the storyline.
 I am big Harry Potter fan so I was looking forward to this. Not your classic Harry Potter book but a great book nevertheless. The story was engaging, thought provoking and it tied in rather well with the previous books. Of course I would have rather watched the play but still a great a read and a must have for any Harry Potter fan!
 Okay, so I've been reading Potter books since I was 11 and was fortunate enough to kinda grow up with Harry because most years if there wasn't a new book out there was a movie. So, of course I was super stoked for this one. Without giving away any spoilers, I will say that it is a lot darker than I expected to the point that it became a bit of a slog around act 3. Also, keep in mind that it is a play script and not a novel so it does lack some of the richness of description as you would have in the books. I would not recommend this for someone who is not very familiar with the Potter universe simply because without the visuals or more descriptive language they would probably miss some of what is happening. It also reads a bit like fanfic, complete with a Mary Sue. That said, it was still an enjoyable trip down Nostalgia lane. All your favorite characters make appearances (even some you might not expect to see) and is worth adding to your collection if you love Harry Potter.
 its a nice twist on things and could have been more in depth and longer but progressed nicely. great read none the less, hate that the ride is ending but was a good ride
 Alot of action
 This book was a big let down. NOT because it is a script. I knew that going in. I was just very disapointed
 It's a good quality book and the jacket feels very nice. The content of the book is not my favorite. I didn't care for it, but the quality of the pages also felt very nice.
 Unreadable. So sad.
 This is an extremely poor representation of the Harry Potter franchise.  The writers of this book should be ashamed to even have put JK Rowling on the cover.  This book is inconsistent with the rules of magic that were established throughout JK Rowling's 7-book Harry Potter series, and the behavior of the people in the book is completely inconsistent with the beloved characters presented in her previous novels.  I advise everyone who is considering the book not to read it, and I truly wish I hadn't.
 It has now been 22 years since the battle of Hogwarts and Voldemort's ultimate defeat. Harry and Ginny are married with three children: James, Albus, and Lily. Ron and Hermione are married with two children of their own. This account revolves around Albus, the misfit of the family. He is so afraid he will be sorted into Slytherin and in his first year his worst fears are confirmed. These seem to be Harry's worst fears too. An unexpected friendship with Scorpius Malfoy makes the relationship between Harry and Albus drift even further apart. After overhearing Amos beg Harry for what he believes to be the last remaining time turner in existence, Albus gets it in his head that by saving Cedric Diggory he can right all his father's wrongs.<br/><br/>I really liked this installment in the Harry Potter saga. The screenplay format made it a quick and easy read. There was a lot of emotion and feeling. The middle part of the story was phenomenal. Without giving too much away, I loved seeing the alternate versions of the wizarding world. The reappearance of so many beloved characters was a real treat.<br/><br/>The one thing I didn't like is that I felt like some of the characters weren't true to their nature's from the previous books in the series. Snape and Draco in particular. Though I did enjoy the direction they went with Draco and hearing his entire story made me understand more. Also, McGonagall was much more lax as headmistress when as a teacher she was extremely strict and a stickler for rules.<br/><br/>I would give this one a4 out of 5. I liked it. It had some really great parts while others fell flat. The resolution to the main plot was good but I thought the resolution to character relationships I thought was lacking. I would've liked to see a bit more development there. It is definitely worth reading for fans of the series!
 Ugh. Fan fiction at best.
 I must admit that I waited to buy this book and began reading it with trepidation, due to all the negative reviews I read about it; but, overall, I liked the play and would like to address some of the things other reviewers have said.<br/><br/>First, should it have been a book instead of a play?  I would have liked to have had it be a book (or even a series of books, as we could have seen the development of the next generation), as that would have allowed more detail and character development, but the play was OK and if the authors were looking to tell a good story without spending too much time and effort to write a whole book, they succeeded.  The pace moved quickly, I'm sure prompted by the limited time a play would allow, but it kept me involved and there were a sufficient number of surprises to keep me interested.<br/><br/>A lot of people didn't like the people Harry and his friends had become, but I found them to be believable adult developments of the kids we knew from the books.  Was this the only way they could have turned out?  Of course not, but it was one, reasonable, way.  The only one who I didn't like was Ron, whom they made out to be little more than an insignificant, silly and almost meaningless piece of fluff.  Granted, in the books he was the least important of the trio, but he still played a significant role. In the play, they could have left him out entirely and it could only have served to improve things.  On the other hand, I liked the way Harry and Draco interacted.  And Ginny continued to show herself as the marvelous person she was.<br/><br/>The whole thing about time travel - a lot of people didn't like it.  Given that they had introduced time turners in the books, the canon certainly gives credence to the concept and it presented a lot of opportunities for Albus and Scorpius to meet some of the characters from the books and grow to know their parents better, which I think added to the story.  It also presented some alternative timelines that were interesting and helped the boys to learn several important life lessons.<br/><br/>Some said that this didn't seem to be written by J. K., but I thought there was sufficient body to the story and characters that her involvement was clear.  True, it wasn't up to her level of detail and magical fun, but to be fair, I don't know how much more could have been fit into a stage play.  The pace was much too fast for much more development.  As I said before, there were still enough surprises and development that I thought it was reasonably well written.<br/><br/>The gay thing.  First, regarding the boys.  Perhaps it was written a little touchy-feely, but both boys showed interest in girls, so I think their closeness was primarily from intense friendship, caused in no small part by their loneliness and rejection by the other students, and heightened potentially by latent homosexuality generated as a reasonably normal learning about relationships by sensitive young boys.  As far as Dumbledore is concerned, I know J. K. has stated that she always considered him to be gay, but the way he was written in this story, I'm not sure this applied to his feelings for Harry.  If it did, then his feelings toward Harry would likely be beyond simply gay and be more those of a pedophile, which would have gotten him into trouble at some point in his career as a teacher and headmaster.  I think the feelings he expressed toward Harry were more along the lines of the love a father would feel toward his son.<br/><br/>Finally, if I could find a major fault with this story, it is that it was a piece of fluff compared to the books.  In SS, I was drawn into the magical world by wonder and the fun twists and turns of the things Harry encountered as he learned about this world he was born into but didn't know at all.  As the books went on, the story became ever darker and more intense as Harry found himself driven toward his fate.  This made the stories more involved and attractive to older readers, such as myself.  The epilogue in DH was bordering on fluff and a bit less satisfying because it was so nice and predictable.  Upon finishing the play, I found myself feeling much the same way as I felt after finishing DH.  The play's story was enjoyable and drew me in, but the ending left me feeling a little bit sugary.<br/><br/>In summary, then, if you're expecting a story of the intensity and detail of the books, you'll be disappointed; but, if you read it accepting that it is a play and, therefore, must move at a faster, less-detailed pace, I think you'll enjoy the story.  Harry and his friends are still there.
 For all HP fans - love that it's hardback but also that the pages are not clean cut!  Feels like we got all the loose pages of the screen play!
 I loved this book I'm a huge harry potter fan j have read every book and watched every movie and I love them all I chose this rating since it is full of action and adventure my favorite part was when Albus helped out harry potter and won the battle. I can't wait to read the two new book J.K. Rowling is coming out with
 Good story but way too slow until the third act. If you're a fan of the Harry Potter series you take for granted how fast the stories move, not so much in the play.
 I felt like the characters of Snape, Ron, and Draco were not believable as we knew them. The whole thing felt more like Harry Potter fan fiction than something JKR would have written. It was better than nothing but I don't think I will be rereading it like I did with the original books.
 Great for those who are always looking for more of Harry and friends. It is a play script, and not written solely by JKR, so be prepared for a read that is different from the original story.
 I didn't know what to expect.  Reading a play can be difficult.  This wasn't. The new characters fit in seemlessly with the familiar.  New action integrated with old stories.  Left me wanting more adventures.
 It is written as a stage play.  I would recommend reading it out loud with a group of friends, as it is a play.  The story itself is nothing amazing, but I appreciate it.  I'm sure it's a huge difference watching it as a play.
 Definitely not as awesome as the original HP series, but it was also a screenplay &amp; they tend to be light on details.  I'm not used to reading screenplays, so I think that is part of the issue.
 Follows the writing style of J K Rowling and makes a smooth transition from the last Harry Potter book. Is based on the play and written in that style but still a must read for any fan of Harry Potter.
 Ended too soon!
 It was a huge disappointment. The vivid description from the earlier books is missing. No character development. Even understanding it was written in form of s play-it was still disappointing.
 The screenplay format took a bit to get used to, but I quickly fell back into the flow of J.K. Rowling's amazing wizarding world. Great read!
 I enjoyed the story. I cannot understand how Voldamort could have a child with Belatrix he had no love for anyone. That would mean in my opinion, he would not be interested in sex because he had no feelings.
 Disappointing. Very little character development and predictable plot "twists." All our favorite HP characters became lackluster adults and the new children seem incapable and a bit idiotic, which starkly contrasts with the children in the original series. May better translate on stage.
 Like many on here, I purchased this more or less blind on Kindle, expecting something written by Rowling. This is sub standard as literature, although the play itself may well be excellent in performance.
 I was a little disappointed in the writing style of this. The story was ok, but the Dialog was very week and childish, and not up to the Harry Pottery usual.
 Pretty sure that the only parts of this screenplay that J.K. Rowling "wrote" are the parts that were taken from The Deathly Hallows. The plot is basically terrible and the concept of time travel does not line up at all with the concept in the original seven books. We should just pretend this never happened.
 Girlfriend said the book was not that great and she was disappointed.  Unfortunately, this is not the copy she read.  We found it at Barnes &amp; Noble the day before and she was finished with that copy before this copy even arrived.
 Loved the book. It was fun to read on a trip.
 Look, if you're buying the 8th book, you're deep into Harry Potter and are going to read it no matter what. Do you really need a review? Just buy the thing and move on with your life. :)
 Little to no thought into the characters, or plot.
 As described
 This didn't feel like authentic Harry Potter - I almost felt like I was reading fan fiction. I don't know if it was because she just didn't do a great job aging the characters, or what, but it felt like a chore to read it.
 It's not canon-compliant, and the writing quality is not good. I understand why people who haven't read the books more than once might enjoy it, and that it must be an amazing play, but the story should have never been announced as canon. Maybe I'm bitter. But don't spend money on it if you're a diehard fan--the story will just break your heart, and not in a good way.
 I thought the play format would bug me, but it didn't at all. I was able to jump right into the story and be immediately transported back to the wonderful world of Harry Potter. It was a fantastic read!
 I know it's a screen play, and that DID take some getting used to (I had to read it aloud to keep the characters straight) BUT, it's still Harry Potter! And it was great to be reunited with the characters and the school and the magic. Some seemed a little predictable, but I savored most every minute of it! Definitely worth reading if you are a Potter fan!
 I have no idea why JK went along with this. Utterly worthless fanfiction drek
 great quality as expected
 The negatives: It feels as though JK Rowling was looking for inspiration for a new book and found it by watching a TNT re run of Back to the Future Part II.  It's hard to root for the main character.<br/><br/>The positives: quick and easy read, and it scratched my Harry Potter itch.<br/><br/>Overall:  decent.  Not terrible.  Not great.  3 stars is appropriate.
 It was not my favorite format but was still a pleasure to "revisit" the Harry Potter family.  The story was interesting and ingenious as usual with these stories.
 Wow. I still can't believe what I read and its been weeks later. This might be my favorite Harry Potter book yet. I went into it thinking the whole "written like a script" aspect would be annoying but it actually helps you keep track of the characters. I loved this book.
 Too bad this couldn't have been flushed out into a novel, but I thoroughly enjoyed it all the same! My second reading has been as a bedtime story. Plays are definitely meant to be read aloud. I only wish I had the talent to do all the voices...
 This was a very easy piece to read and I enjoyed seeing what became of my favorite witches and wizards after they grew up and had children of their own.
 My granddaughter just finished the Harry Potter series and was sad till she received this book!  Made her birthday.
 A screen play gives too much for interpretation. I loved Rowling's descriptions, but this was not it
 I absolutely loved this!  Quite frankly, in many ways, I liked it better than the books.  I could not stop until I finished the entire play.  I highly recommend it for anyone who loves the Harry Potter series.
 I loved it! It really doesn't matter that is "script written" it doesn't affect the wonderful story that this one is. Just as magical as all the Harry Potter books. I couldn't put it down!
 The play format was very tiresome and too little time given to the next generation kids. Still it did have Harry and the gang. I really couldn't recommend this one.
 Exciting to read another Harry Potter book but... missing all the magic from the old books.
 Love the old characters!  The book is written as a play so it is not typical HP books.  It is  a little difficult at first but the story is compelling.  After the first 100 pages, one is used it the style.
 First of all I didn't realize it was in play form. So that was very different, I got use to that and then realized it was a fast moving play. Years pasted in a few pages.<br/>There was no feeling involved with the writing, almost as if J. K. Rowling wanted it done so she could move on.  At the end of the "writing" I disliked everyone.<br/>This is the last book J. K. Rowling will get me to buy. I don't even want to reread the Harry Potter books.  Very disappointed that she didn't have a vested interest in Harry to write a decent sequel. The Cursed Child was anyone who read the book.
 Read it in 3 days ... But then again, I AM A SUPER HARRY POTTER FAN!! Awesome play :)
 This is a play.  Pails in comparison to the books.
 eh. Not a fan. I read this in advance of my daughter to check content and this is far and away the least impressive Harry Potter book, but I guess for fans, it is a must read.
 Worthy addition to the other works. I enjoyed it thoroughly. I’d love to see this as a movie maybe some day soon.
 This book is a waste of time.  JK should be ashamed of herself.  If she wants to write a play then do it.  Do not try to make Harry Potter into some stupid attempt to playwrite.  I want my money back and all of the time I wasted reading this junk.
 LOVE
 Not bad but it does go around in a big circle. From what I've heard, the play is best seen in the theatre if one can afford the flight to London and has the patience to acquire a ticket far off in the future!
 Different reading Harry Potter as a screen play, but the stories can never go wrong in my book. The original series is the whole reason I'm so into reading now. I loved this one just like all the others.
 Very disappointing compared to the original books. Probably due to the play write form, the characters were flat. The plot was ok but not great
 This is an insult to the Harry Potter series.  I wish I hadn't bought it.
 A disappointing return.  As much as I love J.K. Rowling, this book reads like mediocre fan fiction.  If you want more tales from the world of Harry Potter I'd suggest watching Fantastic Beasts.
 It is a very disappointed  book if you are following the HP saga, just like a fan story, totally disappointed content  I'm sure JK Rowling didn't wrote this
 Very disappointing. Doesn't sound like JK's writing style at all. Pure Fan fiction.
 The beginning of closure for poor Harry
 I don't even know where to start.  My love for ALL things Harry Potter runs deep.  This is in my opinion HANDS DOWN the GREATEST series ever written.  The thought of being able to dive back into this world made me so, so happy.  I have had the book for a while and have been dying to get to it, but other things got in the way.  Now that I am done, I just want to open it up and read it again.<br/><br/>I cannot even count anymore how many times I have listened to The Harry Potter Series, or read it, or watched the movies.  It is too many to count.  Every time I get like a giddy little school girl again, because they make me that excited and happy.<br/><br/>Anyhow, lets get on to the review.<br/><br/>This is a script of the play that is now playing in England where I wish I was right now watching it.  We get to go on a ride with Harry's son Albus, and Malfoy's son Scorpius.<br/><br/>Albus is a lot like Harry, he likes to "fix" things which usually means he is getting into trouble.  Scorpius, is nothing like his father.  He is kind and he befriends Albus right off.<br/><br/>These two remind me so much of Harry and Ron.  Albus and Harry do not get a long very well, and when he befriended Scorpius Harry forbade him to see him anymore.  As a parent of a teenagers I know that is the WRONG thing to say...hehe<br/><br/>Needless to say, Albus and Scorpius set off on an adventure to change the world so that Albus can make his dad proud.<br/><br/>This is such a wonderful read.  I cannot express that enough.  I weeped like a new born baby while reading this book.  I laughed, got mad, and a whole other plethora of emotions.  Rowling's writing goes beyond brilliant.  She makes a world come to life in ways I have never experienced with another book.  She has made these characters personal to me, and I love that more than anything.<br/><br/>If you haven't picked this book up, you should.  Especially if you are a Harry Potter fan.  I know there are so many nay sayers out there about this book, but in my opinion they don't know what they are talking about..hehe<br/><br/>I hope there are more to come.  I hope they make this into a movie or bring the play to America.  I need more Harry Potter in my life.  It just makes me happy.
 My sister loves this !! Thank you
 Disappointed in the butchering of beloved characters, poor plot with major holes and lame new characters.
 Loved it
 I really wish Rowling had quit while she was ahead. Now she's just a sell-out. This piece of crap doesn't belong anywhere near the original 7 Harry Potter novels. She's undermining her own legacy.
 Not true to the original characters we all know and love. New characters are not developed in a satisfying way. I understand this would play different on stage, but having great actors is not a good excuse for poorly written characters. Convoluted plot with both major and minor holes. I'm going to treat this as fan fiction because this simply does not do the original characters justice.
 Must read if a harry potter fan but story had more holes than swiss cheese (without posting spoilers) and the way it was written was just not JK (I know it's not her writing which is why it's just not as good).
 I didn't think I would like reading this in play format, but it was great couldn't put it down. Read a few chapters one night then next night read the rest of the whole book. Would recommend this to anyone who are a fan of Harry Potter books.
 Great book!
 The only reason I am giving this a 3 rating is because there was not much in the way of description of locations.<br/>As far as a play goes, I'd say it is a 5.<br/><br/>I would very much like to see Harry Potter and the Cursed Child be developed into a novel, with all the wonderful detail and description that J.K. Rowling has done in the past with all the other Harry Potter novels. Her writing, in that way, is sorely missed.
 Really really really bad. It's sad to think this is a true J. K. Rowling story. It all feels wrong, the story, the format, the plot (oh that awful plot).
 Interesting simultaneous flash forward to the next generation and flash back to what's gone before. Helpful reminder of the inter connectedness of all people and places in time and the impact that the slightest of modifications has.
 Reads like fanfiction....really bad fanfiction.  Characters are completely divorced from their abilities and habits found in J K Rowlings original series masterpieces.  It is a play script, and reads as such, but the problem is the story itself.  Suspension of disbelief is just impossible.  Very disappointed and will be when they make it movie as well.
 I enjoyed the story but reading a play is not the same as reading her story form.  I missed the descriptions and I found it was over before it began.  I really wish it was could have been a regular book too.
 I bought this for my 10 year old grandson.  He is a great Harry Potter fan.  He was thrilled to receive this book and could not put it down.  He read it in less than a week.
 I enjoyed this book so much that I read it I  less than 24 hours. It was a thrilling read and kept me turning pages.
 xmass gift and was a big hit with the person that, recieved it
 My daughter downloaded this book and she devoured it in a flash. She says that it is right out of the J.K. Rowling quiver of bulls eyes. This is the one featuring the next generation of Wizards!
 It was okay . A very quick read , I was able to finish it within an hour or less . It was almost like fanfiction. It seemed rushed , to be completely honest , some parts had me confused . "Shocking changes" weren't as shocking as I except . I felt myself almost bored , reading. Not as thrilling as the orginal 7 books . I got it fairly quickly. I had preordered it a while before it even came out . Being a huge harry potter I was very excited when it came .
 Love me some HP.
 Reads like fan fiction; some good ideas about characters' relationships, but not well developed.  It may work much better on the stage--but it's definitely not on the same level as J. K. Rowling's seven books.
 It was great going back into the wizarding world, both exciting and familiar. I loved the characters Albus and Scorpius. It was a beautiful story about the parent child relationship which is a center piece in the Harry Potter series as a whole. I wish J.K had written it all herself, the other author's style came through. Otherwise, I loved having another adventure with Harry and his son.
 Really enjoyed reading this play. It was fun getting back with the old characters to see what they were up to as they got older. Also enjoyed meeting and getting to know the children. Only thing I could call bad was that was too short. I hope she will do another book soon.
 The story continues with characters new and old. With a twist here and twist there we are sent through time. To fix the wrongs that must be changed and find ourselves changed in the process.
 Once I got over that it was written like a script, I loved it. It captured the flavor of the series. It was cool to see how<br/>the adult versions of the characters deal with having children of their own.
 Excellent follow up that continues the Harry Potter story.
 thanks
 Not nearly as good as I had hoped it would be. My daughter wasn't crazy about it either. Very short and easy to predict what would happen.
 There some space limitations  and perhaps a faster pace (at the end this is a theatre play); but I any case is still like any other Harry Potters book.  Dark, fun and always interesting.
 Meh, lots of sullen characters.  I did enjoy the second half of the book, but it took some effort to push through the first half
 Disappointing, because the Harry Potter books were so good.  Very "flat" in style &amp; sketchy character development.  Maybe the fact that it's not an exact script makes it less satisfying, but it's nowhere near the quality of the Harry Potter books.
 So if you order this thinking it is a book you can read, think again.  Screenplay!  UGH.  Soooo irritating.  I ordered it without clicking on the detail assuming it was a readable book, and then made the mistake of saving it for vacation which took me beyond the return period before I realized that this was not what I thought I had ordered.  Upon reviewing further, if you just look at the photo and order you would never know.  Very misleading.
 This book is a great addition to the Harry Potter legacy. It is written as a script so it does not have the detail that the original series had. But I still enjoyed the plot. It was a quick good read! I really hope to be able to actually go see the play one of these days.
 This script is in no way comparable to J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter masterpieces. It reads like fan fiction in the form of a play. The writers seem to have taken the easy way out, and there is very little plot creativity or character development. After years without new Harry Potter literature, this was a disappointment, to say the very least.
 They stayed true to the original characters. As long as you can get around the stage directions and scenery the story makes for a quick read. So glad I didn't shell out more money for a hard copy though.
 I am a lover of the original Harry Potter books, so I had to read this one. While it is interesting and I am glad I read it, I had a hard time fully immersing myself in the script for a good bit of it.
 I found this story hard to get into at first because Harry's son is starting to have a personality so different from his father and he also doesn't like Harry. Once the adventure began, it was an excellent story with a satisfying ending. It is a fast read and nice to find out what would have been some of the alternative possibilities to my favorite story .  I enjoyed the few "Ah ha!" Moments which extended the understanding of favorite characters.
 The characters hold up, and the story I'd fun and compelling. Sadly, the dialogue is stilted and the stage directions muddle the experience. This really would be better released as a novel.
 Love
 Not an enjoyable read.
 It's with a heavy heart I rate a book with Harry Potter in the title and JKR as an author less than five stars. But I think those are the only reasons this book got two from me. The plot holes are one thing a HUGE thing dont get me wrong... But what really rubbed me the wrong way here was the gross diversion from the original characters' personalities. I mean you have to understand in my opinion JKR has made the most perfect characters I have ever read. They move flawlessly from books one to seven never faltering in their beliefs and standards. Not just the main three, all her characters are beautifully written. But what happened here??? Who are these people and where are the originals??? No one is what they are supposed to be. Harry is moody and mean to his SON, the orphan boy whose only relatives treated him like dirt grows up to be mean to his son???? What??? Hermoine is bossy yes but she is also a bit dull and her story here is basically about how she is supposed to be with Ron which is part of it but so much less than what she is about. Ron is running a joke shop? Why? He was never a joker I don't remember him being a big prankster.. Where is this coming from. He grew so much in seven years to be a joker in the end???? Why JKR? Why? I won't even go into all the others but put it this way... No one is the loveable character you knew in the last books. CEDRIC... That's all I can bear to write about that... I just had to put the name down but it's too painful to think about. By all means read it... You have to if only to tell yourself that we aren't all meanies that can't deal with the play format but please get it in a returnable format.. It's the best advice I have
 The book is just ok,  it's biggest flaw is it reads as a play, no one likes reading plays.  They should've rewrote as a actual book format.
 The story had very little character development and raced through too fast. Also, the plot was weak.
 This was certainly an interesting jump into the future and the past throughout most of the script/book. There's not much more I can say without dumping out spoilers. Still worth the read for a Potter fan.
 I love all things Harry Potter, but I was extremely disappointed with this play. The characters were one-dimensional and the union between the parents was very unlikely. I would have loved to read this written as a book, but not in this style.
 Good
 Fast and easy.  Question as to how I would access these if I ever stopped using Amazon video.  Is there some program that houses digital videos from iTunes, Amazon, Comcast, etc?
 I find that the play written in this book is sometimes hard to follow.  It was however, well written and you can see the plot very well.  I find it hard to trace the lineage of the characters though.
 I enjoyed revisiting the Harry Potter world. Also the story is in the format of a play script, so it was fun to visual how it would look on a stage. The story didn't blow me away, but it was enjoyable.
 Spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>This is a play that has a story around an overused science fiction theme.  How many stories are we going to have where someone goes back in time and changes the future?  Of course, then everyone scrambles to put it right again.  That is the subject of this play <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Harry-Potter-and-the-Cursed-Child-Parts-One-and-Two-Special-Rehearsal-Edition-The-Official-Script-Book-of-the-Original-West-End-Production/dp/B01BMJWU4Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Harry Potter and the Cursed Child - Parts One and Two (Special Rehearsal Edition): The Official Script Book of the Original West End Production</a>.<br/><br/>Another problem is that the writer wreaks havoc on beloved Harry Potter characters.  Harry, having lost his horcrux, is now a mediocre wizard and not much of a Dad.  We learn that a few bad breaks can turn Hermione into a mean spirited and sad woman.  Ron is nothing more than a jokester and Ginny still doesn't have character.  The main characters are a couple of losers who destroy the future through pure incompetence and have to have Mom and Dad set things right.
 Eh seems fine
 Book was written in a style that was different but was easy to read.  Story line was unexpected.
 “Do you know there is a new Harry Potter book out?”  I have been asked this countless times over the past couple of months.  I did know there was a new Harry Potter tale out, but I knew it was a play that was opening in London and the script was being published as a hardcover – not as a narrative book.  I also know that J.K. Rowling said that the Harry Potter series stopped by book seven and I felt unwilling to move on from what had been promised.  Then I kept hearing snippets of all sorts of intriguing things happening in the Harry Potter world and I could not resist anymore and ordered the book.<br/><br/>I first fell in love with Harry Potter in my undergraduate years at Michigan Tech in the late 1990’s.  The first two books had been published and I heard great things about them.  I received them for a Christmas present and soon found myself engrossed in the tale.  Friends would laugh to find me in cubbyholes between engineering classes reading furiously.  I preordered each of the following novels and loved the entire series.  Was I ready to see what happened to Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger 19 years later?  Yes.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child starts off right where book seven ended – with Harry, Ginny, Ron, and Hermione dropping their kids off to take the Hogwarts Express to school.  Harry’s middle son, Albus, worries that he will be sorted into Syltherin and his worst fear is realized.  He also befriends Draco Malfoy’s young son, Scorpius.  Harry and Albus struggle with their father and son relationship, especially when Harry tries to ban the friendship between Albus and Scorpius.  Albus feels adrift and decides to correct what he feels was his father’s greatest error by stealing a Time-Tuner with Scorpius and a new friend, Delphi.  They travel back to the Triwizard Tournament that was held in Book 4:  The Goblet of Fire.  Things don’t go exactly as planned and time goes amuck.  I thought of this as Back to the Future 2 after Biff goes back in time and screws up the future.  Will Albus and Scorpius be able to remain friends?  Will time go back to what it was or will dark forces be unleased?<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this play, and it really made me want to see it on the stage.  I hope it comes to the United States one day and/or gets turned into a fantastic movie.  It was a very engaging story.  I missed the great detail that is found in a Rowling novel and wished that she could turn this story into a full-fledged novel.  As it was a play, it was a very quick read.  This was welcome as my oldest son (10-year old Kile) started the Harry Potter series at the end of July and just finished book six today.  I realized I better get this review up as he will be reading this play before I know it!<br/>My favorite quotes:<br/><br/>“Meet the once-great Harry Potter, now a stone-cold Ministry man.  I will leave you in peace, sir.  If peace is the right word for it.” – Mr. Diggory<br/><br/>“The truth is a beautiful and terrible thing and should therefore be treated with great caution.  Dumbledore.” – Harry Potter<br/><br/>“I don’t care what you did or who you saved, but you are a constant curse on my family, Harry Potter.” – Draco Malfoy<br/><br/>Do you enjoy reading plays?  What is the play you’ve enjoyed the most?<br/><br/>Are you a fan of Harry Potter?  Have you read The Cursed Child?  If so, what did you think?<br/><br/>Overall, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child was a great story.  I would have loved the detail that a novel would have contained, but the storyline was intriguing. I also loved the growth and different three dimensional view the storyline gave many of the characters, in particular, Draco Malfoy.<br/><br/>Book Source:  Amazon.com
 It is not hardcover! It's a electronic book... I waited and waited to find out months later it's not a actual book, if I'd had know I'd have went with another version. My 12 year old still is looking forward reading it!! Love Harry Potter
 breaks my heart not to give this five stars but.. this really felt like a fan fiction... i felt i didn't even know these characters. maybe i need to see it performed......
 Prefer a story form over a script , but as I liked the trend of story line J.K. Rowling used in the Harry Potter series I thought I would take a chance. Sorry to say I would much rather read this in story form with more of the same type of action all the books in the Potter series seem to contain.
 I realize it's a play And will not have the same tone/"flavor" as a book. That said, I was disappointed. The characters fell flat for me. As the plot went on, it became predictable. If the first book in the series read like this one, there wouldn't have been 6 more books published.  Without Ms. Rowling's name on the cover, I might have mistaken it for internet Fan fiction. If you do read it, borrow it from the library or from a friend. It's just not worth spending the money.
 I really liked this book but I think people would enjoy this book better if it was created into a novel because it's a bit hard to read screenplay. Other than that, I suggest this to any Harry Potter fans who would like another Harry Potter-like book. I was a bit torn between giving this 5 or 4 stars because really, this deserves a 4.5/5, so I just ended up doing 5.
 I was worried our 9 year old son wouldn't like this book as it was written as a 'play'.  However, he loved it just like all the other Harry Potter books and read it in less than 3 days!
 I'm a big Potter fan and this really does feel like a Potter story, but why they released a book in script form is beyond me.<br/>The story is there, it wouldn't take much to write it out as an actual book.
 An entertaining book to be sure but not something to be added to canon. Also, I couldn't figure out when the main characters were going to make out. Clearly gay as hell.
 *Spoiler Free*<br/><br/>Harry Potter and The Cursed Child - the most awaited book play script of the year, is storming the book world (2 million copies sold in the first 2days) and is making fans around the world giddy with excitement to be finally reading a new Harry Potter book.<br/><br/>Needless to say, I was no exception. Which is why, before I started reading this book, I tried to keep my expectations on a realistic level (tried is the operative word here), especially considering J.K.Rowling hadn't written this one.<br/><br/>Though I must say, that I was also a little nervous, because this series was magical perfection in my eyes, and I couldn't imagine how this play script could top that. In fact, without Rowling, I was sure of this being a step down; which is probably why, I am not as disappointed with it as many of the others are.<br/><br/>What is Harry Potter and The Cursed Child all about?<br/><br/>It's marketed as the 8th Harry Potter book, and that, I must say, is only partly accurate. Or at-least it depends on one's perception.<br/><br/>It's very much a continuation of the original story. In fact, it starts right where the epilogue ends - with Harry, Ginny, Ron and Hermoine dropping off their kids at Platform 9 and 3/4. So, in that sense, yes, it's the 8th story.<br/><br/>But there is also a disconnect, which makes it unfair to call this the 8th of the Harry Potter series. It doesn't have the multi-faceted narrative, the strong characterization; and while it puts a grin on your face, it's incapable of evoking the depth of feeling the earlier books were able to arouse with ease.<br/><br/>Of-course most of this is because it's a play-script. And not a book. Which is why, I am not taking any points off for this.<br/><br/>I am only mentioning this, in the hopes that people keep this in mind, as they start reading the book. Because I have read too many negative reviews of this book, on the grounds that it is a play script. I mean, it's written right on the cover. What part of that was not clear?<br/><br/>Yes, I wished for this to be a book. And I wished that it would have been written by Rowling. But it's a play script, and I am not going to judge a thing adversely because it was something that it expressly claimed to be.<br/><br/>Of-course, being a play script doesn't excuse every thing (and I will get to those things later in the post).<br/><br/>Read full review at SHANAYA TALES DOT COM.
 My 10yr son loved this book.  He has read all Harry Potter books and read through this one in a day as he really liked it.
 I liked the book but it wasn’t as good as the others. The fact that was for a play may it harder to be engaged
 I loved learning more about our favorite wizards and witches.  I did find reading in play format a little jarring.  I liked the time paradox element.  Would definitely recommend.
 J K Rowling has done it again, great book and a big fan of Harry Potter.
 So what's the verdict? Did I like it? Yes. Yes, I did.<br/><br/>Now, this did not have the same magical feel as it would have had had it been written as a complete story and not just a play script. It's primarily dialogue. But I love dialogue, so that worked well for me. But descriptions, scene-building, etc, are mostly lost. I wouldn't recommend this to someone who has never read Harry Potter before, as there are a lot of assumptions made about what the reader should already know. I've read other plays where there is much more description, so comparatively I cannot give this 5 stars because I think they could have done more.<br/><br/>But what they did include - the plot, the character interactions - was quite profound. I don't want to give away spoilers about the main conflict of the story, but the questions that arise were really thoughtful. I imagine fans of the series may have had these same questions after reading the series. So I love how the big plot point was adddressed. It makes the characters think, but makes the reader think as well. I thought it was a really fascinating twist on the HP world at large.<br/><br/>Of course, what really touched me were the characters. This was really a multi-generational story. We get our middle aged favorites, as well as their children. I loved wrapping myself up in all my love for these characters, old and new. The thought that went into Harry's relationship with his son, Albus, was very touching. I really liked how the father/son relationship was explored in all its complexities and I was really moved by it. I also loved the friendship between Albus and Scorpius. I loved seeing them as individuals, who they were in regards to their famous/notorious fathers raising of them, how they came into their own at Hogwarts, and who they became as they sought out such an unlikely but absolutely necessary friendship with the other. They were the sweetest besties. Even the healing of other older relationships was quite touching. And, of course, there was a cameo or two that tested my tear ducts and gave my heart lots of feels.<br/><br/>Overall, I really enjoyed this extra glimpse into the Harry Potter world. I simply love these characters. I would have loved an actual novel instead of a play, but regardless, I loved the overall story (and would love to see the play live).
 I enjoyed the adventure, but it felt like fan fiction. It went exactly as expected without providing any real surprises. I felt the same way about Deathly Hallows, but did not feel the same way about Fantastic Beasts. I am excited to see where she branches off to next!
 The book was ok. It started out annoying, as is Harry's son in the book. Once he wasn't the main character anymore and we got to follow Malfoy's son instead, it actually was an ok story.
 You can definitely tell Rowlings voice is not the only one here. While I enjoyed re-visiting the characters, spells and places, this book/script fell a little flat compared to the series. 3 stars for effort though.
 It doesn't read well but maybe it's a better play. I don't think I'll be buying the Fantastic Beast Screenplay after reading this. Really was hoping for more.
 It is always good to go home. At any age, any time, to be welcomed home after some time. The faces and places may change some, but it will still always be... home. That is this book for me.
 I can see why people don't like this but once I got into it I couldn't put it down. I found it very satisfying and a pleasure to revisit old friends.
 love the book itself but not the story! it was soooo different from harry potter and the fact that the characters didnt even have the personalities we have all grown to love over the years!!
 It is a great sequel to the original series. I think I would have preferred that it be in a novel form instead of a stage write, but I still thoroughly enjoyed reading it and caught myself unable to put it down.
 This was OK, but don't expect the plot or details of one of the original 7 books.  I think it would actually be better on stage than reading the play, but this is true of most plays.
 Perfect!
 Did not enjoy this as written material, I'm sure it's good as a play. Too hard to follow as a screenplay and the characters in this format seemed flat and lifeless. If you are expecting the rich and fully developed characters of JK Rowling, you will be disappointed. Honestly, a waste of $ for me.
 What can I say, you knew that, right?
 Reads very much like fan fiction..and I wonder how much J.K. Rowling was actually involved in the writing.
 sorry I just did not care for this book. it felt like someone else was trying to write a sequel and not succeeding. just to simple. wish I could say I liked it but I just did not
 Enjoyed the story - was good to see the characters as adults, having them go through (slightly closer to) the type challenges that all parents face<br/>( It IS a script, so some readers may have a slight problem following the flow of the story - that shouldn't be counted against it in any way ... Says Script right on the cover!)
 Loved it! Beware, if you are expecting Harry Potter, it's not. It reads as a play. It may take you a minute or two to get around it but worth it.
 A typical Harry Potter Story.  Fans will enjoy this work.  it is good, not great. I am personally not a great fan of a play script format - I prefer prose.
 It was fun for me to revisit Harry's world again and to see how he is as an adult. I loved how Harry and his son come to terms with their relationship to form a new bond.
 Great Book
 I went into this thinking it would be as high quality as the book.  However, it is a play where not as much detail can be included.  Thus, for me I felt like there was a lot left on the table in areas such as character and plot development.  As a Harry Potter fan, though, I'll still probably read anything she puts out related to that world.
 Absolutely loved this book! I couldn't put it down. If you love the first 7 Harry Potter books, you'll love this! Just keep in mind that you are reading a screenplay, which only took a few pages into the book to get used to it. Because it's a play, it isn't as long as any of the other books. I just thought it was so fun to see what happened to Harry, Ron and Hermione as adults. Fabulous!
 It's a good follow up story with many of our favorite characters. Having seen all the movies the set descriptions come to life. When it finally becomes a touring company I will definitely see it.
 I really enjoyed reading this. It picks up where Deathly Hallows ends. Reading something in play form can be difficult for some people though.
 After the thrill of reading the Harry Potter novels, the play fails to enchant. Of course, reading Hamlet is very different from being at the theater, and that counts, too. As a lover of the Potter series, I enjoyed  reading the play to follow a development where Harry and friends play second fiddle to their children.
 I bought this for my daughter in law who may be the biggest Harry Potter fan ever. She read the entire book in just a couple of hours and is back to being sad because it's over.
 Huge Harry Potter fan here.  So far I love the story.  But with that said I do not care for how it is written as a script.  I definitely recommend reading it though if you are a true Harry Potter fan.
 I thought this was another story.
 I felt like the whole thing was a mediocre fanfiction. The plot like was relatively creative though there were huge plot holes, the character development was disappointing and cliche. There was just a bare bone plot that wasn't very well written, Jo skipped over everything, including character development, in favor of the action. I think she should have rewritten it as an actual book, if at all. I felt like this writing was very low quality and the format did not let itself to a well to being a book. I feel a letdown because Jo is an amazing writer, but this projects didn't seem to have her heart in it, at least not the written version (I can't speak for the play itself). It felt like it was lacking effort. :( Maybe all the effort was just spent dressing up the bare bones and making it a play.<br/>I don't mind mediocre fanfiction, but not when it's put out as an actual sequel in the series. I feel like this was just taking advantage of the huge following that would make the book a best-seller no matter the quality of writing.
 I loved being back with the gang. The only reason I gave four-star is because I would have rather it been in regular book form. Couldn't have loved the story anymore though. More please.
 I'm not sure if it's because this book was written as a play but I just wasn't a very big fan of it. I didn't even finish it and I have loved the Harry Potter series all my life.
 This story did not seem as strong as the other HP stories. Probably at least partially because of the format (play laid out in book form).<br/><br/>I also felt that the Main device that the plots revolve around is handled in a way that contradicts and ignores the rules laid out on book 3 about that kind of device.<br/><br/>Overall, I  felt it was OK but not great...
 Excellent idea I wish it was a true book it matched even exceeded the plots of the previous story of Harry but did not take us to the children wizarding world of the past<br/>JK owes us a book where book 7 ended and this one began<br/>I wish I knew magic and confunded her to write it
 It took some time to get use to reading a play version of Harry Potter. I enjoyed the plot and the images in my mind of Potter characters as adults with families.
 I ordered this and it is not on my kindle. I paid $9 and I cannot find any evidence of where this book has been sent to. I was planning on reading it during my layover and I cannot, and there isn't an option to refund even though I have not read it and it is not on any device.
 This book/script was amazing to read. It was a story in which I could imagine Harry and Ron taking, but it was his son instead. I didn't expect some of the plot and it took be by surprise. Some tears were shed about the memories intertwined within this story. Thank you for this opportunity to bring back some of my childhood memories.
 I don't regard this as canon by any means. It is definitely not the 8th Harry Potter story, but it was kind of nice to go back to Hogwarts, even though most of the time I was wrinkling my nose at it.
 I'm a huge Harry Potter fan. Stick with the original series.
 Excellent tale in every way. Perfect allegory for family, loss, grief, regret, and redemption.  Definitely added to our Potter collection.
 Great read, this play(story) held my attention. I appreciated the parent child's struggles that make this story all the more relatable. I hopes this play makes its way across the pond soon.
 no flow, unpleasant to read
 A true tribute to the Harry Potter series. If you were a fan you will love this story. Many significant characters are revisited and other new ones immerge  and steel your heart. Can't wait to see the play!
 It just doesnt feel like a harry potter story. The characters dont feel the same and everything is kinda just wrong.
 I can't believe JK Rowling would put her name on this garbage! I wrote better fan fic as an 11 year old. Perverted the magical world I grew up with. I'm disgusted at what she will do for money these days
 I think everyone basically covered it here. It reads like poorly written fanfiction. :( SO disappointed.
 It took  an adjustment to  the style of reading a play instead of a  novel. But the story  didn't  disappoint!. I eagerly  await  more plays and want to see it when  it is in my area.
 It was good, but it felt like there was nothing new.  It was the same ole tricks.  It was a bit of a trip down memory lane and a good book.  I just wish there had been new spells and a new adventure.
 Seriously? It's like the just jotted down notes for the last few years and decided to publish their notebook. I guess the bank account was getting low.
 I throughly enjoyed this continuation of the Harry Porter storyline. If you are a fan of the Harry Potter series this is a must read. I hope to see the actual production someday.
 I have been reading (and re-reading) the Harry Potter series for roughly 16 years now, ever since I was eleven. I grew up with the books when they were released, and went to midnight release of Deathly Hallows when I was 18. I feel like I went to Hogwarts and grew up with Harry, Ron and Hermione. These characters are very real to me and very dear to my heart. When I first heard about the Cursed Child back in maybe January or February, I was very wary of it, especially when I found out it was going to be written as a script. As the release grew closer, I got a little more excited about it and decided to preorder it. I knew it would be nowhere near as good as the core series, but I wanted to see what it was all about anyways. When it downloaded onto my Kindle on July 31st, I read it straight through in about 3.5 hours. I couldn't put it down. I found it to be exciting, thrilling, and emotional; I admit I teared up quite a few times. After the initial emotions subsided, I felt a bit empty inside. The easiest way to sum up my overall feelings about the Cursed Chld would be this: it is an excellent stand-alone story and will be undoubtedly great on stage. But, as a Harry Potter story, it's not fantastic by any means, and just does not feel the same, for reasons that have nothing to do with it being a script.<br/><br/>What I Liked:<br/>-Albus being sorted into Slytherin and becoming best friends with Scorpius Malfoy<br/>-Seeing the gang all grown up, and the different struggles that they face as adults, which I could relate to very well<br/>-I thought the time travel and the different outcomes were fun, even if it was not very believable.<br/><br/>What I'm Neutral About<br/>-Voldemort having a child. There's no way it would ever happen or even be possible, but I still thought it was a cool idea to explore.<br/><br/>What I Didn't Like<br/>-The trio's professions. I know this seems minor. But, knowing these characters like I do, Hermione would NEVER accept the position as Minister for Magic. After everything Harry as been through, I find it highly unlikely that he would want to step foot in the Ministry ever again, much less work there. Ron running Weasley's Wizard Wheezes with George is better, but I still don't really agree with it or think it would actually happen.<br/>-There were some inconsistencies when retelling past events, such as the maze in the third task. In the Cursed Child script, the maze is a 'living' maze like in the Goblet of Fire movie. In the Goblet of Fire book, the maze was not like that. It sometimes felt like they were spinning off of the movies instead of the books.<br/>-I missed Hogwarts and wish we could have seen more of it. Besides the characters, the time spent at Hogwarts is my absolute favorite part of the books and I wish we could have seen more of Albus and Scorpius adventures within the castle and throughout their classes.<br/>-What I was most disappointed about, however, is the lack of Rose, James, Victoire, Teddy, etc. I was really looking forward to getting to know the 3rd generation and I was a bit shocked that they weren't more involved.<br/><br/>There is more I could write, such as the dialog and the characters not always being true to themselves, but the above reasons were the hard hitters for me. It was definitely an entertaining story and I will read it again in the future sometime, but to me this is not the 'eighth' Harry Potter book, and something that I will never view as canon.
 I - r e a l l y - liked this book.  I would love to see it in a prose format for my students.  I enjoyed how the characters have changed/grown from their young adulthood to having children of their own. How could you not love Albus?  Why is it they/we find it hard to please our parents?  I hope to hear there is more to the story in the future.
 It is a blight on the entire series. The WORST Harry Potter fanfiction. Ever. We will be hosting a burning party for anyone else interested in 'losing' their copy. Truly awful.
 This was a surprising play. I love to read it from the begining to the end. Thanks J.K. Rowling
 Great book. Finished in one day but was a good read.
 Great book
 Can't wait to see the Broadway play now!
 Great book. Don't let the format of it being written in play format deter you from reading it. I actually don't really notice it while reading the book.
 I was so disappointed!<br/>The magic of Harry Potter books is due to the following reasons:<br/>*Realistic characters - multi-faceted, developing<br/>*Action<br/>*Amazing plot twists that make sense<br/>*Very hard to find holes in the plot<br/>*Jo's magical Harry Potter world is consistent throughout all the books, as if it were a real world. The magical world almost makes sense, and really seems real because there are no discrepancies.<br/><br/>This book is missing everything but the action! It's exploiting Harry Potter's name just for the fans to buy the book that is not worthy of its title!<br/>The characters are very flat and shallow. They are not realistic, and there is no character development. (SPOILER: Albus and Scorpius are busy hugging each other; Draco is chummy-chummy with Harry and Hermoine, Harry turns into a cold, flat, unfeeling, uncaring idiot)<br/>The plot does have a twist, but it is not very detailed the way the other Harry Potter books are<br/>The plot has more holes than a sieve! (SPOILER: How did transfiguring Harry into Voldemort not turn him into Voldermort? How did the message stay on the blanket after all those years - was the blanket never washed? How did Lily Sr. even let them write the message on the blanket? How did they see James Sr., Lily Sr., and Harry if they were under the Fidelius Charm? How did it help to disarm Cedric during the first task - someone would have returned his wand! Why was Snape alive after the second time-turning if the only difference was that Neville wasn't there to kill Nagini - Snape had been killed before the Battle of Hogwarts! I'll probably come up with more plot holes, but I just finished the book less than 24 hours ago.)<br/><br/>This book is just exploiting Harry Potter. I will not accept it in my mind as part of the Harry Potter story, as it is not worthy of being part of the series.
 This didn't disappoint, just could be annoying to read it as a script the whole time. Either way the content and story were great!
 Came in perfect condition, no folded pages or anything. This is a gift for my daughter in law who is a big Harry Potter fan, so I am sure she is going to love it. Fast shipping was a plus.
 Gift for my daughter.  She loved it.
 I am a huge Potter fan and it was great to visit with my old friends. But it wasn't the same and the writing style wasn't the same...slightly disappointed but still worth reading.
 I didn't care for the screen play format of the writing, and the story just wasn't her best writing.  The difference between this and a million other stories about conflicts between parents and teens is the fact that the parent was named Harry Potter.
 This was a believable continuation of the Harry Potter story. Harry as a parent was particularly sympathetic. And Scorpius Malfoy is such a nifty kid!
 An easy read even in script form. Gripping story line leaves you wanting more.  I just could not put it down.
 This is a fast read. It is a script and requires your imagination to truly enjoy.<br/>I enjoyed it and plan to give it as a Christmas gift to a relative.
 My niece was tickled to receive this book!
 If you love Harry Potter you will enjoy.
 Great! Has arrived in perfect conditions! The book is not that good, it's really nice to read something about Harry Potter's world but it still misses something, it doesn't seem to be written by J.K., but it's worth.
 i think i would have liked the story the play was based on better than the play...
 It's HARRY POTTER, well technically more based on another character but it's such a good read, i can't put it down and highly recommend it to the fans out there!
 Great book, can't wait to see the show on Broadway!
 I have been a fan of the Harry Potter books forever, and I really enjoyed this play. I went into it with an open mind and realized that the play itself was based on a story and not directly written by J.K. Rowling. I felt that it was quite fast moving and I did miss the rich full detail of the original series, but I understand clearly that this is a play, just the dialogue that misses the richness that is filled in by the visuals of watching a play in person. Additionally this wasn't a complex novel, it is the script of a play so the long meandering conversations and slowly developing story that I love about the original books was definitely missing. Again, I don't count this against the play because that is just not what a play is.<br/><br/>I found myself filling in a lot of the missing bits with my own visuals in my head. After having read the books so very many times, J.K. Rowling's original descriptions left me a wonderful imaginative landscape to watch this story play out in. I think as a free standing play without the knowledge and history of Hogwarts, the wizarding world and the characters themselves, this probably comes up short. As a piece of the Harry Potter universe, it was a fun jaunt through nostalgia and I actually found the plot to be unexpected and entertaining.<br/><br/>I read the play for entertainment and I definitely got what I was looking for. If you're looking for a significant addition to the Harry Potter novels akin to another book, you will be disappointed. If you're looking to read the script to a play that tells an interesting story about the goings on of several familiar characters and how life has changed since the original books, then this is a fun read with surprises, laughs, and lots of nostalgia.
 Struggling with this...can't get through the format...but I'll keep trying. My bad for not fully realizing this ahead of time or I would have skipped the purchase
 A journey through the memory lane (not only Harry’s but also mine) ..I liked it very much 😊 👌 ❤️
 Intriguing, thoughtful, mysterious, exciting, well written. Two thumbs up. Good versus evil, passed from generation to generation. I’m going to read it again.
 Good story, but hard to read out loud to a child because of the play format. Loved the continuation of the story line. Anything in this series is better than nothing.
 Good
 J.K. Rowling didn't write this. Two guys wrote it and she approved it. I'm half way through it and the writing it self is good but you can go to FanFics and read something more satisfying then this.
 I bought this expecting the quality and enjoyment of all the Harry Potter books. I started to read this book and realized that it is definitely not a "Harry Potter book."  The story is disjointed and vague. Definitely not worth the price I paid. Don't waste your money.
 In the beginning I was disappointed, in the middle I was cringing, by the end I felt a little better about where they took the story.  As a HP fan I am glad I read it but wouldn't go rushing out to recommend it to others.  Its just OK.
 It isn't the same. It's enjoyable, but only if you read it as fanfiction rather than cannon. I do love Malfoy's son though.
 I wasn't sure about continuing the story, but J.K.Rowling didn't miss a beat. Even though this is a screen play, it was a story I couldn't put down.  You did it again!! Thank you for the best book series of ALL TIME.
 This is the continuation of the story that I had been craving. This is a great read for any fan.
 I thought it was pretty good, I'd rather have had JK Rowling write another book. But I enjoyed it. The story helps you picture what Harry and his friends might be doing in the future. I'm hoping JK writes more Harry Potter stories and that we might get to see most of the original cast do something together again. It is sad that some of the cast has passed away. They all feel like family, we've watched them for so many years.
 ...it seemed like well canonicilized fanfic. Play covers 4 years, whilst the books were one year each.  I was hoping for a novelization of the play, not just the script.
 I loved this story.  Note that it is much shorter than the regular books, and it is written in "play format" because that is just what it is--a play.
 Be prepared for a story that is unlike the HP series.
 Awesome
 I liked this book because it continues with the Harry Potter story. It is written in the form of a play not a novel. It would be great to see this book as a film also.
 I enjoyed the continuation of the Potter line and his friends, old and new. It kept me enchanted enough that I could not put it down. I needed to continue to observe the twists and turns of the plot.
 I enjoyed the concept of a grownup Harry, father of a teen.  While you could see the writing wasn't Rowling's style, it was good enough, providing an interesting story.
 Loved it
 People need to remember this was a Broadway play and stop thinking they are reading a novel.  I thought it was great!  It was neat seeing Hermonie, Ron, Harry, and Draco grown up and having to deal with children of their own.
 I'm so glad to see that the story continued. Granted it was a screenplay but it was still great to follow along. I felt the ending was slightly rushed, but overall a great addition to the series.
 I think JKR could have written a brilliant book following the basic plot line of this, but it's obvious she had nothing to do with writing this.  No character development, just time after time of 2 kids moaning about their feelings and constantly having to reassure one another that they are friends.  Loved seeing Draco back but I can't see him discussing the loss of his wife and his feelings with Harry, even after all this time!
 Nope. Just nope. This play was nothing more than crafty pandering to loyal Harry Potter fans in order to make a buck. I'm ashamed I fell for it. I feel stupid and disappointed. Maybe I have myself to blame for thinking this was something it wasn't. Oh well. Two stars. My heart won't let me give anything associated with HP one star. I think it is time to officially leave Harry Potter to live out his days in peace. I'm just going to pretend I never read this.
 Bought this for Grandpa and he was so stoked! He, of course, read it in like two seconds and enjoyed it immensely.
 Grandson loves the series.  Thanks for good pricing.
 Not at all what I expected but brilliant all the same. I was able to envisioned all the scenes clearly and must say this is what wonderful continuation to the series. Well done J.K.R. well done.
 I've read every potter book with my kids and it was kind of fun to divide up parts and read together, but the story was only so-so.  One thing I do have to say is that Rowling can't be accused of being all about the money. (not that she is hurting)  She could have easily banged out a book for each year that Harry's kids were in Hogwarts and we would have gleefully consumed.  :-)
 Seemed more like fan fiction than a literary work, feels out of place in the Harry Potter canon, much like the epilogue to the 7th book.
 I read it in a day. So I can't say I don't enjoy it but it certainly didn't feel like J.K. Rowling actually wrote it. It breaks some of the rules she established in the universe and sometimes characters don't behave in the way that feels natural. Personal influence on owns own character is also downplayed.
 The story is so convoluted and terrible.<br/>Not my canon
 It's a good sequel to the Harry Potter universe. It has some dialogs a little poor, but it's OK. I really likes the development of the characters and how they grow together.
 I enjoyed the book, it was interesting to see how everyone had grown up. When I purchased the book I didn't realize it was written as play script. Wasn't too thrilled about his at first, but it didn't detract from the story.
 It was a good story, but I did not like the format it was written in. It got confusing in the end when all the different characters got together.
 The story was good, but since it's written in play form, I missed the depth of the other Harry Potter books.<br/><br/>I guess I just need to go see the play.
 I really enjoyed reading about the future of the Harry Potter characters.  It took a little while to get used to the play format, but in the end I decided I really liked it. :)
 If you need something to quench your thirst for new Harry Potter content, then go ahead and buy this.  It's nothing special and the style of the book definitely doesn't allow you to immerse yourself into the setting as previous books have.  It is Harry Potter, though.
 If you like the Harry Potter series, you'll love this book. Takes a little bit of getting used to reading it as the play script, but great story on the next generation of Potters.
 Awesome
 Wonderful story. I was concerned at first that being in 'play' format it would be hard to follow but it is actually much easier to keep track of characters in this format.
 For those who doesn't like time traveling stuff - I would expect this book won't make such a great impression. I was disappointed , to be honest.
 Sometimes a little hard to follow, because it is the script from the play.  I would like it better if it was a regular book.  Hope they make a movie out of it.  I would really like to see it in movie form.
 Love these books
 You can tell that Jo wasn't the main author here. Read a lot like published fanfiction, to be perfectly honest. Overall, it was an interesting story, and I'm glad to add it to my Wizarding World collection
 This book was fun to read what became of the characters of the Harry Potter series but didn't give much description compared to the original series. It was slim and disappointing.
 The play format was a bit harder to read than the books, and I prefer the longer, more descriptive original seven books. However, this was a nice wrap up for the series.
 This too was a birthday gift for my granddaughter and she was thrilled to get it. Once she reads it I plan on borrowing it from her and reading it
 Seemed much less involved or complicated than the previous books were. Much like a movie script with no more depth than what is typically seen on the screen. Slightly disappointing from that aspect. Still a good read for Potter gans.
 I love the entire Harry Potter series and, even though I knew this was written in play format, was disappointed in the character development - or lack thereof. Nevertheless, it was still fun to get another glimpse into the Harry Potter world. I just hope that JK Rowling has more involvement in any future HP-related plays or otherwise.
 I loved the continuation of the porter books. Even with it written as a play I found it rather easy to read after the first chapter. The fact that the first scene is the last of the movie really set the stage in my option. Also being able to visualize the characters based off that last movie helped give a starting point for the book.
 It's J.K. Rowling...need I say more?
 It was really a good story. It was different reading it as a play and I prefer the "book" style but because I got into the whole Harry Potter saga I wanted to read this, too.
 I really wanted to like this script, but it reminded me of a poorly written fan-fiction. I liked the new information we received about the whole HP world, but I was pretty disappointed with the arc of the story. Without revealing the plot, the backstory behind what happened in the script seems pretty unlikely to have happened in the wake of a wizarding war. I'm quite annoyed I paid so much for this script, and definitely feel it wasn't worth the price.
 I loved this almost as much as the regular Harry Potter books. I didn't want to put it down once I started reading it.
 Bought this for my granddaughter who read every Harry Potter book written, she had to have this one to. She read it in a day and loved it. I don't know what more I can say.
 Good read
 can't stand harry potter. glad to her that this book (bought as a gift) was also disliked by a rabid Rowling fan.
 To be honest, it seemed to jump around quite a bit, not really developing things as well as I would have liked, and the characters didn't really feel like the originals
 Was disappointed in the lame dialogue, the way actions were written, and the confusing and almost completely different characters. It was a disappointment and not worth the money.
 I was really excited about this.  But then I read it and was disappointed.  I don't consider it canon.  The characters you are familiar with suddenly had personality changes. The plot is so beyond stupid.  It could have been so much better
 She loved it
 This was a present for my wife. She really enjoyed it.
 Like
 Storyline was good. Prefer novel format.
 Great playwright!! This is a playwright!!!! Even though JK Rowling did not write it, it was still amazing! It did take me a while to get into it though but still a great book!
 Didn't sound exactly like the voice of JK Rowling that I was familiar with. Some of the characters just felt a little off (Ron Weasley). But overall still a good story.
 It was good not great.  Not much of a story.  Not like the books
 Characters are whiney, pathetic and sad.  Not written very well.  Huge disappointment.
 wow
 I have loved all the Harry Potter books, and this has an interesting story line once you get used to the writing style.  The reader has to remember this was written as a screen play.
 Very disappointing. I can't really believe that JK Rowling was really that involved in this. It reads like very bad fanfic. And its heteronormativity and queerbaiting is disgusting. I expect much better from a book attributed to Rowling.  Again, very, very disappointing.
 A good story, but not quite as good as JK Rowlings other Harry Potter books. I didn't care for the way it was written in character dialog.
 Fantastic addition to the series. A wonderful kind of organized madness with some poignant themes. Features a lot of familiar faces from the Harry Potter series as well as some exciting new characters. Definitely earns its place in the series and leaves this reader wanting further expansions. I'm already craving a re-read.
 Not as good as the other ones.
 See above. It won't let me post until I hit 20 words, so, I hope everyone's having a great day!
 Very good concept, very well written. Because it's a play and the line spacing is so large, this is a very easy and quick read. Must have for any Harry Potter fan
 I am interested in what happened to Harry and the gang but I find the writing confusing and my attention tends to wander.  A different setting might have made this book more appealing.
 I read ALL of the reviews about this story, negative-neutral-positive. I think some may have read TOO much into this. Agree...this reads like fan fiction. That's not entirely a bad thing. The best part is...it's JK Rowling ENDORSED fan fiction. It is a story that, in my opinion, is not really needed, but didn't hurt anything in the franchise. I feel that way about Fantastic Beasts. The original book was a reference tool for the original stories. Now we have a screenplay and movie created out of that is thinly connected to Harry Potter using history. These stories are just fun. There are preposterous situations, characters and scenarios that are a HUGE stretch...but that's okay. I have my seven books that I get to re-invest in as often as I want. HPATCC is/was a quick read and a, kinda, nice "Where are they Now" story. The best part is...one them stayed from the original series...and that is the value of loyal, loving FRIENDSHIP. In the original 7, Fantastic Beasts screenplay and this story...it is universal throughout. In my book...that IS the best thing out of all of it. It is also why I gave it 4 stars. Lastly...there were comments about what Harry would/would not do. I would suggest re-reading "Order of the Phoenix"... Harry was quite different in that book that "Cursed Child" had a deja vu feel to it...
 I dislike this book! I just recently found Harry Potter and read the entire series one right after the other and fell in love with Harry and all the other characters. Loved the stories and could not put the books down; they held my interest completely. I could not wait for the release of this one and was disappointed immediately upon opening it.  I realize it is written in play form but the zip and the interest is gone and Harry not so exciting. This is not the Harry Potter we have grown to love, so sorry to say. Sorry I wasted my money on this book!
 While I had no problem with it written in play form, this did not live up to the Harry Potter series. The characters were nothing like the friends we loved and cheered on in the original books. It read like bad fan fiction. I did enjoy Scorpius. I'm just going to stick with the epilogue from Deathly Hallows and pretend Cursed Child was a bad dream.
 If you like Harry Potter _and_ you like plays this is for you but the sparse style is different than the novels, and may not be for everyone.
 Any chance to read just a little more of the HP world was worth taking a chance on reading a script instead of a book. But I had no difficulty in staying with the story even in this alternative format. JK is still great!
 This book is a reunion with our favorite characters. I was afraid that I wouldn't care for the play script format but it worked very well. In my mind I heard the familiar voices and learned new ones. Bravo!
 Surprised JK Rowling put her name on this. Besides the point it's a script, not a book, which I knew, There is no character development. Our older heroes seem sad and pathetic in this book, they don't act or speak like the characters in all previous books.<br/><br/>Besides the rushed feel to produce an obvious money maker, the plot could be a well thought out series, except for the main antagonist. That felt wrong on so many levels.<br/><br/>I'd rather they let Harry Potter rest in peace the way it was left after Deathly Hallows than this attempt at a sequel.
 Really enjoyed this play. While the story does not directly revolve around Harry, Hermoine etc. you still get a bit of those old characters you love, along with some really good insight into Malfoy. 10/10 would read again, took about 2 hours to finish.
 Excellent read, had difficulty putting it down. Not used to reading in script form but it simply added to the descriptive scenes presented.<br/>Brings past and present together in an intriguing yet familiar way for Potter fans!!<br/>Brings back why you may be a Potter fan, and carries on a tradition.<br/>Hoping for more in the future.
 I thought it was awesome! The first part is a little hard to get through, because it's kinda setting the scene. But once I got further into it, I thought it was great!  I just wish that she would have made it longer and elaborated a little more. But other than that, it was so nice to explore the Wizarding world again!
 I bought this not realizing it was a script.  I wish I had known that before purchasing.  I was really looking forward to the next "chapter" in the lives of HP &amp; friends, only to find out this isn't a book at all.  I got through a few "scenes" and decided it's not really how I want to read this......
 Not as good as the novels, but I got the familiar warmth I feel when I read those novels, and that's good enough.
 Marketed as a book, but this is a script. It lacks the wonderful nuance and detail that made seven harry potter books so engaging.
 Very good book and worth the wait  I won't ruin the suspense of this book but will encourage you to read
 "I could manure my garden with the contents of that rag." - Rita Skeeter
 It's a play of course, so you are reading dialogue and stage directions, but it is an adventure that lets you peek into the next generation. Short but bittersweet. I hope I can see the play.
 The story was a good read not one of her best but a good read, the script writing wasn't bothersome at all. I felt like I was reading a book for a younger genre of readers than what I had expected after deathly hollows. It still brought some of the charm that people felt when they first read the series at least that is what I received after reading through, in the end it is up to everyone else if they shall enjoy a new adventure in a magical world or not.
 😇
 This book has a ton of negative reviews but I really enjoyed it. I came in with no expectations. As a huge Harry Potter fan this was definitely something to add to my collection. It's a fast read and it will take you on a roller coaster of emotions, you'll have a serious love/hate relationship with this book.
 I didn't realize that this was in "screenplay form" so it was really hard for me to get into. Also, the character development is meh, I just couldn't get into it. Big mistake comparing this to the Potter series.
 I love this because it takes a whole new direction for Harry Potter, and new characters get to come out to play. Also, it's a welcome distraction from all things political. :)
 really liked this book
 This just was not as good as the previous books, I'm sure the fact that it is in script form has a lot to do with that. However, the storyline just felt rushed and was not up to the same standards as the other Harry Potter books.
 Badly written, boring, slowly plotted, disappointing characterization, all rolled up in one, a flop.
 It was wonderful to be with old friends again. A quick read and interesting twists along the way. The multiple plots were very enjoyable.
 This was amazing!!! Unpredictable story line and great continuation of the series. I thought it would be lame compared to the original series but I was wrong!!
 Written like a play. I purchased it for my granddaughter.zNo comments yet.Wouldnt have ordered it if I knew the format.
 The book itself is a well made product. The story was good, but not great. The Seven Harry Potter books were definitely better.
 I was expecting something more similar to the other books and I was disappointed with this being totally in screenplay style and such a easy, fast read.
 This is a great follow up to the Harry Potter novels.  I think it adds more to the overall story and I would recommend for the Harry Potter fan to be sure to read.
 Yes, this is a script for a play. Yes, it's up to the actors, director, etc. to bring the characters to life on a stage. But I feel as though Rowling lost the voices for her characters. Like she lost touch with them for 19 years, and tried desperately to see the rich, developed, intricate friends she used to know. The heroic trio (Harry, Hermione, and particularly Ron) are mere shadows of their younger selves. The main duo (Albus and Scorpius) are flat, and their motivations clumsily explained. Maybe this installment is better left to live performances, where in life magic can distract, and misdirect, the audience from the lack of a coherent storyline.
 good
 The script was good and an interesting story. I did miss all the details of the earlier novels. Am sure the play fleshes out all the details. Do hope to see it someday.
 Honestly, dont expect much from this book. Does not even give you a glimpse of the brilliance that was the rest of the series. Many discrepancies and characters were not like their former selves. I liked the fact that Albus is in Slytherin and I liked Scorpius' character.. but very weird and confusing relationship they have.. sexual tension there. Overall, a big let down, wish i could unread it because it ruined the characters for me.
 I didn't like the style of writing... it didn't sound like the other books at all.  Like other people have said, it reads like a fan wrote it.  I'm a huge Harry Potter fan and wanted to love it but found myself wanting to rush just to get through it.
 OK, good.  I think you need to be a Rowling fan for sure...but good none the less
 After a while I sat with a Harry Potter book and the child in me was immediately hooked. As the book went on, I was beginning to look forward to the end. It is a good one time read, unlike the Harry Potter series.
 Another fantastic tale in the Potter storyline.  Ms Rowling's talents are spellbinding. It was hard to put this down. I could picture this on the large screen.
 This is a fun quick read for any true Potter fan. I will say it has a different tone than the originals and my mind hasn't quite accepted it as "canon" but worth reading.
 I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED TO FIND THAT THIS IS WRITTEN AS A PLAY NOT A NOVEL, OTHER THAN THAT IT WAS A DECENT STORY.  I HOPE THAT IF J K ROWLING WRITES ANYMORE HARRY POTTER STORIES THEY WILL BE IN NOVEL FOM NOT A SCRIPT FO A PLAY.
 A quick read.  Fun to revisit the old characters and learn about some new ones.  A bit predictable but all in all an enjoyable book.
 Not very good compared to the other 7. Read all seven 5 times. Probably going to start up again.
 As a Harry Potter fan, I was looking forward to this book. I must say I was a bit dissapointed. Of course this is not a novel, rather a play for theathers (I want to see this in a theather). But anyway, I think the plot could have been better. There are many things left unsaid and I was done with it very quickly.<br/>So it was interesting, nice reading but definitely not to be compared to original HP books.
 love everything "Harry Potter"
 I liked how it sped through some areas but I missed the imagery you get with a novel. However, it being a screenplay, I loved getting a peak inside the mind of the characters and their reactions. It was a fun and fast read! It brought me back to reading the seven books years ago!
 This was a great ending to the Harry Potter series.  It was nice to see harry, Ron, hermione, and Draco become friends.  Reconciliation is always a happy ending.  Great job!!!
 This was not a horrible story, and I'm unsure why it's getting so much hate. It was not predictable (well parts of it weren't) and it was not boring.
 Not at all at I expected but more Harry Potter is always a good thing in my world. And it's always fun to see Harry wrestling with a teenager who is so very like him. Kind of felt like book 5 all over again except this time it was Harry who had to feel with an angry, emotional, teenaged Potter lol
 Four because it was a play and I would have preferred a full novel. But an extra star because it gave us a look into the future that we thought we would never see.
 We have to keep in mind that we are missing the most important character in this book - the stage.<br/>Still, it was disappointing that they this book leads to inconsistent rules of magic from established canon.
 The book is written in play form. It didn't appeal to me as such and although the characters are familiar, I didn't feel a rapport with them for some reason.
 I knew that it was a play or that's what the book was made for. But it's not great to read it that way so I wish I had come more in a book style, then having to read each character part.<br/>Or that we were given a choice as to how to read the book.
 It was great to be reunited with the characters. This book is for the HP fans who've already read the entire series and are well acquainted with the characters.
 Interesting to read a screen play as opposed to a novel.  Loved the experience.  This story was exactly how I pictured a child of Harry Potter growing up; always feeling like he had to live up to something that he could never be.  Being a rebel, and trying to find acceptance from a father who is to wrapped up in his own hype.  Well done!
 Great Book.  Thank you.
 Light and likable.  Took a little to get used to a " play version" but then just zipped along.  It was a fun visit with characters that we grew up with...
 Loved it! I was reluctant because it read as a play and mostly because of the bad reviews. In fact, I made the decision to not read it because of the  "avid Potter fans" reviews. I downloaded it prior to a long flight and read it in its entirety and thoroughly enjoyed it!
 If you remember that JK Rowling did NOT write this book alone, and go into it without expecting too much, it's a great book. Super easy read, I read it in 5 hours! The format is a play, so that makes it read quicker. I recommend this fully!!
 I didn't want this.  I don't read plays.  I looked at it and suddenly found that I had been charged for it without actually asking for it.  How do I return a Kindle book?  I resent this!  Watch out, everyone, if you even click on the name you may find that you own it without wanting to.
 Rip OFF - One is led to believe this is a new book in the story, but instead it was a darn script for a play.<br/>I'd like my WASTED money back.  I didn't even read it once I had it in my hands and saw the ACTUAL contents.<br/>I'm so disgusted.  The word "script" is NOT seen when ordering it.
 I recommend getting this book if you're a Harry Potter fan
 Such a disappointment. I so wanted to love this book. It's fine fan fiction but JK's name shouldn't be on it.
 I expected more.
 Can't get enough of HARRY POTTER!  Very well done as a follow up to the originals.  And loved that we were able to see him (Harry) as an adult.  I have truly lived this story.
 Loved it and her. Its different from the others, it isn't "the next Harry potter book", it's like starting over knowing his past though. It's a script, not a normal story, which to me made no difference. It was still a great read. The ending was a little rushed, but still was satisfying to me.
 This book was so good I couldn't put it down.
 Not at all engaging or as entertaining as all the other Harry Potter books.
 I thought this was on the quality level of mediocre fan fiction.
 Harry Potter is alway a great read even for the older folks that want to know about the things their grandchildren are interested in.
 It was more like a good short story. It was probably much better to watch on stage, rather than read. I think the jumps in time were what I most disliked.
 Well it's Harry Potter and his gang, some Voldemort too, but..... let's say it could have been a great book, but unfortunately now it's a mediocre play. Pity.
 Amazing! It did not disappoint. I love how the story unfolded. Seeing the characters 19 years after was special!
 So dissapointing... Having loved the HP universe for so long this is like betrayal. I wish I could select no star at all. A horrible pity of a story. Having been so moved by JKR's Casual Vacancy... writing this is sad for me. And there are today 44% of 5-star reviews! This I believe is the most surprising fact.
 I just love everything Harry Potter and this was no different.  I had missed it.  So when the play came out in book form I jumped at the chance to read it.
 I am an avid Harry Potter fan and have read each book and seen each movie about 1,022 times. The only downside to this book is the fact it was written in play format. While it wasn't terrible by any means, it just isn't quite the same.
 Not her best work in the Harry Potter series, seems more like a Harry Potter short story without the detail and richness present in previous books. Lacking emotion but still it is okay.
 I love the HP series. This just added another chapter to the HP universe. Loved it! I hope to read more about my fave trio and their children and or the wizarding world in the future.
 Finished it in a day and really enjoyed as a 30 year guy who started ready HP in the teenager years.
 Would still see the stage production, and it's still JK Rowling, but unfortunately this reads like something she wrote because she ran out of money. :/
 The book my daughter wanted at a cheap price.
 Love it. I mean, it's Harry Potter, what's not to love?
 I read it all during my flight. The hardcore is cool
 Couldn't put it down. I read many reviews before the purchase and let me just say, haters 'gonna hate. I thought it was well written and easy to read as a screenplay. You won't be disappointed.
 It explores parents finding ways to connect to their children. Often making mistakes along the way, but getting there together.
 Love all the books.
 All these books are great.
 Be very careful to read before you buy: SCRIPT parts one and two. It's not just the "story."
 I was very disappointed in this book. I have really loved all of J.K. Rowling's other books. This one seemed like an outline to a story that wasn't completely thought out. It seems like an unfinished work. So sad :o((
 Different but good. J.K. Rowling did it again. I really liked this book. It was the last of the set I wanted to read.
 Still in the process of reading it but I am half way through and love it. It's a great tease for harry potter fans.
 Wouldn't have been a bad story written as a book, but as a play so many details were left out or rushed through that it lost it's charm very quickly!<br/>Such a shame, I was so looking forward to another of her books!
 A little disappointed, just from my perspective the parents of the main antagonist seems implausible. Story was well written, loved the uneasy alliance with the Malfoys
 One would get the impression that this was written by JK Rowling from the cover and the hype.  But that's not the case.....I'm not sure how her name got on the cover.
 It is a little fast at first. It seems to go through many years in a short time. But it has a twist that you never expect. I feel very comfortable with the characters.
 IT WAS AMAZING I LOVED ALBUS AND HOW COMPLEX HIS CHARACTER WAS AND I LOVED HIS MOMENTS WITH HARRY AN SEEING THEM BOND REALLY GAVE INSIGHT ON A CHILD PARENT RELATIONSHIP I LOVED THE OLD AND NEW CHARACTERS I JUST WISH IT WAS A LITTLE LWAS CONFUSING THE PLOT GOT TRICKY TO FOLLOW HALFWAY THROUGH
 Too much like fanfiction, not believable as part of the original story line.
 The script format inherently loses the great characterizations found in the original novels. It would be a treat to see the characters come alive in the stage version, but the writing alone falls flat as the plot underwhelms.
 Excellent purchase for Harry Porter Fans and people who like to read. Fast shipping. Excellent shape. Thank you.
 in great condition, well packaged, good for a gift or for your collection. Overall great buy!!
 I tried to give this play the benefit of the doubt and read it from cover to cover. In the end it was shallow, panders to its audience, and is not fit to be associated with the original series. If you're a Harry Potter fan don't waste your time.
 I have enjoyed all the Harry Potter books, and this was no different.  I was a little hesitant at first, since it wasn't written as a novel but as a screenplay, but it was great.
 It was  very difficult to read . Especially when They traveled through time. It was difficult  to tell who was where.
 I read this book in about five nights and loved it! While it's not all JK Rowling, so much of her writing style comes through. I'll definitely be re-reading it.
 Flat, flat, flat. Would have been better served by saving paper and trees and not publishing this. JK Rowling, after the grand success she has enjoyed should known better than to put this out in print.
 The book was ok. Didn't like that it was printed in the form of a play scripts
 It was nice to see how life turned out for the characters. It gave them more depth and showed how deeply the past events impacted them.
 Very disappointing read, and I read less than half of it. I am a big Potter fan and loved the novel collection. This story is constructed like a play, is lacking in descriptions, and is just not entertaining. I am very disappointed and hope that you can avoid that feeling.
 Only a small minded person would put politics and refer to politics in a fantasy book. Better luck next time
 As a Harry Potter fan this is a must read. I loved the plot and it leaves you wanting so much more to read. This is a must!
 As an avid Potterhead, I was deeply disappointed. As it does not represent the great work Rowling has written, it cannot be accepted as canon. Rather, it is (at best) an interesting story dreamed up by Rowling, but horribly written by the co-authors. I didn't mind the screen-play format, but I was disgusted by the misrepresentation of both established and lesser-known characters from the Harry Potter universe. The dialogue and flow were cheap and shallow and the story line progressed in an unnatural and choppy way. Such a pity!
 Harry Potter has returned. Great story, it takes a little while to get use to reading in a play format.
 Spoiler: Voldie has a peeenus. It now gives me night terrors. The story itself was great; however, I miss the actual story telling and the building of connections with the characters.
 I've read every Potter book and think this is just as good! I've read some of the reviews and disagree whole heartedly.  I enjoyed every word.
 I bought this as a gift for a friend, and she loved. It was a big success.
 I wish it told more of the future then what happened in the past
 Have not read yet. But I do believe I'll love it. For I love the Harry potter books
 Personally I prefer reading basic prose as oppose to play that are compose mostly of dialogues. But it was nice to find out bit more about life of the main characters of HP series after Hogwarts.
 Took me a bit to get into this because of the script format, but it is a WONDERFUL story
 I read all the books several times. And I didn't start reading the books until after the Half Blood Prince movie, but enjoyed the movies in retrospect  as well. I found this play to be interesting and enjoyable, but not an eighth Harry Potter story. If you read it without assuming the story is a continuation of the series, you may just be pleasantly surprised.
 Love it !!!!!!
 Not a fan of the screen play format.  Seems like it is just a way to drag the series out.
 I very much enjoyed the story but would have preferred it be in book form rather than script. I hope some day to see the play. Love all the Harry Potters!
 It was Harry Potter so it was a must read for me. Once I got past the format of it being in a play, I thought it was ok. There's a twist in the book that's not anywhere in-line with JK's normal writing. She should stick to only writing it herself with no input from anyone else. She did just fine before
 Not sure I like a book written as a stage play.  It was ok, but if I hadn't had all the books I probably wouldn't have bought it.
 Thank You Very Much !!!
 I looooove this book!! I thought it would bother me that it's in script form, but it didn't!! It's still a very well written story about Harry's son! &lt;3
 I was happy that I read this book but the play form was difficult to get into. I think that many people would find it much easier to understand in book form.
 I returned this.  It is a play.  Not for me.
 Very interesting. I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Would make a good movie. Kinda like Back to the Future II. If you like that sort of thing.
 As a huge Harry Potter fan I was not sure how I would like reading the latest book in play form. I still loved reading about my favorite characters and enjoyed this play a lot!
 The book was just "okay." I understand that JK Rowling wrote it in the form of a play for a reason but my personal opinion is that it would have been so much better as an actual book. Very minimal detail in the book compared to her original work.
 Great story line-obviously that was Rowling's contribution. The writing, however, is considerably below the standards of the original Potter series.
 It was good but it lacked something but I like Harry Potter so I read it I think I might have liked it if it were in book form but it was good
 I got this for my husband's birthday and he loves it. The only thing I would note as it is written as a play so it reads different from previous HP books.
 Not the same as the other Harry Potter books, interesting take, just disappointed at the lack of content.
 I loved the Harry Potter series, but this book (screenplay) was a total let down. There is little to no plot line and character building is subpar at best. Go stare at paint drying, it will be more entertaining.
 Love this book i  wish it followed more with the original books instead of being in more of a play type of format. But it was still a very good book and im glad  i purchased it.
 This is average at best. I love the original series. It is easily one of the most magical stories ever told. It is written at an amazing pace and the characters are brilliantly multi-layered. Every character stays true to themselves from the Sorcerer's Stone through the Deathly Hallows. This is not the case in The Cursed Child.<br/><br/>The general story is not the problem. I enjoyed the overall idea of this tale. My main complaint is that the pacing is WAY too fast. It removes the character development aspect of the story which was so crucial to the main series. It makes it nearly impossible to care for any of the new characters. This particular story would be much better as a novel rather than a screenplay.<br/><br/>The other big issue is that beloved characters act in ways that seem inconsistent with the characters fans have come to love. The only character that I loved just as much in this story as in the original series is Professor McGonagall. Multiple characters act in ways they never would have in the original series. It is frustrating!<br/><br/>It is clear the Rowling did not write this from the start which is too bad because she may have made this as beautiful as her other masterpieces. It is not terrible, but it could have been so much more.
 I would recommend this book (it's a script of the play, but is an easy read) to any HP fan. Really a delightful story with terrific humor and plot twist.
 For a play script it was very entertaining. As an avid HP fan I was able to create the visuals in my head based around all of the dialogue. It was a good read, in my opinion it still doesn’t measure up to the original series, but at the same time it’s hard to compete with a classic.
 Because it's written as a play, I find it hard to follow.  I love Harry Potter stories but this one is so difficult to read I'm not sure I'll finish it.
 OK - but just a replay of many of the happenings from other HP books. Although I am glad I read it, it wasn't close to any of the other 7 books.
 I dove in with mediochr hopes, and the story fulfilled my expectations. A rehash of the past, for no apparent reason. JKR could've done better, but in screenplay version, well, not my cup of tea.
 I had never read a screen play before.  Interesting since with a screen play the author does not have to add a lot of 'filler'  ie what the weather is like for example...
 Just never catches the voice and feel of the characters, and the play format may work on stage, it certainly fails on the page.
 Oh so amazing and worth the wait! Twists and turns you NEVER saw coming and new characters to fall in love with ( or hate 😉)
 No as good as the original books - did not do justice and would not recommend.
 I agree with some of the other reviews.  Not enough time was spent with character development. But the story read as a "what if," was interesting and fun.
 Was kind of hard to read it in "Play Format".  I'm so use to J.K. Rowling incredible detail and flow.  Still, I loved the story line. The twists and turns were unexpected.  I look forward to reading more from J.K. Rowlings. Maybe another series like Harry Potter?
 I am deeply disappointed in this work, as it is presented as a work of JK Rowling, but the writing is not the quality of work from the esteemed author. Instead, I was disappointed to discover a poorly-crafted work of substandard skill which rides the coat tails of Rowling's notoriety. I wish I had read reviews before purchase.
 After reading reviews, I had decided NOT to read this book, but then a friend who is also a big HP fan read it and enjoyed it, so I gave it a go. I enjoyed it thoroughly. Maybe because I had low expectations for it? I think if you are reading this expecting it to be as good as or exactly like any of the original 7 books, you will be disappointed.  But it was enjoyable, and a great way to revisit the world of Harry Potter that I love and miss. It definitely has limitations being written as a script, and it isn't on par with the novels by any means, but it doesn't mean that it doesn't have value of it's own. Is it the kind of fleshed out 8th book that JK Rowling would have written if she were to written a full novel on her own, of course not. But it was fun to read, fun to get a bit of Harry Potter back and I devoured it in one sitting basically. Glad I read it , despite the negative criticism surrounding it. I especially have to laugh a bit at everyone whining about Harry's "moral integrity" and that this character would NEVER do this or that.... which come on, is ridiculous...  did we all forget what a whiney, surly, self absorbed JERK Harry was for book number 5? yeah. he doesn't always take the high road. I guess I read this more as a story about the kids than a deep dive into the psyche of Harry, Ron and Hermoine... there are parts that I rolled my eyes at, but for an entertaining few hours, which is basically what I am looking for in a book, it was perfect.
 Perfect for those that have been waiting to find out what happens to everyone in the later years!  Hopefully it turns into a movie here in the US
 Boring read. Read all the books that are awesome and this is hard to get in to. Characters are not interesting. Feels like I'm reading a book not part of a adventure.
 Being written as a play made it less enjoyable.  The story line wasn't as appealing as the original Harry Potter Series.
 Story was okay. Not her best by any stretch of imagination. Did not like reading it as a play. Annoying and took away from the story. I hope the play is good.
 I know this was a play, it was a little weird to read. The underline story was good and i am still happy that i read it.
 This has all the fun and excitement of the original and as a play it moves faster than any novel could. I think all Potter fans will love it. Thanks J.K. and others, it is wonderful. I wish I could see an actual production.
 rereading this and now I want to reread the rest! what a great escape for all ages!
 I refuse to except this as cannon
 Was counting down the days until this book released. Love the Harry Potter world and all of its stories.
 It was wonderful to get to spend time with Harry Potter again. I would love to see what other adventures his children find at Hogwarts.
 This was the WORST HP fanfiction I've ever read.<br/>I have read EVERYTHING ELSE WRITTEN BY JK.  This was a piss poor attempt to stay relevant.  Do yourselves a favor and go to hpfanfiction.net.  You will find PLENTY of better HP continuations.<br/><br/>Still love HP and JK but truly wish she had not done this.
 Excelent book
 Best HP fanfic there is. Especially great when you read it right after the other books (or after watching the movies).
 The characters are disappointing.  The facts of the book follow the Harry Potter series, the characters do not seem to have the same personalities.  I was just overall disappointed.  It seemed random and almost like J K Rowling did not write it. It may have been better in book format. :(
 Like a visit with old friends.  Certainly different then the 7 books as written but for any HP fan a must read.
 Eh, it's okay. But it broke the rules of time travel established in Prisoner of Azkaban
 I was a lot disappointed in the book as it seemed to drag not like the others that kept you moving all the way!
 Written like a play not a book but once you get used to it its a great read. Only complaint is its much shorter than your average harry potter book obviously.
 I was expecting another novel and was surprised it was written in play script format, which makes for cumbersome reading.
 Nothing wrong with the delivery, it's just an awful book.
 I think this would make a better novel than a play--can't image sitting through a two-day play. But if you need a Harry Potter fix this is better than nothing.
 Well I really liked this book! I thought that the way it was written was very cool. I absolutely love the Harry Potter series, it is definitely by far my favourite series! Out of all the Harry Potter stories, this is my least favourite because the overall feel was not like the original potters. I still enjoyed how this story was very much!  I would recommend this story to everybody.
 I am a Harry Potter fan.  I really enjoyed reading the Play Script, development of new characters was great and the old characters were true to their old selves.
 I haven't finished reading it. I bought it for my grandbaby however, the first 20 pages are as great as the others.
 JK Rowling. Harry Potter. Enough said.
 Well, I liked it for what it was and would recommend it to Harry Potter readers.  I loved reading Moaning Myrtle's real name.
 I was very disappointed with the book.  I didn't feel like you got to know the characters.<br/><br/>Maybe it will be better as a movie.
 It's a lighter plot than original saga. Still, it's good.
 Disappointing. I had to reread the original books to get this out of my head and just forget that it even existed! It was that bad! Terribly disappointing and yes, maybe as a play it works, but like this, just words on paper, oh no, my dear readers, it does not work at all!
 Good book! Won't say anything about the story, but it was very entertaining!
 The story was okay but not up to the usual JKR standard. Being written in a screenplay format was a little distracting but not a showstopper.
 Guess I thought the story would be a can't wait page turner. Sorry disappointed.
 This made me wish that they left Harry Potter alone. I wish I could unread it. It's as if poorly written fanfic and a ridiculously amount of fan service got married.
 A great read! The book is amazing. Highly reccommend if you're a fan of HP.
 Nothing wrong with the product. The story just sucks.
 I finished the new book. The plot was good, but it wasn't quite the real Rowling. Scorpius was the best character for hearing Rowling in the writing.<br/><br/>Even though I enjoyed the book, I miss her Dickensian detail and sense of humor. It felt a little fan-fictionish because it lacks much of Rowling's humanistic and humorous voice.<br/><br/>This play make me appreciate the later books all the more. I miss Rowling's clever and intricate descriptions of weird and wonderful people, places, and things. Plays don't have time for that the way novels do.<br/><br/>Still, a quick summer read -- not something that you can say about most Harry Potter books.<br/><br/>Okay, George R.R. Martin, it's your turn to get a book out.
 Loved it . Would recommend reading the first 7 books first .
 It was nice to dive back into the HP universe, but I've honestly read better fan fiction.  Maybe I would think better of it if I actually saw the play.
 If you've never read a play, the format might be hard to get into, but the story is there and it's nice to read a story about the characters I so miss.
 I don't recall ever reading a book this fast or this satisfying. It is a natural fit with the original series and takes you back like you were reading them for the first time.
 I was skeptical about this play, which was foolish of me. It was outstanding. Such a great read for Potter fans. I hope to see the production in London next year.
 A great addition to the Harry Potter saga!  I enjoyed reading it.  Can't wait until it is on film or the play itself comes to Los Angeles.
 Book was received in perfect, new, condition. Just as described. My daughter has been reading this and she's loving it thus far.
 The best book I've read in a while! Very happy with it!
 Great item, fast shipping
 Let me start by saying I loved the story. It was well done. As it was written in "play" form rather than "book" form it wasn't a terribly relaxing read. Would I purchase and read it again? Absolutely!
 i'm a potterhead
 Story revolves around time turners and alternate realities. Reads like a quick fan fic. Fun quotient depends upon how much you miss the HP universe. The script medium loses some of the impact it's probably have if watched on Broadway. Looking forward!
 loved it
 I think the HP saga is running out of fuel
 Lots of potential but ultimately a major failure. The story not only fails to capture the spirit of the original HP but seeks to change the characters in the worst of ways.  I truly hope this story does not become cannon and is quickly written off as nothing more then a fan made stage play. This will be the first HP story that does not stay on the kindle but disappears back into the cloud, forgotten.
 Great book in a great series.
 This author never disappoints! This series keeps us wanting more. The next generation deals with famous parents. Great read! Thank you, J.K.!
 This book was exciting and fast moving!  I read all the other Harry Potter Books, and really enjoyed reading about his and Ron's family. It was very enjoyable!
 Just like all the other devoted fans who were raised with Harry, I am a 30 year old woman whose heart was crushed by this horrendous misrepresentation of the beautiful and complex characters that touched me so deeply throughout my childhood.
 Purchased as a gift for my 21 year old daughter who is an HP fan.  She loves the book and is very happy with the purchase.  Good shipping and reasonable price.
 Great
 J.K. Rowling did not write the book and you can tell. It is a hollow shell of the Harry Potter series and I am disappointed that Rowling would ever approve such an embarrassing work that does not stay true to the characters.
 I did enjoy this book. No, it not like the others but it still was a good read and a nice reunion with some old friends. It's worth getting.
 I am a proud Potterhead and bought this as an add-on to my original HP books. The book itself is pretty big in size but it came in the mail looking great! Great hardcover and good story!
 Terrible book. Felt like it was not written by J.K. Rowling.
 Will always love anything Harry Potter related. Book left me wanting more. It was an okay story just felt like it could have been written better.
 Written in true HP fashion. Same suspense, incredible magic.
 A fun read but it doesn't have quite the same feel as the originals. As many before me have said, it has a distinct hint of fan fiction to it.
 I liked this a lot. The play is not as good as previous HP books, but that's a lot to live up to. If you consider it a companion piece it's pretty excellent.
 I liked the books better. I understand the author branching out into a different venue but I enjoyed the books more.
 This book starts really awkwardly and it really made me consider chucking it. I wasn't a fan of some of the character backstory and plot development, until they pull you in about 1/4 the way through the book. The issue is that it reads like a screenplay instead of a novel but the plot is solid and the characters are well developed.
 Like most in my generation we all grew up on the magical world of Harry Potter. Once I heard that the script was going to be released I had such high expectations. I re-read the entire series before I got this book in the mail. I am highly disappointed. It's a pretty cheesy story and I guess I expected it be darker, and just to have a much better storyline. I tried to convince myself that I actually enjoyed reading this and but I really didn't. It's a good story but it does not compare the original series.
 I liked it. Albus and Scorpius are so gay, the force heteronormativity is an outrage and i will not stand for it. But eh it was nice
 The major characters lack authenticity as adults; they are still children acting in childish ways. This adds very little to the canon.
 I liked it... It's not your typical Harry Potter story and a lot of it was very cheesy. Figures because it wasn't written by J.K Rowling.  I wished there was more substance to it. It's honestly not horrible but it makes me crave a real sequel more.
 Very happy with the story but disappointed in the format. I didn't realize it was written as a play script. Once I got used to it it was ok. Also the cost for the Kindle of 14.99 was expensive for a short read. I loved all the Harry Potter series!
 Didn't like the format.  I found it distracting.
 Another "home run" by J.K.Rowling.
 Read it. You have to if you are a harry potter series fan. But It was not what I had expected. The story does not make much sense when trying to link into all the hidden twists and secrets through the original 7 books. Still read it. Might as well if you loved the Harry Potter series, but I was disappointed.
 10 year old daughter LOVED this she is a huge potter fan and was so happy to have one more to read. She loved the action and storyline
 A little continuation to my youth days. I love everything Harry Potter and it was good reading a new story again. I has so much meaning!!
 I didn't read that this was a play not an novel. pls read the description clearly before buying. Don't make the same mistake I made.
 Its a fun jaunt in the world of Harry Potter. Its not exactly what I wanted, to be honest, but once I got past myself I enjoyed the story thoroughly.
 I'm a big HP fan. Really enjoyed the story just hated reading it in play format. Can't say I was engrossed because I didn't finish in a day but I did complete.
 Wish it would have been a novel....jumps years too fast....didn't mention a lot of key characters from the previous books....felt let down....
 It's ok for a play script. The story line felt rushed and  cluttered with pointless detail.
 It is probably great to watch as a play but the details seemed sketchy and each year seemed hurried - almost like a calendar of events rather than an absorbing read! I did anticipate some of the main characters before I got to read it, I only did not anticipate that one of them might be a different sex!
 Characters, including Harry Potter show no change in maturity.  There is no balance between emotional and logical behavior.  There is a shallowness throughout the play, no substance or depth.  Perhaps the format is inhibiting but that didn't stop Shakespeare.
 Great book! Love the plot twists!! Spent the entire time reading it and doing a mental movie in my head and wishing that it he already been made into a movie.
 The sequel nobody wanted. Time travel is difficult subject matter to tackle and The Cursed Child falls flat on its face trying to do so.
 I did not like the way it was written.  All with stage writing.  It was an ok book, but not the type I am used to reading.
 Terrific story and characters! This book does not disappoint. All Harry Potter fans should read this book! It was excellent.
 Bought this for two of my sons but keep in mind it is a script and not a storybook. Nevertheless, they both loved the story of Harry's son.
 I loved this book. Read it in one day. The plot was a little out there and Rowling doesn't explain somethings which would help the story to make a bit more sense but it was a lot of fun for sure. Albus and Scorpius should have been a couple, it's very heavily implied even though Rowling tries to thow Rose in there as a "love interest" but it doesn't really tie well.
 It was like a visit with old friends who introduced me to some new friends.  My biggest disappointment was the way Ron Weasley was portrayed.
 Great new Harry Potter story (assuming you are familiar with the original series).  Obviously from a different perspective.  Can't wait to see it on stage.
 Must read if you're a Potter fan. Quick read so be sure to take it in small doses. A lot of old character revisits in a very interesting way!
 This book was a very interesting book and it is a very good story. I really liked it so much
 Great read!! I love how this book gives us new insight to beloved characters! Rowlings imagination enables us to be fully transported to another time and place, almost as well as a time turner!
 The story was OK but given the format it felt flat and sometimes confusing. It was nice to have a little more Potter et al But definitely does not hold a candle to the Rowling series...
 It's not as great as the original HP books but I still really enjoyed it. I wish it were longer. It's easy to get through within a day or two!
 The adventure continues and there are so many cameos by many of the loved characters!  For me the whole Harry Potter series is the best adventure I've every been on!
 I purchased as a Christmas gift
 Ordered as a gift.
 Great read that whets my appetite for the movie!  Although I do miss the rich descriptions that come with a traditional book
 really enjoyed this book. I love all the Harry Potter books, this one was just as good!
 A wonderful read and I loved the format, enjoyed having the scene description. Would recommend this book to everyone!
 It's JK Rowling, if you dont like the other Potter books you probably won't like this one, if you did like them then you probably will.
 This was a little hard to get into and unlike the other books I could put the book down for days at a time.  However as I got into it, the plot was good and reading like a play wasn't as fulfilling as the other books but I did enjoy it.
 A fun read, but clearly not written by JKR, and felt very much like fan fiction. Still enjoyed revisiting many of the characters, and the world, I so enjoyed growing up.
 Love the Potter series.  This has a lot of time traveling and I found it confusing the firs time  read it.  Got better each time after that.
 I couldn't get into this...which is very disappointing!  I love Harry Potter and have for a long time.  I was excited when this came out, but now I'm trying to pretend it doesn't exist. :/
 Spoiler alert but in some parts the characters go back in time to the old books and the authors get the other books wrong. (This is what my 9 year old son said)
 So glad they released this book, have read it many times
 amazing sequal to the Harry Potter series  -  I can't wait to see the play!
 was a good book to read
 Absolutely devoured it like I used to with the Harry Potter books. Brought back the magic again for me even though it was a play.
 Interesting take on "what happens after the war" but it felt awkward, like a fan fiction. Visiting great places from the books and film. May loose something I just reading the script though. Would still pay to see it on stage I think.
 I really enjoyed this book. It really keeps you on the edge of your seat. You don't want to put it down, you just can't wait to see what happens next. Great book.
 Loved it and wish I could see the play or they make this into a movie with maybe the original movie cast in their original parts.
 I couldn't get into this- weird reading Harry Potter in play format. Maybe I should give it another shot.
 Worthy of my time, but didn’t read like a Rowling novel. I am happy I read it.
 This is a fun read, and is likely more fun in performance. The play tries a little too hard to be everything to everyone who misses the world of Potter. Even so, the story stands decently on its own. On stage, it likely delivers better than visiting Universal Studios.
 I tried reading this but stopped after the first two pages because it isn't anything more than stage directions and dialog which didn't interest me enough to bother with continuing with. If it were possible to give 0 stars I would have.
 I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was not at all what I was expecting, which I like! I also like how some of the loose ends were wrapped up :)
 This play script was a fun add on to the Harry Potter World and story. I loved every single page of the book and it kept me interested until the end. I wish I could see the play in person...
 This play is quite good, is it like another Harry Potter book? Not really. Anyone who expected that is going to be sadly mistaken. A script is not a novel and does not come across as one. You are not going to be transported to the wizarding world as easily and it is harder to connect with the story and the characters. You need prose or to see it performed for that. But, if you can use your imagination to transport yourself into this world, you won't be disappointed. The characters you love are there along with new ones, the story is very grand and reminiscent of the books. The story is more about relationships between characters as opposed to an overly magical setting and experience. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing how relationships between some of my favorite characters have evolved as they grew up more and their relationships with their children.<br/><br/>I've read other reviews that said the story and characters are flat and two dimensional, again I believe that is a problem with the way a script reads versus a novel and I think many people are going to be expecting something different. I've also read that people found inconsistencies between this and the books. I didn't notice anything major, but I also have not read a lot of the extended universe material.<br/><br/>Overall, I really enjoyed the story and format and this is definitely worth a read.
 Just finished reading this with my twelve year old Harry Potter nerd son. We both thoroughly enjoyed it (although his frequent digressions about time-paradoxes and possible interactions between alternate realities were a bit frustrating at times.)<br/>Kudos and thanks to Rowling for another engaging adventure!
 I like the use of old and new together, bringing the characters with their histories into the present was well done. I would have liked more in depth about the child and prophecy but it was a play and therefore couldn't go into the level of description JK Rowling normal gives us in her writing.
 I loved it. I gave it 4 stars because a play can be only so long and detailed and I wish the author had written a novel instead, but I fully enjoyed it. I hope I get a change to see it on stage sometime.
 I wish I would have realized it was written like a script. It's interesting but not enough to binge read for me.
 Not on the level of the first series. Found myself wanting something more than this delivered. I still enjoyed it though.
 As a megafan and worshipper of JK Rowling - I am disappointed to say the least. I read the spoilers so knew what was coming but the blow of it still sucks. There are so many plot holes and go-backs on canon that my head spins. I keep trying to make sense of all the mistakes but I just can't. I am so sad. On a bright side there is some really cool bits with hermione and Ron - they prove that their love for each other makes each other the best version of themselves. I also love that scorpius is such an awesome geeky goofball and is a mixture of Harry, ron and hermione so albus really lucked out getting him as his friend. Albus was angsty and angry but that's not a character flaw though. I like that he's angsty I just didn't like him so much - pure slytherin narscisist haha. Anyway it's not a bad story, it's not good though and I'm surprised Jk Rowling approved this story and says it's canon when it goes against many other things she says is canon. I spent the night really upset about this but I have let it go and in my mind this isn't canon - it's fan fiction. This doesn't help in any way the 7 books - it cheapens them.
 I could not put this book down. I binge read it in 4 hours. Everything about it kept me hooked and needing more. When I finish the 7th book, that last chapter with a glimpse into the future, I wanted more. I need more. This was just that. It was heart breaking and reopened wounds from the novels, while adding new ones. It was funny and charming with a new friendships and different perspectives. I absolutely love this.
 I have seen some reviews of this book that claim the presentation is stilted and two dimensional. I'm guessing that those readers have had little exposure to scripts and aren't accustomed to visualizing stage action.  I found the limited stage direction delightful, as it allowed me to imagine the creative use of the set, lights, and stage as I interpret.<br/><br/>Another complaint I've heard is that Harry's actions are out of character. I didn't find that to be the case at all. We are seeing Harry the father for the first time since accompanying young Albus to King's Crossing during the epilogue of The Deathly Hallows. Although a grown man with a child of his own now, Harry is as clumsy with fatherhood as he was with his relationships as a boy... something I believe all parents can relate to at times.
 Why? Oh, Why? Bought this out of intense Harry Potter nostalgia, shouldn't have. The original books are so great, that this one is all that worse.
 LOVED IT! There was delayed shipping due to a storm, but was thrilled to still get it when it came a couple days later.
 A gift.  My niece was thrilled to get it. She can't wait to start reading it.
 There are better stories in this series but it is good.  The drawback for me was that it is not as easy to read as the others and because of the playwright style it loses some of the unique flavor and descriptive punch.
 A fantastic story that I highly recommend you to read.  Especially if you like Harry potter. Loved it from beginning to end
 It is the quality one would expect from JK Rowlings. The Plot is engaging. We visit familiar characters and learn much about new ones too.
 I'm not saying you shouldn't buy this. I'm saying you shouldn't have high hopes.  As many other reviews have already stated, this is more of a poorly-written fanfic.  It seems like JK Rowling did nothing to contribute to this and they just slapped her name on the cover for sales.  It feels nothing like the Harry Potter we know and love.  The characters are either untrue to themselves or are missing entirely. (Why wasn't George running the joke shop?? Why Ron?? And where was Teddy?)  The whole thing feels wrong.  If you read this, try not to accept it as cannon.
 Loved the play format. Enjoyed the story.
 It was fun, but not the depth of her Harry Potter books, nor of the Magical Creatures movie.
 I enjoyed it very much.  Took the book with me on a recent trip from Orlando to Arizona, and finished the entire book before the plane landed in Phoenix.  Hope there will be another book to follow where this one left off.
 I'm sad to say that this was a total disappointment. You can tell Rowling had nothing to do with the writing. It does not compare to the other books at all.
 This tale about Harry and his son is everything we hoped for. We've all missed Harry Potter and now we can dive into the magical world once again. The story was wonderful (although it made me want to go see the play). Shipping was fast, it came in sturdy packaging and I finished reading it the day after I got it. Enjoy!
 It's not such a huge disappointment as many of the reviews suggest, but it is a completely different experience than reading any of Rowling's other books. It's like taking all of the descriptive sentences out of a novel and hoping it still works, it doesn't. I knew it was going to be a script, but thought there would have been more stage direction to fill in the blanks. For example, if you didn't know the characters this would be hopeless as you have no idea who or what are these characters.<br/><br/>The story itself isn't terrible, but we expect much more from Rowling. It's all a little predictable. Due to the nature of the story (avoiding spoilers!) much of it seems to be a repeat of the early books and therefore doesn't have that surprising content that each of the seven books provided.<br/><br/>I'm not sure of the input Rowling had with this project, but I'd suggest that she publicly clarifies her role.Having her name connected with this project isn't very complimentary.<br/><br/>In the future, before purchasing, I may review future Harry Potter projects and not automatically order them like I have in the past.
 I thoroughly enjoyed this book.<br/>Didn't realize how much one can miss the adventures of the wizarding world.<br/>No regrets.
 Great product!
 I had expected a play, but a well written one. This read more like a spoof of harry potter than actual harry potter. The rules of the harry potter world were bent and it felt forced. I am disappointed jk Rowling endorsed this.
 Good read. Did not like the play style layout. Very glad the Harry Potter story is continuing but didn't find this one as exciting as the others.
 While it is true that I find this piece to be full of plot holes and something you might find low rated on fanfiction.net I do see what they were trying to do with this. I just do not myself agree with it.
 I’ve debated for a long time weather to read the book. I’ve seen multiple negative reviews. I actually loved the story. Perfect ending, you see a new side of Harry.
 It's a Harry Potter Book...need I say more?
 In comparison to Rowlings' books, this stage script is a poor representation of Harry Potter's world.  It's very unimaginative and has no magic.
 I felt it was a great read, and while i understand J.K. Risking only approved and didn't write this expansion, it still carried on the Potter timeline.
 Wonderful addition to the Harry Potter series; had me reading and reading, could not put it down! If only the actual play wasn't so far away in London....
 love, love , love it!! I am not a reader except for the Harry potter series! I do hope they make this into a movie!!
 Another amazing story from J.K. Rowling! Don't let the script format turn you away because it's pure magic inside, you won't be disappointed I promise!
 This book was good atleast for my taste ! I liked how scorpios and albus were so different from their parents Harry and Draco , also how rose Weasley was a total weirdo . The ending has a big surprise ! I recommend this book ! Plus I'm happy albus is a slytherin .
 I have read the Harry Potter books more times then I would like to admit..  But i am disappointed beyond words at this book,  did J. K Rowling run out of money and needed some quick? Felt completely thrown together,  sorry was shallow and the characters development was non-existent.  I don't understand why they just ruined a good thing.
 I loved this book.  It is just as good as the other  7 Harry Potter books.
 Great read!! Not a typical Harry Potter book, as it is in a play format. But, still in a he same adventurous style we are used too.
 It is a different to read a screen play, but once you get past that, it is the same magic that J.K. Rowling put into each and every Harry Potter book!
 It was a simple story. Some excitement for sure, but a good story. It didn't have the feel of the books since it was a screen play, but I really did enjoy it.
 A very quick read, as it was in play format. Nice to revisit the HP universe, but I was left wanting a bit.
 **Spoilers** The idea of Voldemort having a child...and what it takes to make a child, is just so beyond ridiculous to me. So that entire plot line just fell flat. Also, I miss the characters inner monologues that you get in a novel versus a screenplay. But beyond that, it allowed me back into the world of Harry Potter (and to embrace the wonderful character that is Scorpius Malfoy) so I can't complain too much.
 loved it
 I'm sure it's better on stage. As a former actor, kept trying to figure out how would do all that magic and person-switching stuff.
 I didn't like listening to or reading a book that is really a script for a play or movie.  It was stupid and I'm a harry potter fan.
 Loved that this was written in script form meaning, I glad it wasn't rewritten as a novel. The stage directions and side notes gave me a whole new perspective.
 Not up to Joanne''s Standards.  I may not have enjoyed the play format.  I'm a big fan of the books, sorry.
 J.K. Rowling has done it again.  I've always wondered how Harry Potter's life went on.  It's nice to finally know.
 I was not excited since it was a screenplay. I couldn't, however, put it down!  Excellent read!
 Wife Loves it!!!!
 Why write a script? This was not interesting nor inviting. Nothing to write hogwarts about. ..
 My 12 year old on loved it. It took him a while to get used to it being written in a play format, but he was excited to start it &amp; sad when it ended.
 This book just doesn't compare to the rest of the series but was enjoyable nonetheless. Glad to be able to read a continuation of the harry potter story.
 well written - just a rather wrenching undertone of sadness about it - wish it was a bit lighter but the insights into human emotion undeniably give it depth
 It's a play not a story from a book and I did not like it at all. which was said because I have enjoyed all of her other Harry Potter books.
 Bought for my daughter as a gift, she loved it.
 This is written as a Play Script, so be aware of that. The story continues with Harry and his Son, and it is an amazing addition to the lore we have all grown to love. Rowling has done it again, and kept me hooked. I finished this book in a single read and was gripped the whole time. A great, easy and fun read!
 Arrived on time in good condition. No problem there. Just a disappointing story.
 Hard to like in the beginning, sort of confusing, erest of book was  very good.  Don't really like play style set-up. Maybe should supply more background info about years passed.
 This was a great follow-up to the series! Be forewarned, it IS in play format, so it reads like a script. If you are expecting typical novel format, you'll be disappointed. But the story is GREAT.
 I did not enjoy the story nor the way they published the book in a script format. I would of possibly enjoyed more if rewritten in a story book format.
 Loved it. You have to be able to understand that you are reading a playscript, and not a book. Therefore, we don't get as into detail with the charecters.
 love harry Potter books
 A really horrible entry in the Potter series.  The kids were not appealing, and couldn't carry the boring story
 great product
 Definitely not Harry Potter canon, as far as I'm concerned. Reads like a pretty good fanfic. Does not have the same magical feeling the other books do.
 I guess we Potter fans really wanted another Potter book and this was not it.
 Loved being back in this HP world, and I didn’t want it to end. Can’t wait to watch the play now.
 Fun book.  Loved the Harry Potter books and was nice to see another book with the characters back.
 This little look into Harry's adult world, as a dad, is teasing and wonderful. It flys by, and you settle into the play format quickly.  I LOVED it!!
 This play stays true to the Harry Potter series, and I was very impressed with the plot and fun characters - some old, some new. It's definitely worth reading.
 This book was nothing I expected. I knew it would be in script form but it seemed more like a fanfic than a story created by the original author of this series. It wash an extremely confusing story going back and forth through time. It was very unnecessary for the franchise. I regret buying and reading this.
 First let me say that I love the Harry Potter series - have read them all several times and attended the midnight launch party for every one of them.  This was mostly awful.  I knew it was in script format long before it came out so that was not the problem.<br/>!!Minor Spoiler Alerts!!<br/>Harry and the original characters seem to have had complete personality shifts.  So many examples, way too many to list but would Harry really have a distant relationship with one of his children considering his own childhood?<br/>So much of it was a cut and paste of events from the original books. Events and outcomes were changed and then went back to where they were.  Characters mourned and remembered fondly were back, if only temporarily and it felt like cheating.  One particular scene near the end was just cruel and unnecessary.<br/>I could go on and on about the things I hated but then this review would be one giant spoiler.  Instead I am going to pretend this book never happened and drag its memory out of my head and drop it in a pensieve never to be retrieved.
 I can see it as a movie!
 Terrible follow up to a great series. I was very disappointed considering all the hype. Bad form and. Rowling. I expected more.
 I loved it! I literally could not put it down. Due to the book being set as a play, it was a much faster read than a narrative. Still, a very good read!
 love everything about Harry Potter wish they would just keep coming, this was no exception it was great.
 disappointing read. no details to surroundings, doesn't take you there, even for a playwrite
 The story was good, but compared to the original series it was a little lacking.  It was not as well written.  I am glad I read it.
 Just a book of futuristic events after Harry Potter. Dealing with their children ho attend Hogwarts.  Delightful! A good story.
 I happen to think these JK Rowling books are weird, but for my son, they never disappoint.
 This is written as a play.<br/>Take place after the 7th book.<br/>Is a different experience comparing to the 7-books series since this is a play.
 A gift for my 29 year old daughter who did not put it down for the first week after receiving it. She read it in a matter of days!
 I liked it. It was different having to fill in blanks the way a play requires, after being so accustomed to Rowlings' rich narratives. But very engaging.
 It was a good follow up to the Harry Potter series ... and since we know the characters, it's hardly noticeable that the descriptive narration is missing.
 Just didn't like the book.  The original series was much better.  Felt that the characters were boring and one-dimensional.  Just not a good effort.
 Good story line - way out of context compared to previous books.  Did not like the "play-like" format.  Could have been much better done.
 Fun, fast read for potter heads. No it isn't as good as the original. But it's fun.
 Arrived a little bent, but thankfully there has been no lasting damage to the book. Can't wait to start reading it!
 Big Harry Potter fan.  Loved it.
 WEll written as all J K Rowling books are.  A great book to read and a wonderful addition  to the Harry Potter series.
 I wasn't impressed with this book. I loved each Harry Potter book, but this one was very different. I don't think J.K. Rowling had much to do with the writing of this book.<br/><br/>Very disappointing.
 disappointed
 Bought it for my nephew as a gift. My mother is still reading it instead of wrapping it and sending it to the child.
 Can't put it down...so wish I could physically see the story play out but I know it wont be too long before I am able to see it!
 I guess I expected the magic of prior books. This was a rehash and I struggled to finish this  play which is not, by any means, a long work.
 Honestly the author should have adapted the play into a series of books. For some reason she felt the need to instead force feed us years and years of harry potter's son's life. Feels like a money grab
 It was wonderful to revisit the world of Harry Potter. I have it 4 stars only because I found it a tiny bit predictable. It was a wonderful read and very enjoyable. I would highly recommend it.
 I expected better from a Harry Potter work, but this seems to read like fanfiction. Perhaps it has more impact as a stage play?
 I loved this but my wife and daughter (age 26) were not impressed.  I think they were really expecting a book rather than a play.  Personally, I think a book would have been better, too.
 Not anywhere close to a real Harry Potter story.  Interesting how Harry and the rest of his crew grow up but this just didn't do it.  Lots of gaps in the plot.
 I would of like it much better if it would of been in a reading format opposed to the play script.  I liked the story line.
 I love the Harry Potter books and world. I love JK Rowling's writing. This is not her writing and it is my opinion that her name she not be associated with this. The plot is terrible and horribly predictable, and just...bad.
 Should not have been sold as a book. If JK had written it in regular book form it could have been so good because the premise of the book is good.  However, it could not be well developed in play form or by any writer other than JK Rowling.
 Never could get through it.
 A classic that every child will love.
 Look, I am a big Harry Potter can. But like a lot of others, I personally think that it was just not as good as any other of books. It's sad to say I know. It was a pretty big disappointment. I won't spoil anything, it's up to you buyers to decide! 😩😞
 love it.
 Definitely a disappointment if your looking for Jk Rowling writing and that authenticity. I guess it's fun just to read about that world again though, but it's kind of just like a fan fiction since she didn't write it and it's like apparent while reading that it's not hers.
 not very interesting
 Worth the read - It was fun to imagine what could be done on a stage. Makes for a fun night if you read it with friends and play the different roles!
 Yech. I couldn't get past the first Act.  What an insult to JK ROWLING.  Her books are so entertaining and this was just so poorly conceived and written
 It feels like a HP fanfiction story. I like it and maybe as a play is good but...is not Harry Potter anymore.
 No problems, good experience.
 It was a different type of read, since it's a playwright - that took some getting used to. But once I was in the flow of things, it was classic J.K. Rowling and I enjoyed it very, very much. As with all of her books, they seem to end too quickly. In other words, they're so good, I don't want to put it down, thus finishing the book within a day!
 Well written, continues the story, gives more history and makes you want more!  I hope more is to follow in some form or another.  I would love to see this play in my home town, Phoenix, Arizona.
 does sort of read like a fan fiction. the rich description are not really there because it's a play. but was still enjoyable for any HP fans
 Just not the quality of a real Harry Potter book, even if it is a play. Disappointed  a little bit.
 Great story, had to have it the second it came out, and Amazon was the first to deliver. My daughter was thrilled.
 Hard to follow at 1st due to being written in a script style instead of a traditional story style.  It's definitely cool for those wanting to know more about Harry's life after Voldemort but not even close to the same quality as original Potter books.
 I went in knowing, full well, that JK did not write this. That being said, I was not disappointed whatsoever. This was a masterful piece of fan fiction. It misses many details that Rowling would emphasize but all in all very pleasant, very entertaining and worth adding to the collection (although, technically not the eighth book).
 I almost quit reading on every page. Only kept going because it was a Harry Potter story and I might need to know the background for another  book.
 If you go into it expecting a book, stop right there. This is a play, and requires some more imagination. The story was excellent, and I loved imagining how the theater made this come to life.
 I've read better fanfiction, but I've also read worse fanfiction. There were some things I really liked about it and a couple crucial things I really, really, REALLY REALLY didn't. And if you've read it, you probably already know what those things are.
 I look forward to seeing the play. Maybe see this turned into a movie. It explains a lot of Harry's internal struggles with having friends die for him.
 Wasn't as good as the other 7 books. The idea was nice - reading about Harry years later but it just didn't work.  Couldn't wait until this book was over. Very sad and disappointed.
 A bit hard to read in script form, but so far intriguing. I have always enjoyed "Harry Potter" and I'm sure I will with this one.
 Big HP fan. This book was different from all the rest but still very good. I enjoyed the read.
 It's everything I wanted it to be. Fast read, took me back to the World of Harry Potter and just made me happy reading it. :)
 A good story, but not as engaging as reading a regular book. It was great to see the continuation of the characters from the previous series, as well as the addition of their children.
 A bit childish and not long enough but definitely worth reading!!! Unpredictable and cool plot. Ties in great with the original story.
 I wasn't sure what I expected, but I think I'd rather have seen the actual play.
 It's a little different and it took me awhile to get into, just because of the style, but once I did I couldn't put it down!
 From the first sentence you recognize J. K. Rowling and it feels comfortable. I had never read a play before so that was different. Overall I enjoyed the book very much. I would defiantly go tho see the play.
 I actually liked it a lot. It reads more like fan fiction than a real Harry Potter book, but I'm okay with that.
 Cheating! Should include e-book in the title! I was redirected from the "hardcover" page here! Very bad experience.
 Fun to go back to the wizarding world and rejoin Harry, Hermione, and Ron.  Get used to style of the book being play script.  Story has a few good twists, but fairly simple.
 Donated to the Natchez Public Libary
 The story plot is kind of weak....seems like this story was rushed or maybe didn't have a lot of J.K. Rowling's input or review.
 LOVE JK RAWLING
 A swing and a miss.  I am a Potter head, but this format left me cold.  I can do Shakespeare, but this was just the wrong format for Harry.
 The book was in perfect shape.  You can tell that a different author wrote it though.  Good story, but I prefer J.K. Rawling's writing.
 It arrived exactly as described and timely.  The writing was not as spectacular as previous books.
 It is not written like the other Harry Potter books (my son has read them all, and loved them).  It is written like a SCREEN PLAY.
 Hard to appreciate after the depth and detail of the novels.  I would have preferred this as a novella, by really,the story just wasn't great.
 Unnecessary.
 Wished it had been longer.  Enjoyed finding out more about the kids and their personalities.  Would read additional books if she puts them out.
 Very interesting story with some great twists and turns.  Makes me wish I could go to London to see the stage production.
 A fast paced play that examines relationships lost and found between teens, parents and their kids and adults among themselves in a way that is meaningful and non-pandering
 Disappointed. I stopped reading after the first 50 pages because the plot was so contrived and predictable. Didn't want to read anymore and ruin my memories of the original series. Expected something much better.
 Love every aspect of Harry Potter.
 Not my favorite book in the series, but nice to have some more story after book 7
 I didn't like the writing style, and I felt like the book was really short because of it.
 Read the entire series first! I was skeptical because it is written as a play...but it actually made it easier to read!
 Do not expect a Harry Potter book.  It is written in the fashion of a script -- I didn't enjoy it all that much.
 I have loved all of JK's novels, even the Robert Galbraith books are great. I know this is a "script" and not a novel... with that being said, the plot is lame, the dialogue is not engaging, and it is an overall disappointment.<br/>P.S. - Watch out for the T-1000 trolley witch!
 Great service. book is huge disappointment. It is a script not a story, co authored by Rowlings and others.
 It's Harry potter...you have no choice. You love it.
 Great plot development, suspenseful action, and more characters to love and despise! Hope to see it on stage!
 Screen play vs. novel.  My husband devoured it quickly.
 I wish I had never read it.  I hated the play format (my fault for not knowing it ahead of time) and I missed the wonderful character development and strong plotting of the 7 books
 I love anything Harry a potter related. The story was great but I don't care for reading things in screenplay format. Still loved anyway.
 Was not expecting a script form so I was a little surprised and disappointed.  I still enjoyed it though being a potter fan.
 I read the whole series as a child and this brings back great memories<br/>Read This book it's very good I love you j.k. Rowling
 Great Book!
 I've never read a screenplay before and it was a quick, easy read. I enjoyed it and gasped out loud at a couple of times. If you're a Potter fan, it's worth the read.
 Interesting but lacks the spirit of the series
 My fault. Wish I would have noticed it wasn't written by J.K. Rowling herself and that it's a play.
 Would buy from seller again, product arrived on time and as described.  Great price and great product! Thank you!
 Things you must understand:<br/><br/>One, this is a script for a play, not really a book. It reads like a play, the details offered are those you'd get in a play (stage directions and so on). It's easy to read but this is a different kind of Harry Potter book. Two, you won't have to worry about what they left out when they make the movie as you know they will. There isn't much that they could leave out. Three, if you were worried that this was going to ruin the series for you - don't. It holds up the Potter flag. You won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>In some ways, this reads like fan fiction. What happened if... and they got Rowling involved to make it all work. And it does work. You will enjoy the story, you will believe these are the same characters, and in the end you will care about what happens to them. I can't give it 5 stars mostly because I wanted an 8th book, and this isn't that, it's a lot less detail and a lot less story. But it was a whole lot of fun. If you keep in mind that this is NOT an 8th book but the script for a play, you will enjoy it.
 Only,I don't like to be in the form of the theatrical text...Other than that, it was smooth and engrossing story. I'm looking forward to the movie.
 For an avid Harry Potter fan, this just doesn't live up to the originals. The writing style is just different enough that you can tell JK Rowling didn't write it. I still read it, but I could have lived without it just fine.
 This was a great read! It took me about a chapter to get used to the style of writing (written in play form). After that I was immediately captured by the story!
 This is one of the best Harry Potter books! My son finished it in one afternoon, it reads well and allows you to have great visuals.
 I thought I would not love this book because it is a screen play. I was SO wrong! I found this book very interesting. The book being written as a screen play did not take away from enjoying the story like I had originally thought.  I would recommend it to anyone who loves Harry Potter and wants a fresh read.
 My kids really did not like this. They said it does not read like J.K. Rowling, more like a bad fan fiction. They were really upset
 Never a disappointment with Harry Potter.  Fans should love this!
 omg love this book
 As with many, many other people the Harry Potter series will always be a favorite of mine. This is no exception. I wish I could see the play in London.
 Fun different read on a great story/character.
 Thank you, JK Rowling, for continuing the story.  The adventures continued with some great twists.  Can't wait to see the play!
 waste of money
 It's well written as a play and would be very cool to see.  Not that exciting to read
 did not like the "screen play" format. I think this is just a way to sell more books
 Series enjoyed by my granddaughter, quality writing
 Great to see what JK had in store for Harry and the next generation.  I'm sure it is better in live format.
 Save yourself the trouble. All this does is making an annoying blue light and attract spider webs. On itself. When it's supposed to keep them away. Such a bummer.
 The story feels heavily contrived. The action is few and far between. There's very little logic, and the usual details about how the wizarding world works feels shotty at best.
 Didn't mind the format, or the characters added, but the language was just not the brilliant writing I've come to expect in this series.
 The book was good. Took a little bit to get use to the style of writing but it was a quick read.
 NOT a book, make sure you know this is a rehearsal edition, like reading a play. Wish i would have known before I bought the 'book'.
 It was a great view into the adult characters. Facing issues with kids . The friendship that might not have been.
 Well wrapped, came quickly and it was a great read.  Love it.  My grandson woll love it too.
 I guess I'd have to see this to understand how on earth it can be staged, but the story was good and fits well within the HP canon.
 I liked it... no, it didn't fit seamlessly into the HP universe, but it was entertaining, and I enjoyed revisiting my favorite characters.
 Great book.  However my wife had purchased a copy of her own and hid the fact on me.  I had to return the item.
 Would rather that it was a story to read instead of having to read it as a play, but enjoyed the further in time story.
 It was fun to be back in the Potter world for a bit, but it wasn't the same as the books.
 Great book, obviously.
 You can't beat JK Rowling!
 Nowhere near the quality of the series.
 It was great to spend time with these characters again and the story was entertaining. The book feels more like fan fiction than anything else though. The language is overly complex while the plot seems overly simple. It's fun enough to still read, but don't expect too much.
 Great read, my 14 yr old and I really enjoyed it. No spoilers, but the 'way' it's written is 'different' - just stick it out!
 Not horrible but not up to J.K. Rowling standard.
 Perfect gift.
 If you love Harry Potter...don't get this book.  It's really the script of a very simple story of Harry's kids years later.  Not worth the money!
 Good story but doesn't read like a Harry Potter classic (obviously). Can't wait for more!
 Being how impossible it would be to follow up the greatness of the Harry Potter series, this is a very nice visit into his world years later. The fact that it's written in play form makes it lighter, and gives it a definite feel of something different, but similar at the same time.
 Mrs. Rowling please write more books. Write all the books. I love this so much. Can't wait for FB&amp;WTFT
 I miss HP. I had to see the 4th movie again after reading this one. Please- more magic!
 Bought this for my daughter. She was going to get the kindle version, but you can't add a kindle version to your bookcase.
 Completely overdone and not worth reading.  It was like reading a really bad fanfiction book of Harry Potter.
 I enjoyed revisiting the characters and the world of hog warts but was disappointed in the overall depth of the actual story from such a talented writer
 Not a fan of the format.
 I enjoyed this story, little hard to read at first, being a script and not a full book. However, it was great to have a new HP story.
 This was a gift for someone in Texas.  I have had good feedback - once the 'gifted' reconciled to the fact that it was written in form<br/>of a play.
 It was good but not as good as the series.
 odd reading a play script
 It was very different reading a script instead of a story. I was glad it was written. I enjoy the Harry Potter series.
 A fantastic foray back into the discarding world. A great balance of characters new and old. Gripping, emotional, everything we've come to love about Harry Potter.
 I've always been a fan and I thought this was a really clever update.  Good promo for the stage show, but good in its own right
 Very nostalgic. Took me back to my childhood. It was so good to be with these characters again! I have sacraficed quite a bit of sleep, but that was always the case when a new Harry Potter book was released:)
 Horrible. Didn't live up to the Harry Potter legacy at all. Seems like a bad fanfic. I would not recommend.
 Missed opportunity for a new story. Unconvinced of the creative merit of using 'time' to rehash everyone's favourite characters.
 Super
 Was afraid this was going to be over-hyped fan fiction. Was pleasantly surprised!  Great addition to the wizarding world.
 As so many others point out, this book does not belong with the rest of the series.<br/><br/>I hated the rehearsal script format - it is not very fun to read. I could possibly forgive that if the book did not have these huge other flaws.<br/><br/>1. Main characters are nearly unrecognizable from earlier books<br/>2. Story does not follow the history accurately from earlier books<br/>3. Writing is not enchanting<br/>4. Plot holes are very puzzling and annoying<br/><br/>It reads like fan fiction by an author that is not that familiar with the Harry Potter series. If this is the way sequels will go, I am not buying any more in this series. I wished I'd stopped with book 7 so I would not have the bad taste in my mouth from Cursed Child. So sad, So bad.
 Like her other books this one does not disappoint the reader. Nice references to events happening earlier in Harry's life. These would help readers and play goers that are not familiar with whats happening present time. Keep on writing JK love your C. Strike mysteries too!
 Excellent
 I loved this script, and it was fun once again to enter the world of Harry Potter!  J. K. Rowling is a wonderful writer!!
 Loved the story but not the format.
 Gift fir birthday. Not read yet but she is anxious to get it. All her books are great. Beautiful cover.
 I am a big Harry Potter fan but this was so far out there plot wise that I didn't finish it. The writing was so-so.
 First, this does not have the magic of Rowlings books, it was still fun to read.  I look at it as a good piece of fan fiction.
 It's a little less exciting than the original 7-book series. Still a good read, but, a bit depressing. Good that it brings in real world issues though.
 Terrible plot, boring characters, poorly written. Felt like I was reading bad fan fiction. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
 It's a darn screenplay and I didn't notice when I bought it.
 The entire book was very short in length.  If I wasn't a Slowreader I could have finished reading it in an afternoon.  It needed to be much longer.
 I really liked this book.  However, readers need to understand that you are reading a play, so it doesn't flow like a novel.
 I liked the story but it was a little hard adjusting to it being a play. It started out sorta confusing but ended up being a short cute story
 Probably would of liked it better written as a book and not a play but over all it was ok.....not as good as the first 7.
 weak
 It wasn't anything spectacular, but it was kind of in to imagine how they all would turn out post-Voldemort. For me it wasn't all it was cracked up to be.
 A nice diversion from the previous novels.  However, the same characters you know and love are present and have grown and grown up.
 Not what I was expecting.  The book seems to jump around a lot and part of me not reading the complete description or understanding that it's even written in a play format.
 Loved this story. It has elements of book 3 which is thought by many to be the best one of the series. I wish there were more!
 The play did not warrant the anticipation I felt.  It might have been better as a book but it was not worth the effort it took to read the work.
 I didn't care for it. It just seemed like something Rowling had to write , but didn't really generate my interest. Disappointed.
 LOVE!!!!! A must for any fan, but keep in mind this is writeen differently (as a stage play). Brings back memories though!
 It is all here...every character we have been missing for years!! No spoilers but all Potter fans need to curl up and read thus in one sitting! Compelling ,amazing, and tear inducing!!
 Did not enjoy, and I am a real Potter/ JK Rowling fan. Hard to read a script, for one thing, but I also did not think that the characters, from the original series, were consistent IN character from that series
 A really bad book. Don't waste your money on this one.
 Average read, retread of stories already told on a more interesting read.  Not on par with original series.
 Nice follow up to the Harry Potter series. Easy read and flows well with all the previous stories. Any Harry Potter fan would like this book I think. Need more stories about the main characters.
 ok read.  not as good as the original potter series
 A little slow in the beginning. It got better later in the book
 Overall, not bad. However, it is nowhere near as good as the original 7 books. I think the biggest reason I did not care for it was in the writing of Harry Potter's character. I didn't like him. Harry was not a character I wanted to root for in this story, and that was disappointing to say the least.
 I refuse to believe J.K. Rowling had any hand in writing this mess. Like many have already said it reads like a horrible fanfiction. I’m going to try to forget I ever read this.
 The book made me nostalgic. I wish she would write more sequels
 JK does it again. Amazing whirlwind story.<br/>Loved every second of it!!!<br/>She has a way ok making me care so much for fictional characters.<br/>I can't wait for the play to come to the states
 I missed new adventures with some of my favorite characters.it's a bit difficult with text to speech listening, but I enjoyed it.
 let's face it: it's not a book and it was not written by JK Rowling. It's OK. I liked it, but it's not as deep as the other ones.
 Excellent read for those with a good imagination since it is not a book, but a play script. Would love to see the play sometime in the near future!!
 It's so darn good! Pleaseeee write more! It's absolutely amazing! You go girl! Harry potter is my all time favourite books! I got a first edition deathly Hallows too!
 I don't like the change of style...but I wanted the set of Potter books.
 I didn't feel like the charachters had the same depth as in the original series. I couldn't get attached to any of the new characters. And I would have liked to know a little more about Astoria Malfoy and how she managed to tame Draco.
 I liked the book but would have enjoyed it more if it was written more like a book instead a play.
 Didn't know it was so short and fast to read
 Well, I have to say, I'm kind of disappointed. I thought j.k. Rowling could do so much better. Harry Potter has been my life, and I was so excited for the new book. I am only a couple of chapters in and I am so sad. Can't say much more, because it will make me cry.
 Written like a play and can be difficult to read but the over all story is good. Not my favorite book but still a solid poece by JK.
 I choose five stars because it fits in with the first seven books nicely. Was great to see where their lives went. I so look forward to future books on tales about what the children get into and how Harry and Ginny and the rest of them handle the different situation. If they even know what the children get into!
 Not exactly what I thought it would be.  Not very interesting.
 Good book, definitely not like the originals.
 I didn't realize it was a book written for acting and I didn't enjoy it as much as I would've have the other way.
 I enjoyed the plot but I didn't like the format it was written in It was a stage play not a real book so I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would
 Excellent addition to the Harry Potter Series. Interesting character transition from the books to this play; as in the books, this play prompts the reader to imagine and develop an interpretation.
 I kinda wish this didn't exist. Feels like it calls into question so much of the HP world. Doesn't even feel like her writing. I wanted to love it...  but can't. It's fine.
 It was worth my time as a Potter fan.  As always, I find myself wanting more at the end of each story. She make me feel greedy!!!
 The book I got was in packaging that said 'made in china' and it was not the type of copy that you would find at a book store (e.g. Barnes and Noble).  The item seemed to be a boot leg version of the actual book.  The coloring of the jacket was different and didn't have certain pages.
 If you are looking for Harry Potter 8, this is not it. It is somewhat of a continuation of the series, but the feel of it is a bit different. I would have suggested that they take off the Harry Potter in the title of the book and called it something else to stir people away from their expectations. All in all, i really enjoyed it. I was a little hesitant to read it at first because of all the negative reviews, but i felt like the writers did a great job with this story. The set up and the pace is a little bit different from the original books because it's written as a play. However, after reading the book for 5 minutes, i was hooked. I read it in one sitting (it's not a long read). It wasn't a perfect book (it had its up and downs), but i thoroughly enjoyed it and was really entertained. Please note though that is not much of a story about Harry, Ron, etc.. It is a story about their kids. With that being said, it did also did a good job of revisiting old memories I had of Harry and his friends.<br/><br/>I am a huge Harry Potter fan and i think this was a great little spin off to the original story line.
 Super fan of JK Rowling, not a fan of the play format
 Great read. This was quick but took a chapter to get used to the screenplay style of the book.
 Felt like a bad fan fiction story. Yes I know JK Rowling didn't write it so it won't read like the rest of the books and yes I know it's just the script for the play bound and sold as a book all of that would have been fine if it had been written better.
 Harry Potter fans will want more! Was disappointed book was in play form. Would have liked to have seen more details. Story line was excellent!
 Brought back some memories. Not sure how much JK had to do with the writing, but it was intriguing and I couldn't put it down!
 If you liked the Harry Potter series you have got to read this book. Once you get used to the writing format you will not put it down.
 So cool I never thought I could get to read Harry Potter and the cursed child so this was a dream come true
 Pls be aware that this is written in the format of a script.  I would much prefer that it be written in prose format.
 This is a wonderful read. Don't get discouraged in the opening being redundant, it will soon carry you into new realms, and in a fresh new format.
 As a diehard Harry Potter fan I went into this book with an open mind and with modest expectations. I knew that it wouldn't be as good as the original 7, but I was not disappointed by any means with the product. It provided a sense of nostalgia to longtime Harry Potter fans while also telling a story worth any Harry Potter fan's time. I would recommend this book/script to anyone who enjoys Harry Potter!
 cute
 Our son enjoyed the book!
 great book amazing price
 I am a huge fan and I enjoyed the book
 It was poorly written and was  not written as well as the other Harry  Potter books.It looks J.K.Rowling lost her magical touch .
 I am a HP fan so I liked it. However, it wasn't as AMAZING as I hoped! Still worth the buy!
 The magic is lost in this play. For every bit as whimsical, creative, and sensical as JK Rowling can piece together the world of Harry Potter, this play is not. Too many unanswered questions and holes in the story. Don't spend your money on this disappointment.
 I didnt realize it was a screenplay. Great as usual and a perfect addition to my family's Harry Potter collection.
 Fun read for a potter fan
 You can tell it wasn't written by JK Rowling but I still enjoyed it.  Quick read and I hope to someday see the play.
 convoluted  to much jumping around  with that said - they ending of the story was a real eye opener  did not see that coming!
 While we're sure this will be a good play, it was a disappointing book.  It lacked the extra 300 pages of JK's incredible imagination and excellent sense of humor in most of the story.  Our family has lived and breathed the Harry Potter series for ten years and we did not enjoy this book, especially with the extra authors.  Can we please have the story published in a format not adapted for the stage?
 Don't bother.
 Love Harry Potter. This book closely followed the writing of the previous books once you get used to the play-type style.
 The plot was a surprise.  Some color missing because this was a script.  Cannot wait to see it..  Magic, on Stage!  WOW!
 I had high hopes and was excited to read.... started off and was intrigued but as it went on got very choppy. Forced myself to finish and while I enjoyed the concept and understand it's in play format just got overwhelmed by the lack of continuity.  Surely Rowling did not put much effort into this.  The concept was good but the road was full of potholes.  It seems like she fell into the trap of thinking anything will do so why put much effort into it.  RIP Harry Potter.  It was a good run but your story is done.
 What can I say? It's more Harry Potter.  It's in script format, but I'm finding it fun to read.
 I can only echo what many other reviewers have said here, and so I won't belabor the point...but I do wish now that I HADN'T read this book because it HAS tainted the originals for me, possibly irrevocably.
 Play format eliminates the backstory and character thoughts and emotions which were some of the best parts of the original Harry Potter series.
 I am.a big Harry Potter fan, but this book just sucked. There were so.many plot holes and don't get me started on what this book made out of all the beloved characters. This book never happened for me and series ended with deathly hallows
 This was not as good as the original series, but it was fun to revisit this world :)
 Excellent book I finished in less than an hour. I'm obsessed with HP though so I'm biased.
 The book was just as promised when it was promised. The book itself, however, reads like middle school fan fiction.
 I should have just gone to a local bookstore.
 Loved the story line. Recommend this to any Harry Potter fan.  Would have preferred it to be a story not a play but besides that it was very good
 I love the fact that this book goes deeper into the understanding of all of the main characters from HP books
 Great product - love it!
 The book is definitely a page turner. It could be made into a movie, as far as I am concerned.  My third time through was as good as the first. Thank you JK et all.
 I didn't like the story at all.
 This book was an interesting read but it did not come close to the original books.
 Its interesting but I would have rather waiting for it and checked it out at the library. I'm sure it'd be better as the play it was intended to be.
 Loved the read.
 Worth reading more than once didn't think I would like this writing style but I loved it couldn't put it down!
 Not a bad read but not up to par with previous books in the series. A bit predictable and then the ending was rushed.
 I was very happy to see J.K. Rowling wrote something about Harry and his son's life after his battle with Voldemort. I have mixed feelings about reading a script in book form, it doesn't flow smoothly and will be more difficult when I read it out loud to our grandchildren.
 Past reviews are correct when they say this reads like fan fiction. I would also add that the fan didn't take the time to get to know the characters well. The idea of the story's arc was compelling, however.
 this story was hard to read.  it felt like it  was only meant to give harry potter a hard time. i could have lived without reading this book.
 Love it
 Let me preface this with admitting that I'm a 26 year old who grew up with the Harry Potter novels and may have come into this with a bit of a bias. I understood that this was a script, and I realized that it was not written by JK Rowling herself, but rather as a collaborative work That being said, without seeing this play performed, it feels like absolute rubbish. It's possible that the story just doesn't translate well on page, but I doubt it. The flow is terrible, the dialogue is atrocious— which is really awful considering it's a script and therefore is nearly entirely dialogue. The characters are horrid; I can't believe a word of what they're saying. The tone and dialects are completely different from the novels. The original novels had a richness to them, in part due to the wonderful scenery described by Rowling. I can only hope that when performed, the play gains back some of that vivid imagery that made the books so immersive. Overall this read like a poorly executed bit of fan fiction, but I'll hold off on my final judgement until I've seen it performed on stage.
 It certainly reads differently than the previous novels (well, it's a play :D), but I enjoyed it exclusevely. Quite a new look on Harry, Ron and Hermione, inspiring new characters, and interesting plot. What else do you need to finish a book in one day?
 Dear J.K.Rowling, thank you for taking me back to my childhood! It's different book but it's still Harry Potter.
 I was hoping for more, but this read like fan fiction. Fans got what they wanted, but nothing new was added.
 Back to the future, harry potter style
 Reads like one of Rowling's books and is a pleasure to read.
 I'm a lifelong Potter head, and this book is not canon to me. Reads like fan fiction. You can tell JKR didn't write it. I'll see the play but don't recommend this book at all.
 Amazing, duh!
 Enjoyed being back in the wizarding world.  The element of time travel made the plot a little hard to follow. But it was entertaining nevertheless.
 Tough to really get into it as a screenplay. I used to love all the writing around the characters in the book.
 If you enjoyed the other books in the Harry Potter series, then you'll love Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. Don't let the fact that it is a Script scare you away; it does not feel like a script while you're reading. There is still as much magic and fantasy as in previous books in the series. Enjoy. I know I did.
 The story is great I loved it. However given that this is meant for a theater play it doesn't have the rich amount of details that JK Rowling had us used to. But as I said, the story is great!
 Be warned - it's in a screenplay format.  Great story and nice closeout to the Harry Potter series.
 This one explores the relationships between fathers and sons, as well as friendships. The story line does not disappoint the reader.
 I love Harry Potter but writing this as a rehearsal with the line was a mistake
 This play is great and i can’t wait to see it! I just feel like it was a disservice to the character of hermione to assume that just because she wasn’t with Ron she is a crabby mean spirited and unsuccessful woman.
 Excellent book, lots of changes in this book.  I wish there was a movie!!
 Once again JK Rowling has proven she is the fantasy master! Highly recommend for any die hard potterhead!
 My husband was so pleased with this book. He is such a harry potter fan, it was more than worth preordering.
 This book is a play, full of conversations with less background descriptions, explanations. I was a little bit afraid of this change, however it was just a little freak. The story starts exactly with the last scene of the Harry Potter movies; unfortunately the free sample could not reach the end of this part, but I can tell without any spoiling that the story is worth reading.
 I didn't think it would be so hard to read a script based book. Wow, so difficult...JK please turn this into a real novel like the others. Please
 Loved it what a great continuation of the Harry Potter novels. Can hardly wait until the next thing comes out!!!!!
 This story is okay but hard to follow because it is written like a play and I don't like that
 Great story! Wasn't really expecting it to read like a script rather than a novel but a chapter or so in and it was no longer noticeable.
 The story line could go on for generations...Harry Potter never gets tiresome.  Thank you for keeping the legacy alive.  Bravo!
 Was apprehensive.  A script to read?  The trio, but not my trio?  Get it- borrow it, buy it, listen to it or go see the play.  Just do it!
 I really did not like it. With all the other books they were more flowing. this one is not.
 Found it depressing and too complicated for children.  Who really wants to read about middle age Harry and friends and their sad lives.
 only 4 star because I like a book reading format not a script format.  I wish it came in a choice. so a little disappointed.
 Reading it in play format, script, took a little getting used, but another great story from J.K. Rowling!  Thanks for all you have given us!
 I wish this was an audio book too. I have the book itself and liked it. But sometimes it's nice to clean and have someone read to you
 I'm still reading it.  Its not like the other books, but still its another Harry Potter fix for those of us who just need more. ;)
 It definitely adds a twist to a lot of the what if questions that you probably asked if you read the series. Wish i could actually see it live, but this works!!!
 Not the same quality writing as Rowling at all
 Simply put, this is a transcript of a play. If you do not understand the medium, your expectations may be off.  The story captures relationship and provides a retrospective/reflective experience for the reader.  The true test of this content lies with the actors playing on stage. Haters are going to hate.
 Harry Potter and the Cursed Child Review<br/><br/>I'm really puzzled by all the negative reviews written about this great sequel to the Harry Potter series.  Many reviewers seem to feel that the play differs so much from the books themselves that J.K.Rowlings could not have really been very involved in its writing.  I COULDN'T DISAGREE MORE!  The story itself is wonderful and Rowling's involvment couldn't be more obvious.<br/><br/>I'll admit that initially I was a little disappointed by the fact that this story is presented as a script and not the usual novel format.  I'm not a great fan of reading scripts.  But within about 2 minutes I completely forgot about that aspect because the story is good...it pulls readers in...and the format itself is done so well that it doesn't detract from the story in any way.<br/><br/>Before I wrote my review I read many of the existing ones and did some research of my own to answer a few basic questions.  One of my top questions was 'how and why was Jack Thorne selected as the writer?'  I learned that he's a relatively young playwrighter and screenwriter who has already built up an amazing reputation.  The Guardian writes that "He's quickly establishing himself as one of Britain's most sought-after writers."  The Guardian maintains that his talent is unusual because "he's equally prolific in both theatre and TV."  And also that there's no doubt that "Thorne will achieve the first instance of a play text becoming a runaway No 1 bestseller. "<br/><br/>More importantly, Rowlings herself was the main reason Jack Thorne was chosen as the writer...her involvement in the selection and writing process is very easy to document via Google.  The last shred of evidence is included in her dedication at the beginning of the play manuscript.  Rowling's Dedication to Jack Thorne reads "To Jack Thorne who entered my world and did beautiful things there. —J.K. Rowling"<br/><br/>I also discovered that Jack became a first-time father while working on "Harry Potter and the Cursed Child."  His own Dedication, also in the beginning is to his newborn son Elliot Thorne who was born on April 7, 2016.  It was something I missed when I first read the play and I think knowing that adds an a personal element that's sweet.<br/><br/>Without revealing too much of the plot line, I think that this story does a remarkable job of continuing on from where "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" left off in the epilogue.  It answers questions about how Harry and his friend's families grew and evolved overtime as well as how he and his friends developed personally and in their careers. It's a compelling story exactly because everyone isn't how you might have envisioned them to be later in life.  It mirrors real life so well in this regard.  What our intended courses were versus what the real courses our lives have taken are oftentimes very different from each other.  It's puzzling to me why those that criticize the play don't understand this.<br/><br/>In reading the positive reviews I was struck by how many people wrote that they wished this story were longer...because I felt the same way.  Although it ended and closed well...I didn't want it to end.  And I do agree with some of the criticisms that mentioned there are too many characters who are left out of the story entirely...and who I'd like to hear more about as well.  But overall, I think this story was perhaps one of my favorites because it did a great job of not overemphasizing the negative 'dark' plot lines that can scare younger readers (or play attendees.)
 It wasnt as great as harry potter books lol but it was still good. I had trouble getting into The book but that mightve been bc its in play format other thn tht the book was ok
 The book was a fun follow on to the original series. Plot was fine if you like time travel stories of which I'm not a super fan. Kids were good change. Being as it was written in play form it is a short fast read. Pricy for what you are getting in terms of volume but worth it for content.
 I read the whole thing in one evening, but not because I was dying to see what happened next.
 Giving this book only 4 stars is probably the result of my not having ever read a screenplay edition before...it may also be that this wasn't only J.K. Rowling's work, but rather a cooperative effort. The story itself, dealing with Harry's son, Albus, might have been everything I'd hoped it would be, had it not been for the problem that, in my opinion, the writing did not hold true to the standards to which I have come to look forward with Ms. Rowling's work. Differences in writing skills aside, I tried to see beyond the inconsistent style, to the meat of the story.<br/><br/>Dealing with the relationship between father and son, Albus' rebellion against who he felt people expected him to be, as Harry's son, and his discovery that he was more like his father than he thought, does make for an interesting evolution of the HP saga. In this tale, however, Albus just seems more like a pouting, rebellious child who feels put-upon by having a famous father. Unlike Harry, he seems to lack the noble character of his father at first, preferring a pity-party over 'sucking it up and dealing with' his life.<br/><br/>Albus doesn't seem to have the soul-deep, innate sense of honour that defined Harry (not to mention thevery deep type of person he appeared to be in the last scene of Deathly Hallows, both in the book and movie), and yet the reader is supposed to just love the little guy to death, simply because he's Harry's son? The blurb of the book indicates that we are to feel compassion for this child who is finding it hard to fill his father's shoes, but I stopped feeling sorry for him early on, even though there were still times that I sympathized throughout the story.<br/><br/>There was very little in this book that "fit" with the HP saga, from the grown up versions of Harry and Ginny, Ron and Hermione and Draco and his family...oh, yes and speaking of which, what was with the very thinly veiled inference to Scorpius' attraction toward Albus? If you're going to have the character gay, be up front about it...or if he wasn't (he did have a crush on Lily), at least delve a little deeper into what that attraction actually was: admiration? envy? brotherly love (sure didn't seem that way)? or maybe just a preteen questioning where his psyche lies? Better yet, leave it out altogether, because all it did was detract from the side-story of a deep friendship developing between two boys whose fathers were, at one time, enemies.<br/><br/>Now, this sounds like I didn't enjoy the book, but in truth, I found a lot to like about it, even if it wasn't very J.K.-ish.. However, to agree with another reviewer, it just seemed more like fanfic. Had it followed the character of the characters more closely, and played true to what we HP fans already know about the wizarding world after around twenty years or so of visiting, through books and movies, the book could have been exceptional. As it is, it was simply a pretty good read, IF you'd never been introduced to Harry and the gang.<br/><br/>This should have been a GREAT book, but there was no justice done to it.
 This book was a disappointment overall. There were occasional moments that got me but overall this was a giant let down as I had so many high hopes for the book. This was a bunch of flat characters running around in a subpar plot line that overall was completely and totally underdeveloped. If this play was rewritten as a complete book with a fleshed out storyline and characters it might be a million times better. I wish that this had lived up to my expectations but unfortunately it did not. I should not be able to finish a true Harry Potter book in a mere three hours if it's truly fleshed out and developed like a true jk Rowling book should be.
 I’m a huge Potterhead. I’ll admit it. Rowlings stories continue to be magical, even twenty years after Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone came out. I’m sure I don’t need to go into the back story of Harry Potter for this review, because if you don’t know it, why the heck are you here?<br/><br/>Cursed Child takes place nineteen years after the events of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Harry, Hermione, Ron, and Ginny are in their forties, and have kids in Hogwarts. This book focuses mainly on Harry and Ginny’s second child, Albus Severus Potter. Albus is very unlike Harry: he’s in Slytherin, for one, and counts as his best friend one Scorpius Malfoy. Harry, being Harry, and Albus, being a teenager, butt heads constantly, their personalities pinging off one another like rocks colliding in midair. I’m not going to get into the plot very much (or really at all), as I can’t find any way to describe it without HUGE spoilers (and god, but I hate spoilers). Suffice it to say that we get to revisit some classic bits from the original series, as well as find out some new stuff about the Harry Potter Universe.<br/><br/>Now for the nitty gritty: the book is not really a book but rather a play, which is going on in London right now (though again, if you didn’t know that . . .). What that means is: this book is written as a play, with dialogue and stage directions but little else. I’ll say the dialogue is spot on. I think the authors (Thorne and Tiffany) did a great job of capturing the characters. The dialogue flows like Rowling wrote it, and you can easily hear the character in the lines. the bad part of this is: it’s mainly just dialogue. There’s none of the little wonderful extras Rowling would slip in between the lines, the depth of field that makes the Potter Universe so compelling and so real. I’m sure seeing the play live takes care of most of that (can’t wait!), but in the reading you feel a little bereft.<br/><br/>The adventure is fun and engaging. The duo of Albus and Scorpius are just as compelling as Harry and Ron. And it’s great to see how the characters we already know and love, not just the big guys but also Professor McGonagall, Draco Malfoy, and others have gotten on since we saw them last. Potterheads are going to love this expansion to the universe. My only wish would have been to have the thing rewritten into novel form by Rowling, but perhaps that’s just me being greedy.<br/><br/>Get more reviews by checking out my blog!<br/> ...]
 I liked it, but wanted the character development that the novels give.  Her writing is so thorough that it can never be truly expressed In a script.  Thank you for sharing your brilliant mind once again.  I'm grateful for any additional Harry.
 J.K. Rowling, John Tiffany &amp; Hack Thorne<br/>HARRY POTTER and the Cursed Child<br/>Arthur A. Levine / Scholastic<br/>Young Adult / Fantasy<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is not a novel. It is a play. The story is by Rowling, and was written by Rowling, Thorne, and Tiffany It is the eight Harry Potter installment, and premiered on a stage in London on July 30, 2016.<br/><br/>This book takes place some 19 years after the Deathly Hallows (Book 7). Albus Potter, the son of Harry and Ginny, is headed to Hogwarts. His biggest fear is the Sorting Hat. He does not want to wind up in Slytherin. Always at odds with his father, Albus knows he will never make it into Gryffindor. It is one more comparison to his father bound to deliver more disappointment.<br/><br/>On the Express to school, Albus befriends a boy sitting alone in one of the cars. Scorpius, like Albus, is plagued by the legend of his father. Although Harry's father was the Wizard of all Wizards--an impossible shadow to crawl out from under, Scorpius' father was the dreadful Draco Malfoy. No one likes him based on this fact alone, and the rumors that Voldemort might actually be his true father. No one, that is, except Albus.<br/><br/>When a Time Turner is recovered, a device allowing for time travel, the tale quickly spins out of control. Amos Diggory (who's son, Cedric Diggory -- the boy murdered in Goblets of Fire by Voldemort) wants Harry to go back in time and save his son; to make it as though the death never happened.<br/><br/>Taking it upon himself to make things right, to maybe impress his own father, Albus and Scorpius, team up with Delphi Diggory (Amos' niece), in an attempt to save Cedric from an untimely death. Their journeys back in time mess up the present. They change the future. Timelines cross.<br/><br/>The damaged caused may be too significant to fix. Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Draco Malfoy are desperate to save Albus, and Scorpius. They fear the return of Voldemort -- and the possible present world where Voldemort isn't just alive, but where he rules the world! Time is of the essence. If the newly revealed prophecy comes to light, the world that they once knew, and loved, would be gone, changed forever!<br/><br/>The play is taut. The Acts, and Scenes perfectly laid out. The story is filled with emotion. It is most definitely a tale about father's and sons. Parents and kids. Depression and hope. Division and reconciliation. The final Scenes brought me to tears. As a fan of the Harry Potter saga, it was amazing to see this story end where Harry Potter's legacy began. Very emotional. I would give anything to see the play. I suppose I will have to hope they make it into a film. I loved placing this finished book on my shelf alongside Rowling's other titles.<br/><br/>Phillip Tomasso<br/>Author of the Severed Empire Series<br/>Wizard's Rise<br/>Wizard's War<br/>Queens of Osiris
 Started out slow but gained interest as became more proficient in the format. Overall very enjoyable and followed the overall storyline.
 I love me some Harry Potter, I have read all of prior books and we have all of the movies, This book would have been GREAT if it was done as a book instead of a Play!
 Could this have been better? Absolutely. But really, it was still pretty good. Not as well written as the original series and lacking in depth, but a fun read nonetheless. Go in with your expectations set that this is going to be a completely different type of reading experience, and you will probably enjoy it.
 not as good as the original series. some funny characts. but harry seemed out og character sometimes.
 Enjoyable read.  Read by four different people with different points of view.  Everyone enjoyed the  book.
 This is a good continuation of the Harry Potter series, and I am wanting to read more and liked the variety in characters.
 This play gives a realistic approach to what it would feel like to be the child of Harry Potter. I am in love with this new generation of witches and wizards, and pray that soon we will read more tales featuring them.
 It was OK.  Not great.  It was not as good or exciting as the Harry Potter novels.
 A great read for those willing to read a play. Very fun story!
 The story line was just as good as her original works, but because of the play format I missed the depth from the novels that draws you into that magical world.
 Abysmal script, absurdly off canon. A daughter of Hermione and Ron a snob whilst Draco ' s son is destined for sainthood? Please. ..
 Reading the book you can definitely tell the writer is not the same. The plot was entertaining but it definitely isn't like the originals.
 The story was interesting...I guess.  I spent a large portion of my time reading attempting to justify all of the terrible decision-making done by the characters.  The dialogue seemed pretty terrible from the perspective of an avid Harry Potter fan.  However, I did read quickly through to the end, so I must have enjoyed it somewhat, right?
 Brilliant language, descriptive stage directions. Sometimes the references to the previous books were a little on the nose, but I can see how that's helpful to those who didn't read the original seven.
 The plot and storyline were good. The dialogue was emotionally cheesy. It didn't sell me as being realistic. I would recommend it to an avid Harry Potter fan but not volunteer to read it again myself.
 Read in two days - love this book, love Harry potter, love it all.  Please write more...
 I have found all of the Harry Potter books very good to excellent, and the author did not disappoint here.
 Holy moly that was a great read... any Harry Potter fan will be glued to this book from start to finish.
 I thought that it was perplexing and I finished it all in one day! I choose this rating because the book showed effort. What I disliked was that i didnt get to much info on the occupations of the weasleys, and most importantly LUNA LOVEGOOD!!! But otherwise i l-o-v-e-d it!😊😊
 Loved it! So sad that this is pretty much the end of Harry's story. I know she is still giving us a lot of stories and such from the entire Magical World, but Harry's story has been with us for so long - I don't want to say goodbye yet.  Thank you JKR for giving us this amazing world and people, it is something I will cherish dearly, always!
 Loved the revisiting of favorite characters and the introduction of new ones. Love the connection with parenting and characterization-Bravo! Thank you, Rowling!
 Play reads well can't wait for the Movie LOL
 I was disappointed in the presentation. It was a little confusing remembering back to a few of the characters. I also found it short in length. I was disappointed.
 I love Harry potter series. But this one is really dissappointing. Just a week after I bought it. I found 4 of the same book in goodwill for bargain. :D
 I thought this was the novel.  A play script lacks a lot of the graphic scenes the writer projects though descriptions and step by step laid out story flow.  Very hard to get in the mood.
 I really can't recommend this. I LOVE Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure I still have the series memorized because I re-read them so many times. I knew this wasn't "written" by JKR herself and I knew this was a script and not a novel. I was perfectly ok with both those things.<br/><br/>This book is bad Fan Fiction. Most of the characters felt terribly OUT of character, like someone was trying to force these characters into a specific plot but ultimately failed. I agree with other reviewers that it didn't make sense for Albus to be so clueless as to why people were staring during the Epilogue but now not only be totally aware of his father's "legacy", but resentful of it as well. I actually really enjoyed Scorpius' character - best part of the book, in my opinion, and I liked that Albus and Scorpius became friends. The rest is just not worth reading. If you really insist on reading this book, brace yourself of OOCness and predictability. The acting on stage may be fantastic, but you still can't sell me on this plot.
 This was simply beautiful. After years and Harry still learning; this next gen is great. So love this... wish there was more to it though.
 I was happy to have read this book as I'm a big Harry Potter fan.  I recommend this book for fans who enjoy this series.
 did not enjoy it being written a a play should of had more of an explanation in description
 Too depressing to read.  I simply could not buy into the major personality changes in the characters we came to know so well in the earlier books.
 With a piece this length character building cannot be as grand as a HP fan would like. Due mostly to this, during the first half a reader will find it hard to empathize with Albus. This will change about halfway through. The story is enjoyable and brings back several characters who have been missed. This was a great read. Recommend.
 I was pretty skeptical before reading this. I've come to love the Harry Potter books, and was bracing myself for a less-than-ideal sequel. I was very pleasantly surprised. Once I got used to the new format, this felt like a seamless continuation of the original series. I enjoyed it very much.<br/><br/>The characters are multidimensional and well-developed. Old friends from the previous books are brought in and out in a natural way, complete with the "baggage" of having lived and changed over twenty years, while the new, younger characters carry the plot line.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint is that I didn't want it to end. I finished it three days ago, and still have a longing inside for more!
 Hard to read as a play. however nice to see the old characters back in action!!
 My 11 year old son is a die hard Harry Potter fan. He re- reads the books frequently and casts spells often. He started reading the kindle version and then insisted that I take him to the book store because the version on his kindle certainly was the wrong one. He's convinced that JK Rowling had nothing to do with this book.
 Perfect
 So so.
 Great follow on to the original series. Picking up where we left everyone at the train platform and making a huge story about the second (and first) generation.
 I was so happy to get another chapter in the Harry Potter story, which was not predictable, but was immensely satisfying.
 Loved it...absolutely LOVED IT! It was not at all how I imagined it to be...it was much better. I would love to see this play.
 Excellent story. Loved it.
 Not the company, just didn't like the book.
 I had been avoiding reading this partly out of not liking to read plays (high school Shakespeare may actually be an unfair yardstick here) and partly because I have not liked any of Rowling post Harry Potter stuff.  BUt it was on Amazon for like $1 so I bit the bullet.  And then in true Harry Potter fashion I sat down and read it in one sitting.  It was truly a lovely story.  Harry and company have grown into adults with real important jobs and families, but have remained friends and famous.  The kids have started Hogwarts.  All is not well though. Harry and his son don't get along and then Harry's scar hurts for the first time in 20 years and creatures are moving in strange ways.  How can this be and what does it mean?  Harry learns some lessons as a man that would serve us all well to remember.  Lovely visit back to this wonderful world
 pooled ink Reviews:<br/><br/>Read my FULL review here:  ...]<br/><br/>Hmm…I’m honestly not sure how to review this…I will say that a script is only the foundation of a play. The words are important indeed but there is something so drastically changed when one sees a play performed compared to simply reading the words in the script.<br/><br/>Okay so why didn’t I give this book 5 stars and a raving review in all capital letters? Well…because it was just okay. While the writing is spotless as usual the story just couldn’t hold my interest (I think I read three or four books between starting and finishing this script).<br/><br/>Scorpius Malfoy is the best character in the whole play. I am forever a Scorpius fan. Albus Severus Potter, kid with the worst name ever, is an annoying angsty little git for 90% of the play and I just couldn't do it.<br/><br/>I’m not saying every story has to be profound or groundbreaking…but as clever as this story makes itself out to be, it sort of wasn’t. Perhaps it was all over-hyped. Perhaps if I had waited until all the excitement had died down I would have enjoyed it more. I’m not sure. Perhaps if I read it again in a year or two I will absolutely love it. Anything is possible.<br/><br/>Rowling is a very gifted writer and I bet this show would be seriously incredible to see performed live (like seriously, based off some of the loose stage directions in it I bet they have quite a few nifty tricks up their sleeves and the characterization that an actor brings to their role is really the magic that sells it).<br/><br/>OVERALL: I didn’t hate it but I didn’t love it. Glad I read it but I could totally have lived without it.<br/><br/>HARRY POTTER AND THE CURSED CHILD is stage play and a brave continuation of the Harry Potter novel series. An interesting look into the Wizarding World’s future that is best performed, witnessed, and experienced rather than simply read and scrutinized. Entertaining but not heart-pounding.
 It was perfect. It completed my set
 Purchase as a gift
 I was pretty disappointed in it.. I read it in 6 hours because I was committed, but even 10 pages into it I was bummed. Since it's a script format, you don't get the same experience as a true Harry Potter book. There's no magic, wonder, or imagination needed to create the setting. It's all laid out with italicized actions that the characters are supposed to do on stage. No one is true to character... it's just not the same and I'm skeptical how much JK actually contributed to this nonsense. My biggest complaint is that you can figure out the basic plot of it early on, so nothing really came as a surprise. Like, "oh I saw that coming from 100 pages ago. This is lame."<br/>I was excited for the new Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, but knowing that its in the same format I have no desire to buy it.
 A bit unrealistic at times. Yes, even for a HP book
 Loved the book.  Wish that th here was more Harry Potter to come.  Like many others I can't get enough of these stories.
 I enjoyed the book though it is a very quick read.
 If you're an HP super fan, skip this one
 J.K. Rowling ... enough said. Solid character development and expansion of the Harry Potter World
 Note that I haven't completed this book yet. I purchased this book knowing it was **not written by JK Rowling and that it is an **inspired fanfiction story. Please note that it is **written like a play script and does not read like a regular novel. The book picks up right at the epilogue of the last movie/book ends (19 years later at King's Cross station). So far the story is ok but you can tell it's fanfiction, so if you're expecting another Harry Potter masterpiece this may not be the book for you. I'm 82 pages in and they're already in the fourth year, so it moves quickly. I am a huge Harry Potter fan so I thought it was worth purchasing; ***however, I stress that this is fanfiction and is laid out as a play script!!
 Perfection! For full review, check out my instagram hashtag #EllenDoesBookReviews &lt;3
 The story was too short. Too many events took place in a short span of time. There should have been a separate book and play for this installment instead of a combined book/play. Not enough was written about the daily lives of these characters. Lot of important characters were missing from the story.
 ** spoiler alert ** Harry Potter and the Cursed Child reconnects with Harry Potter and the gang as they navigate adulthood, raise families and try to suppress a past that doesn't want to stay put.<br/><br/>There wasn't much that I disliked about this novel, except for maybe the fact that it was pretty short and a quick read due to the fact that it was written as a play script.<br/><br/>Otherwise, absolutely entertaining to read if you enjoyed the original series that J.K. Rowling produced. I loved that readers got a chance to continue on yet another adventure with Harry Potter and his friends, as well as watch their children experience some of their own adventures. Like father, like son.<br/><br/>Although Draco Malfoy was pretty much a prick throughout the original series, he actually shows that he's a human being with feelings in this latest novel. And, that his son is nothing like the monster Draco was in school. Little Scorpius "King Scorpion" is a wonderfully optimistic kid that seems to find the light in even the most morbid darkness even as he battles rumors of being a descendant of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named!!<br/><br/>In comparison, it was interesting to see how one of Harry Potter's children, Albus Severus Potter, seems to harbor a pessimistic, distant attitude having to live in the shadow of his father. While Harry may have pulled out ahead in his battles with Voldy, he demonstrated that he has a LOT to learn about parenthood ... thankfully, Ginny seems to have a good handle on it.<br/><br/>While I have heard varying critiques of the book being offered as a script, it's still a thrilling adventure that the reader gets to embark on. Yes, you don't get as serious detail with the script but if you are familiar with the previous books/movies, or have any amount of imagination that won't stop you from thoroughly enjoying this latest installment in the Harry Potter Series.<br/><br/>Worthwhile read for anybody seeking an escape from reality.
 Amazing, perfect, beautifully done.  I really can't say any more than that right now except - Thank you JK for bringing them back.
 It was good, but some of the magic of the series was missing.  I wanted to be as awed as I was by  Harry originally and it just didn't happen.
 Very disappointed that Rowling put her name on this. The story was terrible and they didn't represent the characters accurately. Waste of time and money.
 To be fair, you have to keep in mind J.K Rowling did not right this book. Secondly, it is the script for the play.... It's not meant to be a book like we are all used to.<br/><br/>The book was ok. If you've seen Butterfly a effect with Ashton Kutcher, you've read this book already. There is some small things that make you go hummm, but I'm going to call it what it is... It's fan fiction. It's meant to raise interest in the Universal Studios attraction and provide the rest of us in the world that can't go see the play a small tidbit to hold on to.
 I am a longtime stalwart Harry Potter fan. Here's a short list of points/criticism/things to consider.<br/>1. This was not written by Rowling. It is essentially a fanfic IMHO.<br/>2. Read this from the perspective that this is a screenplay, and knowing it simply doesnt translate from literature to screenplay. If you dont understand what I mean, read the screenplays of the other HP canon. You will see much is lost without the fullness of explanation.<br/>3. There's an incredibly convoluted plot of time shifting, which in a HP book or heck even a HP movie would be explained better by reading in a book or watching in a theater.<br/>4. The characters don't always act like themselves. For example, Snape would use Veritaserum to determine Scorpius' true motivations. There are other examples but they are apparent as you read along. That being said, some interactions are bang-on and well staged. It feels more legitimate, like Dumbledore's heartfelt interactions with Harry through his Hogwarts headmaster portraits.<br/><br/>All the minor inconsistencies, convoluted plot and lack of character development lead up to a read which is in the main rather disappointing. It touched on topics that were heartfelt, but the playwrights couldn't seem to decide if it was character driven or plot driven. Overall, it might make a passible play, if it was full of audience impact. An interactive experience counts for a lot in that medium, and might go a long way to help clear up the confusing scene changes and plot twists. However, the book as it stands does not adequately introduce its new characters and truly make you care about Albus or Rose. Moreover, the canon HP characters were sort of placed into the play as if we should just know them -- bad form, even if we do, because then you don't even care about the new world order under the Dark Lord.<br/><br/>In summary, this could have been done much better. Although I will reserve final judgement until I can see the play, for now I am merely saddened by the lack of attention to detail.
 Granddaughter thinks it's great.
 Just like other novels in the series. I read it twice enjoying it throurouly both times. I highly recommend this book.
 Quick read and good book.  I liked the way it was written - like a play.  The characters didn't disappoint.
 I’m sure that the play is great, but this is just okay to good.
 Someone simplistic, don't feel it developed the background well but was an easy read and a fix for my Potter-world needs
 Fun easy read. Enjoyed reading it as a screen play. It was interesting and able to pause in between Acts.
 This is an amazing story that was so much fun. My wife and i read out loud together and we were riveted the whole time. Anyone who doesn't like this book is no real Harry Potter fan.
 Don't get much of a feel of Harry Potter, It's a play and not all that interesting.
 The story was good, but I didn't like the format.  Not as complex as previous Harry Potter books.  Predictable.
 Product was as promised.
 I haven't read a HP book since when they first came out.  This took me right back to that magical place.<br/>Once I got used to reading the play format, it was just as immersive as the books were.
 I wish it was in a audio format. I feel it would be awesome audio book if it was recorded like the play with  different voices playing the roles.
 I didn't not know this was a play when I purchased this. It's a bit hard to read if you are not used to scripts.<br/><br/>The characters are familiar so fans of the series will enjoy seeing them grown up and finding place in the new wizard world.<br/><br/>Story had a couple good twist but the end was what I expected.
 I am a huge fan of the series. This book felt to different. It did not have the same style and emotion as the originals.
 Bought as a gift, but she loved it.
 Great book.
 When you can travel back in time, it is not always for the best. This book keeps you going on what's next. Good read.
 Bought for a twenty-eight year old child who read all the other Harry Potter books. He says it's very good.
 Excellent look into Harry's life 19 years later. Some surprises but a well done wrap up to the journey! I hope they make this a movie as well but only with the original cast please!!
 Was introduced to Harry on a CNN review on the radio.. Immediately ordered it for our 2 grandsons. It became a family tradition...bought every other book through the years and saw each movie. When we read the last book, I wanted to go on to follow the characters, married, with their own children. Looking forward to the full Kindle new book. Welcome back Harry and Friends!
 It's written like a play. Makes it stupid for reading.
 Was not expecting it to be a play. I read about three pages and got bored.
 Seriously, how many times can you recycle the same plot? In the next generation too? Disappointed
 Once you get past the quasi fan fiction beginnings, it'll warm and break your heart at the same time ⚡️
 So very happy with this order! It came much earlier than expected and everything was in perfect condition - just like I bought it out of the store. Highly recommend.
 The book is a script for the theater. I am a great fan of Harry Potter's books. This story is very interesting, but could be better developped. As a film, or a play, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child shall be a great success. I missed the depth of former books.
 It's not a book, per se, but a screenplay. That being said, the story is okay but there's not much new and the dialogue is not up to par with any of the other books.
 Phenomenal!! The way the authors combined the characters and moments from the original books  along with the new character was amazing. This screenplay is a worthy addition to the previous seven books. Well done.
 Not a normal Harry Potter novel. It is written as a screenplay. I did not care for it. Others may.
 Wow, this book was a major disappointment. I, like almost *everyone* else reading this book, have been a Harry Potter fan for many years. This was just awful. It really seemed like bad fan-fiction. At least it was a quick read.
 It's a book, wife bought it. I got sex win-win.
 I really liked how this was written. Wanted more. I can't get enough of Harry Potter. He grew up to be a great wizard!
 This Book is Amazing!! Anyone reading the Harry Potter Series will feel complete reading this one! It has thee same passion that you see reading the other books and it'll touch your heart as I touched mine. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child Part One and Two is Truly Brilliant!
 Enjoyed the continuation of the Harry Potter world but would have preferred it as a book where the characters thoughts could be more fully explored.  But overall it was good.  Read it quickly - didn't want o put it down.
 Unfortunately, it’s a screenplay. The emotion comes from within the actors. So, as a straight read, it is impossible to match the novels.
 I soooo wish this was a movie or that I could see the play! Maybe someday! Thanks, J.K., for another fantastic read!
 Really can't get past it being a script.  Give me traditional Harry Potter, I'll read the originals again.
 interesting read in play format.  But once I got started it was absorbing.
 reads fast.  large text.  I wanted it to go on and on, but i read it in a day and i'm a slow reader.
 The HP fans in the house were eager to read the last book.  A light and quick read!  Can't say anything bad as I am a true fan!
 Such a disappointment
 Very hard to read as it just seems off. Feels almost as if it is a parody. I was forcing myself to finish the book instead of enjoying it as with the original seven books.
 this is a screen play---as such, it's a bit off kilter from typical novel but story was good...
 As usual, very enjoyable story about the Hogwort adventures.
 Very good story telling. 4 stars is due to complete rehashing of old plots.
 What a delight to read. It took me back and the characters were all true to what I remembered. Sad that it ended. LOVED!
 Like every other story in the HP world, it left me wanting more, more, more!
 It failed to capture "Harry Potter"  very disappointing a waste of money
 wish it was printed like a book instead of a play haven't been able to finish it because of that
 I feel bad leaving only 3 stars but I feel as though this book opened a can of worms and it's obvious Rowling was working with others to write this as the characters are completely different people.
 I don't have a problem with the script format... Fun, but the story is definitely not up to par with the original books.
 Loved it. Wish there was more if only J.K.R. Would keep writing potter books...this is the best escape from reality.
 Both plot and story line move much slower than the Harry Potter series.
 I was expecting more detail in the story like the books but I guess that is the down fall of a script.
 I liked it much better than I thought, based on what I had read about this book
 It was awesome to get back into the HP universe and see some of the characters again, but I wasn't impressed. The characterization of a lot the original characters felt off &amp; the entire plot was confusing
 JK Rowling's has not lost her magic.  My favorite Potter book is still The Half Blood Prince, and this one is a close 2nd.  For all the same reasons.  The insight into what made others besides Harry, Ron and Hermione tick and even though this is a fictional magical world, we all relate to awkward teenagers and difficult interpersonal relationships.  Loved every second of it.
 An utter disappointment. Completely jumped the shark from the original books. Felt like a really written fanfic.
 Was a very good book. Not exactly how I thought Harry would be. Some surprises and twists. Worth the money.
 Wish it was an actual novel instead of a script. Despite that, it was a solid story with good characters and would have been a worthy successor to the original Harry Potter books if it was a novel.
 The book/script was very well written. However, there was little magic, little action and just didn't feel Harry Potterish. The plot  was boring and some of the lines felt very predictable. The story was  somewhat predictable. I am glad I did not buy the book. The younger age group might enjoy it.
 Reading the story as a script makes a new way of reading Harry Potter.
 Reading a script is more challenging than reading a book but as I got into it, I was able to follow easier. Would enjoy this concept being made into a movie and the original characters would be old enough to still play their parts
 We are only on the first chapter, although the print is SO tiny, I am not inclined to pick up the book.  I am a young Mom and need a magnifying glass to read this book with my son?!
 Great!
 I love all the Harry Potter books, but this does a disservice to the series. The story is written as a play. It is disjointed and never actually builds into anything interesting.
 I wasn't sure where this book was gonna go, but I was pleasantly surprised! I did like the fact that this book  started where it left off. The only bad thing I would say is that I wish it could be made into a movie, or at least offer the theatrical version in the States! Specifically Chicago!
 Ugh, I couldn't even get halfway through this book. It read like a bad fanfiction. I ended up putting it down and reading actual good fanfiction instead.
 Great read. It’s a must read after the Harry Potter books.
 It's a gift for my granddaughters. They reread the whole series and are just starting the new one. They seem to very happy with it, so that makes me happy!
 Great copy and the artwork is beautiful. Very quick read and I'm excited to see the play.
 Disappointing. I'd have hoped this would have been made into a book instead of a screen play. JK owes her fans a REAL book...
 Sorry, it's just really terrible. It reads like bad fanfiction and then takes a dump on everything you know and love from the first 7 books (i.e. the real series.) I was lucky to get more than $3 selling it to half-price. If you like anything about Harry Potter, DO NOT READ.
 I am a big Harry Potter fan. I just couldn't get into this. I guess reading a script just isn't my thing.
 Big Potter fan! I love reading plays so this was a delight. Hope to see it performed in the states some day!
 As usual her books are very hard to put down. It was up to the usual highstandard
 I knew it was written as a play so I thought it would be weird but the more I read the more I wanted to read. I wish it was longer and I didn't like the ending. I hope a movie is coming soon!
 What a cash grab on the Harry Potter brand. This is what we have been waiting for. This is garbage
 Hope we get to read more about our two newest hero's in the future.  Keep writing and providing joy for your millions of followers
 I will give it 3 stars even though I was very disappointed. It does have the name Harry Potter on it, so it had big expectations to fill, which in hindsight was probably not fair. I wanted to love this, I really did. But it just reads as predictable and flat. Perhaps it would have likely been a much better novel.  I didn't find myself connecting with the characters, rooting for or against them. I just couldn't get into it. It really does read like a poor fan fiction. I had hoped for more following  such a long wait. JK, please don't pawn off your story anymore, it'll be the death of it.
 I did not enjoy this book, which was not truly written by JK Rowling and is an unfinished / pre-version of the play's script. It was poorly designed and non-descriptive.
 I bought it for my son who is in middle school he is reading it now and says he likes it he read all the previous boks
 Not sure about this one book?...
 I have read all 7 of j.k rowlings harry potter books and it doesnt seem like she wrote this at all. Also, this should have been made into a story instead of a screenplay like the end of book 7 made me to believe.
 It's a Harry Potter Book by JK Rowing. What's not to like?
 It was a very great read. I love the style of script reading, and was very pleased with the story line. However, I wish it provided more detail throughout the story like all of the other Harry Potter books. I still give this a 5 star rating because who doesn't love Harry Potter! Can't wait to see if more stories will be written as I will buy them as well. Very great book!
 This was literally the worst thing I've ever read. Please don't read it.
 I felt like they tried too hard to make Harry's son not too much like Harry. Overall a good read.
 Not what I was expecting...but I got into it eventually.
 Our son wanted this book in order to complete his set of Harry Potter books. He's happy!
 It was good...but not her best.<br/>I did not like how Harry was portrayed as an adult.  Rowling needs to stick with writing solo.
 When this was announced I was equal parts thrilled and terrified. I was thrilled and the idea of seeing what the Wizarding World had been up to since the epilogue of Deathly Hallows, but was terrified that this would become just another cash-in sequel like so many other franchises seem to do these days. I should have known better than to think Rowling would tarnish her creation by simply cashing in. What's been released is an exciting, well crafted extension of the original 7 novels that, in some ways, fixed some of the issues I had.<br/><br/>Without saying too much, I really loved this. It is not entirely perfect, but it is damn near close. The play format took a second to warm up to (I haven't read a play since college) but once I got up to speed, I felt like the format actually worked better than expected as it allows so much of the reader's own imagination to fill in the gaps that would otherwise be descriptions in a prose novel. Because of the play format, the pacing is a bit different than in previous stories, but again, it works quite well. The amount of story told between these covers is larger than I'd ever anticipated. And though the pacing maybe lend itself more towards theater, this is a Rowling story through and through. Do not worry that working with two other writers may have watered down the J.K.-ness of this tale. There is no question that this up to par.<br/><br/>I cannot wait for a full production of this to hit the States. With so much action, magic, heart, and visits from characters and locations both new and old, this is sure to be a hit.
 Great book/screenplay; not finished yet, but I love what I've read so far!
 my wife read it and she loves it!
 There's not much left to be said. I gave it a try, assumed complaints were because of the format. It's just real bad and contrived.
 not my favorite of the Harry Potter books but very interesting.
 I really enjoyed it. A different format, but I couldn't put it down. Read from cover to cover in one day
 Keep in mind that it's a book written in stage/play format.<br/>As far as the rest of the HP books go, it's not very good.
 Nephew finished in 2 days...loved it.
 Who doesn't love Harry Potter?  Pre-ordered for my daughter and she loves it!
 I had higher expectations for this book.  I have read the whole series again when I heard this book was coming out.  I understand this is a play so I should have not expected the detail that I found in the others.
 Let me clarify. 3 stars means I enjoyed this book (play). But being such a huge fan of the original series (I read them all 5 times) it dwarfs in comparison. Still enjoyable read and nice to dive back into the wizarding world of Harry Potter!
 Every change of time presents differing outcomes.  Several good subplots.
 Reading a play is different than a novel, but still transported me to another world.
 Written as a play, this new addition to the wizarding world of Harry Potter was slightly disappointing. It was easy to read and the plot was close to interesting enough, but I was never able to get past how much it read like fan-fiction rather than the masterful prose I expect from J.K. Rowling.<br/><br/>There were plot holes to try to disregard, overly emotional scenes, familiar characters brought up only to have their memories sullied. While at first it was nice to have new Potter material to read, I wish I could obliviate myself, and erase all memories of this play from my mind.
 Loved it.  Rowlings writing is so superb that you actually see what is happening.<br/>Tried to get tickets in London to see the actual play but they are sold out thru December 2017.
 Rowling didn't wrote it, what else can I say? buy it at your own risk. Maybe the live play is better.
 Love J.K., hated this book and everything about it. It reads as if a high school kid wrote this for an English class.
 Wish it wasn't written in play format, BUT now I really want to see this made as a movie!!!!!!!
 Loved this book - great addition to our Harry Potter collection!
 Enjoy all the books
 The book is written in play dialogue form, which I found to be tedious to read. I did not realize this when I bought the book. Furthermore, the book recycles old events from past books to create a newly contrived story.  I was really looking forward to reading this. The events are confusing in nature and so are the sequences. It jumps from one time period to another, and from one event to another. It twists the story events from the past of the other books into something that is not traditionally Harry Potter at all. I am disappointed.
 This would be better if it was in more of a book form not a play form.  But I still liked the book. I am very glad I read it.
 Any hardcore fan of Harry Potter---heed my words!!!  Do NOT read this book!  It is as bad as, and indeed worse than some, fan fics I have read of Harry Potter over the years.  Not only does it play fast and loose with the characters' traits (Harry is a jerk/Hermione the Minister of Magic???/Ron runs Fred and George's joke shop?!), but it plays loose with established rules of magic in the Harry Potter universe.  Towards the end, one character mentions the possibility of brewing a Polyjuice Potion in under a day.  Anyone who knows the books well knows that it takes a MONTH to brew Polyjuice Potion.  Am I being a little too demanding?  Perhaps.  But J.K. Rowling wrote the original seven books, she did NOT write this.  Please note:  J.K. Rowling did NOT write this!  She and two others came up with the story, and then one of them wrote the actual play.  That's another point:  This is not a book.  Don't expect Rowling's descriptions and turn of phrase---all of it is mostly dialogue as it is in play format.  This will make a lot of people unhappy.  It does not gel well with the other books.  It also, quite literally, re-writes Potter history.  Plus, the dialogue is cringe-worthy:  "Draco:  Hermione Granger, I'm being bossed around by Hermione Granger.  And I'm mildly enjoying it."  Ack!!!  Is this supposed to be flirting?  Or what?  It is so awkward and cringe inducing that it makes the plot almost secondary.  Almost.  The plot does what the third book only dreamed of:  rewrite history, again, and again, and yet again.  It was enough that, even though I loved Rowling's 600+ page books, this mere 300 page book had me looking for the end.  In short, don't waste your time!  You'll regret it, because it will color your experience with the Harry Potter universe overall.
 Just when I thought I would never get anymore Happy Potter, I discover this gem. Thank you J k Rollins! That is all I can say.
 I love all her books
 Fun to see Harry Potter characters again. Not as good as the original (in my opinion) but I still loved it for what it was
 Once one gets used to the play format, this is actually quite a very smooth read.  Bringing back beloved characters from the Harry Potter septology, and expounding upon briefly mentioned or entirely new ones, with all the wonders of magic and wizardry, this is a worthy addition to any HP fan's shelf.  However, the story felt a bit 'tacked on' - squeezing another drop from the septology's plot, a bit contrived in its twists and turns.  I do quite like the ambiguous title and the sense of mystery throughout; how does the title apply?  Who is it referring to?  In the end, it's still nicely unclear, with more obvious candidates and more subtle suggestions.  Another thing that bothered me, however, is that the returning characters seemed rather.. out of character.  Typical speech habits, patterns of behavior, and even seeming personality traits have been lost or replaced.  This may be a side effect of the story being told pretty much entirely through dialogue, but none of the characters feel fully developed by the end, and the whole thing felt rather like fluff, like decently written fanfiction rather than Rowling's usual intense style (though of course she was not the sole author of the script).  I did find myself rather amused by the occasional descriptions of characters' behaviors, and bemused by descriptions of magic performed or experienced, wondering how on earth they managed to pull that off on stage.  Perhaps someday a video recording of the play performance will be released, and the story will feel a lot more immersive taken in its intended format.
 LOVE IT!!!!
 I was unsure at first of how I would like this, but to my surprise I really enjoyed it. It is the perfect balance of the old and the new coming together. With the heartfelt moments just adding to the story. It truly is a good read.
 It wraps up the series nicely. Not sure it can go much further but what a wonderful story. Read it.
 I loved all of the Harry Potter books and hoped that this would be a continuation of those.  That is not the case.  I wouldn't reccomend this as a continuation. I was disappointed.
 Some dialogue and plot components were flaky. The plot wasn't as well thought out as the original books. Harry, Albus, and Adelphi are interesting characters, but none of the others have any character development- I suppose you can only squeeze so much into a play.
 Was not what I expected. Could have been longer but it was pretty good. #worth
 It was awesome! It was a great story, with several plot twists, definitely good for those who've read the Harry Potter books. I wish JK Rowling made it a novel, but the script was interesting to read
 Son was excited to get and read this book as he is on a Harry Potter kick!
 The title didn't do it justice.Great book, would re-read.  Make more like this jk rolling. Wonderful book will recommend to friends.
 Bought for my daughter - she loved it, but could see how sme people will not like the script format
 It's been way to long ! Such a good book. A must read
 I was hesitant for a minute about reading a play. Then I bought it.<br/>It was great.!
 It's obviously not going to compare to the original book series, but it's still a very fun read.  Bringing so many of the characters back is something I've been craving for years.  It's entertaining, even if not entirely original.
 Would love it to have been a real book rather than a script, but then the movie will be totally awesome!  Thank You, JK, for continuing the Potter saga!
 full of fan service and nostalgic bits and pieces, I love it. i was a kid again.
 Good read! Once you get over the format of it being a play it's a fast read! I don't care for the play format but still worth reading if your a HP fan
 super.
 Got for my teen.  Loved it and craves anything Harry Potter related to read especially.
 This story brings back nostalgia from the original series but the plot does not build on any details or background and seemed to jump from one idea to the next without reason. Hopefully fantastic beasts will be better because this is nothing like the original Harry Potter besides the characters.
 I waited so long for this book and it didn't disappoint! I just wish it were longer!!
 Somewhat disappointing.  While there were a few plot twists, it really was not the quality that I expected.
 This is one of the worst things I have read in a long time.  It is poorly written.  I can't believe that the same person wrote the Harry Potter series.  I am sorry I actually paid for this.  I do not recommend it.  It is a waste of money.
 I enjoyed reading this book. It is different type of genre than I normally read. The theme and characters remained consistent as the other books before it.
 I am a huge Harry Potter fan and I loved how this picked up right where the last book ended.  I missed a little of the vivid descriptions that the other books had.  You lose that a bit with a stage script, but I loved it enough that I really want to see this on stage!
 Bought this to complete the Harry Potter set.  It will be hard reading for our grandson as it is written in play form.
 Enjoyed the story line.  Misses the characters from the first books but as always her writing keeps you hooked. Couldn't put it down until the end.
 not as wonderful as the earlier HARRY POTTER books, I was disappointed .
 I mean, it's Harry Potter, need I say more?<br/><br/>Great story and love the storyline.  Finished in 2 days!!
 I loved this play. I thought it was a great addition to the series even if JK Rowling didn't write it. Scropious is hilarious!
 I still haven't finished it. Doesn't keep my attention and I find the characters I loved very annoying.
 Engaging. Exciting. I want to see this in person. Definitely captures the "Potter" magic.
 It doesn't feel like a full book. Maybe a short story. It does feel like Harry Potter though and that's enough to get you through it. It's fun enough and a quick read. For diehard potter fans only though.
 I loved that it was Harry Potter. I hate that it was a play that skipped over a lot of things. HP fans must read at least to know how our Heroes turned out.
 I wanted to like this play. I've been waiting forever it seems. I'm a pretty dedicated Harry Potter super fan, so when this was announced, I was pretty dang excited! I pestered my poor boyfriend for months to buy it for my birthday, and now it's just a huge letdown.<br/><br/>First off, I WANTED to like it. J.K. Rowling is a queen, but she didn't write this. I highly doubt she was even involved with this. She couldn't have been. The writing was terrible. TERRIBLE. Words and actions were so out of character for our beloved childhood heroes. (I understand this is a play, but I don't think the characters would talk the way they did or act the way they did in the play). Also, Ron was too much comic relief for me. He's typically the comic relief in the series, but he was completely over the top (at least from what I could tell). I'd like to see the play to make my final decision for him.<br/><br/>The plot was awful. It was like the actual author (Jack Thorne) discovered all of the weirdest fanfictions ever conceived and spun it into this terrible web of a plot. It was completely unbelievable and I am so ticked off. Plus (SPOILER ALERT) I can believe Voldemort had a child, but did she have to be such a "perfect" character (Mary Sue, in other terms)? She had no flaws (other than being a villian) and really no substance to her character. Actually, none of the characters had any real substance and all seemed a little flat to me. I understand, however, that this is a play and that emotions and actions being conveyed are probably better seen on stage. But Harry especially seemed out of character and that bothered me quite a bit. He's always been a bit of an idiot at times, but I have a difficult time believing he would tell his own child, "I wish you weren't my son." That is very un-Harry like. I know that's integral to the plot, but still.<br/><br/>Again, I'm disappointed. I wish this play had never been written and I'm still in disbelief J.K. Rowling allowed this plot to happen. This is the first time that Harry Potter has ever let me down and I love the Harry Potter series so much. I'm hoping that Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is not the gigantic let-down this play was.
 booo and sadness from a hp fan for forever.
 I really liked this book because it had so much detail and was not very confusing. In my opinion it is better than the other ones
 I hated that was in the form of a play and put it down
 The book format was great and the font was perfect. The story line is great and I am just waiting for jk Rowling to write the whole book!!!
 I have done both so I enjoyed it.  It is NOT like the books or the movies by JKR.  It's more like a fan fiction. I liked it.
 Good
 Loved it! I am also a huge Harry Potter fan!
 I knew it was a screenplay, but I can't help but imagine what a fan-freaking full-length book it would have been!
 Loved that is followed the original story line, but HATED the play layout!  No room for the usual detail and hard to focus on and get the in depth feelings as before.  VERY disappointed!!!
 She's making money on a play script  disappointing
 Excellent..did nit think i would like play form..i was wrong.
 Very good product. I am not rating it with 5 stars because I was not expecting a hardcover with a separate paperboard, for me this is a little disappointing because I was expecting very high quality on this product.
 Harry, Harry, Harry...your son is a brat! The story dragged at times. Ron is a minor player, Hermmi is a strong character but lacks decision making. Gennie is a shadow of herself from the movie. The story could run in an endless loop time and gain.
 I hate what they did to my beloved characters.
 Thought it was a nice follow up to the HP series, set after everything had transpired.Harrys' young son with his struggles to find his own identity and the developing friendship.
 Very good! Loved it! Harry Potter will always be a classic.
 You can tell Rowling didn't play much of a part in the creation of this.
 Too bad it was in the form of a play and not like the previous books.  Nevertheless worth reading.
 Its a shame that the end of Harry Potter was this play.  prior works were very well written with many dimensions in the writing. this was very one dimensional and reminds you of Mel Brooks comment " the quest for more money" a sad ending.
 My friend read this before me and she loved it
 This was an amazing book! Loved the way it read and now I'm hoping a movie will come out of this.
 Was a good read, but not as good as the originals. Felt a bit list at times. However I did enjoy the format.
 Didn't enjoy reading it as a play but the story line was good.
 Nice
 I can't even finish this. I'm only 37% through. The plot is awful, the characters are completely flat. This is NOT how I pictured these characters ending up. I don't want to know how this warped Harry Potter universe plays out. As another reviewer noted, this is more like a really awful fanfic.
 There were so many things to love about this play. I really enjoyed how the characters react to each situation and how their past has influenced them. I definitely feel this is a much different story than the Potter books and does truly feel like some sort of fanfiction, but that hardly means that it shouldn't be taken seriously. There are plenty of laughs to be had and emotional scenes that bring tears to my eyes.<br/><br/>Spoilers below this line.<br/><br/>I love the friendship of Albus and Scorpius and I love the fact that Harry and Draco were able to come to an understanding. I love that hate did not perpetuate into the next generation. Draco's love for his son and his determination to do the right thing and fight the good fight is the Draco I so wished for at the end of Deathly Hallows. I wish a little bit more would have been explained about how the time turner's worked. I understand that they worked according on what location you were in but how did they set what time period they were going back to? I love that we got to visit again with Dumbledore and Snape. I really don't understand the whole Belatrix and Voldemort thing since the trio did not notice that Bella was pregnant when she tortured Hermione at Malfoy Manor. Plus, the thought of Voldy getting it on with anyone kind of gives me the heebie-jeebies! Overall, I really enjoyed the story and I will think of it as canon but it will never be able to replace the previous seven books in my heart.
 The book it's self was perfect, but I ordered it months in advanced and was supposed to get it a week earlier then I did.
 Though the story took a twist that slightly disappointed me I soon realized it was the same stuff that got me on the edge of my seat in all the other books. I wouldn't have it any other way. If you our Harry Potter fan you will love this story as well. I hope the saga continues cause as the battles are won and lost the war wages on.
 JK Rowling is an absolute genius.  I loved reading this book almost as much as the first 6 books.
 After some initial adjustment to the writting style, it does not dissapoint as a harry potter story.  It doesnt knock your socks off either, however.<br/><br/>I will go see this performed, somehow somewhere.
 LOVE IT!!!
 Thought it was great that it was the original play manuscript.
 A fun quick read in playwright style. Very entertaining story.  It was fun to have the characters all grown up.
 I haven't read it.  I purchased it by mistake.  I wanted the actual novel not the play script.
 Nice story line and keeps you on edge from start to finish. The ending is a great way to finish the story
 Didn't really expect anything other than a great story from Rowling! Loved it!
 I loved it and as. Parent it helps to see who still are the biggest influences in our children's lives
 What can I say ... It's Harry Potter.  I actually enjoyed it even though it's in play format.
 Disappointing. Ghost written?
 Great
 Amazing book, crap shipping.  The book is great but was two days late and was a beat up copy, probably due to the fact it came in an envelope.
 Nice return to the future and the past of the world we all love and the characters we care for.
 Was really looking forward to another book in the Harry Potter series this screen play was too short . It was good read but I wanted more.
 neat story - hard to read as a play (for me) but really enjoyed the next generation characters
 For a play it's fun writing. It isn't a book, so keep that in mind when and if you decide to get this almost eighth part to the Harry Potter novels. Having the play focus on characters other than Harry Potter, allowed for depth in characters who were more by-lines in the novel.
 I loved it! Great continuation of the series. This script identifies with the original audience by following us into adulthood, and if we’re lucky (depending on your views), parentage.
 I think I had unrealistic expectations for this. you just can't go into the level of detail in a screenplay that you can in a novel.
 The book is so easy to read that you can easily do it in a day. The plot overall was meh, kind of like reading someone's fan-fic on Tumblr. Enjoyable because it is the characters that you know and love, but once you get past the nostalgic feeling halfway you realize it has a great backbone to the story and not much else, even for a play.
 A great follow up to the previous saga. I was a little doubtful at first knowing this was a rehearsal script, but it really reads and feels like it's a novel, you get sucked in until the end.
 Good
 Love the book. Do not love the format. But hey, it's Harry Potter!
 I don't like the script writing like it's a play, but loved the story line!
 The play was well written. A good read. A great continuation of the Potter Mania that we love.
 it is write as a play in Acts. It was good but a little weird ready it as a script for a play.
 Loved the 7 books, but I just couldn't get into this script. Plot and beloved characters didn't feel authentic.
 I love all the stories of Harry Potter
 All in all takes a while to get used to the play style writing, lacks the in depth text the Harry Potter books contained leaving lots to the imagination. It's a nice story but just seems to open doors for future books and didn't have any new concepts. A nice read for a Harry Potter fan all in all.
 I gave this as a gift to a teenage boy, and he was extremely happy to receive it. Thank you!
 I would ave preferred a novel. To me a play script was a major let down. Disappointed !
 The book was in new condition. However the story was a disappointment.
 The story is ok, but I prefer book format to play.
 The screenplay format was a little difficult for me initially, but after the first chapter, I was happily swept back into the magic of the Harry Potter world.
 It's J.K. Rowling and she is adding to the Harry Potter story - enough said.  Love it
 It was worth reading, but not nearly the same experience as the series.
 Read in just a day, but enjoyed every second.
 Would have liked a story line better but it was still great
 Wouldn't it be great if she would write on about the next generation..  I really liked the story
 Loved it, but expected it to be less predictable
 Great story but was written in play format kind of hard to read til you get used to reading in that format
 I knew it was the "play version" but kiddo didn't like reading it that way.
 I like it but it's not as easy to read in "play" format as I thought it would be.
 loved it
 Incredibly disappointed.
 Pretty good.  It's a quick read.  It was an exciting story line, but at times hard to follow.
 I missed the depth of detail J.K. Rowling went into when she wrote the other volumes.
 Love J.K. Rowling! She always writes in a style that you don't want to put her books down.
 Can't wait to give it to my daughter 😀
 A little disappointing. It was great to get back into the world of Harry Potter. However, the plot was difficult to follow through the written play. It might be easier to follow when performed. New characters were introduced without much background or development and they seemed flat...
 I didn't like it.  I found much of the book actually made me angry.
 Great follow up to Harry Potter.
 I enjoyed the plot twists, but didn't feel the same emotional connection to the characters that I did with the books. The characters here feel flat and sometimes forced.  Perhaps because the script reads like it's trying to emulate Rowling's writing style.
 I didn't like this script nearly as much as I loved the books, but it was still good.
 reads like a play, didn"t like it
 I have been a Harry Potter fan ever since the books came out. I've read so many negative reviews about this written script and I see why people don't like it. (A) This is not a pure work of JK Rowling , there are 2 other co-authors.  So, the characters that we've grown to love seems "out of character" because of different word choice. Again, this is not purely a JK Rowling work. (B) This is written for a play format, thus the characters in the play have to state out loud the emotions they are feeling. How can the live audience know what they are feeling if they don't say it out loud? Unlike in the original books, we know what's going on inside their minds because we are reading them off the book. Thus, again, the characters seem "out of character" because of this. (C) The book/script is fast paced because the whole script/book covers Albus' journey through Hogwarts up to their fourth year (I think). It is unlike the original books where each year has one book dedicated to it. This is my objective review. lol. Now, I docked off one star because (spoiler alert), why is Albus devoid of talent? Like zero? Not even one? I thought we inherit intelligence from the mother, isn't Ginny a vivacious talented witch? He is brave, for sure, but his stupidity caused all the trouble in the world. But I guess that is why we have a story. Harry's son got insecure, so he starts on a reckless/stupid journey to prove something.
 This book was very difficult to get into and did not follow format of the series. She should have let it go.  I did like that Harry away married and Ron still had pretty much the same personality.
 This is my fault of course, but I didn't realize the book was a play script. I love scripts for when I'm in a play. But not to read. Don't like it. Thumbs down
 I thought it picked up where the other books left off, years later when they were all grown up with families of their own! Loved how each one worked at either the magic school, or magical council! Please I would love to see more potter stories
 I always hoped we would learn what the future held for Harry and the gang.  Thanks for filling that need JK.  Loved it.
 A little disappointing. Not written as a novel but as a play. It is definitely missing JK's colorful imagery and details. Story is ok.
 Wow.  I loved it
 A glimpse into the past. Wish I could see this play!  Great storytelling, and touching in all the right ways.
 Great addition to a much loved story! It's not exactly 'jk rowling' in essence but you feel her in the story.
 Love Harry Potter, and this glimpse in to the lives of the characters post-Hogwarts.
 This book is bad. The story is horrible, the writing is sophomoric, and the memory of having read it is indelible.<br/><br/>Go. Leave. Save yourselves.
 Loved it! Couldn't put it down! Discovered some new insights on a few of the characters, and endeared some new characters to my heart!
 More great characters and clever plot line. It came to life for me even in this format. Glad to move into this generation
 I went in with low expectations knowing very well that it would not be like the original 7 books... even then I was hugely disappointed. *No spoilers!* The story was all over the place, had a weak plot, brought forth ideas and characters that ultimately were a waste of time, and left a lot of unanswered holes. Actions characters took as adults, don't make sense... it's like a complete need set of Harry Potter and gang! I honestly wish I had not read it. I almost feel betrayed by JK Rowling for signing off on this story. As a Harry Potter fan for almost 20 years, I had to read it and recommend you read for yourself. Just be warned that your childhood image of Harry Potter will forever be tainted.
 I have way to much to say to write it all on here.
 Good quality and quick shipping.
 Its ok, good story, I just did not care for it in the way of a play
 Excellent follow up to a very good series of books.
 Gift
 This story seemed derivative and lacked the magic of the originals.
 Nice gift
 This was a great story. You have to have an imagination to read the script and see how they would produce this on a stage. It was a great read and I hope one day I could see it on stage.
 Too confusing. Relies on previous HP stories. Time travel a poor premis for a play.
 I have been a huge fan of the Harry Potter books for forever now and while I was slightly disappointed that it was written as a script I am beyond happy for any continuation of this incredible series. I would highly recommend it to all fans of Harry Potter.
 Very pleased with price and transaction overall, Thank you!!
 This was awful, so t waste your time reading it
 Very good story has a lot of plot twists like the original books and I like that it carried on the story and show the life he has after he defeated Voldamort.
 Not as interesting as the Harry Potter novels. Predictable simple plot.
 Missed following this world! If only it was a little longer. Who knew I would cheer for a Malfoy.
 This is very misleading. It is written in play form and lacks the depth and flavor that the other books possessed. I am very disappointed.
 Was really expecting better, knowing Rowling.<br/><br/>Highly disappointed
 It was fun to re-visit Hogwarts but the plot was unremarkable. Harry Potter is predictable as a parent - uncertain and unsure of himself just as he was as a student - but still somehow manages to win. Overall, a good trip back to Hogwarts and a reminder of why I loved the original series.
 Horrible book! Don't not read if you like the original harry potter books.
 This production was a wonderful addition to the Harry Potter series. I can't wait for it as a movie production!
 Heart melting in so many ways. Beautiful story of struggle and sacrifice that can only be played out in Rowling's magical world.
 I like this book but I think a novel form would be easier to read and follow.
 Once I got into the play format, I was awed at how they could possibly portray on stage.  Very interesting.
 Brought this for a gift
 Love, love, love, love this book. I've read all the Harry Potter books ALL more then once and I was pleased with this portrail of her story about Harry's adult life/son. Great read!!! So glad this was written.
 The first, that this is the 8th story. It's not. This is a guy writing fan fiction and slapping JK's name on the cover so it will sell. The second is that it's 19 years later. No. The events in this book happen 22 years later.<br/><br/>It's a shame because there's a lot of possibility here. There are interesting storylines taking place here, they just aren't executed on the level we've come to expect from a Rowling product. I'm a sucker for a good time travel story, as well as revisiting beloved characters much later in life. But this isn't how these characters act. Albus should never have been this whiny. I liked him in the 7th book. I liked Harry in the original 7. But, here, the characters have become annoying or flat. With Ron he was actually just describing either Fred or George!<br/><br/>I also just wasn't a fan of how entwined in the story Harry was. Like, I've already seen him and everything he's capable of in the original 7 books. Now, he's a blubbering fool. You can't sit there and tell me that Harry Potter, the boy who lived, is going to run to Ginny every time he has a minor problem. That and I don't want to read about his life working a 9 to 5. I work a 9 to 5. That's not interesting to me because I live it everyday. Give me more Albus and Scorpius!<br/><br/>The only intriguing part of this for me was when we focus solely on the kids. No, they don't act like normal kids, but honestly, I just wanted to see how they would interact with each other. I know the adult's story and I just want to focus on someone else, now.<br/><br/>Another very problematic thing for me was the fact that we spend a good chunk of the book fast forwarding to get where we need to be. Why waste all that time? Why not start us where we need to be? Why not go further in depth for the moments you do skip over? Entire books could be written for the amount of time we skipped in the beginning of this book. I wanted much more from this story. Answer some how's and why's while you're skimming through the years.<br/><br/>No one can write these characters or this universe like Rowling and no one should. I'm going to have to exclude the "8th" story from my yearly reading of these books, unfortunately. Fantastic Beasts looks great, though, and that is a truly Jo Rowling production.
 I greatly enjoyed the book, once I got past the fact that it was a play. Then it was like reading a movie!
 This book was sent to my granddaughter who loved the book.
 don't like the format of the book at all.  not a problem with the vendor
 This is a screen play, it is in no way an 8th Harry Potter book, but I did not expect it to be. I loved getting to see my old friends again and getting to see what they're up to. The story wasn't perfect, there was at least one major hole that I found (something Potter fans are not used to). But I would do just about anything for a little more Harry, Ron, and Hermione in my life. So I say 5 stars.... with the right expectations.
 I tried so hard to enjoy this but it just didn't capture the magic of Harry Potter. I wish I'd never read this and let the Deathly Hallows end the story
 The book came in absolutely perfect condition. I'm so looking forward to reading it! Thanks to J.K. Rowling and the co-authors!
 What a perfect way to revisit all the beloved characters in one of my all time favorite fictional universes. This story brings everyone back together in a unique way and gives closure to the lives of the characters.
 Decent read did not like the play scripting.  Not real exciting ending.  Maybe because its the last book.
 Love it great and not at all stale as many multi volume adventures can be! Please keep them JK thank you a 60 year old fan
 Very tired time travel change the future plot.  found it predictable and somewhat boring.
 Severely disappointed.
 DIDN'T LIKE IT
 Great to see what's going on years later and that it's not all sunshine and rainbows
 The last of my daughters collection
 I loved it written as a screen play, which surprised me. The descriptions of the stage and what was going on in the audience made it so exciting; I can't wait to see the play in real life. I felt the characters mostly stayed true to themselves.
 Awful. Hard to follow. Couldn't finish it. Disappointed for sure.
 Was sceptic at first, it being a play and all. But it was great!
 I could tell it wasn't a strictly J.K. Rowling book.  Very entertaining and would love to see it on stage.
 It takes a chapter to get adjusted to the script format, by the story-telling is still exquisite.
 A touching, if a bit ... Redundant... Continuation of the tale of the Potter family and the Dumbledore's Army crowd.
 Not what I thought was being ordered as far as content.
 It's a script for those of you who don't know. I had a hard time reading the story that way
 I can't wait to see what happens in the world of Harry Potter on this new recent book.
 Originally posted on my blog at https://rantandraveaboutbooks.com/2016/08/26/rave-review-of-harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/<br/><br/>I pre-ordered this book a few weeks before its release date and held on to it for the past few weeks until the hype died down. I read very few reviews for this book, knowing only a few basic facts before I went into it. I didn’t even read the synopsis when I ordered it on Amazon because I didn’t want to risk any spoilers.<br/><br/>Luckily, the synopsis didn’t give away the story. I’ve read some mixed reviews about this book, and I can honestly say that the hardcore Harry Potter fans will have issues with how time travel is handled. I went into this as a new adventure, happy to have another Harry Potter story. That’s it. I didn’t analyze every book in the series or make too many comparisons because I wanted to enjoy this story as if it were the lost novel J.K. Rowling stashed away in some drawer. I don’t care about the loopholes or the inconsistencies or the fact certain characters are missing from the story. Okay, I care a little bit, but I did not let it disrupt my enjoyment of this book.<br/><br/>If you’re expecting this book to be a continuation of Harry Potter, you will be disappointed. But if you’re like me and you’re thrilled just to get another glimpse into this world, then you’ll probably rave over it. Another thing to consider is that this is a play adapted to a script book. With plays, the time is limited, and they had to cram a fair amount of information into a short time frame. There are almost always some minor inconsistencies in plays. It’s just how it is and it’s something I’ve come to accept after over twenty years of going to the theater. If you’ve never seen a live production and you’re expecting a full length book with all the questions answered, again you will be disappointed.<br/>What I Love About This Book…<br/><br/>  I forgot how much I missed Harry, Ron, Ginny, and Hermione. I think I missed Ron most of all. I loved him from the second I read about him in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone. He’s such a goofball and it was really nice to see him again. He had a few lines that made me laugh and go aww, Ron, I love you.<br/><br/>  Harry is still Harry just older and sort of grouchy. Even though the books were about Harry, I was more of a fan of the secondary characters. My opinion didn’t change after reading this book, and I was glad the focus of this book is on Albus Severus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy.<br/><br/>  I really like the dynamic between Albus and Scorpius. From the start, everyone is hating on Scorpius and he was my favorite character from this book. Each scene with him only made me like him more. He could’ve chosen to be the bad guy at certain parts but the underlying story, just like the original books, comes down to friendship. That’s what I always liked about this series and that part remained intact.<br/><br/>  We get to see Snape again!!! I forgot how much I missed him, too. He was down to help the kiddies and I loved that he was willing to take one for the team once more.<br/><br/>  We see a little bit of Dumbledore, and there’s a really cute exchange between Harry and him where they discuss their relationship. Harry is very annoying in this book, which is why I was glad he wasn’t the focus. But I liked how his conversation with Dumbledore’s painting helped him to see what was wrong in his relationship with Albus. They constantly butt heads because they think they’re so different but it’s because they’re so much alike.<br/><br/>  My favorite book in the series is Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire, and for that reason, I was really happy with the plot of this book. I loved being able to revisit parts of my favorite book with the help of a Time-Turner. And without going into detail, that also means you get to see some of the characters from back then, which was really exciting.<br/><br/>  I have always liked Draco Malfoy, and I guess if I had to choose a house I would’ve been sorted into Slytherin. I never gave much thought to this, mostly because I always thought with my personality this would make sense. I love characters like Snape and Draco. Who cares what house they’re in, right? That’s my thinking.<br/><br/>  I also liked the development of Harry and Draco’s characters as family men, and even though they’re not going to hug it out and have a sleepover, I did like that they had come to sort of understanding by the end of the book. There’s a secret about Draco that humanizes him a bit by the end, which I think had a lot to do with Harry’s change of heart.<br/><br/>The Parts That Made My Heart Hurt…<br/><br/>  Although Hagrid was not a character in this book, we did see him through Harry’s dreams. For me, Hagrid was the reason I was sucked into the first book in the series. Well, that and the fact the Dursleys were child abusers and I was so angry about it that I kept reading to make sure Harry got away from them. Sorry for the short rant but I really hate the Dursleys. Anyway, hands-down Hagrid is one of my favorite characters in any book. There is a serious tear-jerker moment where we get to see the past, and when Hagrid sees baby Harry, oh my God, my heart melted. It reminded me why I love Hagrid so much. He’s such a sweetie. I just wanted to hug him.<br/><br/>  There are a few scenes at Godric’s Hollow, and if you’ve read the books, you’ll know what I’m talking about. I don’t want to get into the specifics, but my heart literally hurt for Harry. I was hating on him most of the book until this one particular moment.<br/><br/>  Harry and Albus’ relationship was painful at times, but I was really happy with their overall character development. Some of the exchanges between them made it feel like they were strangers and not father and son. It was sort of depressing to see Albus feel somewhat like Harry did as a kid when he had a father right there. I thought it made sense to some extent, considering Harry did not grow up with a father. It was also very sad to read about.<br/><br/>There wasn’t much I disliked about the book, which is why I gave it 5 Stars on Goodreads. I think I was just too excited to have another Harry Potter book that I was willing to overlook some minor issues with things that J.K. Rowling attempted to fix throughout the series, only for them to reappear in this book. Just writing this review made me miss it even more so I decided to start watching Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone. I own all the movies through Amazon, so I couldn’t resist throwing it on just so I could see some of my favorite characters on-screen. And now I need to do a reread of this series, most likely some time closer to winter.<br/><br/>I really tried to limit this review to character development, and I didn’t give any spoilers, not unless you count who made a reappearance, even though I didn’t mention all of them, but other than that, I didn’t reveal any of the plot. You’re in for hopefully a pleasant surprise if you haven’t read the book yet.
 I think a novel would have been better for me. I do not like reading scripts but the story is great.
 Nice book but there's no comparison with others Harry Potter s series.Think should been stayed just as a script. Never sold to the public.
 Another HP knockout from JK Rowlings.  I am just sad that the Harry Potter series is over.  After reading this book I kept thinking that more books (and movies) could (hope) be done about the kids of our heroes!
 J.K. Rowling did not write the script. The voice of this play is so different. The way the characters speak and think is drastically altered. Along with many othe readers, I feel like this is fan fic. Sadly, I have read excellent fan fic without paying anything. I wish I would have waited to borrow this book from the library or a friend. Seriously, it can wait. Read the spoilers online if you are that curious.
 My son enjoyed it, but didn't think it was as good as the original stories.
 Loved reading this play. My only problem with it was that it was over too soon! Love the dialogue between Severus and Albus.
 It was very good. It was a fast read too and quite exciting too.
 Basically fanfiction with a weird plot, but enjoyable and resolves some character conflicts that were unaddressed in the books.
 Me and grandkids took turns reading the parts ... they're enjoying it!  Excited to see how it ends.
 Good story.  Nice to read an additional Potter adventure.
 Excellent as expected
 A wonderful last chapter in the adventure of a lifetime-- for all Harry Potter fans out there, you need this book! It will remind you of everything you love about the characters and Rowling's stories, and it simply feels like coming home to old friends. A great read; a must-read!
 Story line was very good; however, I found reading it as a screenplay instead of a novel was difficult.
 Gift for my wife.  The new format was not as good as the previous books.
 Good condition
 Definately didn't grab and keep my attention like the Harry Potter series.
 Enjoyed diving back into the magical world of Harry Potter, however why was Rons character changed so much? They made him into some goof that was never anything like his character in the books. All the characters had their personalities different.
 Loved it. Definitely very different reading a screenplay instead of a book, and I wish it was a book instead,but the dialogue was still engaging and the story overall was very fun.
 very great quality cant wait to dive in and read it
 good read
 It read like fanfict, quick and left me with a slightly guilty pleasure sensation. It does leave me wanting new, more fleshed out stories from the wizarding world. I guess that's what Pottermore
 This was definitely different than the 7 original HP books but JK Rowling will always be a genius and I think I'll always love everything she writes. So basically this is a totally biased review. Still, you should read this!
 it is good, a little odd to read it as a script. but good.
 Any fan of Harry Potter will cherish this play.  It brings back all of the original magic and opens another door to the next generation.  Loved it!
 Awesome book, love seeing more in the Harry Potter universe.
 amazing book and came in amazing condition
 Was a little let down as I was hoping for a story, but this is the screenplay. Still a good read, but just not what I was hoping for!
 Characters were developed because of the original author - not the writer of the play.
 I found the tale immensely compelling! I could hardly put it down! The writing is such that I could see the play unfold in my mind's eye. I wish I could see it live, I'm intrigued as to how the wizardly conventions are executed in a live performance setting.
 great little book. I only wish there was more of it. I adore the return of the original characters and meeting the new ones
 Good read. Fun to hear from some of the old characters. Perfect for the holidays. Thanks, Mary
 I love the Harry Potter series. This was a good read based on the life after Hogwarts, marriage, and children.
 The book is great!
 I think I would have enjoyed it better if it was written like a story not a play.
 Very simple book that creatively uses the existing Harry Potter story in a future context. The alternative realms created are magical and provide readers with insights on alternative story plots.
 Haven't read it yet. But I will say I know it's good!
 Perfect addition to our collection
 I didn't like the play format - just write a book and let us enjoy it.
 Grandson needed this to finish the Harry Potter stories.....loved it.
 Great
 Gave as a gift &amp; they really enjoyed it.
 JK did it again! It may be a very short read for an avid fan but so worth it!
 Kept me guessing. The insecurities of sons are explored as well as the insecurities of fathers. Friendship is a key theme in this play. Reconciliation is sweet for 2 families.
 Total Bummer!
 Premise could go in circles forever. Can't tie up loose ends. But a good HP read for a fan.
 Fun and interesting story... So now we know what happens to Harry's family and the wizarding world.  Still exciting !
 Difficult to read a play. I expected a "typical" Harry Potter book that I loved.  I will not be recommending this book to anyone.
 I love a chance to dip into the world of Harry Potter, but this was not as satisfying as I'd hoped. The lack of detail may be due to the fact that it's a play, but it lacks the overall depth of story.
 Very disappointing.  The screenplay version is a very quick read without any depth to the storyline as on the past books.  It could have been great
 Love reading stories in script format. It teaches students how to write for television and theater. Great.
 
 The only real problem with this story is that it's written in the form of a play.
 I was disappointed that this book was in play format. Being a Harry Potter fan...I could not get into the story.
 Great sequel to all my seven Harry Potter books. I really loved it.  J K Rowling is amazing!!!
 Boring and predictable. If you are a HP fan, here is some advice; don't read this. It is to the HP series as Go Set A Watchman is to To Kill A Mockingbird.
 Did she need the money?  It's the only reason she could have taken leave of her senses to write this slop.  Do they hug?  Of course not - they're British!
 I love Harry Potter. I read this in 3 hours. I did not want it to end. It is absolutely brilliant.
 I loved it! I hope she writes another one that continues this story line.
 great condition, the book was unexpected, and not in a good way
 Amazing play. Made me proud to be a slytherin!
 It was very good, but just not quite as good as the original because books.
 Basically glorified fan fiction that got traction.  I'm not a big fan of emo Harry Potter. That said it's certainly not the worst possible read.  I could hear Harrys voice so it was decidedly okay.
 This is between a 2.5 and 3 star rating for me. Truth be told, reading this book gave me such an ambivalent feeling that I'm not exactly sure of what I thought about it, nevertheless I do have some very clear opinions.<br/><br/>1. The fact that the format is a script and not a novel had a huge impact on me and my enjoyment of the book. It made everything feel a bit chopped and extremely fast, not at all what I was used to from all the original books in the series but since it will be difficult for me to go to London and experience the play this publication will have to do for me.<br/><br/>2. Scorpius is a great surprise, quite a lovable character. All the other kids presented in this story are just a bit, very, irritating and just annoying and somewhat self entitled.<br/><br/>3. Ron lacks shine, the character comes off bland and just not what one remembers of him.<br/><br/>At the end I understand, or at least I think I understand, the fact that no matter how magical this world is the people in it are human even though they're witches and wizards, they are first and foremost, human. They are flawed no matter how much we love them and I do love them, even with this book. I'll always love them and I'm grateful for the original series and to Rowling for writing it.
 Had much higher expectations which were not met. not a good read at all
 Great to add another story to the Potter series. Thank you for engaging our imaginations and keeping us entertained JK Rowling
 I didn't expect it being written as a play. It was okay and predictable.
 Damaged by dog shampoo
 Really good read,fun and fast. It keeps your interest, and it's hard to put down I will read it again.
 I knew it was a play before I purchased it.  So it jump around just like watching an actual play which made it harder to follow at times.  I'm sure that if I were watching this play it would be very good.  The story itself continues to follow the pattern of the Harry Potter books so you can guess as to what will happen next as you ready it.
 I do not accept this as cannon
 I didn't care for the play-like format, it was like read a play which interrupted the flow of the story.
 Great read and I want more! Love this series and this extension of it!!  I hope there is more to come.
 Awesome!
 The cursed child closed off many of the questions i had after the 7HP books. The only thing left now is for dudley to have a magical child!
 Well it was a great story I didn't like the format it was written in
 love it
 Ya boy one of the best<br/>Make more books about albus potter<br/>This book is great in every way thanks j.k rowlling for an awesome wizarding adventure
 This is written as a play: Act 1, Sceen 1, etc..  Very interesting and well done.
 Got a used version but looks new. Love it
 I wasn't a fan of the touchy feelyness of this one... The play left little room for the exquisite characjer development seen in the books... But hey... It's Harry Potter... How bad could it be?
 Definitely not as good as the other books but still pretty good. Filled in a few things. Pretty good for a screen play too.
 Great book
 I likes the story, but I did not like the scrip format.
 It took a bit of time to get into reading a play. Not as rich and detailed as the original series
 It switched back &amp; forth in time &amp; persons so many times that I lost interest pretty fast
 Gift to my family for Christmas.
 Idiotic and amatuerish. As though a fan wrote a stupid fiction.
 You have to read this knowing it is a play. I kept hearing Daniel Radcliffe's voice through the whole story. I thought it was good, but do miss the original store of writing.
 So good!
 did not expect a screenplay
 I wanted to buy the book by J. K. Rowling, but my mistake I didn't pay attention and bought the play!!
 Best pre-order ever! I stayed up all night reading it. This is for true fans of the series, this script makes no sense if you haven't read the other books. Good cherry-on-top read for long time Potter fans!
 I simply loved everything about it!!!! Now I have the complete series
 I would have preferred this as a novel, but the play format provided a provocative read.
 just as advertised
 everything as described.<br/>Thank you very much
 Wiith the exception of Alan Rickman's inability to perform as Severus Snape, this would make a great film!
 Wow
 It is not what I expected.
 It was good , it had that JK Rowling feel, but at the same time it didn't. I can't quite put my finger on what was different about it, maybe the way it was written as a play rather than a novel. I'm happy that I was able to go back to wonderful world of Harry Potter.
 *some spoilers to follow*<br/><br/>If I’m being honest, I never originally intended on reading this story. I adore Harry Potter, I just felt that the story was better left as is after the epilogue of the Deathly Hallows. But then my book bestie morphed into the pushiest book pusher that ever pushed and suddenly I found myself having already finished and wondering how I ever thought I could not read this. Setting aside all the vast amounts of criticism this has received (i.e. this isn’t written by Rowling, it reads like fan-fic, it’s not even a book but a screenplay) it ended up being more than I could have ever hoped for.<br/><br/>“Hogwarts will be the making of you, Albus. I promise you, there is nothing to be frightened of there.”<br/><br/>Taking us right back to the epilogue of the Deathly Hallows, we get to see Albus getting on his first train to Hogwarts. And his discussion with Harry regarding the possibility of him being placed in Slytherin. We’re not given the detailed account of his time spent at Hogwarts, but rather the generalized impression that Hogwarts isn’t quite the sanctuary for him that it was for his father. The comprehensive details of the world are also missing from the screenplay but for those of us who have already read the first seven books, that world is emblazoned upon our minds and no rehashing of details are necessary for us to fully comprehend each and every scene.<br/><br/>Cursed Child manages to smoothly connect many major plot points from the original novels: the infiltration of the Ministry of Magic by Harry, Ron, and Hermione (Deathly Hallows, book 7), the Tri-Wizard tournament and Cedric’s death (Goblet of Fire, book 4), time turners (Prisoner of Azkaban, book 3), the perpetual battle between good and evil, and the important father-son relationships that have been a focal point of this series from the beginning. It also makes a less than obvious point of showing how seemingly inconsequential deaths end up having a much larger impact in the grand scheme of things. With the help of a time turner, we’re shown snippets of how the world could have been with the simplest of changes. The variation of possibilities was both shocking and horrifying. What I most enjoyed was how this wasn’t simply a new set of adventures with a new set of characters but rather recognition of the fact that the actions of the past was not a given end to that story, but that they inevitably had an effect on the future of their own children.<br/><br/>Harry: “How do I protect my son, Dumbledore?”<br/>Dumbledore: “You ask me, of all people, how to protect a boy in terrible danger? We cannot protect the young from harm. Pain must and will come.”<br/><br/>While we do see the original characters and what they have become 19 years later, the focal point is on their children, primarily Albus and Scorpius who become immediate friends on the Hogwarts Express. Albus has a severely strained relationship with his father, Harry, and has difficulty living up to not just the enormous importance of his father, of the great men he was named after, and because of the fact that he was in fact placed in Slytherin rather than his father’s house, Gryffindor. It’s easy to see from the original stories how understandable it would be for Harry to not be the perfect father, considering his own lack of a permanent father figure. He does what he feels is best even when it is quite clearly not best, and the scenes between the two are often painful and heartbreaking. Scorpius, son of Draco Malfoy, also suffers from a poor relationship with his father due the actions of his past as well as Draco’s own relationship with his father, Lucius.<br/><br/>In October of this year I decided to do an impromptu re-read of the Harry Potter series on audio. I have re-read books 1-3 numerous times but I tend to run out of steam and have never been able to re-read books 4-7. Well, I finally overcame my hangups and completed my first re-read of Goblet of Fire. Due to the majority of this story centering around the storyline from The Goblet of Fire I chose to do my second re-read of the year (ha) of Cursed Child since the storyline was still so fresh in my mind. It works extremely well if you treat it as a #4.5 book as well, granted, it’s vital to know the outcome of the series as a whole in order to fully appreciate how it ties everything together and illustrates the growth of these characters.<br/><br/>“Perfection is beyond the reach of humankind, beyond the reach of magic. In every shining moment of happiness is that drop of poison: the knowledge that pain will come again. Be honest to those you love, show your pain. To suffer is as human as to breathe.”<br/><br/>Yes, perfection is an impossibility, and while there were many things I would have personally changed, this still managed to hit all my Harry Potter feels as perfectly as possible. Cursed Child reinforced my love of both the original stories and characters by growing them in legitimate ways, it gave me new characters to love (primarily Scorpius &lt;3), and it removed the stereotype associated with Slytherin house by showing that not all associated are necessarily evil. #slytherinpride
 Just what I would expect, I really enjoyed getting a chance to revisit the world of Harry Potter
 Loved it !  So happy to read books about Harry Potter again ! I wish it would never end.
 I love seeing what is going on next in Harry Potters world! So glad I purchased the book!
 Omg. Literally couldn't stop reading once I started and finished it in about 2 hrs. GREATNESS!!! A great continuation of a beloved childhood series.
 IS JUST ANOTHER BOOK FOR MY COLLECTION SO IT CAN BE WORTH LOT'S OF $$$$ LATER ON
 A bit dramatic for my taste with all the teen angst. But still an enjoyable read overall
 A true Harry Potter fan will love this. Yes it was a quick read and yes some of the story dragged or was expected. But i really enjoyed the different scenarios and what IFS. I can see this go on for another 7 stories.  Thru the eyes and new stories of their children. JK Rowling please start writing again.
 Just a whirlwind tour of greatest hits sadly.  Little original, although the bromance at the heart of the play is surprisingly well drawn.
 The book was nice and clean but the paper cover was a little bent on the top and bottom
 Dissapointing.
 In my opinion this was not written in the same resemblance of the books, the characters felt forced through the dialogue and it felt like disappointing Dan fiction. As a devoted Ravenclaw. I am very disappointed.
 I wish I hadn't read it. It detracts from the original stories and takes a little of the magic away from the whole Harry Potter Universe
 Too many plot holes and inconsistent characterizations.
 There isn't much to say when you receive the latest Harry Potter book but, thank you, J.K. Rowling!
 Amazing liked everything, recommend it to ppl who like reading, I chose these rating because it deserved it.Its A  Must Read.
 Disappointing, characters lacked depth and adult Harry was a complete disappointment. The money making machine has replaced the art of the original books.
 So far so good reads as a play. If not use to reading a play hard to wrap head around it.
 The novel is a quick read, being a screenplay, this is to be expected but "Harry Potter and the Cursed Child" brings much Potter knowledge to the reader.
 great book, was very excited she decided to continue the story
 It's an entertaining story, it's wonderful to have that Universe back. BUT - it's obviously not the same level as the books, as it's not written by JK Rowling. It's filled with cliches and the dialogue is poorer. Not the same level of subtlety and refinement we're used from JK Rowling. Many watered down, over emotional, cheep lines.
 Was this really written by J.K. Rowling?  It didn't feel like it.  Sentimental and awkward.
 Bravo, a most delightful blend of love, courage,shenanigans and magic. A great read! Anyone interested in the Harry Potter stories should appreciate this look into an older Potter world
 Good read
 I thought it equal to all the Harry Potter books.
 I didn realize this was the play ! Very difficult to read
 My daughter is obsessed with this book. Awesome!
 The book reveals that The Boy Who Lived and the vanquisher of Lord Voldemort has all the human frailties of any parent.  A good read and it was a lovely way to pass a morning.  It was nice catching up on the characters from the original series.
 Ok. I get that this is a stage play and that they published the script. However, a stage play is all about visuals that are not necessarily spelled out in the script. Likewise, a book has a lot of color and descriptions to set the scene. This book is not an adaptation. It's the script. Period. No color, few descriptions of scenes, very little to get the imagination going. It's dull and lifeless. More time should have been spend translating this to book form.<br/><br/>The other title I was going to give this review is "Hail! Hail! The Gangs all Here!"  Because, wow! The ENTIRE gang is all here. Even the ones who died in the battle of Hogwarts get to make an appearance. I heard one reviewer call this book fluff for the Potter fan club. That certainly fits. Ms Rowling's tries to hard to get everyone a bit part in her story. It just falls flat.
 An excellent follow up and end to the series. Cheers. I am now writing to meet the minimum number of words requires for thia review. It was a good book. Go buy it now on Amazon Kindle.
 Great fun reading about what happens to our friends after Hogwarts &amp; the great battle.
 Nice continuation would like to see the play. wish it was an actual book.
 I love all the Harry Potter books, this one was a great addition.  I hope there are more books to come.
 Came in great shape keep up the great work
 My son (10) read it in a setting and loved it
 I loved the story. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it's written as a play. For me, this left out a lot if descriptive details that would have been in a novel. The story will make a great play and movie.
 This book is clearly an extended fan fiction. For those who need a story line to follow it might be worth the read but for those with imagination it is unnecessary.
 It was a good read and we got to see into the lives of our favorite characters children.
 It was such a good book. It was interesting as a play.. but now I want to see it!! It's really nice to read about future Harry Potter and his children.
 Book arrived in great condition!
 Excellent story, even though it is written in a play format, you are easily drawn into the story and i barely noticed.  Just as engaging as all the other stories.
 great again
 While I enjoyed the story, it was a bit hard to follow the play format.
 This is a good book just wish it was longer like the rest
 Great  book and easy to follow. I had fun reading and thinking what comes next. Great ending and non stop
 This is a gift for my daughter who is a huge Harry Potter fan.  It was a must-add to her HP book collection.
 JK is back, how exciting to realize we haven't been abandoned by the commander in chief! Long may JK live and guide us through the magical world around us.
 This play immediately transports you back to JKs wizards by world. I love how time travel is handled as well as hypotheticals from the series. Stage directions are neat too! Well worth a few reads :)
 WHIMSICAL AND AMAZING LIKE THE OTHER HARRY POTTER SERIES.
 I am a huge fan of the HP books so I was delighted to read a new book
 Reading this in the form of a screenplay was not my favorite, even though I enjoyed the story. I missed the rich description of the environment and the screenplay style broke up the flow of the content.
 This isn't written by JK Rowling and the writing style has many inconsistencies. They called the Ministry of Magic "Ministry FOR Magic"....why<br/><br/>Also the characters don't act like themselves and it's very unnerving. I finished the book because I love harry potter so much, but it almost pained me to finish it.<br/><br/>This is more like a fanfiction than an actual book.
 Read like a script, which I was expecting.  Loved the idea and overall story
 If this story had not been about Harry Potter, I would have given it a higher rating. With that being said, this was not a great Harry Potter story and I quite honestly only kept reading it because I felt like I had to.
 Bought as a gift.
 I loved it because I love all things Potter and was really missing the series. But this is not really new ground, and that is ok because Ms Rowling has already outdone herself. She has no obligation to wow me anymore. The characters have aged appropriately and have the appropriate amount of angst. The next generation of characters were presented well, but it is difficult to feel the same emotion toward them. Don't read this if you haven't been a fan. If you are a fan, be prepared for the script formula instead of the usual narrative and scene descriptions. The introduction of time travel was a possible segue into a new series of stories: what if this person had lived/died and how would the rest of the characters evolved? But all of the questions raised were answered, so I felt that the author did not want a new series of books.
 Nice to revisit beloved characters, but not the same as a true book.
 I did not like this book/play at all.  None of it seemed true to whom the original characters were.  Hard to explain why I feel that without spoilers.
 Not up to her usual standards.  Disappointing.  Sorry I spent money buying the book instead of borrowing it from the library, when I had such high expectations.
 Huge Harry Potter fan! Loved been able to know more about Harry's story, many years later of the last book!
 If you love the Harry Potter books, don't read this garbage. It's not canonical. It reads like a bad fan fic.
 It was a little hard to get pass the format, but a good read.
 I wanted to read "more" about the Harry Potter story. Even though it's written in play form, it's still a great story!
 Was a great continuation of the series. I really liked the difference in pace and action compared to the original books and the focus on the characters.
 I finished this book last night. If you go in expecting a Harry Potter novel, you'll be really sad. If you read it imagining it happening by actors in a stage play, you'll probably find it quirky fun with a couple interesting insights.
 Great great great great great great great great great great great great great great guys I totally recommend this read
 My daughter loved the birthday gift.
 This would be so much nicer to read as a regular book and not as a play manuscript. It was hard to follow at times because of it. And it would be so much better if you could get a better sense of what the settings were and the people were like. A play manuscript doesn't do that. It doesn't make you feel like you're there, mostly because the sets and actors do that. We're not at the play, so the read is lacking what most of the Potter books had. It would be better as a book, and but it would still be neat to follow Albus and Scorpius on further adventures, just in book form.
 Its pretty good so far.  Not like her other books.
 ok
 Not at all what I expected.  Was a little disappointed.
 I've been waiting to see what has happened for so long!  I love this adaptation!  I'd love to see the play!
 This was on my daughter-in-laws' Christmas wish list and she is very happy with it.
 Exactly as described.
 Without a doubt an instant 5 star read. Loved it enjoyed it so glad that Harry Potter is back. Another thriller
 Anyone who loves Harry Potter will love this story. This playscript is very easy to read and fall in love with!
 I enjoyed this book. I get why people think it was disappointing, and they're not wrong - it did read a bit like a fanfiction (a mediocre one at that), and the plot fell a bit flat. But to be honest, I don't think Harry Potter's original plotlines were as wildly original as people seem to think they were. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Harry Potter, and I do think the original canon was better than this book - just not by as much as everyone else seems to think.<br/><br/>I liked the characters. I thought Scorpius was quite charming. Some of the original characters fell a bit flat for me - especially Ron. I'm not really sure what happened with Ron, but his role in the story was so minor that it didn't stick out to me. I wasn't over the moon over the plot, and it was predictable to me, but there were parts I really appreciated.<br/><br/>This book felt like a Harry Potter book to me, if only because I was as swept up in the reading of this book as I have ever been with one of the earlier Harry Potter book. It brought me back to being in high school and waiting for the books and movies to come out, being at the bookstore on midnight the day of release, and the glorious anticipation of waiting to find out what happened next. As a standalone story, this book is decent and would probably get three stars - but I gave it an extra star for the nostalgia factor. So I liked it. I would recommend it to any of my Harry Potter fan friends. Plus, it doesn't take long to read a play - so you may as well give it a go. :)
 For my grandson but he loves it
 I HAD HIGHER EXPECTATIONS. THE BOOK SEEMS TO FOCUS MORE ON THE PAST THAN THE CURSED CHILD. THERE IS NO INDICATION OF A CURSE, MORE OF RELATIONSHIP ISSUES BETWEEN FATHER AND SON.
 This book and the play were a wish come true for me.  Can never get enough of this series.  I hope J K Rowling writes more of these.
 Loved the whole series except for this. Hard to root for Albus -- makes terrible decisions and the motivation is weak
 EXCELLENTAY!!!<br/><br/>Hoping for a movie series!
 Another hit from JK Rowling
 Loved falling into the wizarding world again, so comfortable and interesting!  Great to be with the characters again, and meet new ones.
 It reads like a play.  Once you get use to that, the story is wonderful.  She has such an imagination.
 Nice spin on the story! Simple telling compared to the novel format!
 Anything related to Harry Potter is a favorite of mine.
 Great book. So happy she kept the series going.
 Bought this as a present for my husband, as a Harry Potter fan he loved the book
 Visiting old friends joyful and this follow up story sweet with a moral.
 The script format was not all I would have hoped for.
 This book although not as good as the original series is great. With all the children of those from the past series it multiplies the number of main characters. Its still a nice read. Being written in the form of a screenplay makes it that much easier to follow.
 This is not a book--but a script written in book form. The dialog is script---beware
 Let me start by saying I am a huge fan of all things Harry Potter, from the book series to the movie series, theme park, etc. I have read each of the books multiple times and find them tremendously entertaining.  I am not sure who actually wrote this screen play but I doubt J.K. Rowling actually had much (if anything) to do with it.  It is written as if the author had very little to no knowledge of the characters or story lines from any of the previous books, or maybe they just saw one of the movies years ago.  The characters do and say things that they would never do in the books, and the dialog is not true to who they are in the books. The plot is confused and pointless at times. It meanders through many subplots, often does not have a foundation in the material from the original book series.  I had to force myself to keep reading this thing. Bottom line- don't waste your time reading this if you are a Potter fan.
 While it was did not possess the quality or intrigue of the incomparable canon, it is worth the time to read, even if it just to rekindle the magical spark that has been dormant for the past agonizing years.
 Brilliant just brilliant!
 Even though it's written in screen play format I very much enjoyed this book and found it easy to read
 I've always liked Harry Potter books. I think it would have been better written as a story rather than a play
 The srory was good but the play fornat was off putting.
 I read it in one night. Love love love it
 A little slow and not easy to keep up with in this format. But I still enjoyed it.
 A lot like reading shakespeare back in high school; you don't really get any of the color or backdrop, but still a very good story and easy to follow. Ms. Rowling could flesh it out and a real 8th volume in the Harry Potter series.
 Okay, so it's not J.K. Rowling, but I thought it was a good story and I enjoyed it.
 As always an incredible story. I did find it more difficult to read in play format though. I almost quit reading it but got the hang of it and continued.
 I was let down by it nothing no where near the other Harry Potter books..A waste of my money.
 I have all th the books, I got the newest on my kindle cause I wasn't sure I would like it in play form, but I absolutely loved it, I'm happy with how this one ended, but I hope that someday , maybe JK will continue the story with Harry,  Ginny, Ron , Harmines and Dracos children
 For my granddaughter. She was thrilled.
 Awesome! I hope the theatre troupe comes to Chicago!  This book added to the previous magical plot!  The beauty is the spiritual mixed with humanistic qualities shown in relationships. J L Sirkam
 This was a quick read. I did not believe the play-script format was going to be good, but the scene setting it provided is fantastic.
 As a play it is intriguing almost like a Musical review for Harry Potter fans.
 For a Potter fan this read feels like coming home play style.  Same writing that made rather series so difficult to put down accompanied by scenes being set.  Not a novel, so don't expect to one.  Great continuation.
 I expected more but the story-telling  wasn't on the level I'd hoped for.
 You need to have seen the movies or read the other books for some context, but it reads Great, Fast, and I want a movie based on it!
 great gift for Harry Potter lover
 Lots of twist and turns, book was written a lot different from the rest. Enjoyed it.
 Liked the story. My only complaint about it is that it was way too short!  Also not as easily read written as a screenplay.  But otherwise, anything Harry Potter is great!
 Good reading,but not as good as previous books
 The order arrived before the posted date, the book was brand new and my grandson loved it. It made his birthday a success. Thanks
 Once I explained to my 9 year old daughter the book was in the style of a play it was easier to read it with her..
 Such a great book!
 Was happy to read more about the Harry Potter family.  Could have had more to it.
 Book was written like a play script and once got into the book it was an easy read.  Enjoyed the format.
 Nowhere close to original HP books or films.
 Not a fan of this portrayal of the off spring of Harry Potter the boy who lived and the whimpy son of Draco Malfoy. my second least favorite book by JK Rowling.
 This book was a wonderful read and I completed it in two days.  I just could not put the book down!
 It isn't up to her usual standards. It's good, but I don't like the screen play aspect. It doesn't delve into the characters as much.
 Love all the Harry Potter books and this. I wish it had been longer.
 My daughter was disappointed, i think we could have done without.
 Being a play, this misses the magic that novels can create (internal dialogue, descriptions of scenery, etc).  Overall very disappointing.
 went back to the original books in an interesting way
 Unfortunately, this didn't come close to my Harry Potter expectations. I suppose I was hoping it would be an entirely new story, not one that used previous books and experiences over and over again to keep a story alive. Not to mention, I extremely disliked that it quickly skimmed over Albus' first several school years. If I were to have read this without the expectations of a Harry Potter quality story, I probably would have liked this more. Again it is a screen play, so it reads much different than a novel and surprisingly that part very minimally bothered me. But due to this, it wasn't nearly as descriptive as I would have wished. I honestly only gave it 3 stars because I was happy to read more stories about Harry Potter and his gang. But I didn't much care for the story at all.
 Overall a good story. I thought a little more could have been put into it. And where was Hagrid in the future! The sarcasm between the boys was a little cliche but still funny at times. But it was nice to see into the rest of their lives.
 I didn't like the script format.  The character development was not up to the standard Rowling has set in the Harry Potter series.  Very disappointed.
 Loved this book! I hope they bring the play to the U.S.
 It was a good story but Left many unanswered questions compared to her previously written books.  I didn't care for the way it was written (play format).
 Good story but not as enjoyable as the books. Miss the details.
 no issues
 As usual, J.K.Rowling pulled me in from the first page and held me captive until the last. I eagerly await what she writes next.
 Good to be with Harry and friends again...
 Husband bought this for his birthday and really enjoyed
 A good follow up to the Harry Potter world; format takes a while to get used to.
 Excellent story, but prefer novels over screen plays. I feel the strychnine flows better as a novel. Besides that the story is excellent and suppress the early novels nicely.
 Not as good as all the other Harry Potter books, a little rushed.
 Could not stop reading
 Got it for a friend, she could not stop talking about it.
 I'm a hardcore HP fan and absolutely love this book.  Amazing.
 Ron became the comic relief, other than that the book came pristine
 Would have loved to see the play.  It's a very quick read. Nice to see this series revived.
 Do I really need to say anything??
 I want to see this stage production!! It really is a fantastic story!!!!! I hope that it comes to the United States so I can see it.
 Enjoyable sequel to the original sequence. I have friends that didn't appreciate what they called the "screenplay" aspect (it's a script, of course), but I found it a very welcome facet.
 Script takes getting used to, gut still a great book
 Impossible to read, print small and light. How do I return it/? Wanted the book NOT the play/
 NIce follow up to the first seven books.
 Essentially ruined the Harry Potter series for me. I wish I could unread this... It was as if this play were written by anyone BUT JK Rowling!
 I would have rated it higher but I am really not a person who reads plays. I would have preferred it in a book.
 Really enjoyed this book for any Harry Potter fan.
 Good story - just remember it's not written in prose form but as a play.
 I enjoyed this story.  I'm not sure I would have liked the play.
 This is the script for the play and does not have the background activity to support it that the regular books in the series have.  LEaves much to the imagination and is found wanting.
 Came in with low expectations, so I was quite pleased. Fun romp of a story that readers of the original series will enjoy. Definitely hard to put down. Follows the same style as the original books pretty well, despite not being the original author's sole work.
 So good I hope JK keeps the Potter world going. Well done and exciting!
 JK did it again.  Wonderful follow up to the original series.  Enjoyed every page.
 I am just hooked on Harry Potter so love that the story is continuing!
 The beginning was a little weird but it definitely got better around the halfway mark. If you're a Harry Potter fan I would say it's worth it to buy just to add it to the collection.
 Even thought its written like a play, and most people are not used to it (myself included), the story is so engaging that you barely notice it. And it really is great to follow up on future Harry, Ron and Hermione. This story is like a mini dose of Harry Potter magic for those in dire need of it :)
 Keeps the Potter tradition alive. Because the vehicle is a play it is a very quick read.
 Bought because I love all things Harry Potter. Greatly regret it
 Not what I really expected.
 it was very Normal family issues, with the exception that there's magic and Harry Potter is poor Albus fathers. I really loved it. I even read it to my Nephew.
 It delivered safe and sound with good condition.
 This book is written in a script format which makes it very difficult to read. Not a fan of this style. I was really hoping for a more normal version of this story.... Oh well. If you don't mind the script style, you will probably enjoy this book
 J.K. Rowling can not write a bad book and this one is no exception.
 I've enjoyed all of JK Rowling's books so far and this one did not disappoint.
 Kinda hard to get into because of the play write. But defiantly up to JKRowland
 It's very funny the ways in which this took me back. As a young mother reading the originals with my son as he grew I still related to the characters. And now, with my own son , grown into a man, this book still has me relating to the main characters as adults trying to understand parenthood and their own children growing up. I loved it!
 Just not as good as the Harry Potter series. They went back and forth in time, I started to lose interest....
 Astonishingly crappy dialogues, predictable and cliché parent and child conflicts, poor dynamics in the build up of the drama, hollow and cheesy ending. I as the reader was treated as an imbecile throughout. Something essential must be missing compared to the stage version.
 It had all of our beloved characters but none of their original character.
 Book arrived 4 days ahead of time and wife loves it.
 Garbage.
 Delivery to my door by the release date! Loved the book and price was very competetive.
 so disappointed! I expected a book and received a script. cant read it.
 Hope this becomes a move, was actually a very good read.
 All of us have had years to sink deep into the world of Harry Potter. Revel in it, obsess, and re-imagine he what-ifs of the plot. Only JK with he bold and inspiring imagination bring us back into the heart of it and allow us to live the magic a new. Simply heart-wrenching, wonderful and masterful.
 Finding it difficult to read.  I didn't realize it is actually the play.
 Thank you for waking up the Potter Head in me!
 Nice story, well written but definitely for kids or teens. I've expected more.
 This book is a great sequel to the others. The "script writing" makes it a little hard to read, but otherwise, it is great book.
 Wished it was a novel not a screenplay.  It was kind of hard to follow.
 I tried my  best to not  zoom through the book. Truly I did, but I was engulfed and entranced but the magic of it all!
 Product itself was great. The storyline not so much. The plot is very played out.
 It’s a play script, warning! But if that’s what you are expecting you are good to go!
 Great
 Another Harry Potter book.  Loved reading about what happened 19 years after the last book.
 Not J.K. Rowling caliber. Very disappointing,
 Well done story, continues after we last saw Harry and gang. Lots of twists
 Great book.  Every Harry Potter fan that my daughter knows has also already read the book.
 I purchased this book the day it was released but only just got to reading it. I loved it. It's fun and exciting and makes me fall in love with the characters all over again - even the ones I hadn't expected to.
 Not as good as original Harry Potter books but still great characters and story lines. Have to keep up with the back and forth narratives. Still loved the book.
 Had great difficulty with this read!  Poor plot!  Poor quality writing!
 This is perfect for the collector.
 Wasn't quite what I thought it would be. But a fun read. Wish it it was in more of a book form, than a play.
 Loved it just had to get used to reading in play format.
 I never expected this plot.  People hate on this so much but a true fan will love it!  Easy to read and absolutely mind blowing!  Leaves us wanting more!
 A few spoilers ahead!!<br/><br/>Over the last few months I have actually read this a few times. Each time I read something new, if that makes any sense. I thought I knew all there was to know about this fantastic world that Jo created and then this "book" comes along and blows everything out of the water. I can't imagine a world where Ron and Hermione aren't together or where Cedric is a death eater (wtf to that!). Now that I see what a Time Turner can do, I'm not so sure that I want one anymore. Granted Malfoy had his made, but the consequences are far too great, especially toward the end. Talk about bravery. WHEW!<br/><br/>Another home run hit by J.K. Rowling and her team. One can only hop that this is made into a movie for us fans that couldn't see the play!
 My husband and I, avid Harry Potter fans, really enjoyed the book.
 Bought as a gift. Receiver was pleased.
 Not perfect and the play format made it feel a little rushed. However, I truly enjoyed the story and couldn't put it down after I got to Act 2.<br/><br/>I still love these characters!
 For the price of the book I feel it should have been made into a "book". Not kept as a play. My kids were expecting it to be more like a book and for younger children it's hard to read.
 What is there to possibly say about this book?  Let me start off by saying I am a Potterhead to the core.  I re-read the entire series at least once a year and sometimes twice.  When I first found out this book was coming out I knew it would go one of two ways.... It was either going to be amazing or absolutely horrible.  This was the latter.  If I could give it half a star, I would.  I went into this read with no expectations, but was still left with disappointment.<br/><br/>Firstly, this books reads like fanfiction and not even the good kind.  The original characters (Harry, Ron, and Hermione) were so unlike themselves it was hard to picture them as the same characters I loved in the series.  Ron is now basically the not funny dad always trying to play jokes, Hermione seems cold and distant, and Harry...well, he's just not Harry.  The story line is also just complete garbage.  Without spoiling the book, THERE IS NO WAY THIS PLOT MAKES ANY SENSE AND WOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED!!!<br/><br/>All in all, this book might as well have been of a completely different universe.  This is not the Harry Potter I grew to love.
 I only received the part one.  I may never know the rest.
 It was a good extension of the stories. Tying the past story to the characters future is giving them closure or the start of a new series of Harry Potter books and adventures.
 This book is written in a play format. I love all of her Harry Potter books and I also read "A Casual Vacancy" by her and liked that book too, but I am not impressed with this one.
 It was a gift for my daughter's birthday. She loves the book. She says the story is awesome.
 Not a J.K. Rowling style.
 Would have been so much better as a novel.
 Loved this! True Potterheads have been waiting for a very long time for this.
 Not what I expected but it was good.
 Amazing book!! You just have to read to the end to find the perfect ending. I thought is was just a amazing book. I think anybody would who is a Harry Potter fan would love this ending. I choose this rating because of the ending!! I did not like the beginning but I stuck to it to finish the book.
 my granddaughter enjoyed the book
 Must-have for the HP lover.
 I love the story that she was trying to tell but I do not like the format in which she told it. I really hope that the next one is not like this but I have a feeling that it will be.
 I loved this book! I wish it was longer. Anytime is worth escaping into the wizarding world of Harry Potter.
 For a written play, it was pretty well done
 Yeah I’m gonna was wye you like to go home and take care of yourself and I wanna hang out tomorrow night and hang out for dinner and hang out for lunch
 It is a beautiful story, continuing JK Rowling narrative, it revives the wonderful adventures of Harry and his friends and now his family.
 excellent
 There are chunks missing from my copy. So the one star is for that, not the content.
 Love HP and was happy to get this book earlier than expected!
 Love my Harry Potter!!
 Eh!
 This was  a nice add to the original Harry Potter books. I would like more books on Albus and Scorpius and the world of wizardry.
 A little confusing being the play script, and way too short, but still awesome.
 Purchased for my niece. She read it in two days. She was very happy with the purchase
 The book is great, it arrived with a bit of damage to the paperback cover, due to shipping.
 Not the best of the series by far, but still quite good.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.
 The character were not developed. LaY writing. Harry Potter deserves better.
 Cool  the best book I have ever read in my entire life I love the book recommend turn fun book
 I loved the book, thank you so much!!!
 Pre-ordered for my daughter. She LOVED it!
 Good if you like the Harry Potter series. Wished it was longer.
 This book is not Harry Potter "norm". I can't believe I finished the book, thinking something good will come...... I want to say, it was like that movie "Back to Future".. I guess, authors thought We forgotten about it so no one will know.
 I have read all and seen all the movies this was fun to read .
 Great book Is a must reed for any harry potter fan
 Since this was written to be SEEN just reading it rendered it rather flat
 I needed a Potter fix and this was just the thing.
 New adventure for Potter fans. Just like with all of the other Harry Potter books, you don't want this one to end.
 While I certainly missed the fullness of Rowling's writing style as demonstrated in the first seven novels telling Harry's story, I'm willing to look beyond that &amp; accept this story as an enjoyable epilogue.
 Wasn't a huge fan of the way it was written
 The Cursed Child reintroduces many of our old favorite characters and a few new ones as well. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it however it is a completely different experience because it's a play and not a fiction novel. I finished it in no time rather than lugging it around for weeks. Still, I loved seeing old friends.
 I always crave more about Harry Potter and enjoyed learning what happened next in the lives of Harry and the other characters in the Potter books.  I like to read plays and visualize the stage scenes in my mind.  However, if you do not like to read plays, you probably will not enjoy this book.
 You can tell Rowling didn't write it, that she just provided the idea and guidance. Although it was passably enjoyable, and the script format was a fun twist, it felt like fan fiction. I would have preferred that the story ended with the Seventh book.
 Time travel? Really? Not worth the time it took me to read. And I am a fast reader.
 Not enjoying the book because it's hard to read. Will never buy a book again that's written in this format
 This was a gift to someone else.
 Quick read...cannot wait to see the show!
 Enjoy all of the Harry Potter books and this was no exception.  Cool read in a script format.
 Bought this book for my 13 year old daughter, it was delivered on time and even though she was on vacation she did not leave the house until she finished this book, she did so in one day and was going on and on about how good it was.
 Wasn't impressed like I thought I would be. Needed more details in my opinion. Wasn't very imaginative. I expected more.
 It took a minute to get used to the script format. Overall, a great story, it did a good job tieing up some loose ends.
 my wife loved this book.  I will read it when I get some down time.
 Great read!
 All around great experience!
 Really enjoyed it. If you enjoyed the series you'll enjoy this one, 😊
 Nice story with familiar characters.
 It is a little hard to read so far, but I haven't gotten that far yet.
 5 stars!  I loved every word and could imagine in my minds eye, each character and  hear every word spoken.  So glad to be taken to Harry Potters world again!
 a great product and got in good time
 Wife loved it.
 Not as good as the other Harry Potter books, but as a play, it really couldn't be. Still, quite enjoyable, quick to read, and fun to find a continuation to a story you love.
 was a gift, she loved it
 excellent
 It's actually pretty good if you don't take it too seriously.
 I love the Harry Potter series but honestly this reads like a bad fanfiction. Maybe it translates better on stage?
 My daughter wanted this and couldn’t put it down until she finished it.
 I didn't enjoy this book at all.  I thought that JKR would have been better to write it by herself.  I didn't think that the characters would have made the choices that they made...too many leaps, not enough logic.
 Love this book. ..the whole gang on a time traveling adventure.  can't wait for my next visit to Hogwarts. School of Wizardry
 different being in play form ...a little hard to follow at first but wonderful.
 great book
 My daughter (11) got this book and finished it in just over 2 days. She absolutely loves all things Harry Potter!
 I'm a big Harry Potter fan personally, but this book does not have enough action, and adventure for me as a Harry Potter fan.
 Wish she had taken the time to see this story into book from. Throughout the book I felt like this story could have been so much more potterlike if only jk hadn't rushed to make another million off of a quickly written play.
 It was a b'd gift for my son's friend.<br/>She loved it.
 As a die-hard potter fan, I was moderately disappointed in this. The storyline was vapid and simplistic. The Cursed Child just didn't compare with the rest of the books.
 great book
 Very enjoyable but I'd prefer not the play text format.
 Love Harry Potter!  Fun to replay some of my favorite characters from the books. Love all things Harry Potter. Word
 My 13 year old loved this book.
 Maybe my expectations were too high.  Maybe it was the format.  Either way, the worst of the Potter stories -- but still fairly good.
 This play was a great continuation of the Harry Potter story. What I like most about it is that it makes Harry more human than the original books left him. By the end of the series, he was more legend than man. This play restores some of his humanity while not taking away from the legend.
 Brought back memory of enjoyable reading the earlier Harry Potter books.
 Excellent
 Great book for my son!
 As many others who have written reviews on here, I have also grown up with the Harry Potter books. I felt almost scared about reading this play, since I did not want it to take away from the magic of the world the 7 books (and movies) had created.<br/><br/>When finally getting to read the play, I was very positively surprised. I enjoyed that the storyline focuses on just a few characters, as we know it from the other books where Harry, Ron and Hermione used to be the main characters. To me it seemed better this way, instead of trying to give uptdates about each and every characters live (I do realise some characters like Hugo or George are completely left out of the storyline or only touched upon quickly - however, it used to be the same in the books, with for example Hermiones parents only appearing very little. Now other characters are in the main focus, and some we used to "know" better in the books aren't as much talked upon. I don't see this as something negative).<br/><br/>The play seems like an actual new story, while at the same time tying in nicely many questions left open within the 7 books. I had to read it a second time directly after having read it for the first time, and was left with a very content feeling. It seems to confirm things that had happened throughout the books taking away any possible doubts about why something had to happen the way it did happen in the book series.<br/><br/>I can only recommend ready this play, but do keep in mind it is a play - you need to imagine more for yourself - but again, I don't see that as a problem.<br/><br/>I cannot wait to get to see the actual play!
 Reading this book I expected something closer to the previous books, that  it was not. It was good, although not what I expected. It was a nice chance to revisit the Wizarding World and see what everyone was doing. This is not for everybody I would say read it if you really want more Harry Potter.
 Let me just say that I'm THE number one fan of Harry Potter, and really really tried to like this ?can't really say book or screenplay? I needed more words or something to bring me into that world.  I feel so jipped...it was like a child wrote the story for a school report? I'm very sad!
 really did not like the play form, would rather it be in story form like the other books.
 Wonderful! As long as one understands that it is a play and not a novel, it is a great story that gives a little insight into the lives of our favorite characters through their children
 Liked it.
 Convinced my life partner to be intimate with me once again.
 Great addition!
 Great
 This is a quick read. It is written as a script. Would love to see the play.
 bought as a gift and he was really happy! Great book!
 Brilliant book full of very deep thoughts and very entertaining as well. A must read. Greatly recommend for all ages
 I like anything Harry Potter.
 I can see a movie of it in the future
 Story was great. It was difficult reading a screenplay.
 Jk did it again. This one had me in tears. Wonderful interplay between father and son.
 A let down from the other books - I suspect it is because it was written to be a play. Still happy to have read it.
 I enjoyed a lot of the beginning and how the trio was living their lives, but I believe the majority of the rest of the story and plot is so crazy that it's unbelievable. Voldemort has a child?! No thank you. It should probably receive less than three stars, but I love Harry Potter, so what the heck!
 We were excited to read this book but it is no Harry Potter.
 Disappointed in the screenplay format: was looking forward to another good story from Rowling.
 It took a short while to adjust to reading a script but I loved the story!
 It was a Christmas present for my grandson. He loved it.
 This book is so good... Having a hard time putting it down...
 Very creative carry-on of the original story, with room for another sequel.  Loved the flashbacks.  Don't see how they can do this on stage.  I guess I will just have to make a trip to London to see the play. If you have missed characters from the books, you'll be able to meet them again.
 I loved this! I have been a Harry Potter fan for 15 years and this did not disappoint. I saw a lot of negative reviews when I purchased, which I was a little shocked by. But the scripted format didn't bother me at all. My Harry Potter fever has spiked!
 Odd. Not what I was expecting
 It was ok, but not a great work.
 It's Harry Potter.  What more can I say??
 Loved reading this!
 I am a huge Harry Potter fan, and this delivered on all levels!
 Once I got into how the book was written I enjoy very much.
 A fun story.  But it lacks the depth and originality of the original series.  The script form is not ideal for reading, but was less damaging to the story than I feared.  Rewriting it as a novel would have been a good idea, though.
 FANTASTIC!
 Loved it! Can't wait to see the play
 Confusing, boring, not up to Harry Potter standards.
 Compared to the original books, it was a disappointment.
 RK is great
 Love Love Love Harry Potter! I just really wished that it was written as a Novel instead of a production. I understand making it a play but why not adapt to a story? It was really disappointing. It was a great story but I really missed the  classic Potter feel of the books. Overall big let down.
 The work tied up the extended story lines. And , a fine resolution.<br/>Many of my high school students were interested in the Potter saga, and eagerly awaited this last chapter.<br/>Can't wait to see the stage performance!
 Easy to read. Highly recommended.
 I wish that the longer version like the original seven with more depth could be written as well! Well done!
 new
 It read a bit like fan fiction, but for me that is mostly because the voice was off. BASED ON a story by JK Rowling, not WRITTEN BY JK Rowling. Despite that bit of disappointment, I was happy to read about the familiar characters again.
 From a HP Fan......this book was not good.....ERG....I waited YEARS for this! It's an ok read, but not up to the original book standards.
 Fun quick read! Loved this extension
 I liked every part of the amazing books and movies.I did not like how the movies cut out so many scenes.
 Not worthy of bearing the name.  Find it hard to believe Rowling had anything to do with its writing other than she allowed for the use of her characters.  It read like a novice creative writing short story and had no life in it.  Very grey and dull.  😕
 My grandaughter likes the book
 Fabulous. I’ve read all the books many times, but hadn’t ever made it to this. If that’s you, just buy it and get it read. You won’t be disappointed.
 Read it in 3 days. Couldn't put it down.
 Great book I love it!
 It tells a good story and throws some old school goodies in for even the most hardcore of fans to somewhat enjoy. I'd recommend it as a light read regardless though I do keep it separate from the core books.
 I very good read!  Enjoyed how the involved former and beloved characters!
 Loved the theme, but hard to read
 It was ok
 o.k. for play. read sample first,
 Very good book though because it was written in script form and made it a little difficult to read if you knew nothing about Harry Potter.  It was sent in good condition and very quickly
 It was entertaining. Not up to Harry Potter style but worth reading .
 Excellent!  A lot of nostalgia.  Great read!
 I'll be honest.  I was nervous about this story.  One of the things I loved so much about the original Harry Potter series was Rowling's writing style.  She has this way of completely enclosing the reader in the world of witches and wizards.  And as much as I love plays, I just wasn't sure if this would match up.<br/><br/>I want to just state for the record -- I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>The new characters have been taken straight from Rowling's mind.  Thorne did a wonderful job of making Albus, Scorpius, and the new set of Hogwarts witches and wizards the same as Rowling would have, had this been a novel.  For me, that was a huge relief.  It made it so much easier to get sucked into the story.<br/><br/>The storyline was also classic Rowling.  It was a moral story (don't mess with time!) and a story about relationships between fathers and sons (and daughters).  But it wasn't overtly obvious or preachy.  It was just a good story.<br/><br/>I'm not going to make this review very long because if you're a Harry Potter fan, you've already read this or added it to your TBR list.  And if you're not a HP fan...how very dare you!
 As a Harry Potter fan I was skeptical on reading “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child”. After reading the script book for the new play I felt in some ways of going to a family reunion. It was wonderful to see what my favorite Witches and Wizards have been doing over the last 19 years since the last book.<br/><br/>Harry’s son Albus Severus Potter and Draco Malfoy’s son Scorpius have become friends and are brought into an adventure. The chemistry between the two characters is as touching and family feeling as is Harry and Ron. I enjoyed the story that has father and son issues and helps the characters see and heal each other’s pains.<br/><br/>Unlike other Harry Potter book covers that have a meaning to the story. The logo of a boy in what appears to be a snitch made out of a bird nest is somewhat confusing to me. However, after reading the story I believe Albus Potter is the cursed child.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this story after such a long time of missing Harry and the gang. So now I’m even more excited for the new movie Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.
 I didn't expect it to be in script form. Still reading it.
 Didn't like the choice to base the entire story on time manipulation. The idea and action of destroying and entire timeline only to fix it 3, 4 times is a bit of, should I say, lazy writing? Still, it kept me hooked, and was a good read.
 Loved this book and all the Harry Potter memories.
 It's Potter...could there really be anything less than 5 stars?
 If you love Harry Potter, you will absolutely love this story. It is a masterful addition to the world we have come to know and love. Can't wait for it to come to Broadway!!!
 It was an exciting read. Hope the movie can include the actors from the previous stories.
 To see the child grow into the father that he always wanted was a readers delight!
 Easy read. But not up to HP standards
 Bought this for my wife, she loved it.
 Not as good as the HP books, but a fun read for sure!
 It was a great, quick read.  However, don't hold it to the same level as the traditional HP series.
 Loved it! How can you go wrong with J K Rowling!
 I love Harry Potter. Just wasn't long enough!
 I wish I didn't read this one. It was a waste of time.
 I am not through but I got discussed with Harry'sa son.
 Love Harry Potter! I definitely reccomend this if you've read the the rest of the series already
 Bought this for my 14 year old Harry Potter Fan!  He loved it and had it read in a day!
 Interesting read.  Reading a screenplay is a little different experience for me.
 I LOVE Harry Potter and when I heard the cursed child was coming out i was SO excited. It didn't take long to get used to the play format, but the plot is so poorly written. I felt like i was reading a bad fanfic off wattpad. I can't even begin to describe my disappointment with this book.
 gotta love the HP books
 Great book!
 Reading script format was weird but the plot/storyline was unique. So used to audiobook with Jim Dale reading. Thumbs up.
 A must read for all Harry Potter fans!
 I fell back into the magical world of Harry Potter all over again! This book was so amazing and made me fall back in love.
 I can't seem to finish this read. Very unusual.
 Good closure on the Harry Potter saga
 Continues the great story, my 11 year old devoured the book in one weekend
 Even though it was a screenplay and not a regular book , it was well written and made adequate references to past books and situations. Waiting for the book to come.
 This is not a book but a play. The story line was good but wish it read more like a book
 Any who have read the books would enjoy this story.  Hope she writes some more about the children of the originals characters.
 I was not looking forward to reading a script, but it didn't take long to adjust.  I loved the story and wish I could see the production.
 once you get past as reading like a script its fine.
 I was expecting a novel. The screenplay seemed like a cheap way out of real work.
 Awful book, maybe the worst ever written. Would not recommend it expect for maybe as a paper weight.
 Bought for someone who's big fan of the Potter series.
 What can be said? It's as wonderful as I expected it to be and it was over too quickly.
 I recommend it it was good. I figured Albus would be just like his Dad. Read this book it was good
 My daughter loved it - it was a birthday gift
 It was not what I expected as far as a J.K. Rowlings book...
 The magical world of Harry Potter is back! It was a fun read and I loved it! But I can see how some May not like/enjoy it!
 It's good in that I missed seeing these characters and being in the Wizarding World, but know that what you're reading is going to be vastly different from the writing you're used to. First and foremost, it's the script. A lot of the action, scenery, and setting that are so vitally embedded in Rowling's work are left for you to conjure up for yourself--the stage notes aren't entirely helpful. Furthermore, to be quite honest, it reads more like fan-fiction than a true continuation of the rest of the series. I did expect more, particularly with the understanding that Rowling was part of the writing process. Some of the plot points didn't seem to fit quite right, others seemed very far-fetched even within a world based in magical happenings. More still seemed to be out of character with the characters we know and love, even considering the fact that this is set many years after the series proper concluded.<br/><br/>I enjoyed reading it; it was fun to go through and I'm sure that seeing the play brings the story to its audience in a better way than simply reading the script. If you choose to get and read this, go forward with the understanding that it will be a different experience than the books.
 My son like this book. Hi was sleep with it hole week.
 We finally get a few answers that tie up some loose ends.  This will give you an idea some of the history after the Battle of Hogwarts.  Now if we could just get an account of the immediate aftermath and reconstruction of the wizarding world, that would be cool.
 It could have been longer, but its a great extension of the harry potter series! I can't wait to see the play!
 It was okay but not as good as the other Harry Potter Books.
 MEH! Harry Potter in name only! Fast read, but borrrrrrred!
 Great book.
 Love love love this book. I couldn't put it down!! This book does not disappoint.
 I was a Harry Potter fanatic growing up and was VERY disappointed in this play. It was not written by Rowling... It reads like the group watched two or three of the movies and then tried to adapt that limited knowledge to the characters and backstory of the wonderful world Rowling generated.
 good book.
 Loved the book!<br/>Well thought out, good character development.<br/>Heartwarming, scary, and fun! Just like the HP books should be.
 I read the other books in record time, always on the edge of my seat.  This one is just ok, done as a play instead of a book, I'm not sure I would have liked it any better written as a book though.
 Loved it. It was very entertaining. I really couldnt say what I didnt like about the book,<br/> because I found it very good.
 I'm no expert, but if you are a true Harry Potter fan you will enjoy this book. Keep in mind, it is a play.
 4 stars. the storyline and premise are both imaginative and believable. This was the first time I have read a script version, and found it slightly less enjoyable than a novel version. But I truly enjoyed the characters,both old and new.
 Didn't realize this was a script.
 Still a good read but not as interesting as other Harry Potter books.
 Good book. Maybe because it is about Albus, I don't feel as excited as I read Harry's stories. Harry Potter was the first English book I read. maybe this kind of uniqueness raises my level of satisfaction. But, overall it's a good book and worth reading
 Such a disappointment!  First, and my own fault for not reading the fine print, it's not a novel; it's a manuscript for a play.  Think double spaced lines, scene changes every couple of pages which requrie chapter headings limiting print to about 1/2 page.  The book is slightly over 300 pages but the story is probably only a little over 100 altogether.  Virtually no descriptions...unless you count stage directives like 'Harry looks confused', sort of thing.  Richness of words, gone.  Depth of emotion, gone.  It's either conversation or brief stage directions.  Plot is Rowling-esque but contrived to constantly push the relationship pressure between father and son.  Everything else is economy--superficial, shallow.  Not worth the time or the money.
 Just what my angel wanted.
 Hated this.  With JK Rowling's name, I expected much better.
 I was so bitterly disappointed by this book.  I pre-ordered and couldn't wait for it to arrive.  I have been a massive Harry Potter fan for years and was so excited to hear about this book coming out.  I read some of the reviews as they started coming in and was disappointed by all of the negative ones.  I hoped that I would still manage to enjoy the book.  Sadly, I have not.  While the original series was pure magic, this book doesn't come close.  The characters are poorly written, the dialogue is so stilted and unbelievable that I could not get into it.  Harry Potter has turned out to be quite the arse, which I find hard to believe.  The only positive thing that I enjoyed was seeing Draco Malfoy become a more decent human being. I can't believe that JK Rowling actually signed her name to this book. It is so far from anything she could have written that I would think she would be embarrassed by it.
 It's J.K. Rowling--it's fabulous!
 Truly awful
 A poor attempt to continue a really great series
 Great book hope that they make it in to a movie
 I gave it as a gift for my Grandson for Christmas. He loved it!!!
 this was different to read but once i got the hang of it i loved it
 Great read really worked fantastic with the other books.
 Not the best work, but a different medium than her normal novels.
 I knew this was a play and not directly written by JKR, but some of the character relationships and dialogue were just bizarre and cringe inducing.
 AMAZING!!!  The only bad I can say is I wish she would continue write books that take place in the Harry Potter world!!!!!
 Pretty disappointed in the story itself. I knew it would be a script before I purchased it, but the writing just seems very juvenile. That being said, I would totally go see this production as a performance, if only it weren't made canon. As I read, I just kept thinking how it destroyed my ideas about the characters and their relationships.<br/><br/>Thinking about it as a production, I understand the need to have eccentric twists and quirky moments. However, as a book/script that was released as the 8th in the Harry Potter Series... It was very disappointing. J.K. Rowling did such a fantastic job with the series I adored as a child. To read this and relate it to her universe just seems so unfair. It is a disgrace to the world she created.
 Mostly the book just repeated things that happened in other books.  Only a small part was a new story.  I realize they go back in the past, but it could of been more original.  The play format was interesting but it's not my preference.  If I wasn't already a big fan, I would have been really disappointed.
 Poorly written, bad logic, mess of time travel. Shame to be series.
 So cool. Love her stories.
 Made me want to have so much more.
 I have read every Harry Potter book I have been waiting for something new to be released I just wish she would write another book.
 You know those fanfiction stories you read where you start off thinking they're going to be good, but slowly realize that they were probably written by a 12 year old who is obsessed with cheesy dialogue and emo-ness, and wouldn't know a good plot if it hit them in the face? That is what this is. It's a bit harsh, but I honestly couldn't help thinking this while reading, without ever having seen another review.<br/>The plot revolves around Harry Potter's son, Albus, dealing with the insecurities and "consequences" of being the hero of the wizarding world's son. A rift is sown between father and son that continues to grow, despite Harry's best intentions, leading to a series of unfortunate events, beginning with Albus using a time-turner to go back in time to attempt to change the past along with his best friend Scorpius, and the mysterious newcomer, Delphi Diggory. Albus gets more than he bargained for when his meddling sets off a butterfly effect of negative changes to the future. Now he has to try to correct his mistake and save the future, while unaware of the dangers around him.... It sounds interesting enough, but it somehow falls short. The characters are 2 dimensional and out of character. The dialogue and plot are watered down and unrealistic/unbelievable. And great Scott, there are SO many plot holes. I guess I just expected something different. I wanted to go back to Hogwarts and watch Albus grow from there. I wasn't completely against them revisiting scenes from the previous books, because I was curious to see them (briefly) played out in a different way, or as a means to show Albus glimpses of his father's life to give him a different perspective about him. However, I would have much preferred a look into Albus' life at Hogwarts, along with Scorpius, to really understand him and his issues, not a fast-forward synopsis of his life and first 4 years in Hogwarts, minimizing his issues and making it hard to relate to him. Don't get me wrong, there is still good here, but just so much wrong.<br/>Let's go now to the specifics:<br/><br/>BIG SPOILERS ahead:<br/><br/>Good Points:<br/>1. I actually liked seeing this more gentle and affectionate Ron. People might compare him to the movie version, but I think this is in line with what a more grown-up Ron would be like (although maybe a bit more hot-tempered). I think surviving the war, marrying the love of his life, having children, losing Fred, and having overcome his most of his insecurities would mellow him out.<br/>2. Hermione and Ron together. Even in the alternate realities where they weren't always "together," they still loved each other. They're meant to be.<br/>3. Scorpius- how can you not like him? The most likeable character in the play. He has the intelligence/geekiness of Hermione, the positivity of Luna, and the heart of Neville. What's not to like?<br/>4. Scorpius and Rose. Their relationship served as another way to bring together the most opposing houses in Hogwarts. And knowing that Draco had a thing for Hermione makes it better because it's the realization of what could never be, in a positive way.<br/><br/>Negative Points:<br/>1. The dialogue was simplistic, robbing the characters of life and personality, and yet somehow, still making them seem out of character. What happened to the clever Hermione? The feisty and strong-headed Ginny? The calm and wise Dumbledore? And Harry? I don't think Harry would have ever said that to Albus, nor would he have  acted like a total jerk and dictator and prevented him from seeing Scorpius.<br/>2. The "issue" between Albus and Harry. I could have really understood how being Harry's son could be a problem, unfortunately the way it played out was so poorly done it sometimes felt illogical. Maybe it's because time went by so fast or because I'm not visually seeing it played out, but I'm still scratching my head as to the real issue between them, why he was so harsh/unsympathetic to Harry or why he was so hung up on bringing Cedric back. I guess I just couldn't really connect to Albus.<br/>3. Why do the time-turners work differently here? Remember in the book how changes from the future were already being played out in the present (past) during the Dementor attack? There were no alternate realities, no butterfly effects. This is supposed to be cannon?<br/>4. Time-turners again. As soon as I saw the word time-turner I knew Albus would be going back in the past to try to change things, but I never thought he would try to do it so cheaply. "Hey, let's engorgio Cedric's head so he gets humiliated and doesn't win the Triwizard cup. That will change everything." I mean, he really couldn't think of a better plot? Speaking of poorly thought out ideas- Delphi. Why the heck wouldn't Delphi just take the time-turner from the very beginning and go to Voldemort? Why even bother with "the kids" and with Cedric??<br/>5. You're telling me that good, kind, and honorable Cedric would have turned out to be a Death Eater if he hadn't won the Triwizard cup? What? What?? That is so ridiculous and eye-roll worthy.<br/>6. What happened to the other characters? Where are George and the other Weasleys? Why is Ron running the joke shop? Why is he not an Auror? Where are the other Potter and Weasley kids? It's like they don't exist.<br/>7. So Harry Potter, the Auror, savior of the wizarding world, Head of Magical Law Enforcement is now a weenie and can't even take on an 18 year old witch. Yeah, that's right. Are your eyes rolling too?<br/>8. The worst and most unbelievable, incongruous portion of all. Voldemort has a freaking daughter!!?? Are you kidding me?! There is NO way. The only time I can picture Voldemort being remotely interested in pleasure of the body is when he was still young  with a complete soul. After that, I don't think he was even capable of wanting it, especially having no love. Plus, I don't believe he would ever risk producing an heir; and heir would be competition. A child would weaken him, "take" from his being, likely his power. Somebody who could usurp him- a threat. I could sooner seen him making out with Nagini. Add on top of this that, Bellatrix would have been very pregnant around the time that the trio were taken prisoners to the Malfoy Mansion, so it's just a bunch of bologna.<br/><br/>That being said, I realize that this is supposed to be a play and as such I am missing much of the non-verbal communication, acting, and emotion that goes behind it, but it's only a partial excuse. Macbeth was a play... so was the Crucible. That should say enough. I was torn between a 2 and 3 star, but I realized that in all honesty, had this not been "Harry Potter," it would never be a three star. With Jo being so meticulous, I can't understand how she approved this. Not the concept in general, just the direction and specifics. My best advice would be watch the play first.
 It's k.<br/>I'm not the kind of guy that reads dramatization script but I do enjoy creating images that has something to do with Harry Potter stories. It puts my mind into a different world. It is predictable in the end, which is not surprising to me but it was a bit of a twist in the middle of the story.
 Lots of twists turns and surprises-I did not expect the ending! Can't wait to see it on West End!
 Wish it was the story rather than a script.  This is not the book.  Still a great story.  Fast shipping, as described. Recommend seller!
 Easy read, great story.
 oh,, what fun.. great story, fun characters, and the world of great magic....
 It's JKR, expectations were met!
 This book is just so good I can't put it down. Also only 10 bucks for a hard cover!
 It's essentially HP fan fiction. but otherwise, its pretty good
 It seemed like a book that had the characters named the same as J. K. Rowling's first books, but didn't act like them.
 Such a good read. Highly recommend if you're a true Harry Potter fan.
 It was okay. It did not feel like a real Harry Potter story. It also was a little convoluted.
 This Harry Potter book, like the other 7 books, did not disappoint.  JK Rowling is still the queen of fiction.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who is as obsessed with Harry Potter as I am.  The only thing is kind of threw me off is, this book is in play form.  But that did not stop me what binge reading.
 Loved it wish she would write more Harry Potter books
 Total crack!fic, but who cares, it was fun.
 was in theatre so the play form niot a distraction
 Very different than books but once into it I really enjoyed it
 This book was awful.  It was as if it had been written by middle school children.  The dialogue and voices weren't even close to what you would expect of these characters if you'd read any of the other books.  Very disappointing.
 I don't buy hermione as minister of magic, but any story that enlarges the HP canon from jk Rowling mind is awesome to me.  Love the time travel and what happens when you meddle
 Wait this book for a lot time. Great.
 Not my favorite Harry Potter adventure. I figured everything out pretty quickly.
 I like the story line but not a fan of it written as a play.
 Same stuff.  Wish there were new characters and more of the Harry Potter World lore.
 Interesting format and once you got into reading it , the whole story flowed.<br/>Yes it was nice and tidy and tied all the ends up BUT hey it was a happy ending and connected all the characters and I was smiling .<br/>So read it, finish the saga and It was a great ride.
 Not as good as the 7 Harry Potter books but interesting.
 Excellent read.  Can't wait for the next one.
 Loved it. Didn't have very high expectations but t blew me away.
 My son loved this book!
 Love the book and style of writing. The worst part.....it ended.
 It feels like this book was just written to have some kind of extension. It didn't leave upto expectation. Also because it was written in play format it couldn't involve the reader very well
 not the same as the harry potter original series. I would call it fair.
 I read it in 1 day after I got it. It was only slightly different then the orignal books but I can see me buying more if they decide to write more.
 Awesome! Great book! Perfect condition
 was gift to niece, she liked it
 After missing reading the Harry Potter books, I really enjoyed reading more about them.  What can I say, I think they're great books.
 I was  sooo  disappointed  in  this  book! All  of  the  other  Harry  Potter  books  were  top  notch, but  this  one  is  way  below  par. First  of  all, I  really  disliked  the  whole  play  format. It  was  very  difficult  to  follow. Secondly ,  it  just  lacked  whatever  it  was  that  made  the  previous  books  so  great. I  can't  believe  I  spent  $14.99  on this  book, not to  mention  the  3 hours  of  my  life  I  won't  get  back  from  reading  it. You  really  should  have  ended  the  series  with  " The  Deathly  Hallows."
 excellent Highly recommend
 Not as good as a new novel but an enjoyable read.
 I couldn't get enough!
 I don't understand publishing this in play format. Makes it difficult to read.
 good book if you like harry potter
 It must be wonderful on stage, but it still felt like reading a sequel to the series.  It was nice to go back into the world of Harry and the gang.  Highly recommended to everyone who felt a void when the series came to an end.
 My expectations was somewhat different and I think this book does't feel like a Harry book.
 Another excellent adventure of Harry Potter and his mates. Add to it the magic of parenthood for an adult Harry Potter that did not have a father to emulate and have to figure out how to be a father to his rebellious son. Fantastic!
 Wonderful book! Beautifully written!
 Did not like the style of the book.
 christmas gift
 Can't express how dissapointed I was with the book. Lots of inconsistencies in the plot, incompleteness in storylines (i still can't figure out, to what conclusion should this book lead us). It seems that the creators where trying their best to accumulate worst and most trivial fan-fiction ideas in this play.
 I didn't even mind that it was written as a play. Enjoyable from cover to cover
 It is Harry Potter. Weird reading it as play
 Disappointing after the other novel. Was not a real page turner
 the magic of the Harry Potter was not present.
 She did it, she surprised me!
 Couldn't read it as a play...too difficult to sort it the characters and the plot line skips around in time.  Likely much better on stage where you can see the characters and know which generation  they belong to.
 a must read for hogwarts nerds
 interesting character development.  enjoyed the story and the outcome.
 Great book but know what your buying. It's a screen play but still awesome if you are a Harry Potter fan!
 Didn't like play format. Should've been rewritten into a book format and with more detail.
 Was a good play book thingnlol but the only problem was I had trouble with the way it was written, maybe cuz I'm not used to that or something. And it seemed a little sporadic as well. Not what I expected from this author but still a good read.
 a disappointing potter episode after the incredible 7
 A great addition to the series! I was sad to read the last page. It was like saying goodbye to an old friend.
 don't really like screen plays
 Nice to visit some familiar characters. Would have loved it more fleshed out as a proper novel but still enjoyed it as a screenplay.
 Terrible!  A few hours of my life and money that I can't ever get back!  Flat characters and implausible plot!  At least one third of it was dialogue directly from the books.  Atrocious!
 product was as described with fast shipment!!
 Stupid
 Ugh. There's the root of a good story here, too bad it was handled in such an inconsistent manner. Flashes of brilliance, depths of....well...not.<br/><br/>This is titled as a "rehearsal script." I'm interested to see how much of it survived the workshop and previews and made it into the final production -- including all of the wild staging challenges and multitudinous scene changes. This reads like a screen play incompetently posing as a stage play. And the characterizations of the now adult characters -- not a challenge I'd want to face -- is disappointing, to say the least.<br/><br/>Bottom line: this could have been a terrific novel, then movie if written by JKR. I can only hope they were able to fix the stage play. (Now I'll look for reviews of that.)
 Very surprising sequel... Well worth the read if you can leave out expectations about being Harry Potter 8.<br/>This being a play script it has obvious limitations =/<br/><br/>It just made me want to go watch the play that much more!<br/><br/>Damn you J.K. Rownling!
 Great book. Took a little while to get used to the format but still just as enthralling as the Harry Potter series.
 Nice little continuation but wanted more!!!
 I liked it so far but I would rather it be in book form. I'm not to keen on reading plays.
 I am a passionate fan of the HP series. This book, while well written, pales in comparison. As a screenplay it lacks the richness of the world inhabited by the original HP series. The characters - particularly the original trio - are flimsily written, one dimensional. The female characters especially.
 This book literally took me back in time to when I was a teen reading Harry Potter. The writing style is different but the characters personalities has been captured well. And the story, "I open at the close", .
 was a must read but not happy with it
 Need to be written with more depth
 exactly what I expected
 My son is a huge Harry Potter fan. This is a great addition to his collection.
 Took me back to first time picking up first book<br/>Took few pages to get on the script form but at book end wanted more
 I have just finished reading the script and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  This is a script of the play so don't expect the detail you have come to love from the Harry Potter books. The characters, scenes and dialogue cannot be the same as the books, because this a script.  I enjoyed the story line, the cast of characters and the action. The limitation of the script format didn't detract my pleasure of the story.  I thought the characters were very well written.  In particular I enjoyed the portrayal of Scorpius Malfoy, who was very likeable, and I found Albus Potter rather irritating, not because of poor character development but because he was written that way.  Those who gave negative reviews were expecting more of the same from the previous books.  Instead of expecting the same, just appreciate this for what it is: a script of the play.
 Nothing will ever be the same as a JKR novel, but this was a very good extension of the story. It was wonderful to be in the HP world again!
 I enjoyed it as a fan.
 different, but enjoyed it
 One last adventure given to for us. Was strange reading the screen play, but you will get used to kit.
 The only thing my child wanted for Christmas.
 Worst story to come out of the Potterworld.
 Disappointing.  Predictable.  Seemed to be a rushed product.
 I found this very hard to read.  Didn't flow like the books.
 I didn't like the play aspect of the book
 I dislike the format
 My sister loved her book!!!!
 Short for a story in the Harry Potter Series, however I very much enjoyed this installment!
 Great read. Another new and great adventure in the Harry Potter Series. Adds a lot of new and exciting details to an already great series!! Only hope that the series will continue with new and exciting adventures like this one! Definitely recommend this book to any and all.
 The play was extremely disappointing, badly written, not a true Harry Potter story.
 Would have preferred it as a regular novel, but great reading anyway.
 I loved this new chapter of the Harry Potter saga. It's more accessible for adults and kids can still enjoy it. I live in New York and I am waiting impatiently to seeing this play performed on Broadway.
 Arrived on time. Item as described.
 Aunque al principio es difícil acostumbrarse a leer el libro, cuando te acostumbras este se vuelve en un típico libro de Barry Potter
 I AM IN LOVE WITH THE SERIES HARRY POTTER!! This was he perfect follow up to the series. We learned what happened to our gang Harry, Ginny, Ron, and Hermine and to read about their most important missions ever (being parents, husband/wives, and still remaining friends). Parenthood was yet another role that Harry's life never prepared him for this mission as well. To read about Harry's and Ginny's and Malfoy's child being best friends and causing all of the trouble including bring back Harry's worst foe back. This is a must have to have in the Potter collections.  Because I couldn't wait for the hardback to be sent to me I  sent it to my IPad. In my haste to read this new book I lost reason because all I had to do was go to my local 24 hour walmart and pick it up...(DU)
 If you're a HP fan you'll love this book.
 If you love HP and know how to read a play (vs a regular novel) you will love this.
 I love Harry Potter and this is a good sequel. However there are too many scenes borrowed from the past. I was hoping Albus would find a new path not relive Harry's. It was suppose to be a new chapter with new character development. Overall, I loved reading it.
 Was very disappointed that it was in play form
 I'm a big fan of Harry but I couldn't even finish this
 I liked it a lot. Since it's a play, you get short descriptions instead of long ones. It's fine since plays are meant to be performed, not read.
 Nice read, a bit predictable until it wasn't!
 Definitely good read for the nostalgia. Not sure I enjoyed the direction of the characters. Still worth it for the kindle read price
 It read like boring fan fiction. Very disappointing.
 This is not going to end up like you think it will. Bringing the past back to the movies scripts is intriguing.
 The book was amazing! It introduced new themes that you would never expect in a Harry Potter book. J.K. Rowling really found a way to get you to feel the characters emotions! 10/10 would read again.
 Though I read the whole play, I found it fairly boring.
 I read it twice, and really enjoyed the story once I was used to reading the play and stage directions.
 It maintains the same magic as the original series.
 Stupid, stupid, stupid!  Totally lacking in the creativity of JK Rowling
 written in play form and modeled on back to the future  not very entertaining
 Harry's life hasn't gotten any easier... This was a wonderful continuation of their lives, loves and hardships. Can't wait to see it!
 good read for HP fans
 This play script is corny and unoriginal. I honestly expected more from JK Rowling, but it is still Harry Potter so it gets points for nostalgia.
 Not a s good as the other books, can tell that JK Rowling didn't write it. Thought they could have taken the time to write it in a story versus a play. I love Harry Potter so I enjoyed the book, just wished it was a "typical" Harry Potter book!
 Christmas gift for granddaughter
 Didn't realize it was written as a play. Different format for reading but you get used to it.
 good.
 Incredible story plots. It is amazing how she can keep all these twists in her head at the same time. Part one was fantastic reading and then she does it again in part two.
 Gift to my grandson
 Missing too much description because it's a screen play.
 All was as advertised.
 gift was read in 2 days he was very pleased
 Awesome
 If JK Rowling touches it, it's gold!!!<br/>Once again a non-stop read. Can't put it down, once you start it.
 Was not as good as other books was ok
 Not bad, but nothing great either.
 It way okay. I wish I was just starting the Harry Potter series and hadn't ever read it before. What a wonderful experience. Difficult to live up to that milestone. But, did still enjoy the script. Would love to see the play.
 Glad to have Harry, Ron &amp; Hermione back! Really missed these guys &amp; so sad this will be the last time we get to read about them.<br/><br/>It was a little strange reading it in play form at first, but I quickly got used to it.
 Good but not really her best work.
 It was o.k
 Not a real book like the rest but still amazing...couldn't stop crying at the end!
 Really enjoyed it.
 Despite it being a play write, it's an easy read. I'm not a fan of the story itself. It seems hastily put together, and not all thought out. I guess that's because of the use of time.
 Brilliant, it was better than I could have imagined.
 JK Rowling is amazing!
 Only a muggle would miss this :)
 This reads like bad fan fiction. 2D characters not true to themselves. They could have done so much more with the plot line. But they decided to cash grab instead and prey on the Harry Potter name and Rowling fans. I was ready to like even something average knowing that the any high expectation will likely make me disappointed. BUT even so, as much as I tried to like it - it feels like a really bad epilogue. This work is actually a mark of disrespect to the characters we know and love.
 She loved it and read it in a day. She's happy so I'm happy.
 Bought it for my wife and she loved it
 I bought this a while ago and still haven't finished it. It just didn't pull me in like the other books and was kind of boring. A shame because I love harry potter books
 I found this to be terrible. It is not the Harry Potter we know and love. The script format is awful, disjointed, and not well organized. Yes, it is a fast read because there are so few of the elaborate and intricate descriptions that J.K. has developed in the original set of stories. I wish I could get my money back!!! &gt;-)
 Great book - arrived on time!  Packaged well.  Happy!!
 Finished it within a day. It's Harry Potter...enough said.
 Not what I was expecting 😔 the sale was great and in great condition, the story itself wasn’t what I was expecting
 Good read!
 The book is good but not as good as any past books by JK Rowling.
 good book
 Written as a play script instead of a novel. :-(
 Didn't like format at all.  Difficult to get into the story.  Reading a play is one thing.  Seeing one another
 I enjoyed it very much!
 It was ok but didn't grab me the way the originals did. It felt like a forced book.
 This book is awesome right from the beginning I was drawn in and couldn't put the book down
 amazin as usual
 Great timing, book is wonderful.  . . different to read in play form.
 Good book. Not up to the originals standards
 Bought this for my daughter's birthday.
 This was a gift.  The person was very excited - excellent price
 Wait to see if this will be made into a movie.
 Another J.kK. Rowlings classic!!!!!!  Read it NOW!!!!
 One of the  best books I've read! My family and I have read or reading it. Great book for teens, kids, and adults.
 Disappointed.  Enough people have already stated why.
 A very good book to read. Back into the world of Harry Potter.<br/>Only negative thing about the book is that it is written in screen play style.
 It was a wonderful read that had me turning each page in excitement. Loved how they showed the true consequences of time travel. Also loved harry and albus's imperfect relationship.
 It was great, just what I had hoped for. Of course I still would like more and a little more back story to sevrus' time at hogwarts but maybe we will get more books....
 I gave it four stars because it was written like a play but I quickly was able to bypass that. Love the future book and how it stayed true to the characters
 I enjoyed it a lot. I've missed Hogwarts.
 Not what you want, but maybe what you need
 Everything she writes is gold.
 great!
 Not to my taste.
 Omgomgomg. I COULD NOT put this down once I started reading it. Oddly, the screenplay format does do the story justice. So many layers within the story: father/son, friendship, a story of understanding oneself, and the altogether 'normal' story of good v evil.<br/><br/>Just want to say that I LOVE the characterization of Scorpius Malfoy, and imho, Rose Granger - Weasley comes across as having the worst traits from her parents: her mother's stubbornness and her father's prejudice. Album Severs has the broodiness of his father, and Draco Malfoy is still the Slytherin we all love.<br/><br/>So, question: just who IS the 'Cursed Child?' Is it Harry, who can't escape being 'the Boy Who Lived' even at age 40? Is it Albus, who is "cursed" with having an infamous father and legacy to live up to? Or is it Scorpius,  who is "cursed" with rampant gossip about his parentage as well as the nearsightedness of his friend (Albus) and his potential love interest (Rose) (btw, the play between Rose and Scorpius would make anyone think of James and Lily Potter).
 Not as stellar as the hype made it out to be. But good. Ive read better fanfics. I think this would be interesting to see on stage though.
 I didn't love it at first, but by Act 3, Scene 7, I was hooked! It was hard to get used to the different voice of the author and the format of the script, but it was truly a marvelous trip back into the wizaeding world!
 My grand son love it
 For a play, it was a good read.  I enjoyed the story and the moral was a good one.
 Nothing actually happens plot-wise. Very little character development. A huge disappointment.
 This was a great continuation to the Harry Potter saga. A must read for all Potter fans!
 Play format was confusing,  over all I was a bit disappointed.  To much on father son relationship.
 Pretty good, not as good as the originals but still a good read.
 Although a shorter story with less details, it's still a great story about the Harry Potter World. A wonderful play I hope to see in NY.
 0 Stars.<br/>Terribly written.<br/>You have cursed and tainted the minds of children around the world - so wharped, so cheap writing, so unoriginal. Wasted USD 14.99 reading crap. Wish I could use a memory charm to wipe my memory off this story.
 I love anything and everything HP. This did not disappoint.
 A great addition to the Harry Potter series. Especially for those who had missed J. K. Rowling's world of magic and wonder.
 Not really sure why everyone is hating on this so much. Yes, it doesn't read like a typical HP book, you get used to it very quickly and don't even realize you are reading a script. Great story, great addition to the HP novels and anything J.K Rowling touches is magical...literally. For sure recommend!
 Well written carry on the Harry Potter series.  Enjoyed this easy read look into the character's later lives.
 From the end of the Deathly Hallows, I truly felt like it picked right back up where the story left off.<br/>I loved the struggles and trials Albus faces and the friendship bringing the Malfoy's together with the Potter's.
 I misunderstood this to be the regular book not a script.
 Made great gift!
 Way to finish off.
 Clever twist at the end. Difficult to keep suspense reading it as a play. I'm sure it<br/>works much better visually. Good to revisit Harry Potter world.
 Loved it, especially the twists! JK Rowling doesn't disappoint. Hope to see the play or movie someday. It was a fast read too!
 Disappointed. Story and dialogue did not ring true.
 Oh my goodness it was great! Reading this I felt like I was watching the play first hand,and I loved every moment of it. To be honest I just wished it was longer and/or that there will be a continuation
 Enjoyed it but wished it was longer :)  great follow up to the series. Hope there's more to come soon!!
 My son loved the way is written as a script. He can't put it down
 It was ok. I realized going into this that it was a stage script, and would therefore be missing many of the things that made the books so wonderful, as well as the somewhat constricting sense of space that plays tend to have. What I did not expect was such a poorly thought out plot. Spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>I really thought this was going to be a story about the next generation, and while there were some new characters, this was a rehash of old ground...literally. It is all about time travel. I am not a huge fan of the time travel conundrum. It has been done many times, and certainly better than this foray into it. Introducing this element to the Harry Potter franchise in general is very problematic. I realize there was some of this in the stories already, but not to the extent that this one goes to. One of the other issues is that the whole adventure is such an unbelievable premise (bringing back Cedric Diggory) and out of character for these newly established characters that it is commented on by the other characters in the play. Sloppy writing.<br/><br/>One of the worst examples of the sloppily written plot is the alternate universe where Snape is still around. First, there is no explanation as to why he survived, when the wand problem would have still existed (why he died to begin with), nor is there explanation as to why Voldemort et. al. still trust him and why he is palling around with Ron and Hermione, when they still would not know why he killed Dumbledore. I'm sure there could be some explanation, but none is given. It seemed like it was just an excuse to bring the character back. I loved Snape as much as the next person, but this did nothing to further his character and I would have rather they left him in his grave.<br/><br/>All in all, I'm sure this is much better seen as a play, and they probably should not have released the script for that reason. I'm sure as you experience it, some of these things might be less important to just being in that world again and seeing it, but I can't imagine that the spectacle can entirely confund one from recognizing the bad writing beneath it.
 Great story, HORRIBLE format. Was really annoying to read it as a play but loved the actual content.
 hated the format  didnt know it was gna read like a script.  very dissappointed
 love it
 It's Harry Potter - of course it's frikkin amazing.
 Exactly as stated and expected
 3.5. Liked the idea, def had some holes. Like, how in the world was Delphi hidden for so long, why is she coming out now? Would've been more interesting as a full novel but as a manuscript, left a bit to be desired. Enjoyed remembering the details from the books though.
 It came in perfect condition !
 My daughter loved it
 This book pulled me In. I couldn't stop reading. It really did a great job keeping you on your toes.<br/>If you loved all the original Harry potter books you will love this.
 Good
 I thought I would have difficulty  reading  dialog,  but it was easy getting used to.
 Enjoyed the story as a rooted for a happy ending.
 Received the book in perfect condition. My son LOVES the Harry Potter stories.
 Although a different kind of read. still enjoyable.
 My kid loves this item, Thanks.
 Not nearly as good as the normal books
 disappointed
 A bit fan-fiction-y w/ at times cheesy themes, this new HP story still manages to be a fantastic follow up... A quick and easy read as well.
 like it
 Because it was written as a play instead of a book it was harder to really get to know the characters as well but all in all, still very enjoyable.
 This book lived up to all my expectations and I was so glad to be in the world of Harry Potter once more and revisit all my old friends.
 An HP fan must have.
 Potter fans: don't get your hopes up.
 I had written a review but after seeing all the negative, I decided to change it completely and elaborate.<br/><br/>For anyone saying that the characters do not stay true to themselves, I'd like to question whether you believe you would be the same as your teenage self 19 years down the road. No, you will not be. No one could expect you to be. So why do you open this book with the expectation that you will be reading the characters in their teenager minds.<br/><br/>They have grown, they have changed and most importantly, they have had children. As a parent, I can tell you that I am no where close to being who I was before my daughter. If you haven't had kids, you would not understand.<br/><br/>My last point is that we never really got much insight into their adult lives in the previous books. We got one chapter. ONE. The lines from that chapter existed in this story as well.<br/><br/>So for those that choose to not read it or give it a bad review simply because it's the characters don't stay true to their teenager selves, I say wait 19 years and see how much you have changed.... then judge this book again.
 Loved being reunited with the Wizarding World again.
 Nice
 Excellent!
 YES to this book! satisfied my harry potter needs.
 Great story. I love how some important characters made reoccurring roles. I thought the story was very funny at times. I love Harry as a father. Captivating and hard to put down. Five stars =)
 I did'nt like the "stage play" format.
 I thought this was a novel, not a screenplay
 Love the story.  Difficult to read script.
 I enjoyed it, and was surprised by some of the plot lines, but it kept me interested and read it quickly.
 It was so nice to read about HP after so many years and to get into this story where unexpected things happen. There are so many 'what ifs' that I was getting lost, but not really. It was a wonderful journey to go back in time and over again.
 another excellent story!
 it is a screenplay
 great story...yet far out...
 I definitely enjoyed the book. It had a few surprises just like every other Harry Pooltterbook I’ve read. I started reading and couldn’t stop until I had finished!
 I devoured this!
 I bought it for my wife and she loved it! She was dying there isn't another one out yet.
 I love the Harry Potter books--this did not let me down!
 Just okay.
 I was ready for so much more. I hated reading this as a play - act by act. I'd imagined the continuation of the story and a whiny "why me" did not hit the spot. I have read better fan fiction on JK Rowling blogs.
 Harry Potter snd the Cursed Child is as entrancing, complex, layered and nail-biting as any of its predecessors. Highly recommended to any Harry Potter fans.
 I found it very confusing. It is written in play format and the explanations of the scenes ruin the book. Very disappointed!
 The best follow up to the original sotry cant wait to see the play
 not what I expected, due to the script format
 I am sure that the story is fine, and have been waiting for more of the Harry Potter adventures; but, it is very difficult to read the script version of the book.<br/>I would like to have a "regular" version of the book.
 I expected a story, not a script.  Boring
 Just read it! ❤ I ordered it to my kindle and couldn't stop reading it!
 The story was really cheesy. I'm a huge fan of Harry potter, but this book is terrible. I hope that future Harry potter books will be better.
 I loved they way the new and the old was incorporated.  My heart needed some familiar faces and I got them. Thought the story was great.  Can't wait for more.
 Had I paid a little more attention, and knew it was in a play format and not really written by J.K.Rawlings, I would not have bought it.
 It's a play, not the book. My bad.
 Very fun read.  Makes you want more!
 As a theatre professional (and HP fan) getting my hands on this script was awesome. This is not a novel by JK Rowling but a story based on the world that she created. And if you are lucky enough to see the show please remember a script is the starting point, not the final product.
 Great item, just as described!!!
 Amazing.... loved it<br/>Perfect continuity to the saga ...makes you want to keep readding until the end, I liked so much I read it twice
 Easy read, nice to see the beloved characters again!
 This was a gift for my granddaughter.  She loves it.
 Loved it! JK Rowlings is a genius
 Amazing....couldn't of ended this saga better.
 This was a fun and fast read. It doesn't have the detail of the original books, since it's a script, but the magic is there. I would like to see the play or see this turned into a normal book.
 Arrived quick and was a perfect surprise!
 binge time
 Not as good as the first 7, but still great.
 A great winter read
 Ruined Harry potter for me. Bad decision to read it😒
 It nailed the angst of teenagers.
 It was alright. It didn't seem like another real Harry Potter book.
 I find it a little difficult to imagine the physical surroundings when reading a play.
 I love Harry Potter and I bought this book based on the previous ones, I have not finished it but so far so good!
 I did not care for the script format
 Even though it was a script I think it was still pretty good. It just wasn't as descriptive as the other books but this is a script. I can't wait to see the play!
 My son received this book for Christmas and he loves it!
 I enjoyed it but then I love all her books.
 I love all things Harry Potter, including this book! It was slow to start and I was a little unsure but it turned out great! I really hope there will be more someday!
 Loved this book!!
 Loved every bit of it. I read within a week.
 No where near as good as the original series.
 Awesome
 It was well written.<br/>And written as a play didnot bother me at all.<br/>The only thing is that I do like the rest of the books more than this one.
 Want to see this play so bad!
 I love all the books, but I did not realize it would be written as a play.
 Would've better as a book rather than a play. It is missing all the background atmosphere that shows authors skill.
 Great story. It was nice to get a little more Harry Potter!
 Excellent Read. Now they need to craft it into a movie..
 A fun read, wish I could see the play!
 Not as good as the Harry Potter Series.
 Hard to put down.  Glad to see Harry is "still alive and well"
 Fantastic addition to this story line! I really hope they continue.
 Reads like bad fan-fiction to be quite honest. The premise is decent, but it's so poorly executed. Guess I expected more since it is sanctioned as cannon.
 A satisfying read, although some may struggle with this being a script and not a novel.
 Stunningly boring.
 I would have preferred it was written as a story and not a play.  Otherwise good.
 Great nook
 This was a very touchy book for me at first. To see harry and his friends all grown up and with kids, well that was just very different. However, this book did not let me down. I cried I laughed and I smiled so many times throughout this book. A job well done if I do say so myself.
 Beautiful cover! Hard back book. Brand new!
 very entertaining
 Loved it I want MORE
 Not high art, but entertaining and satisfying. Rowling teases our need for all things Potter and leaves us wanting more.
 great for any Potterhead
 Bought it for my grandson.  He loved it.
 Love the Harry Potter Series!  They never fail to entertain!
 Daughter loved it.
 This was a gift and the recipient was very happy.
 I don't feel like this story really embodied the characters as it should have. I definitely agree that it read more like a fanfiction
 The story continues.  Written in play format.  Quick read . . .  a must for every Harry Potter fan.
 Wish we could see the play here!
 What a magical addition to the series. My son and I both loved it!
 was expecting a novel
 Very fun and fast reading. Hard to put the book down.
 A necessary read for all Harry Potter fans
 Nice read!
 Amazing.
 Just ok. Not a fan of the play format.
 It didnt have the same impact as the rest of the Harry Potter books. It seemed more childlike than the series. as if aimed at a younger generation.
 Not my favorite
 Love it.
 Excellent book
 Loved this book! Great continuation of the story.  I would love to see this play in London!  Cant wait to pass the book along to my mom and friends to enjoy as well!
 Great! Would've given 5 stars, but I kept wanting it to be in novel form. Because it is in play form, it lacks the nuances of a novel. But, the play does bring back the magic that we love from the original seven books. Great story, great characters, great theme.
 I loved it. Reading in play format was am adjustment, but the story was worth it.
 My wife and daugther loves HP books.
 GREAT PRODUCT
 Can't wait to dig in!!!!
 Wonderful, plenty of gasps and twists. Perfect way to end a perfect series
 It was ok it would have been better as an actual book and if the made the movie and at sometimes it would be all over the place. But all in all it was still a good book and I'm glad that I got to read it
 The story was rushed. The plot and mannerism of the characters were not synonymos of the original ones. The script format was a bit annoying. It just didn't measure up.
 Slow beginning, but I like that JK Rowling was able to explore different scenarios that did not take place in books 1-7.
 This play is nonsensical, does not follow established rules in canon, shows beloved and 3-dimensional characters acting completely out of characters, is poorly written and all in all destroys the magic of the Harry Potter universe. If I could give it -5 stars, I would.
 I read this the entire series the day each one came out. I'm having a hard time with this one!  Not grabbing me the same way!
 A good update on the Harry Potter series.
 This book met my expectations for what I thought a "script book" might be like. Skimpy in detail, and loaded with theateresque, dramatic dialogue (which again, is what I was expecting). That being said, I think this script book told a good story. It took me about 4 hours to read, and I didn't want to put it down. If the average, diehard, HP fan reads this book with realistic expectations, I think he or she may find it enjoyable. The one thing I didn't like about this book is how rushed it was. And I couldn't help but think the whole time how awesome it would have been if JK were to make the cursed child into a 3 or 4 book series with all of the same magic that came with Harry Potter.
 Wonderfully written;  great to have another "chapter" in the Harry Potter saga.
 Currently reading. So far like it.
 Easy to read and well written
 Inspiring as a father I can love honestly. What a great story and closure to a great and grand tale.
 good
 Good book
 Reading it as a play took away from the story a little at first, and then I got into it and finished the book quickly.  Hoping for another adventure with Albus and his friends.
 Not as good as I had hoped it would be. Would have been better if it weren't written like a play. It takes away from the story.
 Reads like fan fiction, unfortunately.
 I've been a big Harry Potter fan from the beginning (like most of the reviewers). I blindly pre-ordered this 8th book back in March, without realizing it was a play script instead of like the other clever, witty, well-written stories of before. My mistake completely on that.<br/><br/>Anyway, even though I despise script reading because I find it to be choppy and hard to let imagination flow smoothly, thought I'd give it a try because no Harry Potter book could be bad, right? Wrong. Lacking everything that made the other Harry Potter books so great, from the very first dull act of the first lame scene. Will leave details out do those who want to read for themselves can, but just don't set the bar too high for your expectations on this one.<br/><br/>So disappointed.
 not as good as the potter books
 Not thrilled with it. I don't care for the format.
 While many have expressed their deep displeasure with how this new foray into the HP world, I actually enjoyed barring two parts that didn't fit the timeline, in my opinion.<br/>(Spoiler alert)<br/>1) Where Harry and company watched baby Harry's parents get killed by Voldemort, you see Hagrid cine and take Harry. Where is Severus Snape? In the books and movie we know he found and rocked Lily's body while Harry watched.<br/>2) Found it a bit difficult to believe that Bellatrix had Delphi at Malfoy manor without Draco knowing his aunt was pregnant. Also found ity hard to believe that Narcissa would allow Delphi to be raised by someone other than a Malfoy. Just my opinion, however I did enjoy the twist.<br/>If you read this play, try not to make it into a spin of the original Harry Potter books.  This is a much older (40ish) man who isn't perfect, has his flaws, struggles to be a parent, etc. People change and we are fallible. Read it for what it is (barring the two major timeline issues noted above), and enjoy something new.<br/>Honestly, this is an enjoyable read if you can separate the two Harrys. I enjoyed his adult flaws, it made the story more believable. I think the young Harry attitude would have been harder to fathom at this age as whimsical and accidentally getting caught up in things would have made him seen a even worse parent and made it hard to see his marriage to Ginny as believable and real.<br/>I'll make a final note, that maybe will help readers decide, a comparison. In the 10th anniversary edition of "Twilight", Stephanie Meyers made a leap with changing almost all of the characters into reversal roles. Many people supremely disliked this and couldn't handle the story because it wasn't of the original Twilight ilk. If you were one of those folks, who couldn't deal with such major change, then I believe you may not enjoy this screenplay.<br/>Hope this helps. Honestly, how can reading another HP reality hurt, in my opinion, but I pretty much love the HP world, so it's easy to be open minded and ready for something different. A bit if a challenge, yes, but worthy.
 I'm not big on plays but after a couple of chapters I got used to it. The book skipped forward too much. Was hoping for more. Over all not a bad book if you're a Harry Potter fan.
 I prefer reading in prose rather than in drama.
 Good, but not on par with her previous work. Still if you are a fan, you will like it.
 No spoilers: This is a nice addition to the HP collection. I am an avid HP fan and I still listen to 1-7 on audiobook on a regular basis. This book is in a different format, so it's a little difficult to get used to. Also, it's not difficult to tell that it was a collaboration. However, I feel that JK shed light on more of the HP world in the past and the present. I really didn't want this book to change my view of the older books, but it did in a good way. I think I'll have to read this again before I really know how I feel about it, but the fact that I liked it after one time through gives me hope. It was the same with Deathly Hallows, it took a couple of reads to really appreciate it.
 Just as good as I expected it would be! Wasn’t sure about the format at first but I actually really enjoyed it!
 Nothing more than fan fiction.
 At first I was mad at the book because of the direction it was going with Harry son but it got better and I started to understand more why.  It was very good and interesting to read.  I was sad it ended.
 a goodtry
 Was too short of a story
 The characters didn't seem genuine and true to the original books, and the plot and dialogue was bad. I understand this is a "script" and the plot can't get too detailed, but it wasn't really witty either.<br/><br/>This should be considered fan fiction, and JK Rowlings name should not be on the front cover. Cursed Child couldn't be further away from her HP work.
 I read this entire book with a great amount of hope that somewhere or somehow along the way the marvelous work that I have come to expect from a Harry Potter book would emerge.  Sadly, it did not.  When I got the "the end," I felt very unsatisfied.  Let's just let legends remain legends and not taint the Harry Potter legacy with this piece of very weak work.
 It was almost predictable I enjoyed the play formatt and character growth
 Arrived in excellent condition.
 Awesome!!
 The story was a little strange, but still a fun adventure.
 Just... disappointing...
 Wonderful
 Good book
 Good storyline, but I don't enjoy  reading a story in play form.
 Very good book, but not same caliber as original series
 My daughters said not quiet as good as the other books.
 Good story line but not as developed as I had hoped.
 Good story.
 Lots of details that were different from the movie.
 It was SO amazing to see how Harry,Hermonie, Ron and even Draco became adults! This got my heart pumping in several action paced areas. I wish it had JKR's amazing visual writing style but with the play it does not have all of if.  It is still amazing!
 A good read. I loved it!
 a quick read
 If i had known the format.......a play, i never would've bought it!!!!!
 A look toward the third generation of Potters, Weasleys, and Malfoys.  With the use of a time turner Albus Potter and Malfoys son, best friends from the house of Slytherin, almost change history, and everyone's future.
 Great
 The plot seems a bit recycled but exploring the lives of the characters is what made this book worth reading. If you like Harry Potter you'll end up reading this one for sure.
 This is a gift so I just barely skimmed contents.
 Loved it.  Reading the whole series again.
 A must read. Can the movie be far behind?
 no, it was lacking in many things
 Very talented story telling and fantastic imagination. When I bought the book o thought there’s nothing to till. However there was a lot I was missing.
 Not up to JK Rowling standards in my opinion, but a good little read, especially if you are already a Potter-head.
 I Will not buy a plaid book again . There is not enough descriptive details that a regular Harry Potter books has.  All the other books I gave 5 stars
 The story was good. I did not care for the Play format.
 If you like Harry Potter, don't do it.
 A great easy read to take you back into the Harry Potter world!
 Not as magical as the original series but enjoyable nonetheless. Good to be back to Hogwarts. I think JKR should now focus on other books.
 I am a fan of the Harry Potter books.  I am glad to find out about his children.
 JK Rowling is amazing.
 This was a gift. She loved it!
 Hard to follow in script form. story too convoluted to be enjoyable has to be re edited for book version
 Part Two really cracks! Would love to have seen it live.<br/>Maybe in America?<br/><br/>Recommended highly for all Potter fans.
 Very interesting adaptation.
 Good book. Not as good as the originals!
 Book was OK but not up to the past Potter books
 The gift receiver was absolutely enamored by the box. So much so she willingly stopped protecting her husband from me. A little backstory... I was friends with her husband first and throughout the years of knowing him he has sold me inch by inch more pieces of his sphincter and color starting from his anus. These were transactions that usually included me feeding him delicious home cooked meals or treating him to a "Man Date." I am a Straight Man but we've played this game where we try to catch each other off guard and do things like cop a feel, grab butt, or even do Kancho (see definition below).  After he met his wife she's tried to be his shield. Why I am telling this story?  After gifting his wife this as a Christmas Present she said to him that she cannot protect him any more because I gave her the Best Present Ever.<br/><br/>Long story short: This can make wives stop protecting their husbands from being molested or violated.<br/><br/>*Kancho is a game or trick often played in Japan by young school-aged children; it is performed by clasping the hands together so the index fingers are pointing out and attempting to insert them into someone's anal region when the victim is not looking.
 This really doesn't feel like an HP book - none of the characters have any of their original charm, the story is a silly one and it seems that JK Rowling's only feedback was to remind the playwright of a few choice quotes... quite disappointing.
 I delved into this book with mixed feelings. I had high hopes for this book but had also read many negative reviews. Having read it today I can tell you it is the worth reading. For me personally this story confirmed many theories I had about the plot and characters and also surprised me with many unexpected plot points. This is also a book of contradictions. While some characters are barely involved and remain very two dimensional, others are explored vividly and very well fleshed out. For me the biggest disappointment in the story was the main conflict which at times was redundant, predictable and a bit ridiculous. However, the relationship explored between Harry and his son Albus is what makes the book worth reading in my opinion, and is well explained. For many Harry Potter fans who have their own ideas of what happened after Dealthy Hallows you may be disappointed. However, if you read with an open mind I think for most this will be a great read and addition to the Harry Potter world.
 Loved the book
 Good for a quick read
 I am sad I’ve reached the end of what’s current... and look forward to what is next. (post on amazon)
 I didn't think the comments that Rowling's Harry said to his son were in character.  Harder to read than I expected.
 Poorly written,
 As promised.  Thank you!
 Harry and son Albus learn to respect each other
 Just didn't hold my interest.
 For the past three years, Harry Potter has been my life. I love the plot of the story, I love the characters, and I love the author. But this book is a little bit different...<br/><br/>If you didn't know, this book is a script book. So the writing is a bit different and a bit hard to follow. So if you are a Harry Potter fan, I will tell you this is NOT like the other books. It is a play in London.<br/><br/>Also, most people are upset about what house Albus is in. I know, it's different, but this book is supposed to show that Albus dose NOT want to be like his father.<br/><br/>But here's one thing that kind of upset me. I wish that the author was only J.K. Rowling. I think that the book might have been different if it was only her. But the other authors were still wonderful.<br/><br/>And lastly, the book lacked adventure. Which was also upsetting. But it was supposed to have a lot of heart and it definitely did.<br/><br/>So read this book. It will make you laugh, cry, and stay awake all night.<br/><br/>Enjoy!😊
 It's a great, quick read for fans of Harry Potter!
 Can't wait to see the play!
 Finished this book in one day and absolutely loved it. Reading it in script style was different but something I'm use to so it was wonderful to able to use my imagination. Definitely recommend you to spend your money on this book.
 Not as good as the original books,  but still allows you to re-visit your favorite characters.
 Was not a great fan of the book..
 weird screen play format
 great
 This was not the worst thing I've ever read but it certainly isn't the best.  Something end for a reason
 Bought to put with my collection.
 Excellent
 If a boggart were to come out of a cupboard, it would be in the form of this book. It was atrocious.
 The performance style writing leaves out some of JK Rowling's vivid descriptions and story telling depth. Overall a good read that does not sacrifice any of the beloved original series.
 My daughter enjoyed this book.
 The play format does not work for me.
 So good!
 It was not up to the excitement of the other books.
 ok nothing special
 I have to follow HP! Thanks for letting me enjoy the HP World once again!
 Love this book and JK Rowling
 Format is hard to read. Not like her other Potter works. Nice follow up and conclusion to the story line.
 Fun
 Super! Read it in two sessions and loved it.
 great story
 My grandson loved this book
 This is not a true Harry Potter book. To many things happen that do not fit into the original 7 books.
 good experience
 Characters didn't feel as real and they did in the other books. Harry didn't even seem like he was the same person nor did Ginny. I was hoping for a bit more but then again being a play instead of a book could be the reason it doesn't feel as magical as the books
 Disappointed.  Not up to the quality of JK Rowling
 Potterheads be warned: don't expect reading Harry Potter and the Cursed Child to be anything more than a fun way to spend three hours. Plays are always fast reads, and reading a play while catching up with four or five of your most magical childhood friends cannot possibly be considered a waste of time. HPCC, however, is not going to appease readers who are expecting:<br/><br/>(A) any form/genre of literature that isn't a play and<br/>(B) anything that truly/significantly alters the "canon" story line that was left behind by Years 1-7 and the Deathly Hallows epilogue.<br/><br/>These points are meant to provide the basic parameters of what can even begin to be considered reasonable expectations for this anticipated addition to Rowling's wizarding world. Without these caveats in mind, it would be difficult for anyone to read HPCC without feeling uncomfortably surprised, understandably betrayed, or immeasurably disappointed.<br/><br/>I bring up Caveat (A) because I am reasonably confident that there are/will be a solid fraction of Cursed Child readers and buyers (at least among Americans) that will dive in completely ignorant to the fact that it is, in fact, a play. Those within this demographic who are also without any play acting/reading experience will (probably) feel confused and betrayed.<br/><br/>Being a play, readers should also remember that JK Rowling is explicitly credited with the story. Jack Thorne, a seasoned writer of works for the stage, silver screen, and TV was a major influence on (at least) the shape of majority of the dialogue and stage directions. Writing a novel for readers and writing a play for theatergoers are, obviously, unique literary conquests. We should all be thankful that Rowling was gracious/modest enough to collaborate with an experienced playwright.<br/><br/>Caveat (B), without venturing into spoiler territory, is, in my eyes, essentially true. The Harry Potter plot line and characters that millions of us know and love are not disrespected or desecrated in any fashion. Whether or not their nostalgia factor is shamelessly exploited at points in the play is the more pressing matter up for serious debate. The sacred texts remain sacred. No crusades, inquisitions, or jihads necessary. The canon story line that was left behind by Years 1-7 and the Deathly Hallows epilogue remains, within reason, untouched and unaltered.<br/><br/>Measured up against the world-altering developments wrought by the end of every Year 1-7 novel, little progress is made in Cursed Child. Beyond an old folks home for wizards, there are no new locales or revelations of any lasting in-world impact this time around in the wizarding world. That's not to say that fans are not rewarded with more subtle glimpses into the relationships between Harry, Ron, Hermione, and their children decades after Deathly Hallows.<br/><br/>The Cursed Child is at its strongest when it digs into these relationships. If HPCC suffers from anything, it is from not offering enough of these character-based nuances to readers. That being said, other readers and myself must remember that this is a play. A play meant to be performed by actresses and actors that will lend layers of emotion and physicality to these lines and characters that can only fully manifest themselves on the stage. If the dialogue reads as "flat", "unlike these characters", or otherwise "off", it because a plays are ultimately meant to be experienced as performances, not texts.<br/><br/>Other possible complaints will include:<br/>- Why did it have to be a play?<br/>- Why isn't (X) character in the play?<br/>- Why does HPCC read like fan fiction?<br/>- Why is it a play?<br/><br/>These are all interesting questions if fans and literary scholars are legitimately interested in exploring them, but unfortunately, more often than not they will just remain unfounded complaints; empty thoughts that give readers an excuse to trash a play for being a play or will serve as an attempt to place their own fan fictive imaginations and would-be realities on a pedestal. I'm not saying everyone will feel like this, but looking over other Goodreads and Amazon reviews I know that many do or will. Me? I say go into reading Cursed Child expecting a fun few hours. Go into the theater to see Cursed Child expecting your mind to be blown. The latter situation will be the truly level playing field for work and audience alike.
 Not nearly as creative and complex as the books.
 Don't expect this to be a J.K. story she did not write it,but it was a fantastic way to show a future for Harry and the gang.
 Don't go in hoping for a reading experience like a novel might give you. This is not a continuation of the series nor is written completely by Rowling.<br/>This is different.
 My daughter hated this book!!! She is 16
 I am one of the huge Harry Potter fans, and credit J.K. Rowling with creating a place where most of us would have liked to sample. The fluidity of her books and to a lesser degree the moves actually transported us to every location in and out of the wizarding world. I also saw at the end of the last story a different path. And as much as my creativity and writing in know ways  compares to Ms. Rowling. I would have rater seen development of some of he the other  characters; like Luna Love good or Neville Long bottom than to tear away at the Legend of Harry Potter. I understand there are few really happy endings in the real world, this one took the long way to arrived and was somewhat anticlimactic. Delphi was a Red Herring, And I don't like Red Herring it is a somewhat lazy way to get to the heart of the story.  I also believe Albus picking someone more likely than not is a bit of a stretch after vocally voicing his fear just at the mere idea of becoming a Slitheren moments before there was more of a relationship. He spoke to his dad rather than his mum. I understand father and sons frequently have daddy issues as much or more than women, but this wasn't how it was left in Deathly Hallows.  For all intentions totally ignored the the Epilogue of the final book.<br/>I admit I am a purest and a stickler for details and continuity, and this story had very little. I was thrilled to see another Harry Potter story, but it is hard to believe a man who clearly had always wanted a family, a life time of abuse, could have followed a number of paths to swear not to be anything like Vernon and Aunt Petunia, cruel, cold and making his life of misery, and be the best father possible, not cruel and cold. I know parents make lots of mistakes, I lived through my fair share. And I know it is as painful as mothers and daughters, and men hide their feeling more I know all that rubbish. At sometimes you accept them for who they are. And there many things worse than a famous Father, with all the perks that come with that. Scorpius put him in his place and I liked. It was more contrived and had the feeling that the special set and effects held too high a priority. It was a quick read, and I am sure every person regarding them self as the book already. I know grown up that I am, that I stood in line at real bookstores to get my at Midnight special openings, but this was just unnecessary to bring us back to show how flawed Harry was and  his son that had precisely Lily's eyes, and what was in the  ending of Deathly Hallows story Albus Serverus was afraid and waited to speak with his father alone not his mum. Dad would understand guy stuff. Even wizard's guy stuff. It didn't take too my much of my time so I say read  probably more  than 50% will probably love it.
 I am a hugh Harry Potter fan and never wanted the book series to come to an end. This book is actually a script and it took a little getting used to. That being said, I love the book.
 All I'm seeing is people complaining about the format. YES. IT IS A PLAY. YOU ARE LUCKY YOU EVEN GET TO READ IT!<br/><br/>Seriously! When I first heard about the play coming out I was depressed because, realistically, I didn't think I would ever be able to see it.  So, the fact that I get to read the script is a pretty great thing.<br/><br/>It may also be easier for me, given I was in a lot of plays and musicals when I was younger, so I'm used to the format. The book actually gives a lot more detail than most scripts do, so it really doesn't take too much imagination to create the scene in your mind.<br/><br/>Anyway, overall the story started a bit slow, but picked up for me in Act 3. There are a lot of previous scenes and events from the first books incorporated, which adds a nice nostalgia aspect.<br/><br/>I hope they eventually record one of the performances - I'd love to see it!
 It was different but great. Really enjoyed the continued story.
 Always great
 Disappointed!
 gift
 My granddaughter loved it
 As far as harry potter stories go this one for me doesnt come close to the other books. Enjoyable enough being a fan of the serie .
 Only ok written as a play
 Interesting premise, terrible dailogue, not a Rowling work either
 I loved this story. A great read for Harry potter fans and also a great stand alone story for some that hasn't read the series.
 Love anything that is Harry Potter!
 a disappointment to me
 Disappointing!!!!
 Written as a script, it does read differently, but was still what I have come to expect from J K Rowling
 Loved this book so much!
 It is very easy to read, I was worried about it being a play but I really didn't have any trouble with it. It was a little short.
 no coment
 It was ok but I'd rather just re-read the original 7.  Let the story end where the story ends.  I'm not a big fan of sequels because I feel like it takes away from the original intent of the story and this feels like a sequel.
 Book jacket edges were a bit crumpled. We wish there was more padding/protection for the book before it was shipped.
 This reads like mediocre fan fiction. After years of loving the world and characters that JKR created, I was sadly disappointed. The dialogue from each beloved character is ridiculous and not even remotely believable.  As a huge HP fan, this was a definite let down.
 love anything Potter
 Wonderful condition. Great book.
 I have always been a fan of Harry Potter,great book
 I'm old and reading a play took me some time.
 Quick shipment, clean copy.
 Great!
 I'm not sure I like the new play format.  It's too short and not enough detail about all the other characters.
 I haven't read it yet
 I mean, it's a book version of a play. No complaints with the product and this is not really the forum for a play review.
 Terrible book. Terrible format
 I did not like the form used for this story, like a script.  I did like the friendships, and the story.
 Good, but not as good as the originals.
 The style of writting was much different then other books, so whatever you heard people say about it it's true. However it's still a great addition to the story of Harry potter.
 Wish she'd write more.
 I was a bit disappointed overall
 Good for the Potterworld Fan.
 awesome
 Before I go into detail about this book, I'd like to note that I'm a HUGE Harry Potter fan. I read all the books while growing up and have been to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter and I generally just gush about the book and universe to the point where my friends probably want to hit me. Beyond that, I continue to read the books just about every other year. You could say that I'm a touch obsessed. That being said, I was super excited for this and waited eagerly for it to come out. In retrospect, it could have been my anticipation and expectation for the script that made it come across as just...not the greatest to me.<br/><br/>This script read like a poorly written fan fiction, to be blunt about it. The number of plot holes and the lack of any sort of complexity beyond the weird bending of the scenes made this just poorly executed. I really wanted to like it and at parts I did, but there were just some certain things that I couldn't get past, such as:<br/>- Why Harry was a horrible father to one of his children as opposed to being a great father<br/>- Why Harry was so generally out of character during the entire play<br/>- Why Hermione was written to be so miserable if she was without Ron at her side<br/>- Where is Teddy? Did he want to be excluded from this narrative he did not ask to be in? And in addition to that, where's Hugo? Or Rose? Or James? Where are the other children in this?<br/>- Heteronormativity (or at least what seems to be heteronormativity)<br/><br/>Overall, this book was pretty upsetting to read and try as I might, I just didn't entirely like it. If you're a fan, you're still probably dying to read it if you haven't already. Personally I don't find it to be very canon what with all the plot holes and the out of character-ness, nor do I think it deserves to call itself the eighth story. I haven't seen the actual play, maybe that's better than this mess was. But since this is just a review on the script, I'm going to go with a generally disappointed.
 terrible plot. characters behaving totally out of character.
 for the grand daughter - she was thrilled.
 Loved it
 At first I didn't like it but then it took a turn and I fell in love
 A bit lightweight really.
 This story brought me back to my favorite places and people. Our heroes,once again, take us to the brink of disaster. I truly love this world and the incredible world that Ms. Rowling created. I will continue to read and reread the stories of the Potter's.
 Cant get into it.
 Great book. Arrived in time.
 My teen was happy
 Good story again but didn't like the end of the adventure felt like something was left out
 not ssame quality as series
 I didn't realize I was buying a play in book form. The story was good but not as good as it would have been if it was written like the other Harry Potter books.
 I would have enjoyed it more had it not been written in the form of a play.  Also could have been a little bit longer.  All in all still a good read.
 Always a good read.
 I like that Harry Potter books are back!!! The book is a very easy and fast read
 None
 Queen Rowling does it again.
 not readable
 I don't read
 Great book
 Good Book for everyone to read. 5 stars to my opinion. What about you guys think about this book for reading.
 THIS IS SUCH A GOOD BOOK
 I can imagine that the actual performance of this play in theater can be quite impressing, however for most of the fans the book as such will be a disappointment. Plot is quite weak and very condensed and it is going against the previous books. Definitely not worth buying.
 yayyy
 Loved it would love to this put to the screen
 It was a little weird, but more Hogwarts is always welcomed!
 I loved this book!
 Took getting used to reading in play format but it is a good quick read.
 I should probably start by saying that no one other than JK Rowling should be writing Harry Potter.  Perhaps this plays better on stage, but I found a lot of the characters and their actions to be pretty flat.  These characters are not written particularly well.  It might have worked if we didn't already have a very extensive background for each of these characters, making this iteration of them forced and hollow.  As I know a few others here have already stated, this reads a lot like a fan fiction, and not necessarily a good one.<br/><br/>First of all, Albus and Scorpius do not sound like kids.  There's a lot of time with them expounding on what  great friends they are.  They state it aloud a great deal,  hug each other, have a lot of emotional moments, talk about their feelings, etc,  For me, this came across pretty forced. It might have worked slightly better had they been girls, but even then it would have been forced and odd.  It was not necessary for Ron, Harry, and Hermione to be stating constantly, "You're my best friend" for the audience and/or the reader to know how they felt about each other.  Their interactions made it obvious on a continuous basis.  Here, I get that the author is trying to make certain the audience gets that Scorpius and Albus are devoted friends because they keep hitting us over the head with it.  They must be best friends because they keep telling us (and each other) CONSTANTLY. They're friends.  We get it.  Move on.<br/><br/>Albus is actually pretty annoying.  Harry and others keep saying, "Well he's a teenager" (as he is in a large portion of the story), but even at Harry's most emotional, growing pains moments (Book 5, Order of the Phoenix, the iteration I like to refer to as CAPSLOCK Harry because he yells...a lot), he is not this obnoxious or annoying.  It would be less irritating if Albus' issue was something concrete.  This is hard to do, I know, when Harry's character faced nothing less than the defeat of the most evil wizard of all time, and the possible destruction of the wizarding world every year.<br/><br/>But Albus' main issue?  He's dark and sullen because he thinks it's such a pain to have a famous father.  When his situation becomes more serious, it's of his own choosing, not because he is thrust into a situation and has to dig deep within himself to face things.  I did not really take to his character at all.  His sullenness was simply annoying (as there was little basis for it), and his "I'm dark and moody" persona just seemed very forced.  The other kids seem well adjusted enough.  Albus just comes across like a spoiled child.  There's no real reason to sympathize with the character - he's just obnoxious.  Having a famous father is not the huge problem Albus is making it out to be.<br/><br/>Speaking of forced, Ginny, Ron, and even Hermione to an extent are cardboard figures.  Granted their characters have a few amusing moments here and there (hence the reason I gave 3 stars instead of 2), but they do not come across as developed, and considering the original stories gave a relatively extensive background for these characters to draw from, that's pretty disappointing.  Hermione is bossy.  Ron is a putz.  Dumbledore, who makes a cameo of sorts, is distraught (seriously, there is absolutely zero of the charm that the Dumbledore character usually has displayed here - just a lot of over the top weeping and drama).<br/><br/>Strangely enough, of the "main" characters involved here, Ginny seems to get the best treatment.  Her character is the wise oracle that has all the meaningful things to say to soothe everyone else.  For a moment, I had to double check to see if the story wasn't called "Ginny Potter and the Cursed Child".<br/><br/>And then there's Harry.  Oh my god, what they've done to Harry.  Harry spends a great deal of time in high angst.  He's EXTREMELY emotional, and indecisive, which was an odd choice for the author to make considering  Harry is now an Auror, an occupation that does not have room for a lot of hand-wringing and blubbering.  For seven books, the Harry character faced danger and the problems of being constantly in the spotlight, and he did not crumple as much as he does here.  Here, he is reduced to a whiny, "Oh-my-God-Ginny-tell-me-what-to-do" kind of guy.  He is Angst-y with a capital "A".  Did this author read the books?  This is what he thought Harry would become as a result of the events of his earlier life?  Are we to believe Harry has been reduced to an overly emotional, empty shell of a man?  Seriously?  This story would have us believe that post Hogwarts Harry has become delicate and damaged.  Sorry, I don't buy it.<br/><br/>The actual story-line has some intriguing moments, and could have been far more interesting if it had been handled in a better manner.  If you'll pardon the pun, there is little of the "magic" of the wizarding world displayed here.  There's no wonder.<br/><br/>*MINOR SPOILERS*<br/><br/>When it was decided that Albus would be in Slytherin, I thought they were going to go somewhere with that, but no.  There was a bunch of "A Potter in Slytherin?"  but that was essentially it.  There wasn't much expansion as to why Albus ended up in Slytherin when everyone else in the extended Potter family was in Gryffindor.  They could have done a lot with that, but ...no.<br/><br/>Hermione being the Minister of Magic was a fun situation, I thought.  Given the character's past personality (and her magical skills) I thought it would only be a matter of time before she became Minister.  There seemed to be a difficult time translating her to the stage here though.  Yes, Hermione is bossy and very driven, but she was always uber-focused because she wanted to learn everything.  She wasn't bossy for the sake of being bossy, and because she enjoyed being in charge of everyone.  She craved knowledge.  I don't get that from this Hermione.<br/><br/>And Ron.  They simply didn't know what to do with Ron.  He is now the easy-going prankster who works with his brother George.  He seems to have been given a joking type of personality, much like Fred would have had.  I found that to be an odd choice because the Ron character spends much of the books trying to determine who he is in a family of over-achieving older siblings.  He didn't have this joke-y type of personality before.  It just seems odd that the choice was made to morph him into a Fred replacement.<br/><br/>As an aside...although we don't see a great deal of him, Draco has a few interesting moments here.  He, also, is a little angst-y for my tastes, but I thought it worked for he and the trio's kids to not have interaction that was automatically negative.<br/><br/>*END SPOILERS*<br/><br/>I honestly think the story had some interesting plot possibilities.  It simply was not handled very well.  As stated before - it reads like a fan fiction.  The names are all there, but there isn't a lot of depth to the characters.  There's not a great deal of logic to how they went from who they were to the people they have become in this story.<br/><br/>If this story ever becomes a film, it might actually work if they request that JK Rowling polish a few things in order to make it more in line with the Harry Potter canon, rather than wishful thinking fan fiction.<br/><br/>ETA:  I forgot to mention one of the things I found strange about the dialog.  Several of the characters (Ginny and Scorpius to begin with) begin to sound like psychologists talking about people having "daddy issues" and "craving acceptance".  This was especially odd coming from the younger characters.  Who talks like that?
 Definitely reads more like fan fiction. Tried to force too much into too short of a work.
 Did not like reading it as a script.
 It was so good to get another taste of Harry Potter after so many years! I love the series and have read them many times. I find that I always get something different from them every time I read them. I found the same to be true for Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. The story line is believable and actually use portions from the previous books so they tie in nicely together.<br/>The book is basically a play. It contains stage directions and the dialogue is written as each cast member's parts. This made it a little awkward to read it out loud as we read it together as a family.<br/>All the main characters are accounted for and it was nice to see what came of them as they grew up. I feel as though I just caught up with some old friends that I haven't seen in a while.<br/>The story is exciting and keeps you reading. I hate that it is already over. It is a must for any Harry Potter fan.
 Just what I expected. : )
 Disappointed in the format it is written, (screenplay) leaves so much of the details out. That is too bad. Even the plot was so so.. She has done so well with all the other Potter books, this seemed done in haste.. disappointed.
 HP and the Cursed Child is not what I expected. In fact, it's much more. I love that HP grows up to be...well...not that great a dad. Rowling's "Boy Who Lived" is a man with flaws and that makes him so much more believable.
 Excellent, I just can't imagine how they did to put all those effect in scene. I hope there's a video of the book soon.
 Not what I expected.
 There will always be a place where I want to escape to and that place is Hogwarts, you will need to love this world flaws and all to love this adventure, Always xxx
 The book was awesome of course! I just wished it was not in a play format it was still a good read!
 Love the parallels between this and the original series! Easy to read, hard to put down. Great when you need a Harry Potter fix!
 I was very happy to return to the world of Harry Potter, and to see things from the perspective of his son. I don't want to give too much away, but I thought it was a clever plot line that helped answer some what-if questions.
 I didn't realize this was a play when I ordered it but I really enjoyed reading it.
 interesting, not heartstopping.
 What a wonderful and unexpected book to follow the Harry Potter franchise. It is surprising and kept me guessing with plot turns and inventive writing. As always, I am so impressed with the inventiveness and creativity of J.K. Rowling in creating new story lines and characters in this magical world. It is so descriptive and makes you feel like you are actually watching the play. I wish I could go see the play in person! But if I never get that chance, this book is definitely a good replacement. One of the happiest and best reading experiences I have had in a while!
 Like all of the Potter series, this is a good, fast read. I also appreciated the additional dimensions to original characters and learning about new ones. Highly recommend for all Potter fans.
 I liked it overall. I did have some issues with some of the plot points and how they handled some of the characters. Mostly because some what happens seems a bit deus ex machina.
 Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is a lot of fun -- after the first several scenes. Avoiding spoilers as much as possible, I think it safe to say that the major interpersonal conflict in the play's plot could have been established much more quickly; the beginning I found tedious and repetitive. Once this was out of the way, however, the pace moves along quite nicely. There are flashbacks to the books/films which are brief enough not to slog things down, but that, as a fan, I found delightful. A major event in one of the books/films is a primary vehicle for plot advancement here; this is done quite well, when it could have easily been a retreading disaster.<br/><br/>That being said, of the two main characters, Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy, the former, though the main figure, is wooden and, frankly, not that interesting. Scorpius is the real scene-stealer; he's quirky, extremely likable, and much more real than his counterpart. He truly made the play for me.<br/><br/>Like the books themselves, much is predictable here. One can see immediately who the truly menacing character will turn out to be; the "true meaning" of the curse over the child is patently obvious (to everyone but those on stage). And when, oh when, will Ron Weasley's character be allowed to be anything more than comic relief? Still, if you love the series, this book will grab you at least by Act Two, and provide you a fun, engaging, and entirely worthwhile experience. At first, I felt prepared for disappointment. By its finish, I was psyched for the inevitable film -- and the next installment!
 Loved the book! Took a bit of time to get used to it being written as a play but really enjoyed the flashbacks to the Harry Potter novels. Interesting, Harry not being thought of as a hero!
 It just has to be made into a movie!
 Well written, as all her books!
 I know that this is a very unpopular opinion but I absolutely loved it. Just don't think too much into it and you'll love it to
 Uncle Jack love it
 It was not as good as I expected it to be. I hope the movie will be like that of the other's.
 Absolutely loved it!!!!
 difficult to read
 I love the way JK Rowling is able to transform everyone, young or old that read her books into that magical, mystical world she has invented.
 Great read - grandchildren and I love it.
 Disappointing
 Having read all the previous Harry Potter books, I could imagine the scenes easily as I read the book.  I'm not sure someone new to this series would enjoy it as much as I did.
 Great book, glad to have been back into an Harry Potter reunion. Hope to see this book made into a movie as well.
 loved thid read
 just sp definitely not JK's work and almost not worthy of series
 NICE AS EXPECTED
 Very much enjoyed it!
 It is in play script mode personally i would like it wrote the regular way it would be more readable and this is going to sound funny but the mind agomatiom wpuld or could go firther like imagining you are the and can see whays happening instead of words
 Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is a great book, and it is easy to follow even though it is in a script format.  This story tied in well to the other Harry Potter books.  It has J. K. Rowling's touch.
 Complete and utter garbage. I will not consider this story canon.
 I love Jo Rowling, I love the Harry Potter books, and I re-read them a few times a year. But this is garbage. I was so excited for Rowling to continue Harry's story, but that's just not what this script is. It's fan fiction, pure and simple, and it was difficult for me to even finish. I have a hard time believing that this was "based on a new story by JK Rowling," because nothing in this comes close to the quality or depth of her story telling. The characters act out of character, the plot is ridiculous, and I just can't fathom why Rowling would sign off on this. If you like fan fiction, they you'll probably enjoy this, but for me it was just disappointing.
 Fast read...  Great story..
 Reads like fan fiction but guess it's nice to continue Harry Potter some...
 A good read but far from my favorite HP. The writing style takes a bit to get used to but a very quick read once you get into it.
 Obviously not as good as one of the novels but nice to have our friends back! Any one who loved the series would enjoy this even though it is a screenplay not a novel. It's nice to see where Harry, Ron and Hermione are now!
 The story was okay although there were some plot holes and the characters were not true to their original personalities. But it was a clever story and easy to read and it moved along fairly quickly.
 A-MAZING! As soon as I heard that you could pre-order this book I did it. Then anxiously waited for Harry's birthday to come and for my book to be shipped. I tried to draw it out as much as possible once I received it to savor the next chapter of Harry Potter's life and that failed miserably, I managed to ink out a week with it. Since this is the script for the play it was an adjustment to read, but that was achieved in the first couple of scenes. I definitely don't want to give any spoilers for those who haven't read it, all I'll say is I thoroughly enjoyed the plot and really hope JK Rowling continues with this story line with Harry's son.
 great read!
 Another amazing Harry Potter book. I am not quite finished with the book but it has not been a let down at all. I just wish that it wasn't the last one. J. K. Rowling said that Harry Potter is done and that there will be no more. Hopefully, she will write books about the kids and Harry and Ginny, and Ron and Hermonie. If you were missing Harry Potter since completing the original series years ago, you definitely need to pick this book up and read it. Just an FYI, this does not read as a book, why you might ask, because it is the actual screen play of the play that was released in Europe earlier this year. IT IS FANTASTIC though. I cant wait for the play to come to the US.
 Loved the book.  Good detail.
 Bought 2 ~ One for my grandson. One for myself.  LOVED IT!!
 Surprisingly good.
 great set of books
 Enjoyed the plot continuation and was pleasantly surprised how well it read for a play.
 It was different reading it like a play but it was good. I love all the Harry Potter books.  Interested when they make it into a movie or when the stage show comes to the US
 Another great story by Rowlings
 Was not an easy read. Not what I expected
 I am a Harry Potter fan and was thrilled to have something new to read.  It was typical Potter which is to say, it was a good read.
 I was under the impression that the book i purchased was just that, a book. What I got was not a book it was a screen play script... not cool!
 With the many directions JK Rowling could have gone, I was really disappointed that we were still embroiled in Harry and Voldemort's relationship. I didn't buy the story either. Perhaps as a play it would be a different experience, but overall, I was unhappy with this.
 Excellent.
 Loved the book!
 Our daughter is delighted to add it to her collection and has read it already! She would rather read than sleep!
 Loved it! Shipping was amazingly quick.
 The book is in good condition
 I enjoyed the book.
 It was a firkin script!
 Play script, not a lot of detail other than dialogue.
 I was not expecting to like a scripted version of these famous stories but I was proven wrong. I thoroughly enjoyed it!
 Thumbs up. 👍🏽Thumbs up. 👍🏽Thumbs up. 👍🏽Thumbs up. 👍🏽Thumbs up. 👍🏽Thumbs up. 👍🏽Thumbs up. 👍🏽Thumbs up. 👍🏽Basically, a decent but very quick read.
 I bought this book with no expectations.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  It took a few chapters to get past the fact its written in play form, but once that happened I really, really enjoyed it.  I am a big Harry Potter fan and was looking forward to the release.  I see many people leaving negative comments and don't understand.  If they read the description of the book you would know what it was you were ordering.  One, its states its written as a play, Two that JK Rowling assisted in writing it, not that she wrote the whole thing.  No one should say they were deceived.  Descriptions are listed for a reason.  Anyway....  I enjoyed this book and will keep it safely with my collection.  My suggestion is to read with an open mind and enjoy it for what it is.  An interesting story.
 Speechless.  This was put together so well. It brings closure in so many ways. If there is never anything more, I can live with that.
 I'm sure I'm just repeating what so many others have written. I love Harry Potter and was excited to be able to spend some time with my favorite characters.When I read the book, I felt like my beloved characters weren't there. It was flat, with no dimension and everyone was doing and saying things completely out of sync with who Rowling wrote them to be. It struck me like some not-so-great fan fiction posted on some dim corner of the internet. I was very disappointed and I wish that Rowling herself had written it.
 great read
 As a huge Harry Potter fan, I had high expectations for this book. I am sad to say that it was not what I had expected. Nonetheless, as a Harry Potter fan, I felt a duty to read the text, and I’ve now done that.
 An interesting plot
 excelente
 Reads like fan fiction.
 I have ready better fanfiction - very disappointed.
 It's great to be back in the world which we already know so well. It's pity, that 8th story of Harry Potter was not novelized and that it is just in script form. However main plot of story is well connected to other books about Harry Potter and it's quite interesting.
 Wife loved the book.
 I hope this is made into a movie at some point...good read overall. I liked the way the adults carried similar personalities from the original series.
 Purchased this book for my son. He really enjoyed it.
 Fast shipping. Pleased with purchase
 An excellent follow up to the original series. Potters are far from perfect, but they may be a perfect family.
 terrible
 I was fully aware and prepared for this to be written and based as a play, but personally I found that besides the familiar names of characters and a handful of memories referenced from past books, this was not even close to touching the world of Harry Potter that we all know and love. It felt sloppy and impersonal, with very little emotion attached to it by the writers. Doesn't even feel like it left any form of closure to the Harry Potter series, and almost leaves the feeling of being a knock-off or generic tale of ending, by an amateur author. Luckily, I did not have high expectations, yet can not help but to still feel disappointed.
 Terrible script.
 Great play
 Good story. Did like the "play form ".
 Great book
 I bought this play knowing specifically that yes, JK Rowling did not write this script herself, but she gave her okay (meaning that she reviewed the content before it was published)! So with high expectations, I pre-ordered the kindle version &amp; like many many many others, stayed up the first night of its release to finish the "book/play" (approx. 2-3 hours). Then, I went back to re-read all the seven HP books on my kindle. Fair to say, HP and the Cursed Child definitely cannot compare to JK Rowling's original writing in the other HP books, but you're introduced to many new characters. *Bonus- there are SO many twists and unexpected reveals in this play which I truly enjoyed (although most were unbelievable).<br/><br/>Bottom line, if you're a die-hard HP fan like I am, get this play- I definitely think it's worth it. However, take the content in HP &amp; the Cursed Child with a grain of salt because I don't believe that Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, etc. would truly have grown up this way. Hopefully the next release will be written by Rowling herself so that she can develop a more believable future for our beloved characters!
 Good read
 A little differt to get started. But sfyer getting use to it thoroughly enjoyed it!
 Product was as advertised.
 Makes one want more. I wish I could see the play. I hope it is made into a movie one day.
 I forgot just how much I missed Harry Potter and his famous crew! This play gave me everything I needed and more since the last glorious read.<br/>Loved and Cherished every single word.<br/>Play or Book...it was nostalgic!!!
 wife loves this book
 Loved the book. Easy reading.
 It is Harry Potter and I have a 13 year old.  Any other questions?<br/><br/>:)
 Do not read. It will ruin the entire series. Huge HP fan here and was very disappointed.
 This is a great read!
 yep
 Harry Potter rules!
 This was badly written and so unlike its predecessors.  I cannot recommend it at all.  It was such a disappointment.
 Just wished it was a book and not a play with the JK Rowling detail of a book! Miss that!
 Stage directions made it feel clunky at times and hard to follow. But even so it scratched the Harry Potter itch.
 Loved it!
 I enjoyed this script. The story connected with the original characters I love and also developed them the way I would have hoped they would grow.
 Love this book
 Another great read.
 Read this book in a day! Not as great as the other Harry Potters; however, it is a play. The plot was interesting and I loved how JK introduced us to the main characters lives after Hogwarts! I have already loaned it to friends!
 Felt more like weird fan fiction
 So happy they decided to add more to the Harry Potter series.  Excellent book..nice to read about the children and the parents as well. Keep 'em coming! Can't wait for Fantastic Beasts...
 Reading a play is at best ok but this did not read smoothly ...I loved the intricacies of the plot  ,however ,which will play great on the big screen
 This was a great read for any Harry Potter fan. Disappointed at first it was in a play format instead of a novel but really enjoyed the story
 Didn't like the format.
 not what i expected, just not a fan of the script<br/>reads like fanfiction, mostly because JK Rowling didn't actually write it
 While nothing can hold a candle to the original series, this book is a ton of fun. My daughter and I loved revisiting some of our favorite characters with an all-new story.
 I liked it
 Good read
 It's a great book 😀 the only thing is its written in script. I would  recommend this to anyone who likes Harry Potter.
 Too short!
 Great Book.  Easy read!!
 So much fun
 Amazing
 ok-but wasn't impressed.
 All fans need it
 LOVE!
 Just perfect!! this book brings you, the child days with Harry, and clearly it refresh many details of the old books, is wonderful to have the opportunity to review many futures of our favorite characters, and im sure that Sirius Potter is our new Favourite kid.
 Super disappointing
 Great book.
 This was an amazing addition to the collection. I would like to read more about Albus and Scorpius during the first years at Hogwarts though. Hoping for a movie and follow up story.
 good
 my wife could not put it down ---
 FOR MYSELF ...THE BOOK AS IS ,, WRITTEN FOR A PLAY.. IS NOT DETAILED ENOUGH. HOPEFULLY THERE WILL  BE AN ACTUAL NOVEL TO FOLLOW .. I HOPE SO I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO A MORE DETAILED TELLING...
 Great quality book
 Great script! Absolutely loved it! Thank you J.K.!
 It's not of the same quality as the original Harry Potter series, but I like it well enough. Worth the buy for more of the HP world.
 In love with this book! So good!
 I thought it had decent elements but characters overall did not have the depth that Rowling typically gives to them
 As great as I expected.
 Very good follow through(thru) on past POTTER stories.  Still choices/paths of story line would prefer go another direction.<br/>  (Saving Harry's parents, for  example)  Leaves room for more/ sequels.
 Nice book especially for those who miss Harry Potter so much and thought it was over. It seems this is just a start of another Potter's adventure. I like how this story relates to the other Harry Potter series.
 Great reading
 At first getting used to play format, but a fast fun read.
 I enjoyed this very much! It reminded me of how much I miss JK' s wizarding world and how much I wish there was more to come.
 It is a play as opposed to a book but there seems to be inconsistsncies in personalities we knew from book to this writing.  I don't think basic values would change so much.
 Whether a book or a screenplay it was fantastic. Just like the books, once I started reading I couldn't put it down.<br/>I would recommend anyone interested in Harry Potter to read this.
 Did my care for format
 LOVEDDDD IT.. I'm a huge Harry Potter fan so any book she writes I'll own forever!
 So happy Harry is back.
 Given to my 12 year old granddaughter, she loves it and she said I going to read again. Really holds her interest,
 Bought the book for my 13 year old daughter and she loved it!
 Great!
 My only complaint is that I read it too fast! I wish it was longer! But all in all its a great read and worth every penny you spend on it!
 Excellent
 I didn't expect a script in book form. I thought that I was buying the book. Sorely disapointed that this was not more clearly marked.
 ok disappointed
 I will admit, I wasn't to fond of learning that the book was going to be in version of a script. But I gotta say, it was one hell of play! Read it all in one night! I want to know if there will be other adventures to come with the younger ones!!!
 A very good read
 such a disappointment.
 This is an easy and fast read and very interesting book and how the outcome came out.
 Great Play :)
 really disappointed with this play. I really wanted to like it but it made it so hard. Probably the most frustrating thing was being a former actor and reading the directions for this play and wondering "how the hell would they do that on a stage"?
 I struggled with the first chapters, but soon came to love how different Albus is from his dad, Harry Potter. Everything comes together nicely as usual, even with the unexpected twists.
 Great
 Loved it. It was quick but definitely filled a need I think all of us were waiting for.
 SLOW MOVING
 Haven't started yet.
 Perfect.
 Good
 Loved it! Yet another amazing book to add to the pottervers. Can't wait for more books, plays and movies to come!
 great gift
 What a great story. Made me miss the series. A good story of the next generation with a good mix of the last generation. Would have made a great full book and movie.
 I loved this book.  It brought the story full circle.  LOVED it.
 great book
 Read this in 2 sittings. I could barely put it down. I wish the could make this into a full book and movie.
 Why i chose this rating is because its a true harry potter book even if its a script, who i would recommend this book to the whole wide world of course
 As a 90s kid with a big heart and a bigger passion for reading, the Harry Potter series has been an almost tangible part of my life. It is with some regret that I must admit that this play, written as such, is full of disappointment in many ways. As a student of dramatic writing, I was excited to see the world I loved be set forth under the intimacy and the magic that the drama form allows. Regretfully, I found the Cursed Child to be repetitive and empty in its plot construction. Much of the characters seemed to be shadows of their book selves, or just a beat off of who I knew them to be. Much of the action and spectacle of the play relies on the audiences ability to see it live and preformed which, especially in my opinion, shouldn't be necessary to the enjoyment of the play as a whole. I enjoyed reading the play simply for the thrill of seeing these familiar names once again on new pages, and appreciated a lot of the information given about Albus Potter, and the fates of the next generation. I suggest fans give it read with a guarded mind; this isn't the work of our plot-master JK Rowling, or even the characters as we know them best, but it is a reminder of the beloved past, and will satisfy the longing- if only until Fantastic Beasts comes out.
 great
 I love this book! But Ive read it too fast:(
 Good premise, but don"t like the script format.
 Disappointed. Ruined it for an avid potter head like myself.
 Definitely not as good as the original series. Too corny and forced.
 I missed actually reading a novel.  The storyline was just OK.
 Major disappointment in the annoying play format as well as the quality of the story compared to books 1-7 of the Harry Potter series.
 A story that provokes your imagination throughout, a tale of challenges and the power of friendship. I would recommend this book if you need a little magic in your life. Once again, I can relate to the story of Harry Potter and thank you for the beautiful continuation.
 Loved the book.
 This was not a very interesting book.
 It is exciting to see JK Rowling back creating in the Potter universe. It's, as usual, a complex, character-driven story, with lots of surprising twists and turns. The theatrical medium is essentially different -- everything is handled through dialogue, stage action, and scenery (which is described in the text, but not seen). Rowling collaborated, but the characters and ideas were still clearly hers.<br/><br/>The consequences of the kids' actions were dire and interesting. Her work follows through on its premises and goes places that, traditionally, children's fiction wouldn't go. It is that willingness and imagination that puts her work  consistently in the realm of greatness. Fantasy, at its best, ask big questions and provides big answers that can be profound, in the right hands. Rowling's Potter series has so far always delivered.
 After I figured out how to read the play format, which I didn't expect, I really enjoyed it! Don't know if there would be enough for a movie but if there is, I would definitely go to see it! Love the series!
 The book is not as good as the original series.
 I like it because I'm a big Harry Potter fan.
 Our grandson as blown away to have this special book.
 ATTENTION -- SPOILERS AHEAD<br/><br/>As a Harry Potter fan, but also as an actor and director of stage plays, I was thoroughly entertained by this script.  I know a lot of HP fans are upset that this isn't a novelization of the play, but I was delighted.  I enjoy reading plays, and finding new materials to perform and direct.  When this play is available for amateur productions, it will be on my list.<br/><br/>I actually found the time-turner aspect of the story a lot of fun.  Yes, the HP world has shown us before that time travel is a closed loop... but we also only saw that from a few hours point of view in the third book... this one plays the time travel aspect going back 20 some odd years... and even 40 years at one point.  It's the same premise that was used in the Back to the Future series.  When what is supposed to happen doesn't happen, what are the consequences?  You end up with alternate time-lines, and until the loop is closed and the things that were supposed to happen actually happen, everything will be slightly off from what you knew before.  When it first happens in our play, the world as our young heroes (and make no mistake, the true stars of this story are Harry's son Albus, and his best friend Draco's son Scorpious) is different.  Not a lot different, but enough to have wiped out one family they knew... Showing that when even small, subtle things don't happen like they were supposed to, changes are made for both good, and ill.  Their second trip back in time tries to undo some of the damage done by the first trip, and still complete what they believe is their mission... but this one goes even worse than the first trip back.  It's an upside world, and, as an actor, I find that a brilliant challenge to play.  How do you take a character so well known, and turn them upside down so the core of who they are is the same, but their experiences are different, and subsequently the choices they made.<br/><br/>I look forward to seeing the stage show when it comes to the US... and eventually look forward to tackling this story as an actor/ director.
 Complete disappointment. I've read dozens of HP fanfiction stories with better plots.<br/><br/>The characters lost their essence and main traits. There was little to no character development. Scorpius and Albums spoke to eachother like 30 year old gay lovers (which I would have been happy about had they actually  been 30 and gay).  Ron's character was destroyed. Harry is a shitty father... Really?<br/><br/>I wish I had a time turner so that I can go back in time and slap this book out of my hand.<br/><br/>I'm so sad. The writer blew it big time.<br/><br/>Without giving away too much... The worst possible magical item from the first 7 book was reintroduced. Why!!
 Not impressed with the screenplay. You get doped by the large JK Rowling name and think it's her next book. Serves me right for not reading carefully. Don't recommend!!
 It didn't follow the usual Harry Potter style that I like
 My said it's AWESOME!!!
 always on time. great read
 Loved it. A little confusing at times. But still enjoyed the book. Harry Potter fan forever. I know it is over but the best serial book collections. I am 66 and this set of books was so good that I have read them twice.
 I think it's a really beautiful play about parenting and growing up. The experience of reading a play (especially a rehearsal copy) or reading a screenplay isn't for everyone, and since that was never the intention of the author, that's fine.
 I like the flow of the book even though it is written as a screen play.  The children characters are well defined and relevant.  Hardly any unnecessary extras.  I would like to see this turned into a movie.
 It was ok for a work of fan fiction,  but seriously disappointing as a part of the Harry Potter universe.
 This book was awful. I am a huge Harry Potter fan, and I had to force myself to finish this book.
 The careful descriptions and details that one has become accustomed to reading in JK Rowling works are missing.
 I genuinely enjoyed Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, but there was noticeably a lack of character development for the older characters along with pointless cameos.
 Not sure what I was expecting, the book was okay but nothing I would recommend as a "must read" book.
 As always, the most powerful magic comes from friendship. Read this book if you are a true Harry Potter fan. Also, don't mess with time.
 Loved it
 I am grateful for the continuation of the Harry Potter series. I found it a little difficult to get into due to the screenplay format but I enjoyed the story and wish I could see the screenplay!
 Loved it! Don't know if I'm just used to reading scripts and screenplays but this was an awesome read! Not only the format but the story was great! Side Note: I also enjoyed the Fantastic Beasts Screenplay. You like movies? You like plays? 10/10 would recommend
 I waited a long time to read this book.  My husband and I are die-hard Potter fans!  The early reviews scared me away, since the reviews spoke about ruining the series for the reader.  I finally decided to take the risk.  I completely disagree with the negative reviews.  Since it was a play and not a novel, it was not as "meaty" or "rich" in descriptions as her novels.  I thought it was a good story, interesting characters, and old friends, and JK Rowling themes.  I had a problem with how Ron was portrayed ...sort of a ridiculous...and not as bright as the Ron we know in in the first 7 books. I highly recommend Potter fans try this play with an open mind.  Both my husband and I truly enjoyed the book Harry Potter and the Cursed Child...and wish we would not need to wait forever to see it...since we live in Florida.
 This was absolutely terrible. Felt like they really phoned it in. No twist in plot, it felt like they just tried to repeat the old tricks with the younger generation. Saddened as a huge harry potter fan at the poor writing and complete lack of ingenuity.
 Great book
 Book was very good, however I didn't like the format of the story.
 Quick read.
 I Loved this Book!
 A bit disappointing.
 Sometimes get lost of the trama with the theater format, otherwise  this short story has an  unexpected and excellent ending as Rowling's style.
 Not happy with the play format
 Great book hope there is moire to come,  love the excitement in all the Harry Potter books . great writer.
 Although the it was different than I expected (written as a play) it was still a good read. Glad I took the time to read this book.
 Love it
 It was ok .... I really expected it would be better.
 Great book
 Great play!
 Good read
 I am a huge fan of harry potter and this really continued the story , i really hope this screen play becomes a movie !!!
 Product that was shipped was as described.
 great book
 Was SO excited for this book I didn't read anything about it. That was a mistake.  Really wanted an 8th book.  Got something else entirely. So disappointed.
 I feel like J.K. Rowling's involvement is necessary but not sufficient to make a good Harry Potter book, as evidenced by this story.. It reads like fan fiction and it is a good story, but an underwhelming Harry Potter book.
 Great book
 The writing style was weird to me. It is basically the play put inside a hard cover. This book would have been so much better if they put some effort to convert it to a book/story and not leave it as the script for the play.
 If you are a fan of the Harry Potter series you will love this book!
 Great plot and the fact that it is in script format did not detract from the story.
 wonderful!
 Came damaged. Donated it to library when someone else have me a copy.
 The characters were there, but the magic was missing.  I love the books, having read and listened to them many times over and was really eager to know more about the characters and magical world after the conclusion of book 7.  Unfortunately, what I learned was that the characters seemed to have undergone a total metamorphosis--all their spirit and charm was gone with the wind.  Very, very disappointing.  Back to the original books to get this out of my mind.
 Great buy, thank you!
 Scorpius Malfoy was a highlight, but otherwise a disappointing addition to the series and one I'd rather not accept as canon.
 Reading it as a play flowed very well. I loved the premise and was glad to meet the next generation. Can't wait to see the play...
 It was good but not as good as the originals
 Great book!
 loved it
 I loved reading this.
 JK Rowling can do no wrong.
 It was a decent story, but wasn't well written. It read like J.K. Rowling was barely involved in writing the story.
 Great story.
 Harry Potter is back! A different style than I was used to but it was a good book!
 At first I wasn't too sure if I was going to like the story, but as I got further in, it was a great read! My only "complaint" is there is a lot of whinning, but the storyline enables one get past it!
 Enjoyable quick read.
 I didn't think that I would like the script format but as I kept reading and got lost in the story, those extraneous things disappeared and were replaced by visions of the wizarding world of Harry Potter. I loved the relationship between Harry and Albus and Draco and Scorpius. Men are notorious for hiding their feelings and here we see how it can hinder fathers and sons and even have dire consequences. One day I would love to see the play. I was in London this summer but two weeks before the play opened. All in all, this is a great story that Potter fans should read.
 I loved this book.  Lots of twists and turns and a great follow up to the last book.
 It brought you up to date with the Chacacters after Hogwarts!
 do not like the way it's written
 I confess that I wanted to like this book the way I liked all the others.  Time travel backwards into the previous scenes created by Rowling in past books seemed a convenient way for her to avoid to avoid allowing outsiders to mess up her masterfully created fictional world. I liked the new characters' angst, but the story seemed to depend too much on that and not enough on real suspense. I have read many time travel stories and this one was not particularly  original or ingenious, particularly because the places the visited were already places I'd been to in the first 7 books. I likely expect too much from a play script after a steady diet of Rowling's masterful narratives in her 7 consecutive Harry Potter books. This script ready-made for movie land, and I'm sure I will enjoy it on the big screen, but I found the script reading experience flat and unexciting.
 Romeo and Juliet, a script. Hamlet, a script. Macbeth, a script.<br/><br/>I thought this was a lovely story and I did not mind the format of writing at all. No, the voice is not JK Rowling's and yes, the characters felt a bit like shadows of their counterparts in the novel, but having read THE 7 books, (SPOILER) considering how much this jumps back into the past, I did not need a rehashing of what the scenery or characters look like.<br/><br/>If you're interested in what your favorites have been up to, you have read plays in the past, and you have a pretty vivid imagination of Hogwarts in your mind, you'll love the story.
 A rather mundane, and uninteresting, time paradox story of the sort endlessly exploited by SF writers for over a century. The only wrinkle here is that you have wands instead of lasers. Not worthy of the Harry Potter legacy.
 Nice to read more interaction between Ginny and Harry but more importantly seeing the friendship between Albus and Scorpius allowing Draco and Harry to be friends....
 I was very surprised how much i enjoyed reading this play! Excellent addition to the series
 Great book!
 A+++
 Is it just me or did anyone else feel like she missed the mark on the original character's character development?  I guess they are her characters so she can develop them how she wants but I found myself saying "I don't think Harry would say something like that" or "Ron is really immature for someone who helped start a revolution." I know the original characters are not the main characters in this story, but I felt like she created completely different characters.  It was a okay story line, I understand its a dialogue so there isn't much detail that can be put into the story, but it was just overall okay.  A slight disappointment from all the hype.
 Not as well written as the original Harry Potter novels but still worth a read.
 The storyline was good. I thought it was a bit slow to get into the story and then when it was over I wanted more. More stories about the Potters jnr. It was a typical revitting Harry Potter story. A must read for all Harry Potter fans.
 Perfect
 I got sucked in thinking it was another book but its a playscript.  Very misleading marketing and will not trust the JK Rowling brand - very disappointed.  It's a terrible read noone should every produce a script into a book format its just WRONG!!!!
 Fun continuation but more of a short story than a book
 Amazing
 I thought that the playwrights did a great job of using the world JK created to further the story. Awesome connections back to the time turner and the major theme of friendship.
 Great reading.
 I expected more from Rowling. I did not care for the format or the story.
 super harry potter fan
 Excellent follow-up read.
 My daughter-in-law is hinting that she wants me to drop it off at her house. Now that I finish reading it. She mentioned that JK rolling has other books out that she really enjoyed.
 Disappointing
 read it three times , love it
 Great book
 GIFT
 I love JK Rowling and the Harry Potter series, but this was disappointing.  I am not even sure it would be good to see as a play.  Wish she made this a full book version with a play adaption.
 loved the book
 This book made characters from the previous story much more real to me. It also gave me some closure, cos story never felt ended for me. But it's obviously wasn't as fun or adventurous as books. Probably seeing it in theatre would be more interesting
 Reading as a screenplay to awhile to get used to but it was fine. Great continuation.  No spoilers here from me!!!
 I really enjoyed the book but since it was a play it was kinda hard to understand. But so awesome!
 Not Rowling quality but worth a read for Potter fans
 Very good sequel to the first 7 hope there is more
 Reading the script version of the story is a little different, but I soon adjusted and let the story take me away.
 I really liked it, More stories would be great.
 Her use of language, imagination, and emotion through stories are a pure joy to read and experience. ... ... ...
 AMAZING
 Read it in a day!!  Great book.
 I love her books, but I always hate how I feel like she shouldn't have ended them their. But I was raised with Harry potter so I was still very pleased with the book.
 Reading this was like visiting an old friend and picking up right where we left off, without missing a beat.
 good book
 If you liked the original books, then you will enjoy this book based entirely on nostalgia.  This book however definitely doesn't stand on its own as a great book.
 Don't go into reading this play thinking it's anything like any of the actual HP books. At best, it's like reading someone's fan fiction.
 Harry potter....need I say more.
 I'm sure seeing it on stage would be much more exciting, but reading the script was a bit of a disappointment. The was really nothing new or different about it.
 LOVE THIS
 love it!
 I like the story, not fond on scipt format though.
 I loved to be in the HP world again after such a long time. I felt like a kid again
 An amazing adventure that weaves the present and past with twists and turns that keep you reading!! Highly recommend!!
 I really enjoyed this story &amp; wish it didn't have to end. It was exciting reading about the children of these characters I love &amp; they were in a lot of the story. Very happy with this book.
 I recommend this book to all Harry Potter fans. A very good continuation of the Harry Potter series. Enjoy it!
 Lacks visual description for reader compared to past novels given its written as a play in which visual and theatrical artistry would unfold on stage...
 I'm so disappointed. The whole time I was reading this book (or play), I was wondering where Ashton Kutcher was hiding. Seriously, am I being played or punk'd?<br/>Waste of money.<br/>:(
 I didn't enjoy reading this book because it was actually a play, wrote in acts. I know the book stated this, but I disliked reading a story in this format.
 So enjoyable to read this saga in the format of a stage play. A great story line about the future families of Harry, Ron, Ginny and Hermoine and their offspring. It makes me wish for a similar story about Harry and Rons parents !
 Disappointment. Who wants to read a screen play?
 It took some time to get used to the screen play writing interest of the regular novel format. The plot was great and worth the effort!
 Great
 Interesting story continuing on the Potter story line... but left me wanting better character depth. Maybe just the format change... books better than movies? I want the book before the movie.
 Great to read about Harry again.
 Worse than expected. Basically fan fiction.
 I wanted to give it a 4. I thought it was good not great. All the books are great. I started to think about it when I finished. I realized that when I reread this play I will enjoy it less. I was so excited to see my old friends again. But they aren't real in the play.  They aren't real to Rowland's true canon. That's not Harry. The playwrights ruined our Harry. They ruined all of them. It was not good enough they all deserve better. However, I liked how Draco was able to bring himself from the darkness. He was my favorite part of this play. Read if you have to. If things play out I will see if someday on Broadway. This hurt to write. The play is three because I love the characters even when they are poorly written and bastardized.
 The only thing wrong with this book is that is was TOO SHORT!!!!  I wish I could read a new Harry Potter book every month.  JK Rowlings is the absolute best writer and storyteller.  I was engaged right from the beginning.  I could have cried I was so happy to be back in Harry Potter's world.  This book makes you forget about everything and makes you feel like you have stepped into another world.  It was so nice to catch up with all of the beloved characters from the first book and see what is happening with all of them.  I wish Mrs. Rowlings would consider writing more books about Harry Potter.  He is like part of my family and I love reading about his life.
 Made me want to see the play.
 I thoroughly enjoyed this. Although it lacked the innovations that JKR put in every new book, it was a fun read, and true to canon.
 great
 Nice addition to my collection
 Kind of disappointed in this book after the first ones were so amazing
 Great book
 As a fan of the series it was great to revisit the wizarding word. I was a quick read and able to to finish it in 2 nights, but if I had the time could be down in an afternoon.  Interesting to read it in the script format.
 Easy to have your memory of Harry unaffected by this book because it feels nothing like HP. It is more like hollywood fan fiction..<br/>Further :<br/>If all the names and words indicating that this book is a Harry Potter book were swapped with unfamiliar ones, you would not be reminded of Harry at all..so to speak..i feel like this book had its soul sucked out by dementors. Its an empty shell.<br/>The cursed child is advertised as being about friendship and staying true to the core of the other books in the series..but it is not. It's more about attachment.. and selfishness.. and fear.. than love and friendship. Scorpious is a good character, Ill give them that.. But he's new. Sometimes people attach themselves to an image.. a face.. and think that if they mimic that face..or that emotion.. that it will be enough..that it expresses the same thing.. well, it does not.. and most fans, who grew up with Harry.. can tell that this is not the same thing as Harry Potter.<br/><br/>Please forgive me for being scathing, but.. as the book says.. its ok to be unhappy.. and Im unhappy with this.. (and the 2nd and 7th are my fav books..)
 More than what I expected! When is going to be a movie???
 My daughter was very happy to get this book as a gift.
 Other than being written in play version where it names each character talking, it was an adventurous story pulling in all of the favorite characters while still being fresh and exciting.
 Loved it
 While this book is totally different from the other Harry Potter books (it is a play, after all) it dives right back into the characters I know and love. This book was a great (and quick!) read.
 I felt the play paled compared to the other books.
 I couldn't put it down. I love it
 I didn't bother finishing reading this, and I returned the book. I've loved the Harry Potter series since I was waiting for Book 4 to be published. I've shared them with my children. I knew this was going to be a screenplay, and that didn't bother me. I was just excited to see a continuation of the characters I loved and characters I hoped to get to know--but the characters I knew so well were not themselves at all. This was character slander on an epic scale. Not to mention the story and relationships. There are a lot of things I could say about it, but I think others have said much about it already.
 Thank you!
 Nice book
 My son in law is a BIG fan and liked it - wasn't expecting the different format
 Terrible
 Huge HP fan but have to say cursed child was underwhelming. Unlike the original seven I don't find myself wanting to read this one over again. It is a good fan fiction but as a reader I am growing weary of the time travel element.
 It was great! Book arrived with no damages. Plus the book itself is also good. Chapters are a bit short but it's a play adaptation, not a novel, gotta remember that.
 Rowling didn't write it so it's not official HP cannon. It was interesting but more like fan fiction.
 great
 Great and easy read! Loved the addition to my Harry Potter series and my home library!!
 The story is good, but it's in play version
 Great read!
 Loved to read JK writing about this magical world again!
 Beaitifully written .  Just what I  expected ! THE CHARACTERS ARE SO LOVABLE  AND UNFORGETTABLE  . THE STORYLINE IS A MASTERPIECE.
 This was as delight to read. As one who is a fan of the books and movies it was great to be back in the wizarding world again. Predict a movie based on this play in the near future
 Amazing book, although, after the series of Harry Potter books, this is somewhat intimidating for your readers. Only my opinion. But for me , I like it.
 Okay
 Fun to get back into the story.
 like it!
 I love Harry Potter and this book was no disappointment!
 This read like mediocre FanFiction. I want to pretend this never happened. I'm disappointed because they sold this to us like Rowling wrote this and put time and effort into an HP8 and that is not what we received. I feel lied to.
 If you were/are a fan of Harry Potter you must get this.<br/>Easy read with the format of a screen play makes it a breeze.
 Extremely disappointed. Everything the characters stood for was thrown out the window. Sooo many plot holes. Terribly predictable and unlogical.
 I love the Harry Potter series.  I did not love this book.  It was great to revisit the world, but it took a long time for me to get into the book.
 J.K Rowling tarnished her name and series by participating in this mess.
 Loved it! It is a script so be prepared
 Okay
 Excellent read.
 It was a gift
 Great read, but not as good as books 1-7! This is probably more because the books are novels and this is a play, but still worth the read and money!
 Good story line, but bad writing style.
 Can't wait to read this one.
 very disappointed big harry potter fan this one is awful not to mention written as a play instead of a book makes me think was only done for the money as it is not up to the other ones . dont buy it.
 Written as a play, was really hard to follow.  Story was a bit weak.
 Wasn't crazy about the play format. Too choppy. Premise was ok. Just not the same as the other books. Not enough detail.
 Lovely continuation of the series!
 Wasn't sure what to expect, but was not disappointed. This is must-read for Harry Potter fans.
 Was definitely a book to read
 I left this feeling disappointed. I didn't learn anything new about my favorite characters and most of them felt like a caricature.
 Love it!!!
 Great read!! great author
 Did you really expect anything less than brilliance?
 Very good read.
 I have to say that I perhaps expected too much from Mrs. Rowling.  While I purposely didn't try to track down every single nugget of information about this new book...as a matter of fact, I instituted a "spoiler-free" blackout on anything Harry Potter until I could get my hands on this book.  I was surprised, but not disappointed, that the book retained it's stage play script form rather than being converted.  What I was disappointed in was that the characters lacked any depth or range.  As a matter of fact, if Mrs. Rowling's name hadn't been on the front cover and I was given a copy of this to read, I would have said that it was a very average piece of fan fiction in a sea of fan fiction.<br/><br/>Not going to apologize and I wish she had done better in keeping with her previous works.
 Love it ! Another great Potter story
 Disappointed that JK Rowling didn't have more to do with this book. It read like Harry Potter fan fiction and it made me cringe for most of the book.
 Always!
 Well written.  A joy to catch up with old friends.  Good plot.
 Completes my set
 It was great!!
 Quick ship and book was great for HP fans.
 I love all things Harry Potter!
 Yes
 not very good, and very predictable
 Excellent. Nice to see what happens as Harry ages
 Pretty darn good I'd say. But it's Harry Potter. No matter what I say you're going to read it. So stop being an ass Amazon. Ok Amazon I did your little review, can I please read my book now?
 Not as good as the original books of course, and I find the play format hard to read. Overall pretty good though!
 So disappointed!!! I love Harry Potter books and this was so bad! NO descriptions at all and that's the most exciting thing in the books! Very sad. Hated reading it thought I had made a mistake and bought the wrong one had to check back jaja
 LOVE LOVE LOVE this book! I read it in one day! Very captivating and fun! I would recommend this book to anyone who loves the Harry Potter series!! :)
 I'm surprised at all the negative reviews.  There were one or two plot problems that could have been explained in more detail, but overall I enjoyed this book/screenplay a lot.  It was a quick read and I felt it had a JK Rowling feel to it and would recommend it to any Harry Potter fan.
 Wished there was more
 loved it
 Call me disappointed. Sorry, I am a huge fan of the previous stories, but this one just didn't have the attention to detail and the level of involvement to it. I know it's a script, not a novel and that is why it doesn't have the detail. But the detail is what draws you in and help to immerse you in the fabulous world of Harry Potter.
 Even if I hadn't read the other Harry Potter books, I would have still enjoyed Cursed Child.<br/>But, having read them, made it more interesting and complete s the story.
 It was okay.
 I really enjoyed this play.  The majority of us know Harry Potter.  We have read all the Harry Potter books and have seen all the movies.  We probably own them.  Even though this is written as a play it was an easy read.  I realize this will be the last we will hear of Harry Potter.  This play ties up all the loose ends.  I am glad that Draco becomes friends with Hermione, Ron and Harry. If you are a Harry Potter fan this is a must to read.  Don't be afraid to read it because it is written as a play.  You already know the story.  You know the location.  You will thoroughly enjoy the story.
 It is important to note that this is a SCRIPT, not a novel. Given that, this SCRIPT is good. I enjoyed reading it and being back in the wizarding world, knowing that all the characters I have loved for years are okay and still up to no good-- even their children. It was a fun read.<br/>It is also important to note that our dear JK Rowling is not the sole author, as she was in the original 7 books. There are two other authors who contributed and, most likely, Rowling just approved and edited the final story. Knowing this, it is easier to accept that this is very different compared to the original 7 books.<br/>I do have issues with certain aspects of the book and think that, in some instances, it boiled down to pure convenience, not logic. That, however, is not enough to make me dislike this script and regret having read it. I absolutely loved it.<br/>I suggest reading it for yourself to form your own opinion but I believe that many fans are being too harsh on it, given the important notes I listed above.<br/>The main thing I had issues with was how long it took Amazon to ship and deliver this book. I pre-ordered Cursed Child months ago expecting to have the book arrive on my doorstep on July 31 only to be disappointed and forced to wait until August 3 to receive it. I could have understood delivering on August 1 since the 31 was a Sunday, but the 3rd was a little much. I am not likely to ever pre-order a book from Amazon again because of this (and Target had a better deal-- $17.99 for the book and a free poster with book purchase).<br/>Overall, this was a fun read and offered a great amount of closure for myself and the left over feelings I had after finishing Hallows.
 JK Rowling is back with the story and what a fantastic one. Really looking forward for this to be made into a small movie.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the gang can never fade away !!
 Loved the book or "screenplay." You get used to the names on the side very quickly. Took my back to being a kid. Great read.
 It was like a poorly written fanfiction. I still kind of enjoyed it though because I love Harry Potter so much.
 Great add to my collection
 Not quite the standard of the Harry Potter books.
 Not up to par with Harry Potter series.
 This is a script. I understand this. But the book seems to stray away a large amunt from the story we all kno and love. If you buy it, prepare to be dissapointed.
 It was hard to get into the groove of reading a screenplay. But overall the story was good!
 So much worse than what JK Rowling and all her HP fans deserved.
 I've never read any of the Harry Potter books, but seen all the movies. I liked this book but nothing was crazy new, recaped the other books.
 Enjoyable
 It was a gift
 Can't get enough of Harry Potter!
 Master in character development. Just remember it was written as a play, so it has to be read as one, not a novel. But amazing, surprise as always.
 It took a minute to get used to the way it is written but it was really good. I loved the new characters as well as how the old ones are brought back into the story. It makes me want more.
 I found the other Harry Potter books had more twists and turns keeping me more on the edge of the seat and kept me wanting to keep on reading. This book I felt was OK and too much drama between Harry and his son.
 J.K. Rowling is amazing. She has brought back the magical world of Harry Potter in this extraordinary story, which reminds us why we love her characters so much!
 Loved it!!!
 I'm not sure why I bought this - I knew J. K. Rowling didn't actually write it, and sadly it shows.<br/><br/>There may have been some mildly good ideas for a future book buried within this storyline which may have worked had Rowling herself written it, but this story didn't turn out that way.<br/><br/>All of the characters lacked depth and complexity - the same issue I had with all the Harry Potter movies - and everyone turned out as one dimensional caricatures of themselves.<br/><br/>It was silly in some places (such as embellishing the things Ludo Bagman said during the Triwizard Tournament), and just plain ridiculous in others. The liberties taken with all of the characters personalities in regard to the things that made each one inherently unique and individual made the story feel like reading a fan fiction story, and a mediocre one at that. If that's what I wanted I could have probably read a much better story online for free on any number of fan fiction web sites instead of dumping a bunch of money on a story I never want to read again.<br/><br/>The characters all had the flavor of eating cold white rice (i.e., bland on bland with nothing on it, and a bit gluey). If this story was a spice it would be air, or tap water flavored.<br/><br/>Had there not been names in front of each character's sentences I wouldn't have know whom said what because the dialogue was so similar. Rowling's style of writing makes each character starkly different, she didn't have to spell out whom said what - it was obvious. This story didn't paint a picture leaving your imagination to fill in the blanks - it told you what was happening in the blandest way possible. I could no more "see" the offices at the Ministry of Magic, or the kitchen at Harry and Ginny's house in my mind's eye than even believe that they were real places. I really couldn't imagine these characters in any environment other than a dark, spartan stage setting.<br/><br/>I have to say regarding Delphi … the thought of Voldemort and Bellatrix Lestrange getting it on curdles my stomach (and shivers my timbers). Nope, it would NEVER happen - in fact, I think there was a better chance Voldemort and Nagini were an item then Voldemort and Belltrix.<br/><br/>Save your money - check this out from the library if you absolutely must read it, but don't expect much. Better yet, go find a really good fan fiction story online instead, as it will likely be much more entertaining. This wasn't the literary magic crafted from Rowling's mind and imagination, and it is obvious. I was terribly disappointed, but have no one else to blame but myself because I knew better.
 Good story!  Reading the "script" was a lot less fun than just reading the story.
 I wasn't sure that I would like a book written as a script for a play but this book was wonderful. It was as spellbinding as any of the other Harry Potter books.
 Though it had new characters and it was great to escape back to Potter land, the story lines were not as original as advertised.
 Very disappointed. I bought this as a gift for my mother. She said it was written like a play. I thought I was buying the next novel by the author, not something based off the authors work and written in play format.
 Story surprisingly interesting. Reading a play is fun. In fact I much rather read this as play than see it performed as performance is probably going to make it too cheesy.
 Not as described this is a play , and not well written. Refund please.
 Not as good as her prior Novels
 Good
 It was really good. I feel like they left a lot to the imagination. Because they didn't really describe where they were, so it was really left to the imagination. It was really interesting though, so that's good.
 Love her books.
 Good fun with genre mash-ups, a poignant refreshing of established cast along with a clever generational leap for the wizarding world. Recommended to any Potter fan who if won't mind reading a script instead of a novel.
 Good book
 This was such an excellent look forward into the lives of Harry, Jenny, Hermione, Ron and Draco after the Battle of Hogwarts. I would so love to take my family to see a production of this play! I am saddened that Ms. Rowling has, with this stage play, concluded the chronicles of our beloved Hogwarts Alumni but I understand her desire to move on to other wondrous adventures in other areas. To those who have not read the script, please steer away from anything that will spoil the story for you. Believe me, you will want the ending to have full impact. Who is "The Cursed Child"? Read and find out and then take your family to a theater production of the play. There is no lack of the excitement and emotional thrill ride we have all come to expect from the Hogwarts team. There are even good lessons to take to heart. Superb, Lady Rowling. Superb!
 Amazing book
 I am huge Harry Potter fan, but this was a disappointment. I was able to put it down and had to force myself to finish. The characters were whining and unbelievable. I was excited and wanted to like it but just didn't
 If you're a Harry Potter fan, it's a fun little exploration but definitely no game changer
 Great purchase!!
 It was good y'all should read it. I liked it was a good book. Read the book is a good one.
 I loved the Harry Potter books. The reading of this play just does not stack up to one of the books. I would love to see her write some more books similar to the originals.
 Loved it!!
 surprising
 Very disappointed.  Didn't like the play format or the story.  Nowhere near as good as the previous books.
 any thing writes is good I didn,t like the format.
 Narrated?  It is writtem as a screenplay.  once you are past that, it's still a great story
 Loved it!
 Excellent book
 great book
 I hate to say it, but this might be the best single book in the entire Harry Potter series. I could not put it down.
 Disappointed, the story failed to capture my attention
 I wish it was a novel and not a play. When will it be a movie? Not enough background into the story. I hope your next books are novels.
 In the words of my daughter, "As a 10 year old and a Harry Potter fan, this is by far probably the best Harry Potter book. It was very fun to read, short chapters, and I could never find it in me to put the book down. It was very fun to read, in this book my imagenation went wild, I felt like I was in the book, with the characters. The characters are very funny, and even sometimes I even felt like I was going to freak out if I did not find out if I did not find out what was going to happen next, it made reading a lot more fun than usual, this book is perfect for nussuling up  on a couch and just reading, trust me, I learned it the easy way : )  It is acctually written as a script, so at first it takes a little getting used to, but then it is just like any other book, except you know, more fun : )"
 I missed all the things that the other books had - the background, the detail, etc...
 It's good to revisit Harry and company!  Not a compelling Potter book but a good entertaining read! Thank you JK Rollins
 My granddaughter was thrilled to death.  She has read all of the other Harry Potter books so is ready for this one.
 This was a continuing story about Harry Potter as an adult. It was great reading from beginning to the end. I wish they would make this into a movie. Very clever plot.
 Did not like the format in which it was written.  Very disjointed.
 I only wish it lasted longer...love this book although the play format takes some adjustment at first. But, eventually the writing takes ahold and you cruise through it just like any other novel.
 I HATED the way this book was written - like a script. It was very annoying. I didn't finish the book, and I don't think Rowling wrote this. Terrible.
 JK Rowling has done it again.  Love reading it as a script.  Being a theater nerd growing up, it was very easy to follow and picture the whole picture.
 Awesome book! Very captivating and I even got my partner into it!
 Love the Potter stories.
 A lot of ideas given to speculate, maybe to finish it in a next book, I hope. Assistance to the play, must be such an amazing experience!.
 It is written as a screen play. SO GOOD
 Actually, it's the script of a play, which I wasn't expecting. It was nice to see the characters grown but it really didn't have the same magic, pun intended.
 Amazing book, aside from dislike towards the issues with Hermione (namely how she is in the alternate time lines).<br/>However, really wraps up the storyline well.<br/>Wish I could have seen the play, the cast looked amazing!
 Loved this book(no spoiler alerts needed if you want to know what this book is about READ IT!) can't wait for the audiobook Made me smile made me cry (the mark of a good book)A wonderful addition to any Potter Fan's collection!
 This picks up where Deathly Hallows leads off! It is just as exciting and emotional as the original stories. It's a wonderful read for any Potter fan!
 Great item
 Love the story, hate the screenplay
 A great continuation of the Potter world!!!!<br/>Hope there will be more to come in the future , still easy to read even as a play
 It was a good read. Nice to learn what happen to everyone. Was interested in the time turner's. And malfoy
 Nice book. It is a script, and not a J.K Rollins noble.<br/>A bit childish, comparing to the books.
 Giving it two stars for Craig Bowker Jr. because he deserved better, and the trolley lady with spikey spike claws and her pumpkin pastry bombs.
 Great book she never disappoints!
 I had to go back to Amazon and check that I didn't buy a knock off.. This is not Harry Potter. This is fan fiction written by a seventh grader.. I'm seriously shocked how horrible this is!! Do not waste your time or money!!
 Is been years since the last time I read a book completely. This book brought my taste for reading back.
 as described
 Not up to par.
 This wasn't a perfect follow up to the Harry Potter novels but it was a good story, that flowed well and made sense.<br/><br/>I was hoping for something denser and with a bit more weight.
 It's ok, but only because it's Harry Potter. A bit too predictable for my taste. Hardcore Potter fans will enjoy it I guess.
 No nudity, disappointing.
 I downloaded the book at 830pm. I finished at 1am. Am I sorry? Not one bit. Thank you for a little more Harry Potter, Hermione, Ron, and everyone else. When I can get tickets to the play, I'll book my flight from the States. :)
 When you begin reading this story, you need to remember that it is a modified script (without director placement/scene notes).  It takes a little time to get into the flow of the script.  Once you become used to the flow, the reading of the book goes quite quickly.  Because of the time needed for a well-timed play, there are some holes that would have been filled if this were an actual book.  J.K. Rowling would have filled the gaps that are there for the play, but since a play usually runs about two hours, it is not possible to fill all of the holes.  On point is J.K. Rowling indicated this would be the last of the Harry Potter books.  This play leaves one opening where Delphi will be sent to Azkaban.  We know that several witches/wizards have escaped from Azkaban over the years.
 This wasn't the best for the HP story.
 This was a gift to my grandmother. She loved the book and enjoyed telling me about it. She is a Harry Potter lover but not hardcore
 Omg i loved this, mainly because it was just a continuation of the books. The package arrived in a timely manner.
 More of the same with the next generation.
 It was everything I expected and anticipated.  I hated for it to end.  My only critique is that in the beginning it was hard to read because of it being in script form.  I found it hard to follow, but after a while it was ok.
 made you want more
 NOT worth t he time.
 Fast read
 Tremendous fun.  Look forward to someday seeing the show.
 Felt like I was reading fan fiction
 The story reads like a terrible piece of fan fiction. I'm sure it looks great on stage, but anyone who is a big Harry Potter fan will be frustrated reading this. It's best to not read it and pretend it never existed.
 My grandson was excited to receive this as a gift!
 Good quick read. Hard to put down. I look forward to her next one. Hopefully its out sooner rather than later.
 Being based on a play, it was a little different than a regular book, and sometimes hard to follow.
 I wanted to know more about some of the other characters. (Such as Hagrid and the Weasley's other children) I think I would prefer another book instead of a screen play!! Ijs
 As a long time Harry Potter fan I found it difficult to wrap my head around the adult versions of the characters. However I did enjoy the overall concept of the plot. It was an easy read that made nostalgic for the previous books.
 On the grandchildren's wish list.  They'll love it!!
 This was tough to like simply based on how much I enjoyed the original series but, it was a fun and fast read. Would be curious to read sequels if JK decides to write them.
 love it
 It was quite good, but nothing like as engaging as the previous books ... or indeed her other, later ones
 Wonderfully written and skillfully scripted. A must read for all fans of Rowland's captivating, magical realm of Harry Potter.<br/>Steve
 While it is obviously not the meaty Potter books all us potter heads have grown to love, it definitely satisfies the craving we all had after the 7th story ended!
 two thumbs up
 this is clearly not written by JK. Nice story  but boring.
 I enjoyed it, but I can see where someone who is not used to reading a script might have had some trouble with it.  I would have preferred a novelization, I think.  It will be interested to see where the story goes from here.
 Is particularly special Rowling's ability to catch your imagination take it to an adventurous ride. Doesn't matter your age or how much you knew about Harry Potter series , The cursed Child is a complete and powerful story.
 No comparison to other books. Read for curiosity, but you will be disappointed with the story.
 Does not disappoint.  The characters are wonderful and a great way to pick up the books, giving you a glance into the future
 Very excited to read the newest story in the world of Harry Potter and I wasn't disappointed. Albus Potter is a wonderful character, as is Scorpio Malfoy, and the ways these characters echo and also change the stories of their parents is a delight.<br/><br/>In ways that I don't want to spoil it does revisit old territory, which is not what I expected. But the choices that lead to those moments are very strong. This is a story about children dealing with living in the shadow of their parents' histories (and their parents struggling to deal with the same thing). It's rich terrain.<br/><br/>I suspect some readers will find certain big character moments towards the end a little less satisfying, in large part because this is not a book, where everything gets spelled out on the page, but a script. There's a lot of magic in these pages, but there's undoubtedly far more on the stage.<br/><br/>With the publication of the script Rowling announced she doesn't expect to return to the story of Harry Potter again. While I understand her decision, I hope she'll consider more stories about Albus, Scorpio (and also Delphi, Rose, James, Lily and all the rest). She and her co-writers have added a lot of interesting toys in this latter-day wizard world that we barely get to play with.<br/><br/>Last note -- loved every Ron moment. He's only gotten more fun as a character.
 Good story line. ewnjoyed it very much
 My son love it!
 sister loved it !
 Loved the story
 Good story. A little obvious at times. I am sure it is a great play and I hope to see it now after reading
 I have read all the series now.
 So very disappointing:( didn't even finish it
 Good book!
 Terrible.  Does not add to the series; is basically fan fiction.  I really wanted to love it, but absolutely hate it.
 Arrived in great condition!
 Sad and exciting at the same time. It was great to see updates on the major characters, although, would have been great to see minor character ones too.
 Wonderful Birthday gift
 Loved it! Great message and fun.
 It started out slowly and I almost quit reading, but I am glad that I didn't.  I loved the story.
 Harry has a rebellious son; no surprise there.  But at least we get to spend more time with the characters which is always fun.  The script format was a bit off-putting at first but I adjusted.  A good read.
 Didn't know it was a play!  :)
 Friends and I have enjoyed this read!
 I really enjoyed this story. The only problem I had was that, like every other pop culture phenom at the moment, it rather centered around parental issues.  I'm getting sick of this tired topic, are you listening, Marvel?  Not all of us have parental issues, some of us DO, but don't care, and certainly don't want all of our treasured fiction full of characters with daddy issues...but I digress.  This was a fun story, and I was happy to reconnect with some old friends.  (Minor spoilers!) I loved the alternate timelines, but I always love a story with alternate timelines.  I wish I could have the opportunity to see this show on stage, the magic described in the stage directions must be TRUE magic to be performed on stage!  I bet it's an awesome thing to see.
 I went into reading this book with low expectations due to negative feedback. I was pleasantly surprised. Your three teenagers (how we left them) grew up &amp; were living adult lives with problems. Albus Severus was a middle child &amp; Scorpio was an only child. Both weren't popular &amp; they were drawn together. I don't want to say a lot because of spoilers but trust was misplaced &amp; they were curious. Wanting to do something good for another person but being boys, you can hurt or get hurt not knowing what you are doing. Albus was the middle child, he would never be anything special to his parents &amp; he could never live up to his Dad's legacy. He reminded me of Harry when Draco told him there were people to hang out with and ones to stay away from. He stood up to Draco &amp; made clear Ron was good enough for him. Albus did the same on the train to Hogwarts. He joined Scorpio in an empty train compartment (Scorpio was alone). Albus' cousin Rose told him they needed to sit elsewhere, basically Scorpio was not a person to sit by and especially be friends with. Albus stood up for Scorpio. After that, Rose, his own cousin severed all ties with Albus. When Harry was young, he idolized his dead father. Albus resented his living father and wished he wasn't his son. I could go on but read this book through the eyes of Albus &amp; Scorpio &amp; what transpired. When parents don't keep open dialogues with their children &amp; tell them how they should feel instead of listening to them, bad things can and will happen in our real world and even in Harry Potter's world. Read it from this point of view and you may really enjoy this book!
 I enjoyed this but I much prefer the books of J.K. Rowlng - they're so rich in detail that this play lacks.
 It may not be as flashed out as the books, but it's not supposed to be. You get to use your imagination and have a continuation of the potter stories
 This book did not meet expectations, but the fulfilment by Amazon was spot on.
 good one
 Just ok.
 Disappointing
 I got this book for my Harry Potter crazed sister as a bribe to surrender the PS4 for a couple of weeks. The bribe worked and she really enjoyed the book, which is less of a book and is a script for a play. She actually liked it being more of a script and finished really quickly. A fun fact that I learned until after she finished the book was that she was texting her Harry Potter crazed friend (who already read this book before she received hers). After every chapter, she would text him her reaction.<br/><br/>As much as she loved the book, she's especially a fan of the two leading male characters, she did have a few issues with Harry and a couple of other characters. Which lead to her miniature rants on the problems she had and how she would improve them.
 Wonderful I'm a true Harry Potter fan but I only received one book was I supposed to be receiving two for part 2 or do I have to order that one cuz I want it
 Started slow but picked up really well
 Not worthy.
 AWESOME book!
 Such a disappointment.  When it finally started to really develop it ended.
 Had a few nice twist, could have been a great book, this is not a book it is a play.<br/><br/>Had a highlight feel, not a in-depth story. Great story idea not finished.<br/><br/>Just not, not bad not good, just not. 😦
 It was so nice to have another adventure with Harry and the gang again.  All the characters from original books were part of this play.  With that said this is not a story told in the normal book reading way.  Which I have never read a story in play form before but once I started reading I was caught up in the story so much I didn't notice the difference just wanted to know what was going to happen next.  I would love to see this play and see how they do the things munched in the book.  It seems that at times the play comes out into, over and around the audience it would be so magical to be a part of that.  With all this said I'm NOT GOING TO BE A SPOILER!!!!!  If you liked the Harry Potter books you will like this book READ IT AND JUDGE FOR YOURSELF.
 Once more into the myth.  This is a great story, and the play format challenges us to imagine the Hogwarts universe in another way.  (Yes, it's different from the books.  Different does *not* mean bad!!)  a plus here is that our family can read the lines together and immerse ourselves as much as Muggles can.  Very consistent extension of the Potter story.  I am secretly pleased that the grown-up Harry confirms what I noticed around Book Three or Four:  he's kind of a jerk.  No one is perfect, not even the Boy Who Lived.  But his story does live on for at least one more chapter.
 I can't give it less than three stars because it's a Harry Potter book but to say I was impressed with the book would be a lie. Not surprised though, you can't add on to something that's a legend.
 Great read ! A must for Harry Potter fans
 Loved it got to be able to see what Harry ron and Hermione were up to since the last book, I just didn't really like how it was script written
 I love HARRY POTTER. I knew it was in a play format, doesn't change the fact that I still miss all the narrative in the character's mind though.
 love it
 Love the idea. I wish it was longer and not a screen play. Also wish the chemistry felt more real with Harry and Ginny.
 I am spoiled by the depth and characterizations in all the other "Harry Potter" books and the beautiful renditions of the movies. I'm sure the play itself would be fun to see..The story line is good and some of it is compelling and easily visualized. I was frustrated by the characterization of Ron as a grown imbecile when he had been coming into his own at the end of the original story. This also left Hermione cold and more aloof than I desired. The stage direction seemed bleak in comparison to the richness of interactions of the characters in the movies  and that they were so faithful to the written words . Perhaps the fact that it is only a script is what has provoked my disappointment, But I'm glad that I purchased and read this new work.
 pretty good
 What an awful piece of trash.
 Very creative storyline!  It took a little while to get used to the script style of writing but I was swept in by the twists and turns just like with the earlier books.
 Good read
 The physical but book was fine. I just didn’t like the content. I’m hoping the play is better.
 BEAUTIFUL play script. Would have loved to see in cinemas. Obviously jk Rowling-inspired.  It's a good length. Amazing plot and vocabulary. love it.
 It's was good. But it felt like there was something missing from it. Not sure what it was, but still a good story that gives you another taste of the Harry Potter world.
 Great short story. Leaves you wanting more:)
 Was great finished in 1 day. Had Alexa read it to me. That's why 4 start instead of 5.
 I would like to see the play
 It simply wasn't up to par with the series.  I found myself skim reading ad it just did not capture my attention or imagination.
 Excellent
 Not nearly as good as the novels. Interesting, easy read, but could easily put down.
 Disapppointing.  Not as complex or layered as expected.  Perhaps it was the fact of it being written to be a play.
 The book was alright, but I will never accept it as canon.
 A fun read and nice to get some more Potter in my life.
 Great read
 Great book want to read more
 The story is nice, give an opportunity to two rival to make peace.
 This obviously is written for the stage and I suspect it is an exciting show. Since I do not yet have the opportunity to go see it, I was glad I could purchase the script. It is a very quick read.
 Perfect!
 Initially I think is a bit difficult to follow due to the play written mode but after you get used to it.....you can not put it down.Love the story line and the new characters. Excellent!!!!
 It is the script for a play not book to read.  Rowling should have rewritten it, if she wanted to publish it as a book.  It looks like she took the easy way out to make more money.
 Decent book, but be aware that in script form. I felt it was too condensed
 Excellent! I just wish it was a lot longer store. More, keep potter alive!
 I absolutely loved this book
 Brought back all the characters loved in the original books.  Read more like a story than a play.  Left me wanting more and hoping other books like this will be coming in the future.
 Not as captivating as the original series.  Definitely a new way to take the Harry Potter books but lose the theater aspect.
 Excellent read!!
 Not nearly as well written as any of the other books, but a decent story. I just really liked hearing from my old pals. Read like fan fiction, but I thank the author for the reunion.
 was expecting to be more like the previous ones. This is more like a theater script
 The style was more like a script than a novel.
 It is a frekking manuscript for a play, not a novel.<br/>My bad for not reading the description before buying, but I still fell I was tricked.
 I enjoyed the book. I would have given five stars if it was in story from instead of at form.
 Great book, the entire series
 Not exactly what I expected. Would have been better in book form than play script. It was nice to see the potter team back together though
 Fun story line. I like her prose better than the stage script style. I am reading the original series for the 16th time and each time I read it I can't wait to turn the page! There is also a humanity to her books that this script and all of the movies do not have. There is magic and wonder and deep humanity in just the Weasley's gathering for a meal! Her description of the table groaning with plates of food makes me want to get up and start cooking! I hope she goes back to writing in full prose!
 Fun addition to the Harry Potter family of books. It took a few pages to wrap my brain around the format of the book - actually the script written in book form - but then it just flowed as naturally as reading a regular novel. Anyone that has read the novels should read this book - and will enjoy this book. Characters that were old friends from multiple readings of the first six are greeted with pleasure in this reading. Some nice twists and some nice messages - enough spells to salve my desire for the format of the first six.
 Thanks
 Loved it, not used to reading it as a screenplay but couldn't put it down.
 Potter's version of Back to the future?????
 A little disappointing.
 It's Harry man... HARRY!
 According to my wife, great book.
 The writing is truly awful. Just so, so bad. Ought to make a decent film when they hire a real writer to create a good script. Not worth buying now however.
 Amazing!!
 Good book easy to read gives you a look into what could happen in the future would recommend to others
 did not like the play format.  Did not compare to the previous books.
 I fully enjoyed this and would recommend it to any fan. Just go into it with an open mind and know it is not a continuation of the Harry Potter series!
 I liked the book, but is not near as good as the original series....still brings back good childhood memories and is a good follow up story
 Different read but good
 Clunky.  Reads like fan fiction for the most part.  Excessively short scenes are more reminiscent of film montage than theater.  Very special effects heavy for a play.
 Everyone who is a Harry Potter fan should read this book.  It answers many questions and it reads like as if you were watching a movie.  I loved this book.
 Very good.
 Love it
 Book is written like a play.  It does not hold the reader's attention.  As written, it does not make me want to keep reading it.  In fact, I've read one or two acts and I stopped reading it. It's a snoozer.
 It was a very different read. The play format, instead of the usual book format, was definitely a change. I'm sure that visually this play would be spectacular, but as a normal read, it leaves a lot to be desired.
 Felt like a piece of poorly written fan fiction.
 Harry Potter lovers must read!
 My granddaughter loves Harry Potter books
 A great addition to the Harry Potter line.
 Amazing!!! Gave me the HP fix I needed till Fantastic Beasts comes out. Couldn't put it down.
 Two thumbs up!
 Fantastic.  Great return to the world of magic.  Can't wait to see the performance.
 Was really disappointed with this book.  I realize it's a screen play, but the story line was weak and a bit contrived.  I LOVE the Potterverse, but this one left me unfulfilled.
 Loved it. Very exciting.
 An exciting romp and adventure with the next generation. The story created unexpected twists and turns that kept me engaged and looking forward to the next act.<br/>Excellent.
 fun read for potter fans
 The history was good but I didn't feel the same emotion that the series made me feel, Harry has change a lot, it was a different character, and Albus, well, I wanted to hit him while I was reading.
 A bad time travel story with endless conveniences and unlikable characters. This is one Harry Potter story that never needed to be told.
 I liked the new Harry Potter book, but I thought it was a little strange how J.K. Rowling decided to write her new book as a play.  Don't get me wrong though, J.K. Rowling has to be one of the best authors I know.  :)
 Loved reading this book. It was like being with old friends who have high values and ethics. Another exciting adventure, enjoy.
 For fans with Potter withdrawal symptoms, this script comes in like a breath of fresh air. Fabulous use of insights provided by Rowling in the series to keep the aficionado hooked, and well-developed characters.
 It is a brief return to old characters from the past and new characters, it was an interesting storyline with constantly changing time lines.
 I think my issue was it was in play format and not like reading a book. It just keeps me wanting more to read felt to short.
 Good
 I enjoyed the next generation of the Harry Potter series.
 Reads like fan-fic
 I wish it would of been longer and gone into more detail but overall it was a good story
 I never thought I'd hear myself say this but what a disappointment! Jk Rowling could not of wrote this. I realize it was written in a play version and maybe the play is better but I can't imagine any of these characters acting the way they did or talking the way they did...okay I'm about to spoil it for you so please don't read any further....<br/><br/>Spoiler spoiler spoiler<br/><br/>My issue with this is that's not Harry that we know I mean yeah this is the grown up Harry but he doesn't act or talk like that..and Draco and him friends? Jk Rowling had revealed that they never became friends. And bring Snape back has Mr nice guy! The whole thing voldemort has a daughter?? Okay that did it for me! I hope she goes and either rewrites this has a book or writes a whole different version give us a better look at how things turned out for everyone. Like Harry would say this is rubbish...lol
 Being a Harry Potter fan from the beginning, I expected the book to travel in a different direction. It was a good book, and I enjoyed it. It just lacked the traditional "Harry Potter" style.
 If your a fan of the Harry Potter series then it's worth reading. A little cheesier than the originals but still enjoyable.
 This was a great follow-up to the great series JK Rowling wrote. We get a glimpse into what the wizardry world is like after Voldemort is defeated. We also see how the characters we watch grow up in front of our very eyes while reading the books is like in the older age. It was exciting to also learn some of the new Potter and Weasley clan. At the end of the original series ending book, we see Draco Malfoy begin a transformation from his family traditional view of people. We get to see his son pick up that mettle and transverse the name into a better light. The writing format is total different than most people are use to because of it being constructed for a play. But once you figure the cadence and get a good grove going while reading, you fall back into the world everyone has loved.
 My grandson enjoyed it, but it wasn't as good as the first 7 books.
 The story seemed stretched, the stage unrealistic and the characters shallow and one-dimensional.
 I never once felt like I was being transported back into that world.
 If you expect any insight into the lives of the characters from the books,  you will be sadly disappointed.  It reads as you would expect a screenplay to read,  which is fine. If you read a lot this won't be a problem.  The problem is the whole concept and the changes that were made. As other readers have stated, this does not seem to have been written by JK Rowling. I don't think the people who wrote this even read the books. Some of the writing is silly, like you might find in fan fiction. If you can get past all of this, it is an ok read, just don't expect to want to rush out and get tickets to the play, it had the opposite effect on me.
 Oh my, there are so many negative reviews for this!  I'm a big fan of the original HP series too.  We won't go into how many times I have read the series, because it's a lot.  And here are my two cents.  This newest installment isn't a HP novel, and it doesn't read like one.  It's not even by J K Rowling, though her name appears on the cover.  However, I still enjoyed the story.  It was interesting to read Harry as an adult, struggling with his teenage child.  The play does feel a bit like fanfiction in spots--the time turners, the alternate universes--but at least it's fanfiction endorsed by JKR.  I enjoyed the story, and reading it made me miss the Golden Trio so much that I now need to re-read Books 1-7 for the umpteenth time!
 It was very nice my son was pleased with it,
 Reading a play is always different. It has a powerful plot line while spotlighting difficulties between fathers and sons, which is weird, given that we have known these fathers since they were 11 years old.  At any rate, we see some pretty unreasonable fathers and some pretty thoughtless teens.... and are given a dose of evil in between. I'm about to dig in for my 2nd read and am only sorry that it isn't/wasn't fleshed out into a novel.<br/><br/>A caveat: if you have not read the 7-book Harry Potter series, do not start with this play because you won't understand a word.
 I really wasn't all that thrilled. I realize that this wasn't meant to be a book so is therefore not written as such but still this story just seems thrown together.
 It was hard to get in to since it was written as a play and not a story.  Once I wrapped my brain around the way it was written, I fell in love with Harry all over again!
 If your a potter fan this won't disappoint
 No review for a while as I don't want to spoil it for anyone  :-) hope you enjoy it as I did.
 This book was given as a gift.  She was elated!!!!
 💜💜❤️❤️💙💗💙💜💜💜💙💗❤️
 No it did not because it was written in a play screen form, not in a book form.
 I am a huge fan of Harry Potter and with some of the reviews being negative, they were prevented me from reading right away. I was afraid of being disappointed.  I loved it. It had some twists and included many characters from the books. A play is written differently than a novel.  That has to be understood.<br/><br/>I would have preferred a novel but it was great to read about my friends.<br/><br/>Thank you, I want to see the play.
 NEVER RECEIVED IT ON MY KINDLE!!!! TRIED AND TRIED. VERY DISAPPOINTED
 As so many other reviewers have written, I have enjoyed all of the Harry Potter books until this script.  If only I had stopped with the 7th novel.  This new book is dreadful.  It is not just the inconsistencies of the plot and the poor writing, but the way in which the well-loved characters have been reduced to weak, saccharine caricatures who hug and cry through it all. It will be difficult to forget having read this travesty, but I plan to try.
 I was waiting this book a lot! I was excited when it came so quickly! But disapointed, when opened it...I understood it wrong - I thought it will be written as book jus on the basis of play, but this is just printed play...
 I'm sure my granddaughter liked it -I bought it for her.
 Obviously can't be compared to the book series, but a more than welcome and thrilling addition to the HP universe. It had the right blend of nostalgia and new information. Loved all the new characters and continued to adore the old.
 At a play , yes .  I would have rather seen the play . Not as a " book" ...
 Really enjoyed this book...but thought jk rowling lost touch with some of her characters. Ron seemed more like the movie version than the character in the original books...regardless of his age.
 not a book of fiction but a show script
 it's not a book! it's a play! i wanted a book! not a play! who wants to read a play for fun?!
 I wish it had been a full novel rather than a screenplay,
 Although many have found it difficult to read via a script format, I found the story riveting.  I hope you'll give it a chance.
 I bought this because of the link to the Harry Potter books. It was well written, but it swerved a bit too much from Canon.
 Thought this was going to be a continuation but really it's just a play and reads like a play. Not fun to read. Will be returning.
 I did not like that it was in a play format.  I've always loved all of the Harry Potter books but I just wasn't crazy about the play format.
 While this had the potential to be great (and at times it is) I feel that JK let the other two influence her choices to much. The script seems rushed and has some astonishingly uncreative and sometimes stupid plot points. The largest glaring issue is where is directly disconnects with the original 7s timeline in such a way that the biggest twist of the plot can't actually be possible. It feels to much of a work of fan fiction. I am happy she wrote another chapter in this wonderful story but it needs to be rehashed and JK needs to seriously rethink this installment.
 love the book
 Bought for my son. Looks like he is happy with the book.
 Came in great condition.
 If the Prisoner of Azkaban is your favorite book you will love it. Unfortunately it is my least favorite in the Harry Potter series so I enjoyed it but not as much as the original series.
 I coildn't believe this was written by J.K. Rowling. I read like a junior high schooligans student wrote it. Don't waste your time or your money!
 Enjoyed immensely!
 I love J.K. Rowling's writing. I have the entire series of Harry Potter. This book is a bit different. It is written more as a play write and if you aren't familiar with play's the descriptions and themes are lain differently than in a typical book. However, this is an action packed book and takes you on a very interesting and unsuspecting journey. The story twists between Harry and his son Albus, and the definition of their relationship is interesting and not quite what you would expect. However, the fact that he hates that his father is famous and has a very well-known past is interesting to say the least. If you love Harry Potter books and you think you would like to try this one. The only thing I would say is be prepared for the play write style of writing in this book. Totally safe reading for kids and young adults. Shoot ! I recommend this book to people of all ages.
 It was obviously not a writing of J.K. Rowling. However it was a very good read. Good to have a story line of the future of Harry Potter. I recommend it to all Harry Potter fans.
 If I considered The cursed Child as the last book of the series, I would rate it with a single star or less. Most of it is made up with the materials of the previous books and the story is predictable with a happy end.<br/>Characters are superficially developed and do not seem to have evolved much after nineteen years and even having fathered children….<br/>This book is not relevant to the series.<br/>The only aspect that I have considered to give two stars is that it is not a book but a play and as such it cannot have the density nor the length of a true book as it was thought to be acted upon. This is the only redeeming fact in my opinion that can explain such a poor rendering of a sequel of Harry Potter’s books.<br/>If you can avoid the temptation to read something new of Potterverse, keep your money (it is far too expensive for what it is) and re-read the previous books. You’ll more satisfied and will see new elements that you did not see the first time and you’ll enjoy it much more than reading the cursed child which should be rather named “the cursed book”…
 Liked the content of the story which continued with Harry, Hermeine and Ron's children.  But not the format
 It was so good! - little hard to get past the format of reading a screen play. But overall I loved it! I would read a million more from Rowling.
 I ignored everyone.. Everyone is a critic these days. I went in with no expectations and finished this story thinking it was brilliant. I would love to see the play!
 My daughter loves it!
 The plot was terrible, the dialogue forced, and the personalities of the character inconsistent with the books.
 I've summarized my opinion on the Goodread. Now just shortly: I was so disappointed.
 Packaged very nicely - it looks good! Story left a bit to be desired but that's a whole other issue that isn't really a product thing and more of a personal problem.
 Thought it would be an actual book like the others and not a play. Shame on me for not looking deeper before purchasing.
 Did not get a chance to finish this book because my brother Harold wanted it and I gave it to him.
 sad story indeed
 Good
 It was okay, nothing too special. A bit short without too much character development...even the usual trio were a bit weird and disappointing this time around. And the whole script method of writing was a little annoying.
 Like
 I'm not a fan of play scripts VERY HARD TO READ &amp; keep up with
 Loved it!  Hoping for more.
 Loved it<br/>It was a very good book &amp; a great edition to an already brilliant story!!!❤️❤️❤️<br/>Great<br/>Sweet<br/>Beautiful
 I loved this book! The writing format was different than the books but once I got past that, it was very good!
 I liked the play, I just had a hard time wrapping my mind around some of the things that had happened. It was worth the read.
 Good for a quick read and if you want some new Harry Potter material to consume. However, the story was somewhat weak and seemed to conventional for the much loved series.
 The play looks good.  It is easy to read as long as you remember this is a play.  It could make a great book if the characters are expanded on.
 I was a HUGE Harry Potter Fan since I was 8 years old. After the death hollows movie came out, it seems Harry Potter faded away from my life. But this book absolutely reignite my passion to the magic world!
 Great follow-up!
 I really loved the screenplay and if you are a Harry potter fan just read it as it shows and explains more about the world year's after deathly hollows
 Loved the book! Easy read &amp; brings the storyline to a nice conclusion.
 I loved the whole thing couldn't put it dow
 I was pleasantly surprised with this book, as it is a script. But my imagination ran wild just as it did when I was a child reading the Harry Potter series. Loved how it brings everyone together.
 Yes, because I knew script for two plays and would be quite different from her books but I totally enjoyed it know all of the above.
 Bought this for my girlfriends birthday and she was very excited.
 Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, Parts 1 and 2 was a great sequel for one of the best children's literature series.
 Great for the fan!
 It takes a bit to get used to reading the book as scenes, the first time I tried, I put it back down. When I gave it another try I read it all in a day. But then again I am a huge Harry Potter fan.
 A quick read.  A twisted story line, but lacking in the subplots of the books.  Probably better seen than read.
 The book is about struggles, redemption and love. A truly remarkable screenplay. It quenches the Harry Potter fans' thirst for an 8th book. But, it leaves them wanting for more... a 9th book perhaps?
 Loved it!!!! I just wish there were more Harry Potter books. Hate to see it end.
 I could nota stop reading it! If you've read the seven books this will make you freak out! A must read!
 Not a fan
 Fun to have the wizarding world back!  Was a bit difficult to get into but had some surprising twists.  All in all, would recommend.
 I prefer reading in story form however once I got into this book I became fascinated with the twists and turns (no pun intended) of the time turner. I did enjoy all the characters and the story line.
 I would give it zero stars if I could.  As a fan of the Harry Potter series I was excited to read this only to be extremely disappointed.<br/>Lame story and writing.<br/>Stop adding to HP.  It is perfect already.
 Scorpius was the only reason to read this. I was severely disappointed with characterization and several plot points. It felt like reading bad fan fiction.
 not up to Harry Potter standards
 What else would you expect
 My expectations were low so I didn't end up disappointed. The story at least kept my attention and it IS a page turner. That being said, the writing is pretty terrible and there are a lot of uncomfortably cheesy scenes.
 I don't know what you 1 star review people read but I think you guys read an entirely different book than I did. I can't wait for a movie if there's going to be one.
 Product was fine. Book is awful.
 Not as great as an actual J.K. Rowling book but it does have the same heart and I really enjoyed it!
 I miss the detail in books, but I enjoyed this play.
 it was ok it needed a little more in the story line but it was still worth buying
 Granddaughter loved it.
 Recommend for anyone who loves the series, but set your mind in a place that this is a very different read.
 Loved reading about Harry Potter all grown up!!!
 Gave it as a gift. I have no idea how good it was
 Just didn't enjoy as much as the original series.
 If you're a fan of all the other books you must take this one on as well...... it's a quick read and you will go one a wild ride! JK Rowling's is a genius!
 I'm one of those Harry Potter superfans - I really really love the books and movies. I enjoyed this book as well. There's a lot of people who don't like this book because they say that there's plot holes, they don't like that certain characters don't fall for other characters, whatever.  But I love it as a look at the new generation and for the fact that JK explored the psychology of Harry as an adult.  I can't imagine him going through everything that he did as a child without coming out of it in some sort of mental pain, and he's got issues.  It's also a play, so this is a script and not written in story form; if that will bother you, you won't like the book.  It's a great addition to the world of Harry Potter.
 Very annoying to read as a play.  I will never order that kind of book again, even if it is Harry Potter.
 Disappointing. There was none of JKR's whit. I really dislike the two boys and I didn't find their relationship believable.
 Not as amazing as I was expecting but it was a good quick read.
 Amazing read!
 I love anything Harry Potter....  Screen play was awkward to read but enjoyed the adventure.
 I think this book deserves to be on the high end of four stars -- I really liked it.<br/><br/>The only character that was really amiss was Harry, and the main problem there was his dialogue.  He just didn't sound like himself at all until later on and during the scenes with Dumbledore's portrait (who totally WAS himself, far more than Harry was, even though he was just a portrait and apparently wasn't supposed to be really real *rolls eyes*).  But I could still imagine real Harry doing the things he did in this play, just not the way he's portrayed as doing them here.<br/><br/>The rest of the story was wonderful, the time travel sequences deeply affecting and profound (and heartbreakingly hurried), and the idea that this whole production goes on in a staged performance is a bit mind blowing.  I'll have to see it myself.<br/><br/>I loved the new characters, and yes, of course it was all terribly hurried. IT'S A PLAY -- it simply has to cut to the chase.<br/><br/>***SPOILERS AHEAD***<br/><br/>And despite that fact, the timeless themes of friendship and finding surprisingly wonderful people in the least likely places (i.e. Draco Malfoy's progeny and the first Potter to be sorted into Slytherin) shined through the imperfections in a wonderful way.  I loved the closure that this story gave readers to Snape and how he would be remembered.  I loved the moment where broken-past-present Draco reflects on his relationship with his wife.  I loved the dialogue between Albus and Scorpius.  I loved Rose Weasley and wished we could have seen more of her.  Hermione as Minister of Magic was a bit tough to swallow (so soon??) but whatever.  Ron was funny.  The trolly lady growing spikes on her hands was a bit much. To be sure, I could imagine her doing something intense and scary to students trying to the leave the train.  It just didn't need to be spike hands  (－‸ლ)<br/><br/>Ok, I could go on.  But I liked it.  There was heart, there was closure, there were beautiful moments with great new characters.  It's not a Harry Potter book like the others, but it was a J K Rowling story worth taking the time for.  I'll likely read it again.
 I honestly never thought I'd be in a position where I would give a Harry Potter book anything less than 5 stars. JK really did her fans a disservice with this. Had she sat down and written a new book with this plot line, perhaps the characters would not feel so disingenuous. They are not true to character and come off like well, a fanfic piece. The plot is contrived, and doesn't really make sense in some parts. Two stars is generous.
 IT'S HARRY FREAKING POTTER('s son!!!!!!!!!!!!)
 One of the best books the family has read in a long time.  The characters were well developed and the book read easily.  This was a hard to put down book.
 Wizardly wonderful.
 Not quite as enthralling as the Harry Potter series, mostly because of lack of character development. Our favorite remain in character, but I didn't feel the same empathy for Draco's and Harry's sons.
 Loved it and passed it along.
 Ok, maybe The Cursed Child is not a roman and you are uncomfortable because of that; but if you are still the pottermaniac you were, you will be delighted while reading the official continuation of Harry Potter's saga.
 Glad to get another adventure in Potter world
 Did not like the play venue, I prefer a book
 I don't realize that this was NOT written by JK Rowling until I was well into the book and was surprised by the characters. That's my fault.  I would recommend this book for a preteen, not a good read for adults.
 I'd give it less than 1 star if I could. Not even close to the quality of the Harry Potter series. I had to force myself to read it, and that's rarely ever something that happens to me with books.
 I liked this book! The only bad thing is the fact that it is written like the play. 😃 😃
 I was nervous at first, but it was everything I hoped it could be and more. One more visit to the wizarding world and a story with heart is exactly what I needed.
 Well written but in play format rather than novel. Did not feel the scenes were as fully developed.
 For something that is not a book is great, it still gives you enough information for your imagination to try and picture how everything took place.... You feel it was not written by JK, but still entertaining...
 Disappointing.  Prefer narrative to play.
 I'm so disappointed.  I wanted to love this...I love Harry Potter and everything about the Harry Potter world.  I wanted to immerse myself in 320 pages of old friends and new friends and love it.  Instead, I put the book down as I finished it and just thought "eh."<br/><br/>1) The plot -- weak beyond weak.  'Going back in time causes changes in the present' is one of the oldest 'what ifs' in history, and authors have used it beautifully to explore possibilities (see Amazon's original series Man in the High Castle for a great example!) Unfortunately, this book used the "what if" as a cheesy excuse to stick scenes from past books in almost word for word.  Not only that, but the "effects" of the "changes" were weak and not substantiated by the cannon of Harry Potter.<br/>2) The characters -- see the above...if you're a Harry Potter superfan you know these characters like your own best friends - but even if all you've done is read the books, you still have clear expectations of characters.  Rowling's series is YA literature, and despite the classes that have tried to read depth into them, the characters are unarguably clear.  Having those characters change dramatically in a story with no catalyst besides "getting older" or "thinking" is a huge plot weakness. (I'm trying to avoid spoilers here, but Harry not being Harry, Hermione and Ron almost completely negligible - characters of themselves, Draco?? )<br/>3) The writing....this is the death knell in my eyes.  It doesn't ring with JK Rowling's language.  Reading this is basically like reading a cliff notes version of a weak fan fiction piece.  The language, the voice, the diction -- all of it basic and weak.  Don't try to tell me it's because it's a play.....I read plays fairly frequently, and depth and beauty of language is even more important on stage -- see Tennessee Williams, or even Miranda's recent Hamilton. This just feels rushed and forced.  I'm sure great actors could make it feel better - but as a pure script it fails.<br/>Overall, my final review is that this feels like a very weak attempt to keep the Harry Potter money train moving forward.  I hate to say anything against Rowling, but this is clearly NOT her work...and why she would put her name on it is beyond me unless she just wants the money.  My suggestion -- check it out from the library, don't waste your money.
 Nice story a bit too short. I wish it would have been a novel instead of a play but I was happy for new material.
 I don't like that it's over but the series defiantly went out with a bang. I couldn't stop reading. I literally read it in 2 days. So long Harry Potter. What will Rowling do next? ;)
 It was different than the previous Harry Potter books but it should be because it was about his son mainly. I saw the reviews and decided to read it anyway. I am glad I did and I think you will be too.
 You know when you watch a cheesey rom-com and you know what they'll say because it's SO CHEESEY? That was this story. I wanted to love this, and I tried to. But the plot was like a bad fanfiction. And if you don't like to read scripts at all, it's a no star.
 Book quality is book the price is fare!! I love it!! Five stars
 I love the harry potter universe and I'll read pretty much anything the JK puts her stamp on.  But if you are reading this review i doubt you are like them then.<br/><br/>1. It's a script for a play.  Its cearly not even the working script because there is no stage direction as all.  just a blip here and there about where they are.  It's all dialog.<br/><br/>2. the plot is written like a 90s reunion episode for your favorite 80's sitcom family.  They went out of their way to have people that shouldn't be in the HP universe 20 years in future pop in for a cameo. The Dialog is MUCH better than what you find in those tv events.<br/><br/>3. 40 years olds are kind of lame and have flaws.<br/><br/>Read it if you love harry potter.  Don't read it if you are a casual fan.
 There were somethings I didn't care for.  Harry would never have put work before his child.
 Missing some characters I think should have been involved, but pretty good on the whole.  Nice addition to the Potter series.
 I really liked the way it read as a screenplay. Absolutely loved the evolution of the original characters!! Can't wait to read some more JK!!
 Lacked the joy and excitement of a true JK Rowling novel, it felt like a fan fiction to me with lots of characters entered only as fan service.
 not as good as the originial Harry Potter books
 it was so good
 Being written as a play it was very hard to read and follow
 Didn't realize it was written as a play. I found it to be a good quick read. Recommend to any fans of the story line.
 I'm loving Albus, what a wonderful return to such a beloved story.  Hoping the tales continue! Great spin on characters.
 Excellent. Story. Developing. Characters. Interesting. Story. Want. To. Keep. Reading. Hate. To. Put. It. Down.
 Great book
 This was amazing, wonderful, magical, inspiring, lovely, and every other word one could think of when describing something they love so much! I had been waiting for this to come out for the past few months and it did not disappoint! I loved being able to "catch up" with some characters that were a huge part of my childhood. This book was so much more than I imagined, I could never have guessed that this was how the story line was going to go, which was great since I was able to be surprised &amp; love it that much more!<br/><br/>I loved the surprises along the way since they made the story that much more enjoyable.<br/><br/>I always loved Draco in the books and movies and this play just made me love him more, as well as the rest of the gang!<br/><br/>A MUST READ for any Harry Potter fan. Do not even question yourself. Buy it. Read it. Love it.
 Great way to wrap up these rise but it could also be a beginning. Well written and the stage directions bring it to life.
 Great story as the kids became parents! Artfully written.
 It's a movie scribe
 This is a screen play, not a book. I'm a huge fan of the series, so I read it anyway but it definitely wasn't what I was expecting when I purchased it.
 I love the Harry Potter books and movies, so expectations were high.  The story is likely more enjoyable in person.
 Great book
 Personally, I held on to this script until I saw the play and I'm so glad I did. It is very different reading script versus a novel. You won't get the imagery a novel provides and scripts aren't meant to have that-- I think the folks that were disappointed in reading this were expecting a new novel filled with J.K. Rowlings famous imagination. Believe me, it's there, but the magic is on stage and this will let you relive that magic after seeing it.  #keepthesecrets
 This is an amazing book. It was great being back in Harry's world. As a parent it brought back a lot to see his struggle to connect with his second son. Definitely recommend!
 It's a good book that continue the story of Harry Potter. The type of writing is not easy to follow, but after some time you get used to.
 Very good  miss the longer story lines though.  But good screenplay.  Would like to see it.  You it becomes a movie to
 Spoilers!!!!!!!!!<br/>A+++<br/><br/>I’m not just saying that as a fanboy because JkR didn’t even write this book.<br/>I loved it because it perfectly reflected my own life of trying to make my parents proud.  Then when that doesn’t work just as with albus  I would work hard at trying to fix broken things to only make them worse to trying again and making them go even more worse to the point that life becomes like black horrifying pit of hell.  This is what happened to Albus and is exactly how my own life played out. And just when you think the horribleness is over it only gets harder. But through these trials we become stronger and wiser and we learn that being skilled at something,  having lots of money or romantic love none of that really matters. It’s nice, sure but none of it matters. The thing that we must set our focus on far exceedingly more than those trivial things is friendship. That is where true strength lies. With friendship nothing is out of reach. Everything is achievable if we place friendship as priority one.<br/>Jayallan Bennett
 LOVELYY
 Nice to have another new book.
 As a huge Harry Potter fan who has read and reread all the books, I was disappointed in this book. Not a fan of this writing style.
 Exciting fun book. We read it as a play with my family which was also great because then the story wasn't broken. We had some good discussion on the family themes in the book.
 I was dissapointed to see this novel written in play script form; I did not finish it.
 Unique format but a good way to tell this story.<br/>It's not the same old HP but well written and an exciting story if you can get into the script.
 The prose and writing style is not fitting from a book from when we were used to the novel rather than a play wright, and it takes longer than Shakespeare plays to develop.
 Cover is not what i saw on original book
 Good read
 I loved it! It was so nice to be back in the wizarding world and get to know the next generation. I only wish there was more... Very well done, though!
 Loved the story. It was different than the books, but a great read. More Harry Potter is always a good thing.<br/><br/>Would recommend to any fan of the other books.
 Great book
 I was hesitant to read this one because of the way it was written, but once I started, I couldn't put it down.
 I thought the ending was disappointing.
 enjoyed this book.
 I enjoy Harry Potter stories and I like reading plays.
 This story is very LAME.  J.K. Rowling did not write this.  The writer used her material from her 7 books.  All old stuff, very little new. I kept waiting for something exciting to happen, never did.  I've read and loved her books for years.  What a disappointment this was.
 Excellent
 You know what I liked it. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
 Great book I love it
 As always Harry Potter --- Great  Did not exactly care for the Play Script, would have preferred a novel, but was still good.
 I don't understand all the negative reviews are about overall it was an amazing book, not as long as I'd like it to be but hey read for yourself and tell us your opinion on it
 Good
 It's written as a play.  Somewhat difficult to follow.
 I enjoyed the story but I had a little trouble reading it in play form
 Awesome per grandson
 Couldn't put it down - was sad that it ended
 I found a disconnection when reading the play.  Did not care for the book.
 Couldn't wait to read it and then get right back to it every chance I got.
 Great 8th book to the series.
 FANTASTIC. So great to be back in the Wizarding World after all these years. Now can we just get to November already?!?
 Looks like a money grab for JK. Nowhere near the quality of the original Potter series.
 this book was a very big disappointment
 Not great but not terrible. I overnight. Character of the boys but totally didn't believe the new character of Malfoy
 love this story - huge Potter fan
 An odd book.  Don't expect JK Rowling's voice.  Reads more like fanfiction.  Certainly someone's opinion of what happened after book 7.
 A wonderful story and a Harry Potter classic. Love it!
 This was so awesome to read.  I can't wait to see it on the stage!
 Absolutely satisfying! After all this time we Harry Potter fans needed just a little more adventure and Jack Thorne was brilliant!
 I did not like reading a play. It's not like a book, and self disjointed to me
 Entertaining, but written like HP fanfiction rather than the complex stories that we are used to.
 Great as ever
 As expected, not as good to read a screenplay instead of watching.  Felt like fanfiction, but was ok for what it was.
 It was excellent. Love the idea of confronting the past and accepting it. I know many complain, but ignore those complaints and go at the screenplay with an open mind.
 I chose five stars because I thought this book said everything. I loved how traveling through time created the new problem. And how voldemort had a daughter, excellent. I always knew that Albus was a slytherin since James was teasing him about it. I thought that even though it had a few flaws, overall it was great. A few things I would have changed was seeing more of Albus and scorpious school time. I mean, I knew it was written as a play, and they might not have had time to add that. But in the book, maybe they could have added something more. Otherwise, I think it was a really good story, and I could follow the plot really well. You should really read the 8th Harry potter book.
 Being a Harry Potter fan so very disappointed in the format. So much of the old material merged into a play. I missed the characters development. I think the cursed child  is barely worth the read. I have come to expect excellence in a J.K Rowling book and this book was so much less than her first book. All her other books built on the book before with darker and deeper characters. This seemed more like a first draft.
 Great but left me wanting more. The ending seems a little abrupt.
 Not the same as the one we all grew up reading. You can see them in your mind though. It's still a nice magical story. I tried to look at it as a separate story from the original and was able to thoroughly enjoy it.
 Loved the changed character personalities, plot twists and pace of the story!
 It was good.
 Much too difficult for a young person to read a script. Very disappointing. Big my kids gave up<br/>In it.
 Even though this was written in a play format, it read like a novel.  Loved how JK Rowling let us glimpse a little about Harry Potter and his children's future.
 Harry and the gang where true to there self ,but as parents, trying to be good ones.  I only wish there was a bit more Ron,  I loved it anyway!
 I really wanted to love this book and was hoping that the play made its way to California.  But despite what could have been a really good storyline, this was almost painful to get through. The writing style and character development were not even close to what one would expect from a Harry Potter novel.  The main characters had the same names as the ones in the original series, but that was the only thing that was familiar in this book.  It was as if the writer had never read the original stories....like they'd heard about the characters from someone who'd read HP Cliff Notes.  And for only the first and fourth books.<br/><br/>There was an amazing opportunity here, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one.  But this was a major disappointment.
 It's a sript for a play, not a book. :-(
 Wasn't excellent like the previous 7 books, but wasn't awful by any means. It reads a lot like it were fan fiction but still written by a famous author.
 Love all of these books!!! It was great to see the future of the Hogwarts crew and their children!  Loved it!!!
 It was pretty good  but I didn't like that it was a play.
 Good story but don't care for the script writing
 Really good but different where it's a screenplay.
 Good read.
 Great for the grandkids.
 Loved reading this book.  I could not put it down.  It was read in a day and a half.  A must read for any Harry Potter fan.
 Thoroughly disappointed!
 amazing book!
 I really enjoyed the book. As it is written in a play format, it took me a while to get used to reading in that style of writing. Harry and his friends were just as they normally were but the children were written in completely opposite form from their parents. It was great reading this story and seeing the many changes in HP, Hermione, Ron and Draco as they were parents. Also many surprises that were found in this book as well - it had me slack-jawed and fast turning the pages to make sure that what I read wasn't real (hint - the alternate reality with no HP). Get the book!<br/>The reason I gave it 4 stars was in some parts - it became very slow and tedious to try and read through.
 Not as terrific as the original series. However, it I is a play, so we don't get the benefit of characters thoughts. I did enjoy. Anxious to see on the stage!
 Great extension of the HP series.
 It was a fun, fast read.
 After being a big fan of the Harry Potter series I was very disappointed to read this book. I had a hard time getting into the style. I wish she had just written this book in a normal fashion.
 Great book!  Wish we had more!
 One dimensional characters and a convoluted story.
 Enjoyable having loved Harry Potter, but definitely not the same. It's a very quick read because it is written like a play.
 Just so-so - certainly not of the same exciting times as the Harry Potter series.
 5 Star
 terrible, like bad fan fiction
 Such a amazing book yet so sad that it's the end of the Harry Potter series. I really love this book you should get it
 Excellent read! Couldn't put it down!  Nicely done.  Excellent real world applications regarding family, friendship, fatherhood, love and the ties that bind.
 This is horrible it is not an actual book but a script. I wish I could return it as I don't I will read it I meant to get the actual book
 Great addition, just wish it was not written as a play.
 I love Harry Potter.
 Loving the Harry Potter universe, this was another beautiful written book that I couldn't put down. Loved it from start to finish
 What a great story for all of the Harry Potter fans. Written as a screenplay, it's easy to follow and, get caught up, once again, in the world of Harry Potter. A must read!
 Boring.
 Satisfied  Was better then I expected I had heard so so reviews and was skeptical.  Overall a good book. Thanks
 Wonderful read.  A great addition to the Harry Potter series.
 The GF loves it!
 I did NOT like this book!!
 not as good as I thought it would be
 Keep an open mind, remember it's a SCRIPT, thus it's meant to be seen and you'll be able to enjoy it.
 Th play format, would have enjoyed a novel much more
 LOVED!
 Its decent, not great but not horrible. Its definitely worth getting to read and enjoy another Harry Potter book. Something I've missed.
 Written like a play script.  Weird.  Okay but would prefer an actual book.
 Did not like the style of writing. Not like reading a book.
 Nice strange to read in play format and too short for $$$
 It was ok, but it didn't compare to the others. Wish there would have been more old characters like Hagrid, Luna, and Neville. Could not get attached to these guys.
 Yes I did!!
 Worst story ever. Not a novel but a screen play some one wrote at Starbucks. Not a book at all this is a scam!!!!!!!!
 Can't go wrong with any book in this series.
 Gift for my grandson who really enjoyed it.
 Fun to have a new adventure with old and new characters, but writing not up to quality of JK Rowling.
 A very quick read and if you go in not comparing it to the original series it's a good time. Unfortunately just can't live up to the legacy in my opinion
 Excellent read
 Enjoyable read. Wonder if this will become a movie.
 A while back, I sort of accidentally pre-ordered Harry Potter and The Cursed Child... You know, the eighth story... Nineteen years later... Well, when it arrived, I was surprised (bc I didn't recall ordering it) and I was actually a bit mad when I realized it was the Special Rehearsal Edition Script.<br/>I mean, I'm not interested in putting on a play, why would anyone order it?! So looked into returning it, without even reading it.<br/>I'm so glad I was not able to return it!<br/>I eventually picked it up and gave it a quick read, scripted and all... And guess what?! I couldn't put it down!! I thoroughly enjoyed it!! I had read some other's reviews which were not as favorable however, in my opinion, it was fantastic!! In case you're on the fence about it or care what I think! 😜 I say thumbs up!
 Book is very good. Not real keen on the playwright style
 awasome book
 Awesome!!!  Loved it.  Wanted more. Can't wait to read the other off stories of JK  Rowling. Easy read for a rainy day.
 Definitely not what I expected.  I loved all the other books, I was so excited waiting for this one to come out.  Just did not reach my expectations.
 excellent and recommended
 You have to give it time. Reading a script is a bit different than reading a novel. You don't really have the descriptive text that goes along with a novel. Reading a script, you have to use your imagination a bit more, because all you really have is dialogue. Once I got used to reading the script form, I began to enjoy the story much more. You might have to read it more than once to fully enjoy it, but it will be worth it.
 loved it. Please write more about the Potter bunch and their familiy.
 It was fun to read Harry Potters mishaps again.
 Same interesting writing but too short to get some depth.
 Not my favorite way to read Harry Potter. I prefer not as a script.
 Voldemort would never have a child, he would consider such human ties as irrelevant weaknesses
 Who wants to read a screenplay. Seriously
 I enjoyed the read. It was a little predictable. However, I did enjoy the fact that it brought closure not only for the readers, but for some of the characters in the book.
 I didn't like the play format. I think the characters where not well developed.
 So disappointing, why was this even written?
 An interesting and quick read. Enjoyable.
 Fantastic Book!!
 It got a little cheezy with all pop and son feelings and the action was lame.
 It was wonderful.  The screen play was so different from the novels yet so alike.  The characters remain the same
 After reading all the Harry Potter books, I found reading it as a play not enjoyable ,however, seeing it as play , I would rate that much higher as the story line was interesting.
 Enjoyed the book because it was Harry Potter, otherwise it would have been not particulalry good (nor bad).
 It was well done and true to the other books!
 She did it again. I was skeptical because it is a screenplay but it ended up being too amazing to matter. Excellent. Wish I could see it on stage.
 Hi jk I am cj from USA I like your books very much thank you for letting us experience the harry potter world again thank you☺😊😂
 Does not stay true to the characters or type of story that JK Rowling created. I was so excited for this book, but am severely disappointed with the way the story took its course.
 My wife approves = makes this household very happy.
 Best post Harry Potter book that you can read. It met every expectation and more. This book is definitely on my Harry Potter reading marathon.
 It was wonderful to relive the Harry Potter experience.  I started reading it and I was reliving the original magical experience I had with the first book.  Then the story became predictable and mixed with old story lines.  Actually, rehashing of all old story lines and the blood line of he who must not be named. I want to stop.  The fourth act was the most painful to read.  But somehow the story must conclude. And so is this review.
 I'm still having a hard time finishing it.
 If I could hop onto a plane right now and go and see this play performed I would. It must be the most beautiful production.... I wouldn't even know HOW they could make it into a reality. I wish wish wish I could see it..... What a blast from the past! While I do feel this book felt a bit 'fan fictiony,' I actually really enjoyed it. I was open to not enjoying it and willing to give it a bad review if needed - I am always truthful and honest with my ratings on books. But - luckily I loved it:<br/><br/>The book takes place 19 years after the Battle of Hogwarts and we follow Albus Potter, Harry's son, who is struggling to live up to the Potter name. There's a lot of conflicts in his life, from a hard relationship with his dad to his pretty grim Hogwarts experience - and so when something happens that means he could change the past and inevitably the future, he grasps the opportunity only to ROYALLY f*!k things up.<br/><br/>I am someone that never rereads a book. That said, I hadn't been swept into the Harry Potter world since I was a kid and I was really nervous that this book would ruin a major part of my childhood. Yes, I was one of those complete nerds who would be standing outside of the bookstore at midnight dressed as a witch, waiting for the release of the next book in the series..... don't judge me.<br/><br/>I'd tried my best to keep away from everyone else's opinions until I'd read it but some people had told me they were really disappointed - I still tried to go in with an open mind though. With that in mind, I really don't understand why people were disappointed in this book! I found it captivating, page-turning and thoroughly gripping. OK, the writing wasn't earth-shatteringly good but it's written in the form of a script and I think they did a damn good job at making it as good as it could be.<br/><br/>I enjoyed being reminded of certain things that happened in the original Harry Potter books that I'd long since forgotten about. I enjoyed catching up with the characters too (although I can never really remember Ron being quite so classically humorous.. I always thought of him as quite ingeniously sarcastic and dry rather than 'trying' to be funny). I am still not sure what I think about Draco's character, he changed the most out of everyone to me - a lot of character development which is always a good thing, but I liked him as the bad boy. Just my opinion.<br/><br/>The plot wasn't as mind-boggling as the original books, it was short and quick and had a direction all of its own and there is nothing wrong with that. You can never beat the original HP books - but I definitely think this book is worth a read nonetheless.
 It's basically a fanfic, but the worst fanfic you've ever read.
 Such fun. Incorporates elements from all the other books. Don't think it will be made into a movie, but still an enjoyable read.
 Not the typical harry
 Badly written and uninteresting. I love the Harry Potter series and this is a huge disappointment.
 The fact that is is the workings of a play,<br/>It is stil a good read.
 I just don't like the play format
 took a little bit to get on to reading it in "play form" but once I did - it was great!!
 Harry potter ane the cursed child met my expectations way more than I imagined, I know many people are not big fans of the book being written as a play but I loved it and made it a quick read for me.
 A nice read for a rainy afternoon with enough twists and turns to keep it interesting. Fun to revisit the wizard in world and the characters we've grown to love in a different place in their lives.
 I'm not happy. My child was very happy to recieve and quickly, she finished the finished book. My daughter researched if she has the same pages as everyone else and she did not, missing 40 pages. She also did not find the words the end. The last page is listed below as a photo for your reference. I would like an explanation please, and thank you.
 Great book. I liked the former very much. when is the next Harry Potter book coming out. I am looking forward to it.
 Great book! Typical J K Rowling.  It was a bit tough at first since it's a script, but once Ingot into it it read very quickly and kept my interest.
 nothing more needs said.
 Leaves you wanting more!
 I found harry to just not be what he was but the plot was really fast jumping all over
 Makes a lot more sense if you have read the series.  Some time and logic gaps can be hard to follow.  An interesting update to the story as a whole.
 Wish it was in regular novel format but still enjoy the story, and glad it is in hard back.
 It was nice to see some things resolved and a look into their lives it was a lovely story enjoyed the read
 For whatever reason I can never get enough Harry Potter. I liked the play but I need more of the wizarding world. Please expand the storyline into novels.
 Well, what can I say. I've read all the Harry Potter books, and this one is no exception.<br/><br/>While I don't think this is a literary masterpiece on the same level of The Goblet of Fire, I do feel it was a fun addition to the series. The style made it awkward, but it was still a quick read.
 This was amazing. Please make it into a movie. I have missed this world. Transported back within the first 10 pages. Thank you JK. When do we get more? Next book please.
 It was good, but didn't have the same "Harry Potter feel" as the originals.
 Great read, but too short. It was exciting to see how the Harry and friends ended up after the last movie.
 There are no words. Amazing story telling. I enjoyed it and will probably read it many more times. Wonderful book.
 Having read the previous seven Harry Potters many times and this one three times, I think the authors have done an excellent job. I had often wondered if and how the series could be continued, and they have done very well. I would have preferred a full-fledged book rather than a stage play, myself, but it comes across well anyway. I wonder how some of this could be staged, though. Regarding the going back in time and making changes, this opens a real can of worms, but sci-fi writers are doing it all the time.
 Despite the script format, I still enjoyed The Cursed Child! I applause Rowling for taking a leap and trying something different with HER STORY, which many people fail to realize.
 Not enough...it's never enough!  The ending was anticlimactic and extremely short.
 Our daughter loves anything that is Harry Potter
 Thanks
 I unknowingly ordered this play expecting, a novel, but was not disappointed at all. I quickly became engulfed in the story and read it straight through in one sitting. Truly magical.
 It was a good book, but short. It was nice to know how the adult lives of the original characters turned out without getting too invested in the new characters of the children.
 Expected a lil more. But good script. Good to know a little more background. Glad to see how the transcripts are written.
 Very disappointed it was written as a play. But the Story was going and reminiscent
 Goes with my other Harry Potter books.I like the author.
 It was good, but I think I like Harry<br/>Potter to remain a kid.
 Such a fun read, as always more about human relationships than wizardry. Very insightful. Given not read a play in a long time.
 Nope.
 Well made book, good price, unfortunately the book itself is a piece of crap.
 I didn't expect this to be in play form, which doesn't read as easily for the average reader I think.  Also I felt there was too much repetition from previous books and not much new content.
 As usual JK leaves you wanting more .  JK has made her characters real once again.  Will be rereading the stories once again.
 Let me preface this with, I have 9 3/4 tattooed on my wrist that I got while visiting London.<br/><br/>Without spoiling it for anyone, if you are a fan of the Harry Potter series you are doing yourself a disservice by not reading Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. Yes, it's a play which means you aren't going to get the amazing depth of imagery that JK provides. I thoroughly enjoyed envisioning I was an audience member as the play went on, at the edge of my seat with my heart in the pit of my stomach. The story gave me everything I could want from what is to be the final story in the Harry Potter world. I laughed. I cried. I said good-bye and you will too.
 Not her best book, but definitely awesome to go back to Hogwarts!
 Enjoyed the continuation.  Took a bit to get used to written for a play, but glad I got through that.  Loved it!
 It doesnt feel right for a Harry Potter story.<br/>Love it better when JK Rowling wrote it by herself and made it into a book, not a screen play.
 Good story but story about Harry is the best
 A++++
 If I ate a copy of 50 Shades of Grey, and then made a book from my bowel movement, it would still be better than this crap.
 I couldn't finish it :-( Just didn't feel like JKR wrote it.
 Very interesting concept . Love it!
 Remember, it's not a book. I wish it was a book. I personally say don't waste your money and read this. Save it and go watch the play or something else.
 It's not a Harry Potter anymore and it's fine this way.  I was interested to see the story of his children and that meets expectations. The play-form of the story gives a new flair to the series.
 Simply disappointing. Felt nothing like the HP we know and love. I re-read all 7 books just to get the feeling I was hoping to get from this book.
 Thank you
 It was great to revisit the world of these characters, and I loved imagining how these things might be accomplished on stage.
 Great book and service
 A welcome addition to the wizarding world of  harry potter.
 I like it a lot, thanks
 Enjoyed it!
 Seems great so far!
 Definitely not as good as any of the seven original books, which were great!
 This book dkes not really live up to it's name. Way too much time was spent discussing feelings.
 This is a continuation of the Harry Potter books, but this time it is about Harry, and Draco's children. One thing you should understand is that this is a script to a play and not a proper novel, so don't go in expecting it to be anything like the other books in the series, it's meant to be experienced as a play (for example the book details where characters will appear on the stage and things like that.), and just reading it isn't giving you the full experience.<br/>I see many people complaining about the characters and story, apparently expecting the content of a full novel from something that is only a script to a play with a very limited amount of time in it, so the story goes VERY quickly, going from plot point to plot point to plot point as you would expect in a theater production.<br/><br/>Personally as a fan of the series I enjoyed the book a lot, I loved the characters, and the story. And I went in with basically no knowledge of it or what would happen besides that it was a script to a play, and I didn't expect anything more than that.
 This is a screenplay and should be reviewed as one. Anyone that complains about it knows exactly what they were buying when it came out and they just want to shout and complain. As a screenplay this is a great book! I was hesitant at first but it really picks up after a few acts. It ties into the original series well and if you are a fan of Harry Potter you will love it. Would it have been better as a full novel? Yes, of course. But it's not so I recommend you don't act like it is and you will enjoy the read.
 As always, easy to read, unic situations, magic and friends...
 It is a good book, but the story itself os not as catching as it used to be.
 Good book
 Nice read. Not the best of the series.
 Awesome book!
 This was a great book and story line.
 I did not connect with the story or the characters as I did with the books.  It seemed to be more a remembrance of the books and not really a new story.
 A little tough to read in script style.  Loved the story!
 Excellent read and well worth the wait. Great addition to the world of Harry Potter. Can wait for the next one.
 I wish that if they were going to make another story in this series, JK Rowling would've just done it herself. It doesn't match the pace and writing style of the other books.
 Great book
 All the big people in my house are Harry Potter fans. J.K. Rowling is a very talented writer, and her books are engaging, witty and cleverly written. This book had an interesting storyline, and was a nice addition to the Potter story, but it was not QUITE as good as previous stories. I'm not sure if I was thrown off by the different energy it takes to read the lines in the play, the fact that J.K. was not the primary author so the "voice" was different, or the fact I was just left feeling like more could have been included.<br/><br/>All in all it is a solid addition, just left me wanting more and something a little more polished in the end.
 Reads like bad fan fiction. I'm surprised that J.K. Rowling would endorse this. It lacks the magic and imagination of the original stories. I will say that I found the relationship between Scorpius and Albus endearing. However, that was not enough to make up for the terribly thin plot or the destruction of the original characters.
 I LOVE IT!!!!!<br/><br/>OMG! This book is one of the best in the world. Next to the rest of the Harry Potter series. 😃😃😃
 I thought when I first saw they were making a new Harry Potter book what could go wrong? Well very thing I've never been more disappointed with a book. It had such a cheap story it sucked
 This book was a good idea but I was sad it was written as a play! Even though it was a play I stilled enjoyed it and I would say it was worth my time and I hope other people read it too!👍🏼👍🏼!!!
 The book was in great conditions, and obviously loved it!! Expected a little more content, but was good!
 I could read Potter stories forever! Thank you, J.K.Rowling, for writing yet another favorite!<br/>I was nervous about reading it in script form, but I found it easy to do.
 It was a great way to carry on the story
 Just what I knew I was getting myself into.
 Great new Potter tale, quickly delivered!
 The play is so much less than the books, yet I paid more for this small, skeletal, just okay story than I did for any of the books.  My son, a fan of the series since it began didn't even finish it.<br/><br/>I was going to say it is sad that many will not be able to afford to experience this as intended since plays are so expensive. However, in truth this, story is so lacking in substance and imagination that it seems not to be a product of JKR at all.  The play may have wonderous staging, but the story will still be, as someone else pointed out, at the level of lesser fan fiction. The bit about Ron at his wedding, what was that? So out of character!<br/><br/>My advice would be to get this short read from the library if at all.
 Great book
 Since it is a script, it was hard to follow at first. Characters came in and out of scenes at different stages of their lives. Did enjoy it. Just wish there was more description and continuity.
 12 year old niece read it in 3 days.
 Enjoyed every bit of it!!!
 I wish I lived in the U.K. so I could so this live. I absolutely loved this screenplay and I couldn't put it down.
 It's a good read
 Love anything Potter and was happy to revisit.
 YESSSSSS!!
 Would have rather had it in book form.
 Read it in one night! loved it!!
 should  not have been  written as a play- that was very distracting.  does not come close to compare with jkr's talent.  If I was her,I'd be embarrassed<br/>to have my name on the cover.
 This is written as a play, but reads just like a book.  It was a nice continuation from the original series.
 I do not like the way it is written, not as a book, but as a play.  Hard to read.  Very disappointed.
 It's J.K Rowling, is there anything she writes that isn't extraordinary? I've been a big fan of the Harry Potter series since I was 12 years old. I remember forgetting my book (for our reading assignment) in the 7th grade and a friend handing me the 1st Harry Potter book to read instead. I was instantly drawn in and the magic never ended for me. This was a quick read and definitely different because it's written as a play. I think it opened up the realm of imagination though because we all know what world Harry lives in, and it was easy to imagine it. Thank you J.K Rowling, for another fantastic experience 17 years after reading the 1st book.
 If you love the Harry Potter series this is the book for you. If you can really read, the fact that it is written in script format does not matter.
 So glad to have all these wonderful people back. I missed them. It's a powerful world of good and evil -and how they intertwine in all of us.
 Great to read again! The book brought every memory from my past readings alive again. I only hope it continues ....
 Like most of the other reviewers, I feel like this book doesn't hold true to the traits of the characters that we all know and love. It felt too rushed and ended quickly. I was left very disappointed when I finished reading. Wish they didn't call this the 8th Harry Potter book.
 Difficult to follow in script form.  Will probably have to read it again to pick up more of th story.
 took advantage of readers.  not worth money. thin story line.  minimal character development.
 Great story but obviously a novel would be more enjoyable to read!! Reading a play is a very different experience!
 I'm such a Harry Potter Fan, it's ridiculous. There is no way I wouldn't love it. I'm so not biased:)
 I have read many of the other reviews here. Some have criticisms that are not valid. I have found the story to be very interesting. The characters are true to their portrayals in the previous books. This book is a script, so the author cannot tell us what the characters are thinking as in her books. Some have criticized this. A script is a bit different than a book and the reader must realize this. Still, the author did an excellent job of portraying the characters without the benefit of giving us their thoughts. The only thing that bothered me is we are never told why Ron is managing the joke shop and no mention is made of George, the one who owned the joke shop. Is he no longer around; the readers are never told?
 The quality of the ebook product was good for the kindle app on my iPhone. The content itself, read as a fan fiction rather than a professional play script.  Completed reading in 3-4 hours, not worth $15 for the digital copy in my opinion, but there are no plans for an audiobook.
 Great read!  It went by too fast...
 This should not be contained within the Harry Pottet series. Missing is the heart and soul of Harry Potter ... J. K. Rowling as the author. I agree with other reviewers that this may play well on stage. If you are looking for Harry Potter I am sad to say you were tricked. This book lacks Ms. Rowlings' great prose.
 Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the Harry Potter series. But this in book, the writing is just eh, the plot is predictable, and the whole dang thing feels like a fan fiction.
 Good story but the play format was distracting.
 it reads like a play :/
 It was very disappointing. I'm surprised J.K. Rowling allowed it to be published.
 Absolutely loved it, bought a copy for my grandson and niece. I loved how all the characters were brought back to make the story.<br/>👍👍
 I didn’t know what I was suspecting going into this, but this play wasn’t that good. Now I understand this was a play and was not going to be a novel, but it’s not the writing format I have a problem with as much as the story. It just left more questions than it attempt to answer, and the character didn’t seem to have the same personality as in the earlier books. The characters are older, but they don’t even seem the same. I don’t know what more to say it wasn’t an absolute horrible read, but it wasn’t that good either. Sometimes the worst thing about a story is that people (and sometimes the author) will not let it end when it needs to end.
 I enjoyed the book so much.
 Even though it's not a book i feel to parts of the story are missing. It feels rushed in parts and in the end for me it just does not captivate me.
 It was a good effort. Too many errors from the original books. Still a good read though. But it's not Harry Potter the way I remember it.
 Love reuniting with all of our favorite old friends, but to be honest, it's cheesily written and no where near the same caliber as the straight forward J.K.R. we all know and love.
 This is a perfect addition to the rest of my Harry Potter collection.
 I personally do not care for reading a play.
 So disapointed!!!I did not know it was written as a play, not a book. So much for pre- order. My first mistake. A waste of time for me to try to read it.
 My Immortal was a better version of this terrible book.
 The best thing about this book is that it brings back the world of Harry Potter. Seeing all these people in the book make me cry. A good book for fans, though with some bugs in the setting.
 Now I just wish that I could see the play in person!
 love love love love Harry Potter!!!!!
 Had I done my homework I never would have purchased a book written in "play" form. So disappointed
 It was very short and felt like it had to fast forward through lots of description be used itsome written as a play.
 I could see all the movie characters as I read it.  Very well written, and I hope it will be made into a movie.
 As a theater masters student was disappointed on first read.
 boooooringggg
 Seems a missed opportunity to write a proper novel as well. Not the same.
 The author was amazing, bringing what was lost to life. I look forward to the next series of books. This book must be the beginning of new adventures to come.
 The book was an excellent book ups and downs but very exciting
 I was a bit leary of it being a play. But was delighted to find that the set information did not detract from the action of the plot. In fact envisioning it as a play was most satisfying.
 Does not even begin to compare to the other Harry Potter books.  Would not recommend.
 Little different reading as a script, but still interesting.
 Enjoyed the actually series, and this was a fun story. However, it was just a short story. Expected much more. I think any potter fan will enjoy it for what it is.
 I did not like reading the book as a play.  I did not like the changes of some of the characters.
 Thank you
 Very Good.
 Eh.  I managed to get through it.  Next time write a story without the theatrical direction.  If this ever comes out as a movie I certainly will not see it!
 Good; not as solid as stunning as the originals, but good nonetheless
 I can't say I liked it.  It was a gift for my sister....but she said she just thought it was okay.
 Not horrible by any means.  It is a little hard to read and follow until one gets used to the format.  I think it would make a better book and I look forward to a movie.  Once I started getting into the story, it was over.  If you lack imagination or creating an mage in your mind about what is happening, you may not enjoy this book.  Very little character and scenery description, you will have to make it up or recall from other books as you go along.  Could have been so much more.  I get that it's a stage play and they want you to see the play, but could have provided more for the reader who will not have an opportunity to see the play.
 For those who love Harry Potter, this is the next step in the story. The plot leaves so many opportunities for another story, another book, another movie.
 Love it . Very entertaining and easy read. I'm not a big reader and I finished it in two days.
 Difficult to get into the story because of it s play format.  Otherwise up to the author's standards.
 I don't understand how this was ever approved.  I would give it a 0 out of 5 if I could.
 Amazing stuff this story is so good. Some of jo s work such as the cashual vaccancy is too seedy for me to handle but all her magical and mythalogical prowess is an absolute joy.
 Daughter loved it!
 Did not know it was a play, a little hard to get into, but a good story in the end.
 The plot is good but not great. I do think it can be made into a really good movie.
 Couldn't finish it, story line similar of previous Harry Potter books just different character names. The character development is poor.
 Its written as a play and just god awful...
 I thought it was a novel.  It was a script of the play
 It is weird to read a HP story on this format. I missed the details, but I loved that the story advanced so fast. But sometimes (specially at the climax) was so fast :(
 Easy read. Enjoyed getting caught up on Harry and friends after graduation.
 Recommended for any Harry potter fan. Just enough to tAke the edge off of my HP craving but not what,I expected. A,little predictable and not a fan of the "script" flow.
 gift requested and well received
 I seriously regret reading this. Everything about it was just bad.
 I literally re read the entire Harry Potter series just to wipe my memory of this book ...and it worked like a charm :)
 Enjoyable. Gets a little confusing with the time travel, but very strong character development.
 The format of the book was different than what I expected. I still enjoyed it!
 Great book!
 Totally enjoyed it. I thought it would be difficult to read due to format but it wasn't.
 Love this!
 Great story! a little bit slow in the middle but a wonderful ending.  Don't get discouraged if you get confused because the ending makes up for it.
 Didn't care for it at all. Was disappointed
 don't like the reading in a script format.  why couldn't it be in a normal book format
 Good book, waiting for more.. And maybe a movie
 I must start this by saying that I love the Harry Potter book series.  I have read each book (1-7) 4-5 times each.  I started reading them as an adult, so I did not grow up with them as many did, but they are some of my favorite books.  I was worried I would not like this script; that the story would not truly be under JK Rowling's "umbrella" or feel like her story/voice, and would disappoint.  I must say I was pleasantly surprised.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading it.  It took a little more work to imagine as it is a script, and I felt the characters were left very unexplored, even the ones we know so well and love. With the passage of time, they have all, as expected, changed and I think they (and we) were short changed by not having them flushed out more.  I am sure the actors playing these parts in London will bring a nuance and depth to the characters that you cannot feel or see by just reading lines; however, I do wish it was a book.  I think it is a really neat story that could have been done more justice in a book.  I do feel a bit cheated in that regard.  I wish she had taken the time to do it properly (as I see it).  I am happy to have purchased it and read it though, and I will do so again and again because I enjoyed the story that much.  Hopefully many of you will give it a chance,and find that the overall feel and direction of the story is very much fitting of the series and Rowling as I did.
 Story was good but I didn't like the screenplay format.
 Waste of time and very disappointing.  It's not like J.K. Rowling writing at all.  There are inaccuracies when referring to prior events based on the prior books.
 what can i say its JK Rowling
 I got the feeling that one of Rowling's childern wrote this story, so like a good mother she had it published.
 Good story but no original Harry Potter. I wasn't a fan of the writing format and I thought there could have been more in depth story lines.
 Kindle app doesn't let me read the book unless I give it a rating. Don't know why. Will review again after reading the book.
 Nineteen years after Harry Potter defeats Voldemort in the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry's youngest son, Albus Severus goes before the sorting hat to be placed into his house.  Both father and son are having difficulties accepting each other and where they fit into the wizarding world.<br/><br/>This book is written as a script for a play, and sometimes feels very much like Harry Potter meets a Comedy of Errors - but, not in a bad way.  I loved it and look forward to going to London to see it live.
 I missed the creative detail and background of Rowling's novels!
 It's written as a play. Once you realize this fact, then you can digest the fact that it reads differently than the other books and enjoy learning about what happened to everyone after the end of Deathly Hallows. I know there is a lot of disappointment out there regarding this book, but I think that it is simply a case of people getting their hopes up so high that nothing could possibly satiate their desires. In short, it is a play. If you like Harry Potter and you can at the very least appreciate theater, then I think you will enjoy this book. I quite literally grew up with the original seven books, being the same age (plus or minus a year at times) for every new  release, and I enjoyed this insight into the life of Harry Potter as an adult dealing with issues that many parents struggle with at some point. Give it a chance and don't be so critical people!
 Interesting play format, however I was disappointed in that it wasn't in a novel genre. I felt it wasn't worth the price I paid for the book.
 love it
 Disappointed, it was a script and not a story like the other Harry Potter books.
 The story accurately referred back to the earlier books, thickening the plot and bringing back exciting and found memories. Delightful.
 Not now
 It was a good addendum to the Harry Potter series
 The most difficult thing about reading this is that the intended method of consumption is as an audience member in a theater. Performed well, I might give the production another star, but as a book it suffers significantly. As a screenplay it can come alive when dialog is active, but it is difficult to read any rapidly changing scenes as happens during the setup of the story. It also takes a bit of getting used to when emotion is conveyed via stage direction instead of prose.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the thing that bothered me most is the choice to change how an aspect of magic works, the element that the story is built entirely around. While a fun adventure was birthed from it, we end up with a story that doesn't feel as cleanly crafted or thought out as the previous books or movies.<br/><br/>If you can put aside these two detractors, the story offers a fun trip through nostalgia, a new entry in the joys of friendship, and some touching moments of the relationship between parents and their teenage children.
 Awesome squel!
 Rowling's yet again wrote an interesting story with many twists
