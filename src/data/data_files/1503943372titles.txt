Fabulous, moving history of WWII in Italy, Beneath a Scarlet Sky will not disappoint. Working as a spy against the Germans, Pino Lello places himself in danger to help his beloved Italy. Along the way, he meets his beautiful Anna, the love of his life. This book is a reminder of Hitler's atrocities and how his own people followed his madness. But more than that, this  book is about the kindness and character of a young man named Pino.
Most People thought Italy was our enemy in WW II.  They were not. Just their dictator!
Unexpected and remarkable.

Absolutely a masterpiece of prose, the pages cannot do justice to the heroics of Pino. But in a short space I felt transported to northern Italy and felt hope in my heart as I read of the sacrifices of true love and the faithfulness that this man had for his fellow humans. Pino and Mimo are the quintessential brother's driven together and apart and rallied together in pursuit of their goal to free Italy from tyranny. Thank you for telling this wonderful and tragic story, it is full of con smania

The Tragedy of war
Perfect
A moving, yet exciting true life story
A remarkable life and journey of an 18 year old living through one of Western Civilizations most conflicted epochs.  How many of us would have the fortitude to live the way the protagonist did.  The prologue was equally compelling; a personal story of close to throwing the proverbial towel in, God throwing the towel and back and saying “wipe your face, your almost there.”
Loss of innocence.
