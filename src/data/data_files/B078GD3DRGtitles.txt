Too unrealistic to enjoy
This is the one - this is THE book you cannot put down
Take your time and savor every sentence.
A moving story about survival in a way that most of us can't imagine.
Did I read the same book as others?
OMG Wonderful Wonderful!
Disappointing
Debut Novel is captivating!! Could Not Put it Down!
Almost Wonderful
One of the best books I have read
Most overrated book of the year
You'll NEVER Want To Leave
Promising start that tanked.
I wanted to like it, but...
Really not worthy of recommendation
Most irritating book I've read in a long time!
Very disappointing.
Really? Not a thumbs up from me.
Frustrating Geography, Ecology, etc!
Must Suspend Reality A Little Too Much
Beautiful prose, but the story line is lacking...
A waste of money!
Ending ruin a great book
this book was terrible-terrible writing, terrible plot went on forever
Overrated, Dull, Unbelievable, Trite
This was not a "must-read" for me.
Sand County almanac?  Really!?!?
Didn't live up to the hype
suspend disbelief
Unreadable.
Improbable, unlikely, unbelievable.
Best book I've read in awhile!
Nature writing meets romance novel
Waste of time
Puhleeze!
Lovely Read for Those of Us Who Love Nature....But.....
Well written, but a downer
Overrated.
writing with depth!
In the minority.
Feeds the senses
Ending was Upsetting
Unbelievable
Right Story, Wrong Time Frame
NC geography
Not terrible, but unbelievable and unbelievably overrated
So Disappointing!
Suffocating dullness throughout
LOVE LOVE
Unrealistic in so many ways
More of a fairy tale than a novel
Maybe I'm Too Old?
American magical realism
A Rarity
Abandoned child lives in swamp
An unbelievable fairy tale
Dull, disappointing...Are people getting paid to post all these 5 star reviews?
More Crawdads and Less Silly Plot
They ain't no crawdads in a salt marsh.
Stunningly bad
Not one of those deep books that makes you think
Sad Tale, but Worth the Read
Good story, simplistic character development
To long
Seems very inaccurate.
Mystery, romance, adventure, and nature pulled seamlessly together in this phenomenal story
Meh.  Why all the 5 star ratings?
Such a wonderful book!
Yuck
A poetic delight
Not My Favorite
Beautiful, haunting, and lyrical...
4 3/4 stars  Beautifully written, but with some plausibility issues
Nothing more than a coming-of-age story
Great book with one glaring problem--poor research
Insightful and heartwarming
Expected more from a best seller
Regretfully written
Don‚Äôt waste your money!
Lovely Descriptions of Nature but .  . . .
Worth reading BUT...
Coming of Age in Nature
‚ÄúUnrealistic‚Äù Fiction
This book will last forever and forever.
Could Have Been Better
Spellbinding!
not whatit promised
Good...and then not.
The Marsh Girl resonated with me.
A bit slow here and there but so atmospheric
Setting was my favorite character
Over rated
4 Stars
No good!
more of a romance novel than a cultural one
Intreging chacter whose story line keeps shifting
Great book
Beautiful writing, sad story.
The Best Novel I Have Ever Read
Wonderful--But Geography is Bad
Very disappointing.  If you're looking for an uplifting read, pass this one by and look elsewhere.
Terrific first novel, but strains credulity
Wonderful!
Tried hard to suspend disbelief
Don‚Äôt waste your time or money
I'll  crow about this novel!
Mediocre at best
Did we read the same book?
Disliked the Ending
5 stars and then some!
A story of resiliency and survival...
Disappointing
A good, biologically-accurate yarn about loneliness, longing, survival, resilience and prejudice.

Totally Enjoyable!
Well written heartfelt book about the swamp, a girl and her life. The characters are large and rich. There souls show. A love story, a book about nature, a murder and loneliness. I laughed cried and kept reading. The authors words are so picturesque you see what‚Äôs she‚Äôs writing. Thanks Nancy for telling me to read. This would make a very good movie. Thoughts of Pat Conroe as I read.
