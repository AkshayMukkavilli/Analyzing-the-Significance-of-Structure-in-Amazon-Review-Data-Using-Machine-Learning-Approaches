 A great read.  A very entertaining romp through philosophical thought by a skilled wordsmith, but I would say the age cut-off for this book is 50.  Beyond 50, you've probably already learned most of the lessons in this book the hard way, however, I can see where it can be extremely helpful for a generation that spends most of its waking hours posting narcissistic selfies on their iphones.  Manson gives you the blueprints to get your head out of your ass, (or out of your phone) take a hard look at yourself and the real world around you, and shed many of the illusions you've been slowly poisoning your life with.  If you're a millennial, or even a disenchanted X-gen, pick up this book.  It will give you at least a more healthy point of view.  But, if you're over 50, you're not going to find anything new in here except entertainment.
 I've read quite a few "self-help" books in the last 30 or so years, always curious to see what the writers have to contribute. I went in with an open mind, but could barely finish this book. While there were some good points made early on (such as, we should concentrate on things that matter, like family and friends), there was little substance in about 150 pages of this 200 page book. Mr. Manson describes in detail the thoughts of several deceased persons, from Beatles drummer Pete Best to a WWII Japanese soldier, but does not reference the sources of his information. He theorizes that many of women's accusations of sexual misconduct by men are "false memories" and that men have been harmed in the process without recognizing the impact of this very real phenomenon of sexual misconduct on our culture.  Regarding his account of how sometimes his wife "doesn't look great", and he suggests she change her clothes/hairstyle....just, wow. We'll see how that works out when she attains some confidence.<br/>I have to think that his "wildly popular" blog is followed primarily by readers much younger than Mr. Manson. When his followers mature, I think the writer would be well-suited for a job in search engine optimization. He has figured out that the most commonly searched word is f *ck.<br/>Unfortunately, I bought a hard copy of the book -- will likely  just throw in the trash.
 As someone who has given far too many f***s about far too many things their entire life, this book was exactly the wake up call I needed. Even as a child in elementary school, I would have a miniature meltdown when I got a bad grade or if a friend was mean to me that day. As an adult, I got better at hiding these emotional upheavals and intense reactions to the world around me, but they never really went away with my maturity like I had hoped. I took to heart every disheartening news article I read and every crappy thing that happened to me at work or in school. I'd let it consume me, because I was never told to live life any other way or that controlling my reactions was even remotely possible; I thought it was just a permanent part of my personality. I always knew that it was more of a vice than a virtue, but I felt like I couldn't fully control it.<br/><br/>Mark Manson's The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*** employs a witty use of profanity laced with satirical comedy that's bursting with philosophical wisdom. Much of Manson's inspiration originates from nihilists, Buddhists, Albert Camus, and Charles Bukowski, but he brings those philosophies into a more modern and palatable perspective. He reminds us that life is too short to react so passionately about every little thing. We have a limited emotional capacity, and we often squander it on reactions to mean-spirited people or unfortunate events, completely forgetting that, although we can't control the world around us, we can control ourselves. This book has empowered me to exercise control over my reactions.<br/><br/>Shortly after reading this book, my husband commented at how "zen" I've become. I'm no longer angrily venting to him about all of the various ways the world upsets me. I still allow myself to feel and talk about things that bother me (I'm not aiming to achieve nirvana as a Buddhist monk), but petty things no longer have a hold on me. I let the negativity wash over me now without letting it absorb into my soul, and my life has been much more enjoyable as a result.<br/><br/>I was so inspired by this book and its philosophy, that I wanted a permanent reminder for myself to further ensure that I use my f***s wisely from now onward. For my birthday, I got this simple, but meaningful tattoo on my right wrist. The ∞ symbol reminds me of the infinite nature of time and outer space, and the 0 on the bottom represents humanity's relevance to time and space as a whole. It can also be translated as don't make something (∞) out of nothing (0) or a reminder that there are infinite opportunities to give a f***, but that I will remain steadfast in giving 0 f***s about things that don't really matter.<br/><br/>If you're the type of person who's struggled to keep their temper in line or if you're like me and you find yourself on an emotional roller-coaster because you take every event in the world and within your own life to heart, I strongly encourage you to read this book. If profanity is so much of a problem for you, that you can't tolerate reading the first half of this book (the last half is much less profane) you're probably too narrow-minded to have taken away any of the many philosophical benefits this book offers.
 What I like the most about this book is that my initial thought of; "This will be a good read- I'll probably get a provoking thought or two out of it", turned into, "Wow. This book has literally changed my life, for the better." Since I've finished it, I recommended it to four people, two of which have acquired the book, and I even got an extra copy as a gift for a friend. I intend to read this book every couple years or so for the times I need to be reminded of what improved my life so much in the first place. This is an easy read- yet written on a sophisticated level (despite the title), and I looked forward to every bit of free time I could dedicate to reading it. There were times I laughed, got teary eyed, and most importantly said, "hmmm, I never thought of it like that before..." I recommend this book to anyone who is open to changing their mindset, and can understand irony. Obviously the title is not instructing the reader to stop taking care in interest in EVERYTHING, so if that thought never crossed your mind upon reading the title, then I suggest you read this.
 Sorry, not sorry, but not a fan. This book is pretty much written by a person who had crisis in their life (as many do) and wrote a whole book of life-advice based on their single experience. This book seems to be heavily influenced by taking what Mark learned from his therapist, based on his personal issues, and transforming that into a set of principles that will somehow act as a cure-all for everyone else's situations...with the word "F*CK added to be cool. This is pretty much a fad that will eventually fade away. Definitely not one of the long-standing classics. Good job to this guy for getting paid on it though. I'd get my money back if I could.<br/><br/>Here are the parts that stick out to me in particular:<br/>1. The writing isn't that great. He drops the f-bomb here and there for emphasis which is attention getting. But if you're adding the f-bomb to writing that is not well developed...well you're just emphasizing poor writing. Personally, I'm not a prude and have no issues with the word. I just didn't think it was effective in this case.<br/>2. This book is not inspirational and there is nothing profound in here that most people don't already learn on their own from life itself when transitioning from late teen years to early adulthood. Waste of time.<br/>3. There are many claims about what psychologists and other experts believe. A lot of "Research shows..." but there are no citations! Ummm, what? How do we know what Mark summarizes is indeed what research shows. Where is the foundation on which the proof points of this book is written?<br/>"Sometime in the 1960s, developing "high self-esteem"-having positive thoughts and feelings about oneself-became all the rage in psychology. Research found that people who thought highly about themselves generally performed better and cause d fewer problems...Grade inflation, for example, was implemented to make low achieving kids feel better...Pastors and minsters told their congregations that they were each uniquely special in God's eyes...Businesses and motivational seminars cropped up chanting the same paradoxical mantra: every single one uf us can be exceptional and massively successful." Really? How about an example or citation of where this was pulled together.<br/><br/>"Numerous professors and educators have noted a lack of emotional resilience and and excess of selfish demands in today's young people...Speakers and professors are shouted down and banned from campuses for infractions as simple as suggesting that maybe some Halloween costumes really aren't that offensive. Schools counselors note that more students than ever are exhibiting severe signs of emotional distress..." Ok. Who? Where? What? When and where are these things happening? Where are the studies, examples, news references? Where is this guy pulling all of this from? My goodness a 5th grader could write a more complete current event report than the content of this entire book! The acknowledgements state "To Michael Covell for being my intellectual stress test, especially when it comes to understanding psychological research, and for always challenging me on my assumptions." Well good job for trying Michael!<br/><br/>"Brilliant business people are often f*ckups in their personal lives. Extraordinary athletes are often shallow and dumb as a lobotomized rock. Many celebrities are probably just as clueless about life as the people who gawk at them and follow their every more." WOW! Stereotype much?
 This book is not about absolute nihilism - not giving a f* about anything ever. Instead, the premise is to pare down what we care about, and what we stress over.<br/><br/>The premise of the book is to look to the things that really matter in life and work on that. That means sometimes taking a hard look inside to see what trivial things we care about, and what mistakes we have made that must be changed. Personal accountability for ones' own life is paramount.<br/><br/>The "flow" of this book is a lot more like a blog. It's an easy read that feels more like a conversation than a treatise on nihilism. At times some of the story-telling goes on a bit longer, and sometimes it feels like there's a little filler. I think this book could use some edits to condense down the more salient points. (I almost gave 4 instead of 5 stars, but in fairness, it doesn't detract from the book overall).<br/><br/>As an aside, I got this book immediately after someone gifted me "The Secret," which is about as opposite of this book as it gets. While "The Secret" promotes thinking good thoughts so good things will happen (the "thoughts become things" premise), The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F* promotes personal growth and responsibility. I've recommended this book to most of my friends, and would recommend to anyone who feels constantly overwhelmed.
 This book is written for a younger audience, in that if you are older, you have already figured this message out. It's a simple read and there are good lessons to be learned, but if you are over the age of 30 and you don't already know this, you are just sad. Don't be alarmed by the first chapter; it gets better, however be prepared to get used to the word "METRICS" used about 80 billion times.
 Do you know that feeling you get when it’s last call at the club, the lights come on and you get a chance to *really* look at that person you were dancing with and it’s not a pleasant sight and you want to get away as soon as possible?<br/><br/>That’s kinda how this book made me feel. The clever title, like the low lights in a bar, masks the fact that this book offers no real substance while the author simply brags about his good fortune in life.  A few chapters in, “the lights come on” and you just feel kinda icky.<br/><br/>I’m upset this p.o.s. Got any of my money.
 It's an entertaining read, sometimes, but, to me, comes across as a hodge-podge of philosophies that are the result of aimless musings that materialize as a rant. The title, I believe is "clickbait" and does speak to society's need to counter-balance an unnatural work-obsessed culture, but Manson's treatment is unfocused, time wasting, unprofessional and negative. We have enough pissed off teenagers. Since when does writing as one make you a best-seller, where you sit on your high horse as being able to accept your own mediocrity? What kind of leadership is that?<br/><br/>Manson is correct in identifying our culture of exceptionalism. He could very well be the counter-balance we need to the messages we receive from empowerment seminars, celebrities and successes. But does he ever question whether this empowerment gives people hope, and helps with the day-to-day struggle? The tone is judgemental, rather than empathetic. The experience is cheapened by colloquialisms.
 Reading this book is a bit like being trapped in the kitchen of a party with the annoying guy who thinks he’s funnier than he is and won’t shut up. Most of the cod psychology is bleeding obvious and other parts (like the stalker girlfriend and the friend’s death) unsatisfactorily - theses are the areas that could be profound but instead they are left unresolved in any meaningful way.
 Not a verified purchase, as this book was gifted to me by a co-worker this Christmas.  He told me this book "changed his life" and he thought I'd get a lot out of it.  Well, I did get something out of it for sure - a good chuckle (as well as a glimpse into the emotional development of my co-worker).  Now don't get me wrong, there are some decent principles in this book: staying away from social media, putting effort into things that actually matter, being willing to suffer for things you really want, etc - but nothing even remotely earth shattering for anyone with any sense of self-awareness. The part that made me laugh was the irony in the book itself.  Manson talks a lot about entitlement in this book and at one point speaks of a hypothetical 25 year old billing himself as a life coach, without having really lived any life at all.  He talks about how entitled and delusional this character is, all the while missing the fact that he is a 32 year old bro who's lived a privileged life, who’s been loved and supported by his parents and bankrolled through college and while circumnavigating the globe.  He is a finance major with absolutely no education or experience in psychology, someone who has only begun to live and not yet experienced any of the truly devastating losses that others have endured. And here this dude is writing a self help book, telling all of us how we should be living our lives.  Manson says none of us are special, we’re all totally run-of-the-mill, but he somehow thinks he’s special. So special that at 32, with no real experience in anything, he’s solved all of the mysteries of the world. He alone knows the key to true happiness. That elusive thing that humans have been striving for since the beginning of time? Yep, Mark Manson figured it out. Talk about entitled and delusional! The author comes across as an arrogant, over-inflated, self-congratulatory windbag with a penchant for way over-stating his appeal to the opposite sex. Yeah, yeah, I know it's a #1 New York Times Best Seller, but look around you.  We live in a world where the Kardashians are idolized and Donald Trump was elected President.  Clearly we're off the rails.
 I've never been more disappointed by a book. The constant generalizations. The pretentious tone of it all. The lack of any substance. Heres a synopsis, privileged guy uses his atypical life experience to tell you to care less about certain things and care more about other things you already know you should care about. Don't waste your time or money.
 Couldn't get past the first 10 pages. So boring and full of it. Not at all what you expect from the name. The world would be full of inert, unambitious, dull people if everyone followed this book's advice. Uninspiring, odd and unhelpful, one person's point of view.
 Pretty much a dumbed-down version of M. Scott Peck's "The Road Less Traveled," except with a lot more swearing. Save your money. Watch "The Big Lebowski" instead. You'll get the same philosophy with much more entertainment.
 While it sounds like an obvious gimmick (dropping an F-bomb in the title of a self-help book in order to show how "edgy" it is) Mark Manson's "The Subtle Art..." is a very well-written, deeply thought-out take on the perils of modern living. We can only care about so much, Manson posits, and most of us tend to waste that limited reservoir of "giving a f---" on the trivial, mundane, and shallow. How much better, then, would our lives be if we reserved that energy and focus for the things that truly matter?<br/><br/>Exactly how to achieve that focus forms the core of this book, and Manson offers several strategies to help you integrate that aim into your own life. As with all such books, the precise mechanics are left to the reader, but the principles here are sound and workable. It's difficult to escape the conclusion that the author is right: in a world where people care about such trivia as the winner of a TV show or the latest celebrity gossip, many of us need to adjust our priorities and ask ourselves just what, exactly, is worth caring about. This book is a great place to start. Highly recommended.
 I so wanted to enjoy this book but after reading about a 1/4 of it peppered through each page with vulgarity and also unrealistic ideals I just had to walk away and return for a refund. What does a prevledged 30 year old truly know about the hardships of life. Most of what I read he seems to just be full of himself
 There are 3 PROS to this book that must not be named because of Amazon’s childish rules against cussing:<br/><br/>1. TSAoNGaF does an excellent job of making me feel motivated.<br/>2. I’ve found that I take more joy in my problems and struggles.<br/>3. I’m more attuned to the petty stuff that I care too much about.<br/><br/>The 3 CONS are:<br/><br/>1. The book feels a little disjointed.<br/>2. There is a lot of shade thrown at self-help books.<br/>3. I would have liked more practical steps that an idiot like me could take in his life.<br/><br/>I didn’t buy this book. My wife did. And, I didn’t really want to read it. She made me. I’m big into self-help books. You can see some of my thoughts on others I’ve read by visiting my profile. I usually take about one or two bits of wisdom from each one. It’s rare that one really transforms me. TSAoNGaF was one of the ones that gave me a couple bits of wisdom. And, I’m grateful for that! It was worth my time!<br/><br/>I think this book is best for people who hate self-help books because Manson takes a clear stance against self-help books through misrepresentation. Of course, it could be that he’s just read some REALLY crappy self-help books. They are definitely out there. But, I think he’s trying to speak to an audience that has no experience with and has a negative preconception of most self-help books. This causes him to come off as arrogant at times. I wonder if he cares? LOL.<br/><br/>Anyway, overall, I enjoyed reading the book. And, I think it will continue to help me enjoy my problems more and pursue tougher challenges. So, thank you, Mark!<br/><br/>I recommend this book to people who either love or hate self-help books. If you’re in between, go watch TV or something.<br/><br/>Attached are a couple photos of my favorite passages to prove that I actually read it.<br/><br/>Approximate reading time (I’m a slow reader): 3 hours<br/><br/>If you have any questions, please let me know. I’m here to help!
 Save yourself some money and time.  The only valuable lesson in this book is figure out the things that really matter, and not waste your time/energy getting upset about things that don't.  There, done.  Now you don't have to listen to a drunk dude rant about his explanation of buddhism and why he's so awesome.
 I'm a week off from getting fired. This is only another "failure" in a very outstanding number of great failures I have experienced in my 47 years of life. Reading this absolutely cemented what I've slowly come to learn. Losing does NOT mean you've failed. It means you tried, you DID, you LIVED. And hopefully I've learned and grown and understand more about my values.<br/><br/>I am learning to not hate myself. Seriously, it's a selfish and ENTITLED feeling. Who am I to think I deserve to be or AM better than anyone else? We are all created equal. Equally stupid, equally ignorant, equally lost. I am learning to accept that about myself. But how do you live around so many people (a whole society) who don't have a clue? How do I teach my son how to not give a f@ck? Or maybe I just tell him about some of the stuff in this book and let him learn it for himself... I can't control anyone else. Only myself.<br/><br/>THANK YOU MARK MANSON.
 I can't recommend this book enough.  While its not a fast read, its not a hard read.  Since (my guess) it was excerpts of blogs that he then expanded upon, the beginning of a chapter can be direct, then gets a bit wordy to read.  BUT - he has some amazing points.  I'd suggest highlighting as you go along, then when you finish, go back and summarize by reading the highlighted parts.  A bit awkward to try and read on an airplane (even when you take the bright orange cover off, the black book as gold text along the spine), but very thought provoking.
 There are a dozen of topics Mark goes through in this book. Some of the main themes are these:<br/><br/>(1) Choosing what to care about; focusing on the things/problems that are actually meaningful/important (= "giving a f*** about the right things")<br/>(2) Learning to be fine with some negative things; always aiming for positivity isn't practical, and is stressful in itself<br/>(3) Taking responsibility of your own life; it's good for your self-esteem not to keep blaming the circumstances for your problems<br/>(4) Understanding the importance of honesty and boundaries, especially in relationships<br/>(5) Identity; it might a good idea not to commit strongly to any special identity such as "an undiscovered genius", because then any challenges will make you fear the potential loss of that identity you've clinged to<br/>(6) Motivation; how to improve it by accepting failure and taking action<br/>(7) Death; how learning to be more comfortable with one's own mortality can make it easier to live<br/><br/>The first 20% of this book were a little bit boring to read, but after that, the experience was very absorbing. Just like Manson's previous book (Models), I will give this one five stars.<br/><br/>(BTW this book wasn't as humorous as I expected. It was much more a serious than a funny book to read. The final chapters, discussing the acceptance of death, made me actually a little bit tense and distressed.)
 It's been a long time since I've read something that compelled me to write a review. I wish the result was a 5-star rating, but this was shockingly bad. This book could have been an essay or a series of posts on the author's immensely popular, best thing since sliced bread, yugely successful blog. Instead, and no doubt thanks to a Stephen King-like skill of verbal diarrhea, the world was treated to a WHOLE BOOK.<br/><br/>To be fair, towards the beginning, the book does bring up several interesting, thought-provoking concepts. The delivery is very amateurish, but that's the intent. I struggled with the verbosity of it, but at least I was considering the author's perspective. Some things I agreed with, others I did not, but I accepted them all as a valid point of view.<br/><br/>Then the book devolved into sheer idiocy. The exact moment where it started was when he described the moment he hit "rock bottom". In his - clearly not entitled - world, that meant surfing friends' couches and using a computer to... start a business (and I guess he also looked for jobs and played a ton of video games). It was 2008 and the job market was bad, so when he did get a job, he quit after 6 weeks. I'm not judging, because I have better values than that :), but I did stop at this point and asked myself "who is this guy again?" Up until then I thought I was reading some sort of a psychologist who presented concepts we don't stop to consider in a simpler, more humorous form. He's not a psychologist. He's a blogger with an immortality project.<br/><br/>The most bizzare part (to me) is the last chapter, which amounts to nothing more than the author's musings on death and the inevitability thereof, complete with the description - in vivid detail - of how he rock climbed to a cliff on the Cape of Good Hope (later on it all of the sudden turned out there was a path). How he walked all the way to the edge, but not without detouring to share how most people would poop their pants 3 feet away from the edge and turn back. How he sat on the edge contemplating what death means, before finally getting up and walking back with a smile. It was a strange and wholly unnecessary chapter.<br/><br/>Based on the average rating, it seems the book has helped quite a few people. If it's helped one, it served its purpose. Unfortunately, my biggest takeaway was that in  the time we live in, anyone with an opinion and Internet access can impart their wisdom on the world (myself included, clearly); some just do it on a grander scale.
 Looking at it now I got exactly what I should have expected.  the message is pretty banal and vague and at times seem contradictory: "don't care about the unimportant stuff, but it's important to figure out what is important, and still don't ruin your life if you screw up the important stuff just learn from it and try not to be too afraid to make mistakes..." and on and on with more platitudes and truisms.<br/><br/>no real insights to be had here, just something that is like a skewed facsimile or satire of a self help book that generously uses expletives (at first endearing but quickly tiring) before getting a little more sincere by sharing  possibly made-up] anecdotes with life lessons.
 First pages were brilliant but as I read on in the book there's too much of my, me and myself. He should have stuck to Bukovski's art and not his and book wouldn't lost its momentum.
 Now this is a self help book. It inspired me to look at my life and my decision making process differently. With more acceptance of my responsibilities rather than resentment and blame for people who though may have played a role in my mistake making could not possibly be to  blame. This book should be read to the new 2000 entitled little nitwits in like 6th grade and then again in 9th and then they should have to write a detailed summary about it senior year so we know they get it... sorry not sorry....but everyone should read this and live by it. It should be added to the bible and called The Newest Testimant...seriously...mark manson for president.
 Ok, this man is a blogger, and the reason for the stars is simply due to popularity of his blogs. However, despite good reasoning he uses lies in order to address his points. And to me these are lazy lies that could have been researched and explained. Megadeth was not formed because the band didn't want' him nor did the band that rejected him do bad, it was Metallica, possibly the greatest Metal band of all time. If this man will use lazy lies to address a point, then what good are experts? Yeah, he is reasonably, but simply put laziness does not win over this sailor.....
 Meh.  It's a frat boyish take that's three times longer than it needs to be.  It's clear the author had to pad the pages in order to get this thing published.  And he tries to be too snarky and clever by a half.  I set it down after 30 pages.<br/><br/>If you like Dane Cook's comedy you might like this book.
 This is definitely a great read. It won't change your life or anything but it will put a lot of things in perspective, like choosing your battles and admitting that it's ok to have faults. Definitely not your traditional self-help book. You won't hear a bunch of quotes about how special and wonderful you are. What you'll hear is just how average you actually are but there's nothing wrong with that.
 The author keeps bragging about how many women he slept with, while saying how meaningless it was for him.<br/><br/>And no, standing on the edge of a cliff is not "crazy s***".<br/><br/>2 stars because the beginning has actually some good stuff. It goes down from there, once the point is made. Point being: "you are going to die, so care less about unimportant stuff". Mix some bad language in between and you got this book.
 A quick read, but mostly recycled cliches and stories you've probably heard before.  Author twists and turns quite a bit to create value, but bottom line is that the book could be turned into a fortune cookie: only worry about important stuff.<br/><br/>Actually, a fortune cookie also comes with lucky numbers on the flip side of the paper, and you get Chinese food.  A way better deal.
 Not that great of a book. I ended up returning it after a few days because I just couldn’t bring myself to finish it. Normally, I wouldn’t buy a book with a title like this (just because I see it as being ‘tacky’) but I figured if it’s a top-seller, then there must be a reason why. I feel like the author is just trying too hard to be a “cool guy”. In the first 70 or so pages, I didn’t read anything that was eye-opening.
 Loved it! I generally get turned off by self-help books, but this one nails it. Honest and accurate, with no woo-woo or new-agey or Christian nonsense.Very timely too, given the current obsession with social media and “look at me!” mindsets. His views on entitlement are bang-on, and help make sense of the current environment of selfies, internet trolls, those who allow trolls to devastate them, and the larger environment of political polarization. Should be required reading for young adults. All adults, actually - I know quite a few 50-year-olds that could use a good hard look at themselves, including me, and quite a few 80-year olds as well...
 Formulaic bro-style garbage. Don’t waste your time.
 The insights in this book aren't new, but they're pretty sharp. This book is a good reminder of things we already know but often forget. But this isn't the work of a trained psychologist; they're armchair philosophies. The prose is snappy but not transformative. And by the end, I was thrilled to be done with it.
 Basically tells us to really think about what is important to ua and care about that, and do not care about other things. This book tells you to risk your life by sitting on the edge of a cliff, be really close to death in order to feel better. Then somehow claims that it is not a self help book.
 There’s a lot the anecdotal information regarding life’s complexities. I can’t bring myself to finish it. Sometimes things in life can’t be changed by simply thinking more positively. Really bad things happen. It’s important to ride the emotions and then reflect. I dunno. Lots of simplistic advice. I wasn’t expecting that much based off the title.
 The best thing about this book is the title.  Somewhat interesting read but no real inspiring information. The author also comes off as a jerk. Actually says at one point that his wife is the kind of woman “who spends a lot of time in front of the mirror” and that he likes her to look good. Wtf did I just read. In general he does not seem to have enough depth or substance to write anything meaningful.  I also thought the part about the “hot Asian girl” was insensitive. “Hot girl” would have been enough. What year is it?
 The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*** is a self help book at heart. Using the word F*** on the cover and then excessively throughout the first chapter is the authors tactic to draw you into his world. After the first chapter or so he settles down quite a bit on the language and makes some very good points.<br/><br/>Essentially the book is about not giving a F*** about EVERYTHING so that you can give a F*** about what's actually important. He also makes some good points about motivation. Here are two quotes<br/><br/>1) "Don't just sit there. Do something. The answers will follow"<br/><br/>2) "Action isn't just the effect of motivation; it's also the cause of it"<br/><br/>Essentially, if you feel like you are at a roadblock and the roadblock is causing you to not move forward just do SOMETHING in the general direction you want to go and the roadblock will eventually clear.<br/><br/>I appreciate the authors writing style in that he makes his points in short sub-chapters so you can read a little bit at a time and not feel lost when you pick the book back up. I haven't read a book in the self-help space in quite a while and I found this one enlightening and helpful in thinking about how I frame issues. I recommend this one and hope you enjoy it.
 You'd think that a former "pick-up artist" would write a bunch of nonsense about NLP. You'd be wrong. DEAD wrong! I suppose that's part of the appeal of the book, and maybe even part of the marketing strategy. Nevertheless, the advice inside is really, really good. The author takes a bunch of "common wisdom" and completely turns it on its head, explaining why it's just plain wrong. Best of all, if you apply his advice, you might just find yourself feeling quite differently about your life and daily struggles (like, better). Highly recommended!
 I loved the author's way of being brutally honest. I'd read some reviews that said that his book was trivial in a buzzfeed sort of way or that he was far too profane, but I had no issues with it. I read books to introduce new thoughts into my life so I don't end up in an echo chamber of non-growth. This book is a solid read. I wish there had been more to it but I also realize, that in it's own way, this book is just a snippet of a much larger part of Mark's work. It feels incomplete because he is still growing as a man and this is him sharing his experience and lessons that he's learned. Worth every sentence. 💯
 I can't even get past the first chapter. I understand and appreciate the message but it's executed like hipster frat boy trying to explain some life changing insight to other hipsters. In short, just ask a friend what its about or google it. Do not waste your money.
 I give this book 3 stars, because while I enjoyed reading it, I’m not sure whether I found it to be of value. I have tried to implement some of the thinking that the book describes, including letting go of my entitlement, and choosing what I give my energy to. But at times I felt like ok I get the message here, and then the author would start talking about something that almost contradicted what he’d just been saying and then I got confused what the takeaway message was meant to be. At times it also just came across as a story about him and his life, rather than something I could find helpful for my life. And the title, while very catchy, potentially does not really encompass the message from the book. The idea is not to not give a f**k, it’s about choosing what to care about so that we don’t all get bogged down by caring too much about every little thing. Although other than telling you to choose what you give a f**k about, he doesn’t really tell you how to achieve this, how to reframe things, or how to change your thinking. So while there are things that I’ve tried to take from reading the book, I felt like perhaps the book didn’t reach its full potential.
 Okay, I don't want to be super critical, but I suppose that by giving this book a 1-star review, I'm already doing that. I like the premise and the idea that we need to let some sh*t go in order to more fully participate in the more important aspects of our lives. What I don't like is that his message ends even BEFORE developing that message. This book glorifies the idea of not caring / letting some things go but JUST STOPS THERE. I've read a great number of texts that also see the merit in energy conservation but go beyond it, helping the reader to see the importance of living out their truth and working hard for what they believe in (read any yoga philosophy book for this insight). This book basically just says, "Hey, stop caring about a bunch of stuff" and then leaves it at that. Maybe some folks are into it, but to me it was less than inspiring and not at all novel. I could also live without the redundancy of the F-word which made the book read like a conversation overheard at a frat party. So... I guess this is fairly critical after all.
 I thought this book was awful. I read one chapter and put the book down and never picked it back up again. I thought it was going to be a book about not taking so seriously everything people said but instead it was hate about everything in life and using the F word over and over. Expect to read the F word multiple, multiple times in a sentence. I found it a depressing book that would not give anyone a positive look on life.
 Ridiculous. Don't expect the F word to end with the title.  Should have figured it would have no substance.
 I didn't get a thing out of this book.  I don't know if it's just because I'm in my 40's and have dealt with some "heavy" stuff in my life or what, but there was nothing in here that seemed beyond basic common sense to me.  Common sense leading to obvious conclusions, surrounded by anecdotes.  This book came to me highly recommended and that's why I bought it, but afterwards I felt like I learned more about the individual who recommended it to me than I did from the book itself!  If this individual found this (to me) obvious book "so helpful" and "life changing" - how lost in their own mind were they before?<br/><br/>Anyway, it's mostly not terrible, parts are mildly amusing, and it's a quick read - not a "thinker".  If you find yourself addicted to social media, feel obliged to keep up with the Joneses, or think that celebrities are amazing role models and you want to change but don't know how, this book might help ground you.  Otherwise I recommend giving it a pass - you probably know most of this stuff already and there are much funnier (and deeper) books out there if you're just looking for an entertaining writer who tells stories about their life while dropping a lot of f-bombs.
 Great read, Audio throws you in and affords you the best way to get the read through, yet owning the book is great.<br/><br/>The book seemed to hone in having perspective, utilizing your given ability to choose where you will place your attention, emotions and such, gives you the ideal permission to not know, yet be ok with knowing things but open to knowing more. Tells you that it’s ok to “just do”, with perspective, but to<br/>understand although being understood is partly life, be responsible for what we feel and how perceive others and to just accept things. Touched on getting to root causes of issues in a way that we must know why, to know how to not recreate what isn’t optimal. It lacked certain ideas on an acceptable time of grief, but feel like it stated it’s one thing to have a thought, it’s another thing to build a home and live in those thoughts.<br/><br/>Overall it was great read; I’d say by certain of who you are as the foundation, be open to who you want to become, and be objective to who someone desire you to be, sometimes those desires come from our own insecurities.<br/><br/>-Auna Monae
 Luckily I bought this on Audible so I was able to return this with ease! TSAONGAF starts art ok, it's an exciting premise, don't give a f*#k! Wow, yes, right on! But the authors examples are long stories, stretched to prove a point and fill up pages I feel. After the first third was over and the author talks about visiting 50 countries and banging chicks every night, it gets really tiresome. Couldn't even finish this title. The Subtle Art could also be an updated, more profaine version of Don't Sweat the Small Stuff. I'd be curios to see the age ranges of the different star ratings as I am mid 40's. This might appeal to a younger audience.
 Not a fan of self help to start with which may have influenced my experience. First couple of chapters were okay. They read like a profanity laced ripoff of Don't Sweat the Small Stuff but still okay. The rest was a pointless and felt like filler added in just to get it long enough to be considered a "book". May have made a decent blog post but as a book it dragged on needlessly.
 Didn't make much sense overall. In the beginning, I felt that the author tried too hard to sound like a bada*s by saying F this and F that, which was entertaining and led you to believe that this might really be a different self help book (unlike other ones out there in the market). But.. it really is not. I finished this book scratching my head wondering what the heck did I just read and why did I waste my time not getting anything really valuable or tangent enough to apply to real life. His examples and approach is all too broad and doesn't really guide you in any way in my opinion. Some may find this useful and entertaining but to me it was a total waste of time and he was just trying to sound cute with an appealing book title.
 We were walking down the book aisle at a local big box retailer, and saw "The Subtle Art of Not Giving a $#@*" (Actually I don't recall the exact sequence of symbols).  I picked it up and thumbed through it, and thought it looked interesting enough, but not at full retail.  I immediately popped on Amazon and bought the Kindle edition.<br/><br/>First off, Mr. Manson appears to not have any credentials or training, but seems to have managed to create a following with his blog.<br/><br/>The book starts with a bunch of swear words, but that calms down after the first quarter (but they are still in there through the end).  Mr. Manson uses examples from his own life, and anecdotes from others to make his points, which are really about setting the right kind of priorities.<br/><br/>One thing I found interesting, especially from a millennial, is that the priorities he is espousing are most often associated with the Greatest Generation, or Baby Boomer generation.  He slams modern social interactions and social media.<br/><br/>There is nothing new in this book, but it does a good job of making his value driven points applicable.<br/><br/>If you are turned off by profanity, you're probably not even reading the reviews on this book, but want to stress that there is a lot, and in many cases its gratuitous.  If profanity doesn't bother you, and you need a kick in the pants to change something about yourself, this book could be useful to you.  I feel it is worth the $12 or so I paid for it.
 I curse as much as a normal person, but this guy curses in some attempt to be edgy. it's like that high schooler that learned a few curse words then over uses them over and over and over again, cursing every other word. The following is from the book: "While not giving a eff may seem simple on the surface, it’s a whole new bag of burritos under the hood. I don’t even know what that sentence means, but I don’t give a eff. A bag of burritos sounds awesome, so let’s just go with it." Replace the "eff" with the curse word, and that's pretty much the cadence of the book. Really. :|<br/><br/>His basic message seems to be some sort of mash-up of Zen philosophy but rehashed to make it sound like something a frat boy would say while exhaling bong smoke. :::blows out smoke:: "yea man, I just started my web blog and now i have a successful book about how not to give a eff". im only somewhat joking. he actually does mention in the book in a humble-brag way how he sold all his stuff, moved to south america, then made it as a blogger all because, supposedly, he didn't give a eff. (survivorship bias anyone?)<br/><br/>It's dumbed down writing, and I'm not sure who the intended audience is. :\ Bros that like giving each other high fives? I dont know, dont mean to be so negative, but man, this is the NUMBER ONE book on amazon right now, I wasn't expecting a web-blog in book form.
 For the last two months, every Sunday night at bedtime just before my work week starts, I’ve been laying down in bed and picking up my (digital) copy of The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck. I decided that reading a bit of this book before the start of each work-week would help me have a better perspective on my work life, my career, and all other aspects, so it became sort of a Sunday night ritual. I don’t read self help books generally (this is the first one). I’ve never felt that I needed to. I’ve lived my life—up until now—believing that I have everything figured out. Now I realize I’ve had a skewed mentality about more than I realized, and not in a good way.<br/><br/>This book was recommended to me by one of my African American friends at work who struggled with racism in the workplace during his early career (he still deals with it today). He told me that the book changed his perspective on how he allows others to see him, how he sees himself, and how he chooses to allow racism to affect him. He spoke highly of it, and recommended it to me, so I fell for the bait and I’m happy that I did.<br/><br/>The author Mark Manson offers his readers raw truth (based on his own experiences and academic research) in the form of real talk, personal narratives, and profane humor filled with explicative after explicative. Yes, there are likely more F-boms dropped in this book than any other in existence, but it all adds to the book’s personality. If you’re someone who doesn’t like cussing, go into this with an open mind and understand that it’s merely part of the book’s “charm.”<br/><br/>I cannot stress enough how great this book is. I’m on the final chapter now, and will be sad when it ends. If you still aren’t convinced, check out some of the other reviews. I highly recommend The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck to everyone, but specifically those who take things to heart too easily, or get upset over spilt milk (I’m one of those). Give it a chance. I think you’ll be happy you did.
 Sadly this is probably one of the worst books  I’ve ever attempted. The expletives through out the book were for the most part unnecessary and really detracted  from the meaning of the subject matter for me. It shocks me to see how many people loved it and found it life changing. Rather a sad commentary on our current culture. This book will not get donated but I will trash it.
 In this book Manson, discussed the deep issues of the meaning of life and why people crave the attention of others. The need for validation and why we shouldn’t be concerned with how others view us. Manson uses interesting historical anecdotes to illustrate his points. The book is organized into 9 Chapters:<br/>1 Don’t Try<br/>2. Happiness is a Problem<br/>3. You are not special<br/>4. The value of suffering<br/>5.  You are always choosing<br/>6. You’re wrong about everything<br/>7. Failure is the way forward<br/>8. The importance of saying no.<br/>9. And Then You Die<br/>Overall, the book in entertaining and thought provoking.  An enjoyable read.
 I greatly enjoyed the book and his philosophy.  An interesting and worthwhile read, though at times he did seem to contradict himself.  Even so, it did not take away from key messages.  Please note that anyone offended by the F-bomb should skip chapter 1; obviously done only to kick off and tie in the subject matter to the attention-grabbing title.  Call it good marketing.  After that, he tones it down considerably and articulates his philosophical thoughts in a more mature and "subtle" manner (pun is intended).  :-).  Good book!
 I got the gist in the first 25 pages and ended up giving zero f46ks in actually finishing this book... Thanks Mark!<br/><br/>But seriously, there is invaluable information in this cuss filled rant of a read that can help most anyone looking to navigate their lives with a less stress and more clarity. It's ok to let negativity go and not focus on the past. Be responsible, accountable, and motivated in ways that push you into action and help organize your thought process for the better.<br/><br/>Quick read. Packed with wisdom. Grab this!
 I had never heard of Mark before buying the book, so I may be missing something here given all the great reviews. But I didn't catch the wisdom in here. I can sum the book up for you in one sentence: "Life isn't perfect, so get over yourself and just live it."  I agree, but I don't think it requires 200 pages.
 This..<br/>This book blew my mind.<br/><br/>I give this book two thumbs up.<br/>Like, two REALLY hard thumbs up.<br/>Like, the veins in the muscles on my forearms and neck are popping at how hard I am recommending this book.<br/><br/>I am one of the many who has been changed by this book. I don’t want to spoil anything in the book, mostly because we all interpret the things we see and hear and experience with a different lens, but I do want to say this.<br/><br/>Don’t let the title fool you. The book is not what you may first think or assume.<br/><br/>This book is DEFINITELY a self help book.<br/><br/>The only difference between this book and other self help books is that this one doesn’t try to kiss your ass and make you feel special.<br/>This is probably the most honest self help book ever written.<br/><br/>Of course, this is aside from the one that Nike wrote.<br/>“Just Do It”
 I didn’t like this book whatsoever. It was so filled with vulgarity that it was hard to even read not to mention that it was written like a self-help you are worthless book. I felt like I was being yelled at the entire time. I understand the title is vulgar but there were phrases and sayings that didn’t even make sense with comments like “I don’t f$cking care it doesn’t make sense!”  It is a terrible book, I am sorry.
 I read the book last summer after seeing it at an airport.  Mark Manson is a hardcore blogger who created a gem.  At first, I had to get used to his writing style and dropping multiple "F" bombs. Once I got used to that, I couldn't put the book down.  He provides wonderful analogies to prove many useful points... The big takeaway is creating realistic, attainable measurements to avoid feeling miserable in the first place.  I will not give away more of the content because it's up to you to find your own pearls of wisdom.  It's a great read, and Manson provides opportunities to subscribe to his blog at a discounted rate (that might have changed this year--possible moot point). I've recommended to both friends and family.  If you're spiritual and want to explore how to balance attachment with detachment, then this is a great start.  Thanks, Mark.  I've learned a great deal from you!
 Just goes to show you, never judge a book by its cover because the title of this book is so much better than what is written inside of it. Reading this book is beyond boring, tedious and painful and definitely gives one an insight into the authors self entitled attitude and how he thinks he has actually figured out what life is all about...not really. For a person like me who has raised boys into well balanced, successful and happy adults, this was  a waste of my time. Completely ridiculous book for those of us who are mature enough to have had a lifetime of experiences and who have been able to fulfill our realistic and hard driven expectations and goals,  over years of hard work and determination . I had hoped it would be just a little inspirational and deeper emotionally, or even just humorous but sadly did not deliver on any of the above.
 If you are looking at this review right now and trying to decide whether or not to buy it, you should just buy it. Its a phenomenal book. It does cuss a lot but of course that is expected when you have a title like this ;)<br/><br/>I have a lot of shared feelings with some of the things that I found in this book and there are some other things that I found to be quite beneficial. This book doesn't cut corners and tell you politely what you need to do. It tells you what you need to do in a straightforward kick in the pants sort of way. I have recommended this book to about 50 people in the last month and I plan on reading it for a third time pretty soon.
 You’re going to hear great things about this book, that it changed someone’s life, that they loved it and couldn’t put it down. I ripped my copy to shreds. The author is condescending and self-righteous. He’s right, you’re wrong. About everything. In fact, you’re an idiot. I couldn’t get through the first chapter without multiple panic attacks. His tone is so abrasive, and so is his language. If you’ve ever been in a verbally/emotionally abusive relationship, this book may trigger you. It should come with a trigger warning. I got so triggered I ripped it up and threw it out before finishing chapter two. I will not attempt to start or finish again.
 The title says everything you need to know. Don’t waste your time on this one. It’s obviously written by a men, for men, who have never bothered placing themselves in someone else’s shoes.
 Did not care for this book due to it's negative messgae throughout chapter 1.
 I should know better than to fall for books that come with lots of hype because I almost never agree with "the masses", but I liked the idea of what Manson wrote about so I gave it some of my reading time.<br/>The things mentioned in the book are logical and make immense sense, they're also presented with interesting and sometimes personal anecdotes that really help get the point across. Manson's writing is straight to the point and natural; it flows like a conversation rather than a self-help rant.<br/>All this, and I still couldn't find much enthusiasm for the things being said because I find them to be basic things that I've always believed. It did give me a few things to consider and maybe look up, but I don't get why people keep telling me that it's "life changing."
 This book is a life-changing, 250-page, secular and accessible explanation of the wisdom of the Serenity Prayer.<br/><br/>I am a woman of faith, but I found that Manson’s secular exposition fit right in with my religious beliefs, especially when he talked about values and honesty. Sometimes you have to be forthright (not RUDE, just not fake) to stick to your higher values. Sometimes you have to let go and not give a F about minor things so you have F’s left over to give to the important things.<br/><br/>I actually FEEL better after reading this book because it helped me release a lot of anxieties I’ve been carrying around. Five stars!
 "Our culture today confuses great attention and great success, assuming them to be the same thing. But they are not."<br/>~ Mark Manson.<br/><br/>This book proves the point Mark just made. It didn't work for me. It's insensitive at many many levels.
 The information in the book is not so much my problem but more that it felt like Spark Notes of every other piece of philosophy or profound literature. Mark Manson basically cites Charles Bukowski, Siddhartha, Buddhism, Existentialism, Shakespeare, and minimalism all mixed together. Cool, as an avid reader I an a fan of all of those things. He talks about living with less and finding values and basically all the hot topics that other “self-help” books touch on just summarized with a pieces of his own life sprinkled to make more personal examples to drive certain ideas home. I don’t discount his journey to being a more fulfilled and productive human but I just felt as someone who has read a lot of those texts got more meaning from the original than this book paraphrasing it.
 The author offers two types of advice in this book.<br/><br/>The first type of advice is common sense ideas that nearly any adult already knows (for example, that you can’t do everything well and need to prioritize, or that family is important).<br/><br/>The second, more frequent type of advice the author offers are ideas that are often unfounded, and (for many people in many situations) are likely to be unhelpful or even harmful.<br/><br/> For most, this book has little to offer. Consider that even the title of the book uses language inaccurately.  (The title indicates the approach offered is "subtle" - this is by no means the case. Much of the advice suggests radical changes that would be very obvious to others around you).<br/><br/> Some might argue that the misuse of "subtle" is intentional; that the author is employing sardonic humor. Perhaps.  It may also be that the author and his publisher picked a title they thought would sell.  (And indeed, the book does sell).
 The book gave me some good advice and relief from my mental struggle. Plenty personal lessons could be drawn from the book. They got me thinking of values I’m adopting. Which one I should continue to hold. Which one to let go. It reminded me it’s OK to be nobody or not to be famous. To be what I feel happy to be is the best. The book also reminded that what sets people apart is the difficulties ones are willing to struggle, not the lives they dream to have.<br/><br/>One important lesson I derived from the book is one hasn’t succeeded in something because one hasn’t failed at it enough times. This encouraged me to push myself back again on track to complete my Ph.D. thesis.<br/><br/>However I feel the book didn’t end nicely when the author putting much emphasis on life and death. Also I can’t tell apart the difference of entitlement, the author condemned through the book, and the idea of being greater than yourself by leaving the world better off before we die, which he admired.<br/><br/>After all, this is a great book I’m fortunate to have read.
 I think these reviews are subjective so take mine with a grain of salt. The personal take away from this was,  your a loser and so is everybody else so don't worry about it . Live your life and be happy.<br/><br/>This is all well and good but trying to cope with today's ever-increasing stressful Society somehow this advice just didn't resonate. But the $14 what do you want. ?
 I picked this book up multiple times in the store before I decided to take the plunge and purchase it. I hate run of the mill self improvement books. I feel like every time I go to a book store, there's always a new book out about how to improve your life delivered by a cast of celebrities, authors, gurus, Christian leaders, etc. By no means is there anything wrong with that - that's all well and good - but I have a hard time getting into those books and this is close to being my favorite type of literature. I've been living a mantra of giving it my all, giving back, and giving thanks and I have a hard time related that to some of the more popular books in this field.<br/><br/>However, this one is no bull. It just makes sense. It flows. It resonates. It may not resonate with everyone but if you're like me then this book is for you. If you don't care for explicit language - avoid it. If you can tolerate it, do it. You won't regret it.
 The author takes a different, actually quite different way of making his point. Very straightforward and uses todays language, To express his point.  This book is awesome and I definitely recommend it to the younger generation as it will resonate with the way we think. I Definitely recommend this book to all those who worry… And obsess over things that are irrelevant.
 I've started reading these books because I know I need an attitude adjustment. I realized I cared too much about everything, things I should care about and things I shouldn't care about. At first, I didn't care for the ruthless somewhat foul-mouthed prose as I felt it distracted from the points the author was trying to make, but it's pretty easy to look past it. The good points in this book can be listed in bullet form pretty easily, but it isn't until you read the full build up of each anecdote, its conclusion and its lesson that each bullet point makes sense and becomes a thinking exercise. A lot of these lessons are things that my mom always told me, but after a million times, you start to filter it out ;).<br/><br/>In my opinion, the book takes a wild turn in Chapter 9, the final chapter. It was at that moment about halfway through the chapter that everything made sense. Not only everything that I had read, but how the author came to change his own life. Later in the chapter and up until the end of the book, I felt like I was reading a thriller. I had physical reactions to what he was describing (I won't give it away). My opinion of Mark as a writer really changed in that last chapter. The whole book was good, but that last chapter, dang. I would have preferred the whole book be like that, but I guess that defeats the point!
 This book changed my life. It like a down-to-earth wake up call to get you going in the right direction. The overarching theme summed up in one sentence? It doesn't matter what other people think; find what you love and just do you. Manson's writing is simply wonderful; he is able to draw the reader in and weave in just the right amount of humor to make his point. You won't be disappointed if you give this book a try!
 As far as the content, the f'bombs overwrite what could be some great advice and humor. It is like getting too many raisins in raisin brand cereal . Could be a good thing if it weren't for the excessive expletives. .
 This book really helped focus some things that I had been feeling, some I thought I knew, and drastically changed other ideas in my life, relationship, and everything. If you feel obsessed with small, little things, if you feel you aren't a good person or anything you NEED to listen to this book.<br/><br/>Life is suffering, but you can suffer in a way to HELP yourself. This isn't just a self-help book, only YOU can help yourself. This is a book to give you a completely different perspective on society in general, and looks to explain some insane behaviors we see today on social media and beyond.
 I liked it strangely enough. This book should come with its own warning. Namely that you should be prepared to be offended, confronted, disgruntled, agitated, disrupted, disturbed, but also challenged to live your best life. And I don’t mean that in a condescending happy-go-lucky life-is-unicorns-and-rainbows kind of sort away. I mean if you get past the language, which is vey strong - like f-word strewn liberally about on every page. Anyways if you can get past the language, the message of the book holds true that we put way too much emphasis on what other people think about we should and should not be doing or caring about rather than trusting ourselves to do the work that we’ve been given to do. We don’t trust ourselves enough to have the tough conversations that really are simple means of communicating. It’s time to get back to that, and this book is a swift kick in the rear to man up, woman up, adult up and give the right kind of ... well, you know?!?! It’s in the title of the book.
 Not what I was expecting, I heard so many good things about it so I thought I'd give it a go.  I just finished reading "The Four Agreements" and this book (the art of no f@ks - lol) wasn't what I was going for, kind of the opposite of the books I've been reading.  I'm only a few chapters in and I've stopped reading it already, gonna try to re-sell it actually.
 Last night I wrote a review of this book, but the Amazon folks didn't like my use of "profanity" and censored my review, even though this book abundantly uses the same "profanity" in just about every sentence, and sometimes several times in a sentence.  All this "profanity" quickly becomes deadening -- beyond annoying or even gagging -- and unnecessary to the few good points the author makes.<br/><br/>Still, there is nothing especially original in this book. Sages, mystics, wisdom keepers, poets, spiritual teachers and an occasional psychologist have been saying the same thing in different ways for millennia.  In brief, what you focus on expands, so choose your focus wisely.  In order to make those wise choices, you first need to know yourself ... know what really matters to you as an<br/>individual and then what doesn't matter can fall by the wayside.  So, voila!  You'll experience no stress and have a happy life.<br/><br/>The author admits that knowing yourself takes a lifetime.  From his image on the dust jacket, I gather he's still fairly young and has a way to go on his life journey of amassing self-knowledge.  Perhaps all the "profanity" he uses is just a coverup -- a distraction --<br/>for his lack of self-knowledge. Regardless, the end result is a book that is both tedious and shallow -- bogged down by the author's hubris and limited (think "profane") vocabulary, and mostly by his lack of life experience.  I suggest that you borrow this book if you really must read it.  I bought it sight unseen and should have known better.
 This book does have some basic concepts that are worth being reminded of; after that, there's not much sustenance.  There is so much 'evidence shows' statements with out evidence cited to support any of the word vomit.  Find something by someone who has some credentials.  I have life experience, I'm sure you do too, this won't be much help.
 The book is basically Buddhism for bros.
 I thourouhly enjoyed this book. There are parts where you legitimately laugh out loud and make you excited to see what else he comes up with for scenarios. I can see some people not liking it because of the cussing but with the title come on?! It’s just a different approach on something and I think he did a great job with it. This is a super easy read if you want something quick and helpful to read.
 Books not too bad, author has some sold thoughts but clearly has not been writing long, just seems to have a poor organization of thoughts. Also has a tendency to talk about how great he was 10 years ago... I lost track of how many times he talked about all the flings he used to have. It detracts from his main thoughts which would have been more solid with out these personal inserts.
 I purchased this book on a whim to improve my outlook and anxiety functions in all aspects of life. I really did appreciate this novel concept to addressing where you spend your blanks. I find myself more closely analyzing why I value the things I value and if it is at all necessary.
 I read this for a book group so had not researched prior to purchasing.  I found this to be a superficial silly book that must be geared toward young adults/teens with the shock and awe aspect of the language.  When near the end - as he was espousing the wisdom of death - he reveals he has just entered his 30's, I had to laugh.  I think the author will be quite embarrassed by this book when he becomes an adult (unless of course it made him a boatload of money).  I especially laughed at the section of "honest relationships" as he discussed his wife's disappointment that he had not appreciated her outfit for an event and she had to go change.  Wouldn't a non-chauvinistic and less entitled perspective have been that women should dress for themselves, and not have their identity and self-value linked with how a man/husband/friend sees them?  A very silly book indeed.  Might be a good book for discussing the immature attitudes of young American males.
 I only Read the first 20 pages  and it blew my mind. It’s reader friendly with comical and intellectual insight. I’m telling everyone to buy this. I used To read all these books that were not realistic. I am Bipolar and struggle with severe depression and hyper-sensitive . I never Feel like society makes sense and what we’re told to think, feel and look like. And i think This book will just be the perfect approach to acceptance and contentment without feeling like you  must be what others expect you to be resulting in despair and deeper sense of failure or resentment . I’m psyched to get into it further . Seriously I’m throwing all my other garbage out. This is  real deal to just chill and then you will feel that peace and gratitude for life.
 Although I didn't like that title that much because it sounds way too loud to me, I felt attracted by the idea that mark Manson was trying to communicate.<br/><br/>This book is written in a very honest way and I'm really grateful for the fact that Mark has decided to write this piece. I think it actually can help people to live better lives through showing them how to be a better companion of themselves. I directly bought two copies for two friends that struggle with their life's right now. Good job, Mark. Everyone else: buy, read and learn.
 I recommend this book for anyone that likes to look into themselves and honestly wants to be better, feel better, and live a free and happy life. Great tips, funny, introspective, and a fast read.
 Once you get passed the over the top language used in the beginning of the book and really focus on the message, this book is a great read with a great message. "STOP SWEATING THE LITTLE STUFF", "FOCUS ON WHAT MATTERS". I read this book after hearing about it in a developer's magazine and found the time spent to be well spent and even evangelized the book to friends and family thereafter. I recommend the book to anyone struggling with caring a bit too much about, well, too many things. It's always nice to hear someone else who struggled with a similar problem and the story they can share.
 Found valuable insight, (interspersed with numerous obscenities, if you can overlook or enjoy them) why negative feelings have a biological reason to exist: they're telling you that you're not doing something right!  Why it's counterproductive to try to be happy all the time, that you'll always try to attain the unattainable, and even if you do, it won't be enough.  As one who invested a lot of time worrying about what other people thought of me, found out that life is too short to care. Those who matter don't mind, and those who mind don't matter  Read this book if you find that you care too much, to the point that you're always stressed out and worried about something.
 I feel the book sets more of a negative tone to me than it needs to. It's a good mash-up of something seemingly interesting but it seems to me somewhat rather superficial. I can't really bring myself to finish this book. I just need to stop. I feel the more I read, the more negative I have become. It doesn't inspire me for any positive change or realization in myself.
 I'm an avid reader, but I rarely leave book reviews, feeling as though someone has already done a better job of expressing my opinion.  However, I wanted to add the weight of my review since I just can't understand the success or high ratings for the book.  I'm interested both stoicism and general self-help/human behaviorism books, but this books adds no value.  It's poorly written, seems unedited, and I would never recommend it to anyone.  It doesn't cover any topic well and provides no useful insights.  It is the author's stream of consciousness which seems better suited for a (free) blog post and makes for a very uninteresting book.
 Once you get theough the f-bomb-laced first chapter, the writing style is amatuerish and content is  common sense interspersed with opinion.
 This book helped me at least begin to take a look at the fears that sabotage me. To develop the practice of not being so self concerned certainly is appealing and does free one from anxiety; the book was worth reading to the extent that it helped me to consider this discipline as a goal. The writing is good and it’s an easy read. The proof of its effectiveness will unfold in time. I do have concern about the credentials of the author: though he writes well, I’m skeptical that his experience as a blogger (though widely read) qualifies him to advise others on how to live a good life.
 This is my question about this book. I loved the sociology but felt the psychology sucked. The book was full of great insights on millennial culture but absolutely lame when he tried to take those insights and personalize them.
 I have yet to finish the book, but I have already found several spelling and grammatical errors.  Most blaring one is on the back cover flap, "...more than TOW million readers."  I am NOT an expert at spelling/grammar, but even I have found errors.  Other than that, I am enjoying it so far.
 This book really does not provide anything new or more motivational that you can find on a basic "motivational" YouTube video. Or any other previous motivational book you might have ever read.
 This book is a slap of reality to people who need just that.. Which is everyone. Everyone should read this! It's attention gripping, funny, serious, enlightening, &amp; ear shattering with points you may not wish to hear, but really need to in order to make it through this thing called life with pure happiness. I am beyond happy I read this - you will be too!!
 Several pages are blank, I thought maybe on purpose but then I realized I've missed chunks of the story..SAD. Pgs 122-123, 126-127,130-131,134-135.<br/><br/>The story (what I CAN read) is really good! Highly recommend!
 I’ve just finished reading this book. It’s OK. I understood and already put it practice my giving a f*ck about more controllable and immediate things. That gave me peace of mind at some level and avoid a couple of sleepless nights during these 2 weeks. I plan to keep this habit and rationalize my f*cks from now on. Nevertheless, I have to say that the book is mostly very confusing and it takes too many words to make each point, sometimes I would even say to myself to stop reading due to pure boredom. I kept on reading but it’s not a book I would recommend, maybe I would try to explain the principle of the book if somebody asks for recommendation.
 This is a great read, especially if you're tired of allowing yourself to be treated like dirt. The language may seem off-putting at first but, when you read it, you'll see that it's not advising you to give the world the proverbial middle finger after all; instead it's advising you to take control of your life, stop giving your power to the turds who don't count, and accept yourself and life as it is. It's a good counter to the usual self-help fluff. Even I've outgrown most self-help, but this one, although not richly philosophical or sourced, is a great reset button in times of trouble.
 Despite the provocative title, this book offers practical advice: even though your problems may not be your fault, they are your problems and your responsibility. So what are you going to do about them?<br/><br/>Manson outlines several key components that should help most people take stock of their values, determine what they really care about, and what they choose to invest their pain in. After all, we all experience pain and the thing worth pursuing will cost us some pain.<br/><br/>Give this book a shot. It won’t solve your problems, but it will give you some tools for dealing with them.
 Bought it for all the hype, and I wasn't a fan. I did read the whole book but I felt like I was reading someones rants online, I admit a few parts I underlined but overall I wouldn't suggest it.
 This book uses a writing style aimed at teenagers to convey shallow anecdotes on how to pull yourself up by the bootstraps and get on with your life.  Its the MTV version of The Obstacle is The Way (not a complement).  Skip.
 This book was recommended to me by a very good millennial friend of mine.  Three observations<br/>1. I am curious to know how old people are who are posting 5 star ratings for this book.<br/>2.Fair disclosure: I am almost 60.  The writing style of this book reads like a sixth grader’s diary.<br/>3. I got to page 4 and thought, “If this  were my kid, he needs an intervention.” Tried again, got to page 12,  same! Tried again (I after all had to respond to my young friend and was trying to give the author the benefit of the doubt.). Started taking a highlighter to especially cogent passages.  Gave up.  Kudos to Mark!  He came up with a title and a thesis that appeals to “participation trophy” kids...
 Presents the issue well but seemed repetitious.  This could have been shortened into a short article.  I had discovered this concept prior to reading the book and was glad that someone was proselytizing the message.  There are projects that are important (don't give up on those) but most aren't and nobody cares anyway.
 I say that I am enjoying reading this book. I like the different stories that the writer mentioned in the book. I learn a lot from these stories. I am a person who is worried about everything in life. I started to apply what I learn from this book. I try to not worry about the minor stuff in my life and to not worry so much about people opinion in my cloths or minor things in me.
 I read Mark's blog on and off and like his style.  Going through a rough time right now, and trying to bring my self back into alignment.  I finally decided to purchase the book.  I expected a reiteration of blog material, without much substance.  However, his stories were wonderful and I learned something I didn't...I really have been focused on the wrong values and metrics.  Now I need to come up with the right ones.
 Ok, if you don't like direct feedback.. Well, got read a fairytale. This book knows who's it's audience is and if you need confirmation you are on the right path or wrong path of life, then this book let's you know. That's an important point, maybe you care too much and it's bothering you.. you're right. Maybe you don't care what others think about you, you're right again. This book is fun, affirming, scary, and well worth your time.
 The book is a quick, light read. The underlying arguments are not particularly novel, but they are plainly presented in an easy to follow narrative. Support from scientific and/or other philosophic sources is light. My over arching problem with this book is the tone of the author. He comes across as the vain, slightly drunk “bro” that you meet in a bar that just has to tell you exactly what you are doing wrong with your life- and how his way is the only path. I had to actively fight my distaste for him to finish the book.<br/><br/>Anyway- the lessons here can easily be found elsewhere and often are more eloquently presented- but if you are looking for a light intro to mindfulness among other things- it’s not a terrible book.
 overdone with profanity
 It's Buddhism explained in cuss words.
 Fun self help book to read. Mark writes like your best buddy and you are drinking beers , breaking it (life) all down. I like this approach very much.<br/><br/>At such a young age mark seems to have the wisdom of life down pat. I hope he continues down this path 10 ears plus from now.<br/><br/> If you like to participate in online chat forums and philosophy of life conversations interest you then read this book.<br/><br/>Somewhat trashy, Somewhat therapeutic, Mark Manson has a best seller on hand.
 Title definitely gets your attention, if you can get past the language some good points are made along the way. Was hoping the last chapter on how facing death can help us live better would tie up these ideas and give some lasting insights to chew on but the tone of the chapter seemed to come from a different book and just sort of ended.  The author may not yet have the philosophical depth to tackle such a big question.
 I picked up the book at a book store just to see why it was so popular. The author draws you in with fun stories but then jumps into the details.<br/>He brings out new perspectives about the things or ideas we use to measure our self worth. He talks about valuing ourselves based on material things or titles. Measuring yourself against a yardstick of success similar to that of the beauty of a celebrity. He teaches you about changing how you value yourself and living without fear of failure. Without failure you can’t learn. But most of all, without failure you can’t enjoy success.
 This is the third time I've written this review and Amazon has kicked it back so I guess there's not much I can say except it a reality check and I'm not a frat boy.  I enjoyed the profanity and felt like it drove home the kick in the pants this book gave me.  I want everyone to read this book....expecially when I see them giving way too many 'cares'. Is that okay Amazon?  'cares'?
 This book explains the basics in life, that we very often forget, which results as the root cause of every extreme emotion we feel. The title is very apt for the tone of the book. Prioritizing situation and understanding whats important and whats not worth your reaction is very thought provoking.<br/>There are some beautiful lines in the book which make you stop and think - “Problems never stop, they merely get upgraded and/or exchanged. Happiness comes from solving problems, keyword being SOLVING”. Loved the book!!!
 I have read 100's of self help books since my days sn college and quite frankly since it seemed to have a negative message I wasn't expecting to like it. Most books I have read are of the Think and grow rich type and this is almost the opposite. I am very well adjusted, happy, self aware and successful( not being arrogant but I have achieved most of my life goals originally created). This book has immediatly shown me a very different and very positive new way of looking at life. My problem has  always been "that if it aint right,  its wrong" that everything was about standing up for every principal. This book made me realize that continuing to do  that would take away form my own happiness so pick your battles.
 If you can get past the many f-bombs of the first chapter, you will find a dense and well-written collection of premises that, if honestly and diligently pursued, can help make your life far more meaningful and fulfilling. You will also find a clear description of how many of us set about wasting our time and our lives, making ourselves and others miserable along the way.<br/><br/>The title is ironic: this is not a book about how to care about nothing (the author persuasively argues this never really occurs anyway). Rather, it demonstrates the profound impact our choices about what to care about (our values) have on our effectiveness and life satisfaction. It lists some of the more common choices that can lead to unwanted outcomes, and suggests others that tend to lead to better outcomes. And it gives practical advice on how to identify those values that tend to generate a more fulfilling life.<br/><br/>Be forewarned: these are not easy, “how to always feel good” strategies; they require honesty and a willingness to experience discomfort. But, in relating this book to my own journey of making some of the less effective choices the author identifies, to moving toward making some of the better ones, I can report that the results massively justify the effort. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to improve their life and relationships, and to make a positive difference in the world.
 I love this book! I originally got it from the library but upon returning it, promptly ordered my own copy! I loved it so much and there's so much in there I wanted to highlight and re-read. I'm already re-reading it again, moving through it slower this time to absorb it all in. This book won't be for everyone as there's lots of cursing and it's a laid back vibe which won't suit well with some audiences but if you can look past that, there's lots of great ponderings and ideas delivered in a direct, relatable way. It's not a typical self help advice book, but more like an encouragement to view the world and life in a more realistic and self aware way to benefit a person. I had been going through a rough patch in life and was starting to notice more anxiety and depressed thinking and this book really helped me pull out of it and get back on the road of productivity and a positive mentality. I recommended it to my best friend and a family member and they both have enjoyed it as well. I wish it was required reading for everyone!
 This book is a needlessly extended re-statement of the obvious in frisky but unimaginative language. Good, maybe, for eighteen year olds, but beyond useless for those over thirty.<br/>Quick summary: sort out your priorities and follow them without distraction. There needs no ghost come from the grave to tell us that!<br/><br/>Your first step in following the advice of this book is to ignore the book that gives it.
 This book is beyond amazing.  Personally I felt it started a little skewed to the negative, but thought-provoking enough to continue. By the second third it was very intriguing.  And the final third was extraordinary, with a magnificent wrap up.  It's witty, irreverent and confrontational, but with a deep message.  The writing itself is brilliant.
 I absolutely loved this audiobook. It was entertaining and most of it resonated with me...at times, I was both laughing and crying. It's very real, blunt, and in-your-face honest (and, at times, hilarious)...if you're easily offended and/or not open to discovering some harsh truths about yourself, however, you may not be quite ready for this one.
 I hated reading this book. It took me about a year to read. Not because I read like a kindergartner, but because every time I picked it up to casually read, it punched me in the gut by calling me out on my own BS. So I had to put it down and let things sink in.<br/><br/>In a world where we are all too quick to point fingers at others and external circumstances, Mark shows us looking in the mirror is usually the best solution and answer. The reason we don’t look in mirror more often is because it’s hard and painful.<br/><br/>If you’re done with the new age airy fairy woo woo feel good platitude books and authors, then this is for you.<br/><br/>And take your time reading it. The ass kicking is worth the pain.
 I really wanted to like this book and expected a thoughtful, yet crude approach to not giving a f***.  However, after a while, felt the content went off topic and it got confusing. I was left skimming through unuseful information about the author's life. The first half was worth 3 stars.
 This book is a nice beginners book for someone struggling to pull themselves out of a hole if they’ve never tried before.  I agree with most of the points being made in the book, but there doesn’t seem to be any science behind some of the claims being made.  The book is written in a way to attract fake Alphas looking to move beyond gym tan laundry.<br/><br/>It gets 3 stars for content only.  Originality seems to be lacking.
 One of the best self-help books I've read in a long time. Manson's style and approach are a refreshing change. I honestly gained more from this book than twenty others. I'm on my third re-read - with a highlighter. This one will make you think and make you laugh. I bought three copies for friends. I absolutely give this one five stars and recommend to everyone I know. Thanks, Mark Manson, for a great book!
 I've enjoyed Mark's web blogs for a while and his book was great. It's an enjoyable read filled with sarcastic humor, personal/historical story references, and most importantly I feel the messages of each chapter "keep it real." It's a great book to help put your own life into perspective and to objectively look at your own thoughts and behaviors without being too preachy, or painfully over-optimistic.
 I love this book and I consider it to be a must read for anyone, especially young adults. I graduated from college 6 months ago and I was looking for a full-time job to start my career but as a fresh young grad with virtually no experience, it was a little hard for me. The morning I started reading this book, I got an email about a job opening. It was not the kind of work that I wanted to do but It was a full-time job and I had no other options at the time. Even though I knew it wasn't my ideal position, I sent my application materials in and within 2 weeks I had a job offer! It still isn't in the field that I want to be in but I have now traded in my problem of not having a job and feeling frustrated to the definitively better problem of having multiple opportunities and needing to choose between them. Trust me read this book and you will feel more empowered and in control of your own happiness.
 I feel like the first chapter was exceptionally crass without much of a message for shock value, but if you skip the first chapter the book in general has some great ideas about filtering out untoward influences and deciding on your priorities, including recognition of what you would sacrifice for it such as risk of failure, offending people, and your fears. Kept me engaged and I liked it pretty well.
 This isn’t your typical self development book that makes you “feel” good with affirmations and all that mumbo jumbo. However if you can handle some vulgar language, constructive critizisism, and actually take this book for granted you will see incredible results in your love, work and social life. A lot of people that say, “This book is common sense. I learned this stuff already, what a waste of money!” If you can set your ego aside for 1 second you will realize that “Hey, maybe I might have known some of this stuff already, but wow! that’s a completely new perspective. I never thought about it like that, I will go try it out!” When you think to yourself that you know everything, you completely limit yourself to learning anything new and your hopes of implementing what you learned go down the drain with it. I’m 17 and i’m definitely not a veteran in life but honestly deep down everyone and I mean EVERYONE knows whats the right or best thing to do, but they don’t. That’s why not everyone is sucessful, that’s why not everyone is rich, that’s why 2/3 marriages end in a divorce. It’s until you take ACTION, learn from your mistakes, start building positive habits, not let your emotions get the best of you and not give a F*** about what Billy thinks of you or that Richard next door has a better job and car than you, that you will truly be in control of your life.
 Ugh. Book of empowerment turned self-help book, turned into a ploy for the author to just talk about his own privileged middle-class sob story. The last chapter was ridiculous. There were only a few good chapters in the middle of the book. Not a favorite.<br/><br/>Things I liked:<br/>Not giving a **** is more like saving time for the things that really matter to you and not giving much thought to the things that don’t<br/><br/>When you are upset about something or feel like you or a situation isn’t good enough- it’s probably an issue with your values. You are probably measuring yourself or that experience in a really lame metric.<br/><br/>Whenever he started off a chapter with a historical story and tied it into the topic that was pretty cool.<br/><br/>Things I didn’t like:<br/><br/>This author was full of himself.<br/><br/>No one should start a sentence with “Now that I’m in my 30s….”, you don’t get to preface a sentence with that until you are like- 50.<br/><br/>The last chapter was awful and so off topic. I’m not even sure what he was trying to teach his readers. A huge part of me thinks that he just wrote this whole book so he could have a whole chapter dedicated to his privileged white-boy sob story.<br/><br/>I hate that this guy started off his career in writing with a dating advice blog because I feel like he would be a terrible human being to be in a relationship with.
 I liked this book because its message, which is that most of us are pretty average and we’re all gonna die in the end, does alleviate some anxiety around feeling this need to be the best. It was a pretty easy read, but the tone (sarcastic, abrasive) gets a little old by the end.  I did really love the author’s ideas around the pursuit of happiness, and how its a pretty hollow endeavor. A lot of life is suffering- its about finding what you want to suffer through. If you need to hear that, or are struggling to be “happy” all the time, I recommend this book.
 After coming close to a nervous breakdown about 10  years ago, I had to do inner work on myself.  After reading this book it enlightened a few this I already knew from experience.  I learned how to choose my battles...which is mostly what this book is about.  Doing inner work on self is not an easy task at all....but so well worth it. Working on self gives you inner Peace, better relationships, etc.  I am not sure if I would recommend this book to people that has not done inner work..they may not fully understand what the author is saying.  If you are ready  (and willing) for change, this is an excellent book for you.
 I made it 6% in and thought, "oh ok, got it".  I'm sure there are free articles that will tell you the same thing.
 This right here is the truth. You can’t unread a thing. It sinks in your brain and changes you forever. I got this bc a stud of a celebrity said so and I was not disappointed. If you're struggling then put this in your cart and away you go. Very entertaining. I do recommended a cover in public bc it’s very bright and vulgar unless you're like me and now not giving a f***
 My co-worker referred this book to me a year ago. I needed this this book at the time I bought it and It has really given me a clear understanding of myself, life, as well as relationships. I have to admit, this book has changed a lot of my thinking and Im grateful that I got a chance to read it. What I liked most about this book are the stories he told before making you understand the meaning behind them; while also being honestly  BLUNT, because it was needed. Great job Mark Manson.
 I’ve never paid more than $9.99 for a Kindle book, and it’s been a very, very (, VERY) long time since I’ve re-read a book (because there are just so damn many other books out there to read), and I’ve never certainly finished reading a book then turned to the first page and started reading it over again just to be sure I caught everything. But all of the above is true with this book. It’s one of those gems whose title promised one sort of read, but whose text is so thought-provoking and sometimes so startling that you’re forced to wonder what the hell you’ve been thinking all this time. Actually, there were a few things that I’d already figured out for myself, but Manson takes those ideas and digs deeper and develops them further than I ever would have on my own.
 I was raised on a farm growing our own food.  I have flown into war and have transported my nations bravest into combat and then hauled the bodies of those who gave their all out of the war zone.  I've watched my beautiful wife give birth to two amazing kids.  My generation, the millennials, are so entitled that they forget the real priority of life.  They need this book and more like it.
 Helped me for the wrong reasons:<br/>Been looking at emotional intelligence books, this one didn't exactly have what I was expecting, but nonetheless has great advice I didn't exactly know I needed.<br/>Though the title obviously suggests it, there's gratuitous use of the F word, more so in the beginning making it feel like it was not entirely reviewed/edited before it's final print.<br/>While cursing is no longer viewed as unprofessional as before, there's still such a thing as too much cursing.
 As much as I wanted to love this book, rave about it, and recommend it to friends — nope. I can't. The whole time I felt like we're just all supposed to "pull ourselves up by the bootstraps" or just "get over" whatever's holding us back. This gruff approach may work well for some people, but it just didn't do it for me.
 Cheaply made book. The pages came apart as soon as I opened the book! Some of the typing inside the book is missing ink.
 Unfortunately, within two chapters, I knew I wouldn't like this book. I gave it another two chapters more before it officially became the first book I've ever bothered to ship back to Amazon.<br/><br/>First, don't assume that my skin is just too thin. I learned an extensively vulgar vocabulary after six years in the Army and 10 years of traveling the world. But this book made me roll my eyes more than smile. Mark's writing is good, as it is on his blog, but the overuse of F-bombs (and generally overdone language) made me realize midstream that I was taking life advice from a 33-year-old "bro" with a degree in finance. I could no longer take it seriously at some point. I anticipated, given the title, that a lot of F-bombs were in order. But in this instance, the language grows wearisome, childish, and distracting.<br/><br/>I will still read other things Mark writes. He certainly knows how to build a successful blog. But personally, I'll stick to more mature sources for self development and life growth.
 Probably would have been a better read for me when I was in my 20's
 This book is not what it seems. Once you get past the jumbled beginning, some incomplete thoughts in my opinion, and Manson rambling on at times it's an interesting read. This is not a feel good book. The message isn't what we want to hear, but what we need to hear. I will probably need to reread this book further down the road.
 ...only about 18% into this (kindle version) and I ALREADY LOVE IT!!! Hopefully it will CONTINUE to be a great read/experience but only time will tell and when time DOES tell I will tell all of YOU!!! LOL!!!
 I wouldn’t even give it the one star... I seriously want my money back. I<br/>Think this has to be the first time I’m unhappy with a purchase from amazon.
 This book is so boring and repetitive! The title is amazing, however it does not sustain my attention. The author does make some valid points but he also lacks depth and maturity. I don't know if it because I am 40 and we are in different generations or what the cause was of not grasping my focus. The book feels forced and lacks meaningful to my soul.......I couldn't force myself to finish.....
 By far the worst thing I've read in years. Possibly in my whole life.  Don't say I didn't warn you.
 Recommended to me a couple years ago and I wish I read it then. Even if you end up disagreeing it is still a must read especially for the 90's babies and younger generations. Of course you have to watch appropriateness of the age keeping in mind the title isn't the only part with language in it. Like I said even if you don't agree on the approach it does hit the nail on the head for the way younger generations think.
 My profession is a pastor and I hope everyone can drop their concern about what is nicknamed foul language to learn some great principles this book teaches. The real foul language in our society are not cuss words...real foul language are words like fear, purposelessness, entitlement, etc.  This is the second best book I’ve ever read...immediately following the Holy Bible. Read both and you’ll never be the same.
 Even before I read it,  I had the feeling it's content would be profound. I had no idea who Mark was and had never read his blog, so I had no pre-conceived notion about what he would have to say. The concepts are straight-forward and cut through the BS some other writings spill out. If you want to be coddled by the author, read a different book. If you want simple, to-the-point advice, read this one.
 Superficial self-help book written by a privileged straight white male. May be helpful to bros exactly like the author, but some f***s should have been given while crafting this book. 200+ pages are a quick, but painful read. Could be edited down significantly.
 Do not get out off by the title.<br/>This book is striking like it's title, if you are too offended by curse words, you should read this book:<br/><br/>Manson's book is very easy to read and understand<br/>He takes readers through his life experiences and tells of the lessons he realized. His message is simple, to care more about what's truly important and less to zero about all the frivolous things societies and cultures make seem important. Experiences and experience taught him to live more in the moment, to fear literally nothing not even death, and be less stressed, worried, unhappy, confused. There's much to unpack from this book.<br/><br/>I recommend this book to those who are frustrated with where they are--mentally, physically, emotionally, spiritually--, annoyed too often with anything, seeking a book that will help you actually grow and CHANGE.<br/><br/>I recommend it to everyone.
 An excellent perspective, after you get through the first 3 chapters. After the initial self indulgence and shock factor of dropping the f word every other word...the author is well-read despite being young, and makes some amazing points in an easy to understand manner.  Would have likely allowed my younger self to “hear” it. Wish the book was around 20 years ago!
 Wonderful book that takes some of the obscure lessons of zen and Buddhism and puts it in a practical and easy to read language. I would recommend this book to anyone with anxiety or if you take your problems too seriously (which I am guilty of!)
 I LOVE this book. It goes against this notion that most self-help books push that we are all "unique" and "special." Rather, it suggests that we aren't all the special and people go through similar situations and problems that we also face on a daily basis. My favorite take-away from this book is to pick and choose what you care about. I read it when I need a humorous reminder not to sweat the small stuff.
 Not really what I expected, given the title. It's more of a list of things to focus on that are more important than the unimportant things that occupy less effective minds. There's a bit of contradiction with the anti-positivity framework. A lot of the advice is based on positive psychology research without realizing it, or at least not acknowledging it. The argument that people are too entitled is repeated throughout and comes off sounding like the tired rant that participation trophies are the root of all life's modern-day problems. Other than that, the book challenges conventional thinking and is weirdly motivational in the first few chapters.
 The writing style is "unique" and takes a little getting used to - the first few pages take work but keep at it.  I feel I have benefited from reading this book.  It provokes thought and a good deal of introspection.  There are already a few things I have changed about how I approach life and work - so the concepts are easy to apply if you are up for it.  Finally, I found the first half of the book to be much stronger than the second half, which is more philosophical (hence the 4 stars).  If you need to reorient yourself a little and want to take a fresh approach in life, I recommend giving this book a try.
 This is basically a book on Buddhist philosophy but written in a "modern" way meaning there is plenty of vulgarity. Duh. I did find it helpful and it reminded me to stop worrying so much; however, I began to tire of the F-bombs after a while and found myself substituting the word in my head. I guess that is what made this unique. If you're new to this type of philosophy, you will appreciate the author's lessons and actually learn some great strategies to approach life differently than you've been.
 I just started reading this book and I can say I’m enjoying it. Mark is straight to the point and doesn’t sugar coat anything. It’s a book about real life struggles and Mark basically tells it how it is. Do not recommend for anyone who takes things to heart because you will read things that you might think they come off a little strong but the reality is that this is how life really is and sometimes we just need someone to tell us and encourage us to let certain things go.
 I really love this book so far. Implemented some of the things into my life and it has helped me be way more positive with what I have and basically to realize that it's my choice how I react to things. I think about this more and realize how true it is. Still not done reading it but yeah I love it so far.
 Mad Magazine featured mascot was Alfred E Newman.  His caption on the front of each magazine was “ What, Me Worry”. The message hers seems to be in a similar vein. I understand and agree with most of the premises expressed here, but the point could have been expressed in a shorter form...
 Mark Manson says a lot without saying anything. He thinks highly of himself and the book’s purpose is unmet. Talking in circles is a waste.
 The cover was clearly torn and laminated back together.  Bummed it’s clear that it wasn’t even a good fit since it’s overlapping. I won’t bother returning it. I haven’t started reading it yet. Clearly this is a used book,  I’m okay with that. Just wish the cover was replaced.
 Seems insightful while you are reading, then you walk away and forget everything you read. Better books on this subject are out there.
 Rather immature compared to David R. Hawkins, "Letting Go: The Pathway to Surrender", "The Pursuit of Happiness" or "The Four Agreements". I couldn't bring myself to give a F@#$ about the book, because the author doesn't.
 Amazing book! Really solidifies what's important to care about in life. Made me evaluate what/who drives me to be loving, passionate, and feel alive. While pinning me down to why my focus is not on these life defining people and passions. Thank you for putting into words how to fill that feeling of being busy but unaccomplished. Time to start saying no a whole lot more and saying yes to only  the truly important legacy defining things.
 I really enjoyed reading this and found it very insightful. I think the author very accurately identify the problem with today's society and recommended a solution as well. If you are put off by the title or the cover, don't, you are wrongly judging the book by it's cover and we all know we shouldn't do that :-D
 This was a selection my book club decided to read &amp; initially I thought this book was going to explain why you shouldn’t give a f*!&amp; about anything.  What it actually does is provide perspective on how we choose to give a f*!&amp; and what we waste energy and time giving a f*!&amp; about.  It provides suggestions on how to redirect our energy and time to only give a f*!&amp; about the things that really matter.
 A really good read. Initially I thought with all the "F Bombs" this was a rookie author telling the world to not care and do whatever the hell you want.  Eventually it gets around to some science and great examples most can relate to.  By the end of it the reader should get a sense of whether or not you're doing it (life) right and where and how to make improvements.
 This book really helped me learn to focus on the important stuff in live. Teaches great core values to have. I’m doing better in college, enjoying life more, and have better relationships. You can have a similar experience, but you can’t just read the book. You MUST apply it. I wrote on every page and after ever chapter spent around 30 minutes applying it to myself. I now read every day. Two thumbs up. Highly recommend.
 I read a lot.  This is one of the best I've ever read.  I am at a time in my life where by the time I finished this book, I had<br/>sorted out a few very important issues.  I am sorry that he used the language he did as that's not the way I talk.  I hesitate<br/>to recommend it to anyone, but have done so using enough words that they can find it.  But I know why he did it.<br/>I thought about writing to him to express my opinion, but realized he would just say, "I don't give a ..." :)<br/><br/>I think I will be reading it again just to get it more deeply ingrained in my mind.  Wonderful, wonderful, book.
 This is truly a lifechanging book.  I used to worry about success and how to be the best.  The reality is that there is no best, is just what your perspective is.  If you believe in yourself, others automatically will, just because of your confidence.  You don't need to be a genius, or the best athlete, life is about your moments here on earth and worrying about all the things out there that make us think we are a failure, is a waste.
 OK book but several chapters on my kindle version were all chopped up to the point that the first sentence and sometimes the last two on a page were unreadable. As in they didn't all fit on the screen and when you went to the next page it was not picking g up where previous pages left off.
 Given the title, I was not surprised to see foul language, but hey, we get the point... the horse was flogged and left for dead after five paragraphs. The book has a few good anecdotes, but I lost interest half way through.
 Although some of his advice is good, he picks and chooses arguments and examples to support his theories, and his ideas are all over the place. I found the book very entertaining, though. Just don’t expect great insight or introspection. Many of his ideas like we are all going to die seems common sense to me to live life well. Four stars still, because this book was fun to read.
 While I've seen other authors describe the concepts in this book with much more detail,  and I feel silly for falling for the title's marketing gimmick, I'd be remiss if I didn't say I  enjoyed the modern perspective. Moreover, it serves as a good reminder of many concepts I've come across in the past, and I appreciated how easy it was to get through the entire audio book. In sum, I would recommend this to anyone who's having a hard time getting through the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People or anyone who can use a reminder of the role principles, values, death, and trust, should play in our day to day lives.
 I tried to look past the shock value and see if there is a good message here.  Honestly, it was a difficult read with some gems of knowledge interspersed.  There are better self help books out there.
 I rarely highlight anything in books I'm reading but this one had my light bulb going off quite a bit and my highlights followed.  The perspective you are asked to view life from in this book is original, brilliant and very truthful.  I got a lot of food for thought, a buffet in fact.  So glad I was open minded enough to get past the F bombs.  It was well worth the trip through the minefield.  Thank you for writing this.
 I was really excited to read this book. I kept on waiting for the AHA moment but it never came. The author rambles on for so many pages to make a point that by the time the story is over I have no idea what the point was. The only reason I finished this book was to at least compensate the 15 bucks I spent on it. Definitely not worth it.
 Wasn't what I expected and I've read better self-help books.
 I found this on my friends coffee table and first laughed at the title. I have never heard about it, though now that I have read it it seems like everyone knew about this book but for me. I read a couple of pages there while hanging out and I just had to get it myself. It came quickly and in perfect condition. I thought it was a pretty easy read personally, I read it in about a week just reading at night before bed. This has honestly changed my life. It has opened my eyes to things that were literally right in front of me that I just was not seeing. It isn't like any other self-help book I have heard about or skimmed through. I recommend this to everyone now, it is a really enjoyable book.
 I didn't expect to have solved many puzzled on my mind that I wasn't able to comprehend for quite a long time. Like why there are some people in the West are so fake, why do they seem polite, sweet and say something they don't even mean?<br/>Topics like relationship, toxic and healthy.<br/>Real story like how he transformed by experience his friend's death.<br/>Many things retains after finishing the whole book. Thank you
 A very good book.  Mr. Manson presents examples that remind us of people we all know (even of ourselves)!  Then he turns our first thoughts about these folks upside-down.  There is so much to think about.<br/><br/>The reviews that complain about the author cussing and using the F-Word are ridiculous.  Read the words.  Ignore the occasional F-Word.  Does one word in a book make entire message wrong?  This is how some people emphasize thoughts -- get over it.  The title is an attention getter.<br/><br/>I am retired after a successful career.  I have had a partner in life for thirty years.  I am happy.  I am happier after reading this book.<br/><br/>He does not give you the answers just a way to ask the questions.  What fun is solving the problem of life if you get the answers!  I am going to seriously consider Mr. Mansons' ideas.  Thanks for making me think about what to do next.
 i read this book at the time I had so many confusions in my life and my relationships. It helped me reassess my values and get it altogether, back on track.<br/>We have so many choices and freedom in life now that we are even more lost. The meaning of experiences as much as you can, travel to unknown places, talk to people , hearing the stories is to help you get closer to the truth - to who you are , what you want to be and left behind after you are dead.<br/>it is not about a fancy freedom, no responsibility that many might mistake it for just because they have issues and want to escape.<br/>a lot to think about, a lot to work on but and I felt like I am getting closer to the truth and start to understand that yes, the meaning of life is to live it.
 I Cannot find anywhere on the Amazon site where I can get help returning a Kindle book I bought accidentally. I am deaf and don't use Kindle, nor do I have apps on my phone. I am going to re-order this in a hard copy.
 I got this book because I thought it sounded funny, but it is actually a serious (while funny) work on how to make the most of your life. I wish everyone read this book. It is excellent.
 I thoroughly enjoyed this book, because it was the slap in the face I desperately needed. As someone who worries about and feels everything so personally, Manson certainly put things into another perspective: learn where to give your cares and where not to. I’m definitely glad I bought this book. I will pass it on to my friends and family, as well as reading it again when I need to be reminded. I, in turn, have been giving less cares and embracing the negative that comes with life!
 If you want a straightforward and direct view of what really matters in life read this book. I'm surprised about how young the author is. Very well exposed and with real life examples. I like the fact this tips are delivered by someone who has actually lived out his experiences, not your usual personal growth and naive kind of stuff written by the so-called life gurus. I would really like to read more from Mark Manson.
 Great book! Really helped me open my eyes and want to make serious changes to my life. I'm not good about finishing books, but this one was difficult to put down. Read it in 2-3 nights. Biggest lesson: whatever bad things in life happened to you, there is someone out there who has had it way worse, but still accomplished great things, because they stopped letting their excuses stop them (Mark does a wayyy better job of explaining it).
 I am a therapist  and was told about this  book by a client.  I found it to be amazingly straightforward ,  sage advice for those folks needing a  simple, practical guide to figuring out their life path without drowning  in " therapy speak", homework  assignments  and all the other stuff that is laid on clients.  So many well intended counselors anxious to do their job miss the mark with those already anxious clients  who need answers fast.  This book cuts to the chase!
 Don't give up on this too early. The last few chapters are easily its strongest. There's not much original or profound in the first few chapters, where he seems more interested in shocking readers with liberal f bombs, but fortunately the schtick dies off as the book progresses and is replaced by some much deeper and interesting thinking.
 Our book club agreed that this book could have been a 100 page short exposee. If you are a younger person it may shed some new light on things.
 For all the hype on this book, thought it would be better.  It starts off really well (informative and funny) but then starts to drag out.  Author gets on a tangent and you forget what the original thing he was talking about was.  Found myself re-reading because I would get bored with the repetitive concepts and was not funny anymore.  Save your time and money.
 This is on the list of my top 3 favorite books!! That being said, there are so many other good reviews of this book that I'm not going to go into detail. Probably the biggest take away for me though is to keep reflecting on your values and what matters to you and don't spend so much time on the things you don't care about - life's too short. I'm definitely sharing this book with my friends!
 At first I thought this was just a counterbalance to all the fluffy "happiness" books. But it really offered a batter, middle path. Unfiltered and felt more like listening to someone talk casually than reading a book (yet still thoughtful and eloquent).
 The book has some pretty solid life advise, if you can get over all of the F-bombs in the beginning. But, after that - I have to say the life values laid out in this book are in fact very helpful. I would say, if you're looking at this book...give it a chance. Read it a couple of time to let the advise sink in.
 This book had a very frank voice. The author didn't fill the book with fluff. He was direct and to the point with everything he wrote.<br/><br/>There were times when I read a section and in hindsight it made perfect sense. The way he explains complex topics was great and this book is worth every penny.
 The F word is not offensive to me, but it is annoying to read 1Million times in a book. I couldn't filter out any good info between the F's!!
 I absolutly love this book. If you have depression or anxiety this book is a huge help. I have recently went through a bad break up and this book helped me re-evalute my priorites and ultimately what I should and shouldn’t give a f*ck about. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to live a more peaceful life. 10/10 love this book.
 The audible version was purchased, listened to and I believed that a hard copy was necessary!  I purchased the hard copy so that I can re-read sections and highlight what speaks to me.  I've also been practicing what I've read and it really has made a positive difference on my stress level. Love this book and the messages it delivers--however not for anyone who is offended by the use of curse words.  Mr. Manson is a "straight to the point" author.
 The first time I read this book I was a recovering alcoholic. I was confused and looking for anything other than booze that made sense to me. After 2 years of sobriety I'm reading it again because I'll be retiring from the Army soon and I'm not sure what the future holds for me. The good thing is that I'm going to die anyway so my future has no choice but to be great.
 This is a good book everyone should take a weekend and read. He's funny, and brings everyday issues to the surface and how he thinks the best way to handle them are. He has a good  perspective, and its always good to hear someone else other than your own. I'd definitely recommend - I'm still lost in life, but maybe there's a little bit more clarity.
 If you are 19 and think the world revolves around buying a Tesla, this book is for you. If you are an average responsible adult, I would suggest a different book. While I have a positive opinion of the overall content, I was not suprised by anything in this book- it's basically how most people get through the week without guzzling antidepressive meds.
 I wouldn't soak this up like it's the bible...in fact, I don't even soak that up. But Mark for sure delivers, in my opinion, a very well written book and has a ton of great things to express! Adding sarcasm and wit makes it that much more enjoyable. He's the kind of person I would like to hang out with. I'm not even finished with the book and I'm already recommending it to my friends, family and coworkers. I already bought a copy for my dad.
 Gave this as a gift to a woman who lost her mom, and she was messed up.  She read it, and underlined everything. Then she bought it as a Christmas gift for all her kids.  "It was a great book," she said. "And honestly, I think they named it that so they would sell -- and darn if it didn't work. Everyone in my family loved it."
 Although I could do without the authors vulgarities, this is a life changing book for me. It’s the first book I’ve highlighted in a long time - many of the authors statements are so awakening I had to reread them several times and let the words soak in. This book is a must read. Now more than ever we need books like this. In the age of social media we need this to remind us who the real average person is, how we must stay rooted in our values and how we must be mindful as to what we truly chose to care about.
 I just realized as I'm reading the book that some pages are blank in the book. The window to return the book has passed. I'm really bummed. Otherwise it's a hell of a good book. It's going to drive me crazy because there's several blank pages. When you purchase the book make sure to look thru it so this doesn't happen to you.
 Its a book for people that have no idea what they want out of life.
 Great title. Complete waste of time.  Do not buy.<br/><br/>Zero worthwhile advice. Almost as if written by some millennial who just complains half the time and then brags the other half. Zero takeaways. Can I get my money back?
 The end of this book is my favorite......<br/>But the rest of it is also easy to read and digest. I am over the typical self-help books that have millions of exercises, and cheesy advise. I like that Mark gives examples from his own life and is very honest about the whole thing! Worth it!
 This is, essentially, a self help book. It really hit home in a lot of places. Everyone needs to read this book and reevaluate things you give an f about. Mark uses real life scenarios to help you reevaluate where you are spending your time and energy and where to refocus it.
 For my 18 year old son who is going through some tough times right now. He said he loves the book and that is saying something, he doesn't like reading. I wanted to keep reading just from the snip it online. Looking forward to reading after he is done.
 I would recommend this book to anyone who has a modicum of curiosity on its contents. I will be rereading it for sure. I feel I was able to connect to the experiences without having to go through it and coming out with the lesson he learned. Great outlook on life even though at times the content is very depressing in places. I don't read many books but this one has me hungry for more.
 Love this book. You’ve really got to read the whole thing, not just the first part, to get the whole picture. I recommend this to everyone I talk to. So good. Curses a LOT in the first chapter, so maybe not one for Grandma. Seems like it’s making its point in that first chapter, like, “Hey! I say F***! That means I’m relevant!” But get past it, Bc it’s a great book.
 A decent read with some good insights, and while I like the title, the author isn't that great of a writer. Profanity is effective in small doses - but when someone depends on it as a staple of their vocabulary, in my mind it shows a lack of creativity. Just my opinion.
 If you are looking for an easy answer to how you should approach life and your death in this world, read one of the thousands of other self-help books. If you would like to cut out the bullsh*t and accept responsibility for every aspect of your life, this book I recommend as a tool to let go of the unimportant and get on with the process of making your mark on the universe!
 Mark lays out his suggestions on handling  life in a deliberate and gripping fashion. He makes strong cases on our behaviors that both reinforce and provide a guiding light. It's a great foundation to start from, even if you don't necessarily agree with everything, if everyone followed most of this book it might be a better society.
 This book helped me see alot of things about myself. It's an amazing read, and I think alot of reviews try to keep emotions out...as will I. I'm not sure if I read this at the right time or really needed to hear what he wrote right now, but this book has affected me profoundly. I used to say and forgot, "get over yourself", this book brought it all back.
 WOW. I love self help and personal development books but I often find they’re filled with fluff / general ideas. This book is a must have. It makes you reflect. It makes you think about your life. It gives you a new perspective.
 Most of the points in this book are not new, you have heard about them before, but this book will make you accept those points. For example, people have been saying that “life is full of misery” for as long as you can remember, but this book make you comfortable with the misserys and select the ones that you want to confront. This is the best book about finding happiness.<br/>This book will change your life and the challenge is to spread this idea to the people around you; or better to make them to read the book themselves.
 He does a great job explaining very complex and serious ideas and puts them in an easy to understand, hilarious read. It will take the rest of my life to put these ideas into practice, as they are simple but far from easy. Well worth the read!
 A lot of the material is common sense and pretty much comes down to understanding how to prioritize what really matters. Not a new concept. However, it was entertainingly  presented in a simple, easy to understand style. And it is worth the read as a reminder to keep what you value front and center.
 I read a lot of these types of books. But, I was a bit put off by the title and language. I gave it a chance and read it during a beach vacation where I actually had time to read and reflect. I'm glad I did. It helped to confirm some things, but more importantly it help me to change perspective on a few important aspects of my life. Any book that can help me change my perspective it is a GREAT book. That is why I read.
 Reading this book made me think about the consequences of hyperaffluence and how many of the self-perceived problems we encounter every day could be partially solved if put into the context of need. The author makes a good point by drawing a line between the amount of exposure we are under and how this becomes in itself a need.
 I loved this book! I usually take a long time to read books but this one I read quite fast because it was so interesting. I believe if you let it, it can be life changing. If you are honest about wanting to change your life, your views and actually care about things that matter and not nonsense this is the book for you.
 I've read a lot of Buddhist books, I've read a lot of self-help books,  but this one puts a different spin on all of it  Manson uses the same concepts, but he challenges you to look at things from a slightly different angle. The older I get, the more sense it makes . So glad I picked this book up, life-changing.
 Very disappointed in that the book offers no new insights beyond what common sense, maturity, and life experience already provide.  Buyer beware: This book may indeed have a catchy title, but in truth it just doesn't live up to the hype.
 When I think of self help books I think of condescending successful people telling you stuff you hear from your parents. "Study and work hard, keep your chin up and never give up! Just be happy" but this book doesn't try to hide anything. It opens up about the shittiness of life and how to accept it and be a better person while still maintaining your personal values. And not to mention the style of writing was very down to earth and a good read
 Good &amp; interesting reading around the main premises of the book. It is basically a repackaged version of the advice to prioritize what s important &amp; don't sweat the small stuff. But it makes a good case to do that, serves as a good reminder to do that, &amp; I enjoyed it.
 I didn’t think much of this book when I started reading it.  Maybe I read too many self help books.  After the first three chapters this book totally won me over.  It read like a condensed Tony robins book until the last few chapters take you to a new level of understanding.<br/> Highly recommended!
 I've been carrying a lot of baggage around with me all of my life.  I've read other books, but nothing really spelled it out or made me think the way this book did.  It's really about carefully thinking about where to give your F***S rather than not giving any.<br/><br/>If you feel like you can't dig out of the mess you're in, this will help.
 very interesting book, with a really different twist on self help/self improvement.  Very much in your face approach with very thought provoking ideas.  Need to get past the language but I suppose that is one way to make an impact/impression to drive the point home.  Thought it was very good and I plan on re-reading it.
 ...This is not a book telling you to forget about everything. This is teaching you how to peel back the onion to the things you truly care about and forget the rest of the crap day in and day out. The words are real but if you can get past the first 15-20 pages you get to the meat of his message. Highly recommend this book for all of you people pleasers like me!!!
 This book is changing my life.. not that i gave a f*&amp;* about everything under the sun, but like most people, i wasn’t spending my F*(*s wisely... and some of my values were crap... I have been reallly re evaluating certain areas of my life that i have cared too much for far too long, and not that they are not important or i all of the sudden don’t care about them, but thinking about how to reassess those areas of my life that have not worked out at all the way i thought, and I kept clinging and clinging to this “ideal” that was never going to be, and learning or realizing instead that i needed to adapt that value, and keep moving forward, in tiny bits and steps and failures, but embrace that process of growth and growing, instead of staying stuck on that thing that “hasn’t worked out” and get out of that parking garage of tyranny of unmet expectations.  So I am moving away from this and for this I am grateful. Highly recommend
 Not what i expected. Started to annoy me after a while. Most people love it but it just didn’t resonate with me. If you can, read a sample first.
 The book was on my niece's Christmas list. I bought it for her and then two days before Christmas I picked it up to wrap it. I read the blurb about the author. He's a kid! I'm a 68-year-old woman. How could a person that young have anything worthwhile to say about living a good life? And then I couldn't put it down.
 I don't do selfhelp books but this one's title drew me in. There is nothing in this book that we don't already know. Rather, it is a confirmation of values and life's truths and the problems of entitlement. And accepting death, something I am struggling with right now. Manson did some good basic research and uses real life experiences to illustrate his points - it is easy to associate with and therefore easy to read and understand. Many aha! moments here. Loved every page and although the contents certainly does not present a quick fix, my approach to life is definitely changing as of today.
 Great book! Very honest and insightful. It has some solid feedback on how/why it is so important to be responsible for yourself in ways most people may not ever think about. It's definitely a great read for anyone in search of an interesting book on productivity and self-help.
 Got it for my 32 year old son who suffers with bouts of depression. He said that the book was AMAZING! He wants to read it a second and third time. Made me feel good I helped him. Dispite the title, he said that the book was really powerful.
 This book is a game changer. The best way to fix yourself is to learn about your self. You think you know you but you don't, it's a strange experience when you realize " Ouch, I do that on a daily basis. I should probably quit that" I'm by no means a believer motivational garbage, you're either motivated or your not. That's not what this is, it puts everything in perspective so you can decipher your bad habits. Thank you Mark, I've passed this along and helped several people along the way. Paul
 This book is probably good for someone else, but not me.  I expected it to go in a completely different direction.  Had to put it down.
 Great concept. Classless crass<br/>and unnecessary )language
 I only read a little of the book, but found that it lead me towards really not driving towards any goals in my life and just accepting that I suck. I think it may be a great book for some, but I look for a more uplifting approach to life. You get exactly what the cover says. LOL
 He hit gold on many awesome points. I took a lot of notes on this book. Lots of things I want to remember. It's very frank and direct. The truth is that it's hard to face that we are responsible for our own unhappiness and happiness. This book helped get to that.
 This books speaks to me like no self-help book has. It’s a blunt voice of truth we all need to hear from time to time. I’ve read and reread trying to put into practice.
 It’s funny. I read some of the negative reviews here and I think, “Geez, did we read the same book?” I’m re-reading it for the third time. Thinking about this book has made my work and home life better. Does that make me a bit of a simpleton? Based on some of the hilariously arch “this book ain’t all that” reviews, I’m sure some people would think so. And the nice thing I can say now is, so what? It is helping me do new and important growing up stuff, and I am grateful. Thank you for the continuing pile on of insight, Mr. Manson.
 This book along with  Massimo Pigliucci "How to be a Stoic" have changed my life for the better. The techniques to handle things, to divide what's consequential and what's not, I wish I have learned them early on in my adult life. Better late than never.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend this book. Don't be off put by the title. It is superb.
 Worthwhile, but a little anticlimactic for me. However a lot of the thoughts are the same thoughts I have anyway, but articulated better than I would’ve. I’ve recommended this book to others.
 From the minute I picked it up, this book was difficult to put down.  Manson is full of great life observations and advice.
 Underline insightful.  A truly eye and mind opening bit of writing.  Helped me see the errors of myself.  Thank you, mark.  Here is to living with all the confusion and then to die properly.
 Meh, I'm not really getting it.  It's like the author is just saying "pick your battles" in a modern way.
 Not really any new or novel information in here; but that's not the point. The point is, it's a modern-vernacular take on ancient wisdom, peppered with the author's often-funny and often-wise anecdotes. You have to be OK with swearing...There's a lot of it, especially at the beginning. Between this and Michael Singer's The Untethered Soul, you can get a lot of natural relief from your depression and especially anxiety.
 Many life lessons are touched by mark as the reader follows his thoughts. Yes, Manson is a human mistake maker who has difficulty facing his fears. This book focus on an approach to viewing mistakes an tragedy in a positive light. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to examine their inner thoughts and outward actions.
 This book is awesome! It is a very fun read and it is definitely a different perspective on things. I really enjoyed this book and have taken away some really good points. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a great way to help de-clutter their life.
 Buddhism explained in street language without calling it as such. The last chapter is the most powerful and is what really pulls it together. But the earlier chapters need to be read first. This is a good introduction to the non-Buddhist western mind. I recommend following it up by then reading some of Ethan Nichtern's work, starting with One City.
 It's an easy read.  I would worry about things at work and people would say "don't worry about it".  This book dives into why you worry about inane things and how to step back and not worry about it.  I would recommend to anyone who cares too much about little things.
 Didn't find this one very enlightening or entertaining unfortunately.  I'm very surprised by the high ratings. (4 more words required)
 I started reading Mark's blogs in 2016 and was waiting for this book in anticipation. It is a great book about:<br/>1) Taking responsibility even if you are not to blame.<br/>2.) Embracing uncertainity and constantly casting doubt on our beliefs, our feelings and our future. This was new for me and I have to learn how to...<br/>3.) Learning through failures and our flaws. My future me will be better than my present me.<br/>4.) Saying No and being able to handle being told No<br/>5.) Death and perspective that it provides to life.
 I love this book.  I've read it twice already and have sent copies to people I care about.  Contrary to the title, the book doesn't encourage the reader not to care about anything but, instead, to choose carefully the things you care about.
 I loved the book, if you take what he says and reflect it into your own life. It makes the book all the more impactful, the meanings lie in how you interpret them. Yeah, he is talking about his life. However, for the most part I could realtor parts of my life to his undercoatings. This is what made this such a great book for me, for someone who has taken the path less traveled by and felt alone. This book tells me, that it's okay to be alone. It's okay to be your own person, it's okay to not give a f*** sometimes. To just go with the flow and to discover my own faults and failures. All in all, I loved the book. Would recommend it
 This book is fabulous! I am not a reader but could not put it down- had me giggling outloud... maybe not the best book for a company mastermind group, as it can be a little too much for some people- but, it is spot on about so much in life.
 Having previously read Mark's blog and loving his writing style, I decided to purchase this book and had several aha moments.  Early in the book he explained something that resonated really well with me in terms of a practically non-existent relationship with my brother and, when I viewed it that way, it released a lot of negative emotions I had around it.  The whole book is great and his writing style makes it even more interesting!
 The book is a great book from what I’ve been told and I was very excited to buy and read it. Very disappointed in how the book was put together. My pages were not cut properly at the top and they look very frayed. The book pages  needed to be ripped apart which caused me to rip a few pages to get it to open properly. I expected better build quality but I won’t let it stop me from reading this book and retaining the information.
 The book is like a long blog post full of profanity and personal anecdotes, but I think the author's idea is relevant nonetheless, and he hopes he can spare us the experience he had to go through at times, yet influence us to change for the best. Not the deepest book ever, but a good read that's enjoyable with a message to help.
 I thought this would be more about how to let go of being bothered by crappy drivers and rude shoppers and such but it was more philosophical rather than practical. Still some interesting reading but he often relies, IMO, too much on the shock value of the F-bomb (not so shocking to anyone who would buy this book) and not enough on practical applications.<br/><br/>His ego is monumental but still worth the read.
 Bought this for my wife who is about halfway through and found that 6 pages had not been printed. Not that there were 6 extra blank pages. Content is missing... beyond that, so far so good. She is starting to understand that other people's opinions don’t always matter. ...maybe it’s a test to apply your learning...
 Its main message is "Don't sweat the small stuff."  And most of life's problems are small stuff.<br/><br/>The book is user friendly in terms of being easy to peruse without having to read word for word.  It makes plenty of valid points without losing its sense of humor.
 I enjoyed all chapters except for Something Beyond Our Selves which read like a school essay and frankly was not very much convincing; not very much from the heart, not something deeply lived-through – not yet. I only wish the author could have spared the reader those sexist remarks (fortunately they are not that many) because sexism makes any valuable thought sound unoriginal and even tasteless. And, above all, sexism does not agree with the author's preached values, nor does it agree with his evolution from a womanizer to somebody reborn. I guess it's also possible that sexism is just dust from his previous self and as such will go away with time, once acknowledged. Or maybe the book's target is the dudes, not a general audience. Also, after I gave this book four stars simply because I'd enjoyed it, I started to hesitate if it was a fair judgement of it as a self-help book. And I think that the category self-help is a little overstated here despite the book's rather straightforwardly prescriptive character. I know I did read this for fun (and in hope of learning something new; the title certainly helped me to purchase the book out of amusement and curiosity), and it was fun allright. Of course I learned a few things – mostly anecdotes about some more or less famous people's lifes. Or that the most important is living by your actual values, not the ones you've learned from other people and you even don't realize they are not yours; or that you should get out of your head and do something (not forgetting about the consequences though, but staying positive at the same time). The few bits from the author's life were ok too (one of them life-changing). But as a self-help book I can't give it more than solid 3 stars. It's insightful only as somebody's life experience put into orderly fashion, not as an expert (like psychotherapist's) help.
 I had heard that this was a good book, but it actually was great. I enjoyed the unadulterated truth, language and all, as well as the thought behind the research conducted and the stories told to help illustrate his points. The book had a good flow and never dulled to me. Mark was able to help me see and review things in a new perspective. Never thought he would have solid relationship advice, but it's in there too. Do yourself a favor, give F;#!, and read this book.
 It took me a bit to read this as I only read during periods of complete in activity, but I would definitely recommend this to others. This book hits on some distinct concepts that I feel people need to read. While reading this, I found some of the examples were overly drawn out and slightly convoluted.
 This book was just what I needed at that time! I loved this book! Great read, especially around the new year.
 Not a fan.
 I love finding out things about myself especially when those things are not so pleasant !, that's how you grow as a person , Learned a few powerful lessons reading this book More then a few times I needed to highlight something so I would never forget it .
 A great and thought provoking read packed with brutal honesty. Skip all the warm fuzzy books on self improvement and building your self esteem. Mark Manson tells it like it is. Definitely a must read for anyone looking to change their life for the better. It's all about accountability and he goes through how to hold yourself accountable for the problems in your life and not blame or find a scapegoat and does so using my favorite word. I definitely recommend this book and recommend reading it more than once to drive key points home.
 I think it's safe to say this book has changed my life. I'm in search of something bigger and meaningful in life and this book has it all. I'm definitely going to read this over and over again. Great writer! I've bought a copy for a friend and another for my mom. Because it's THAT GOOD!
 This book was funny and a pleasure to read. I read it in two days because I couldn't put it down. Opened my eyes to some of my own undesired behaviors and reactions and gave me a new approach to my life based on personal values. I appreciate this book. :)
 I ordered this book through Audible, and would listen on my drives to and from work. I still had an hour left to the book and couldn't bring myself to listen to the rest. Everytime I would get out of the car, I would wonder why on earth I was still listening.<br/><br/>I don't have an issue with the profanity &amp; vulgarity. What I couldn't get past is that it seems as though the book is just a bunch of examples of how messed up our society is, and the boasting of how promiscuous the writer was. I was expecting some form of how to work through the things that bother you and how to not care as much.<br/><br/>The writing is shallow, repetitive, condescending, and I wouldn't expect it to be relatable to most people, especially if you have your stuff together. It's a montauge of terrible personal experiences to make you feel better about yourself, and to hate society, and millennials.<br/><br/>I returned the book for a different one, just wished that I would have not expected it to get better and gave up a long time ago. Don't waste your time.
 This book was so helpful.  It cleared up a lot of questions and struggles I've been dealing with for a long time.  I recommend this book for anyone whether they are going through a hard time or not.  It's a must read.
 Bought this book based on the reviews, but didn't seriously think I would like it all that much.  How wrong I was.  Definitely worth reading and re-reading.  Glad I got it and many thanks to the author for a different perspective on life.  Life changing ideas.
 Thank you for following your heart to write this book. It was very timely for me to read and helped me with some things that I've been grappling with, especially my fears of rejection and death. My biggest takeaway was the idea of embracing the darkness so the the light in me will shine brighter.
 Book arrived timely and in expected state (new). Its also a book I would recommend to any and all adults, and specifically those who struggle with honesty, are unable to take responsibility for their actions or waste time on things irrelevant for their and their loved ones lives.
 I thought this would only be a humorous book. And it is funny, but it's also poignant and incredibly well-written. There's a lot of good stuff in this book that will give you a fresh perspective on life. The fact that the language is profane only adds to the enjoyment of this read!
 Mark has taken self help books to the next level! I laughed and questioned my life through his similarities and struggles. Be prepared for the brutal honest truth of how you are living your life. His real life examples are ones you never see coming...kind of like Disappointment Panda knocking at your door.
 A friend recommended this book &amp; said it has been life-changing for &amp; her husband. Embarking on my own healing journey, this sounded right up my alley. I really enjoyed all the historical references throughout the book. Reading the profound experience the author has at the end was a great way of wrap wrapping everything up. Highly recommended!
 The author has an unique life path, well everyone has. It’s not hard to find echo in the fragments that you and me may have come across similar situations yet didn’t steer the feeling in a more ascent, lack of more appropriate word here, way that can lift us out of whatever pit we stepped in. The book uncovers some worth-having mind set that everyone can equip, without needing to go through deep obscure theories in philosophy. They are what lies in our nature, just the noisy environment tampers their raw form and buries in the back of our mind and via the book it reminds us the simple path to happiness
 This book is worth the read! There are interesting definitions of concepts we take for granted, such as honesty, trust, responsibility. I highlighted parts I want to review and will read this book again. It approaches the meaning of life from a different but realistic point of view. It's thought provoking!
 What more can be said , this is a great pick me up type of book. Live your life according to some of the advice outlined in this book, and see your life improve, stress reduced and you may feel better.
 I’m writing this review after finishing the book mere minutes ago, and I have to say that this is a well written “slap in the face” sort of book. I’d akin this book to having a conversation with the character from “The Most Interesting Man in the World” commercial or hearing a lecture from a cool professor in college who decided to talk about big picture life goals rather than the nitty gritty methodology.<br/>Everything in this book works, the stories, the philosophy of Stoicism, the stories behind the stories and finally the swearing.
 While the title is provocative, the contents are not. The author argues that getting rid of entitlement and other false beliefs will help in getting rid of multiple life miseries. Some chapters are longer than necessary. But quite easy and great read in parts.
 I was recommended this from a Facebook/HS friend. My anxiety of perfection is high, knowing the my perception is never achievable I needed something to tell me it is ok to fail...this book is one of them...many more to come...I am sure. No one can be perfect, there are some skeletons in each persons closet.
 Pretty worthless book...as I kept reading I was wondering if there was anything useful in it, and couldn't find a thing...save your money on this one..
 Perhaps it will cause people to read it who need to. It is classic in its concepts; that we pay too much attention to the trivial and not enough to to important essence of existence:  relationships and meaning in life. A purpose driven life covers the same inform but from a different perspective.
 ...book kinda states the obvious that we all already know – or should know.  No earth shattering information is revealed w/in the covers of this book.
 Irreverent humor, Buddhism, staring into the abyss of death to feel alive, stripping what it means to be alive and human down to its essentials to build it back up again - this book is a life-changer. I was up all night reading it and I'm still pondering its effect on me. What is your legacy? What will continue after you're gone? Can you stare your own death in the face and accept it? Because it's the acceptance of the inevitability of death that gives life its meaning.
 Y'all.  You need this book.  It will change your life.  It's an easy read, funny, and straight to the point.  Most of the "self help" books that I've read, have this fluff that the authors could have said in one sentence instead of an entire chapter.  Manson is very direct, which I really appreciate! I highlt recommend this book.  It will make you rethink the way you do everything in your life.
 This took over TWO weeks to get to me (from NY?) and then I opened it up and it's very, very poor quality...almost like a reprint and nothing like the quality of other copies I've had. The BOOK itself, by Mark Manson, is FANTASTIC, hence my purchasing another copy when I needed one. Would return, but it's not worth the trouble! Disappointed after a long wait! My advice? Get the book...from another seller!
 If you can get past the constant F Bombs (they don't bother me a bit) this book is very thought provoking and real. I love his in your face delivery.  I find myself wishing Disappointment Panda would knock on my door and give me his hard truth! Read it! You won't be sorry that you did!
 This author had the guts to say what so many think. It's a good read but in the end it's another self help book without a solution.  Don't get me wrong, it's all about what you take away and how you re-think your life and he did a great job at pointing that out.  I will keep it on-hand to refer back to periodically.
 Entertaining read...and helpful...but with everything, there needs to be a grain of salt.  The book rings true in a almost every area...but deep meaning and grandpa wisdom from a 30-something can be a little hollow. Overall I would recommend it....it’s an easy read and if you hate it...it looks good on your bookshelf!
 I enjoyed how Mark Manson has a very no-bullshit writing style. However, the contents of the book is not new. If you've read Tony Robbins, Tim Ferriss, or something on stoicism, do not expect to find anything new. Despite that, I did enjoy reading the book and it went by quickly. If you haven't read the authors stated above, this book is an amazing start.
 Honestly I haven't known how to start with this review because I have a lot more to say than I have time for, but you have to get this book. It's funny but cuts right to the point. I got a lot from this book and I think most people would as well.
 The whole world need to read this book. Yes, everyone. I have changed several things in my life, and all for the good. It is well written, thought provoking and Mark serves up a heavy dose of reality, which is why it’s so fabulous. So go, go now and buy this book. You’re welcome.
 This book is so true that it's simply funny.  There are few things that the author told me that I didn't already resolve at this point, but this would have been super-helpful if I were in my early 20s.  But still very funny.
 Really great, entertaining book with a lot of practical advice. This is one of those kinds of books with advice that everyone could use, though it's probably delivered in a way that won't jive with everyone. It's a good read if you need a kick in the pants to change your life for the better.
 Great kick in the ass from Manson to stop thinking so much about what we deserve. To stop caring about all the crap that doesn't matter.<br/><br/>Then, to care and spend our time on the few things that do matter.
 Mark Manson disregards all rules when giving us his take on what he has learned through his journey of life. It is a raw take on what "life" can really be, the ugly truth behind our existence unlike the fairy tale lifestyle we are constantly sold on wanting to obtain. I found myself agreeing with many of the concepts and ideas presented in this story, mainly due to what I believe is the underlying lesson; Life is truly what we make it and by the values we measure ourselves up to. Every person has the power to change their life to fulfill their happiness, however we must first look within ourselves.
 It was a great read that goes over entitlement, which for me was a pretty important chapter. Actually the book as a whole made a pretty profound impact. I was waiting on the bus still ruminating on the contents, and like I said, the entitlement piece really stuck out. I feel that I was entitled to certain experiences as such I never was okay with life. Life was the enemy. Anyway, great read and great investment.
 So glad I finally got hold of a copy. The f-word and swearing put me off from doing so and still do not appeal to me. But I get the point.<br/><br/>In the face of death, life becomes simple, life becomes precious. It's a miracle to be alive and we have a duty to focus and to make it count.<br/><br/>But this is only half of the truth, because some of us cannot die. In the light of life everlasting truth is to be found. There you will find me on the final day.
 This book is such an eye opener for me. I am so happy it was recommended to me, it has made a difference in my thinking and looking at the big picture. Yes he curses a lot but it slows down after the first few chapters.
 Overall, I enjoyed this. Manson felt a bit misogynistic at times, and his constant reminders of his philandering past got a bit stale, but he made some good points.<br/><br/>He almost never claimed to come up with any of the ideas in this book; instead, he took ideas and philosophies from others and put them together in an easy-to-read package. Using personal anecdotes and (shall we say) flavorful language, Manson has taken what he has learned and shared it, in the hopes that not everyone will have to go through the (at times privileged) trial and error he suffered.
 Its entertaining enough. Not as practical as listening to a Gary Vaynerchuk. But it has its good points. Whole thing could have been covered in a couple blogs though.<br/><br/>I had to roll my eyes pretty hard though when he claims to have had a rough childhood all because he once got caught with a dime bag and got super grounded and had to file papers in his fathers office and then, later on and unrelated, his parents got divorced. Boooooo hooooooo. Sounds pretty idyllic to people with actually hard childhoods. He didn't even do time. And then complains about how middle class white people are soft. They are. And he's like the poster child for it.<br/><br/>So if you can stomach that, sure... give it a read.
 the title is a bit misleading, but anyone in the mood for some self-reflection will benefit.
 AMAZING. In my opinion this is a must book for every teenager in the word, before they will get to the real world and face the reality. It immediately became my most go-to book. Totally love its political incorrectness!
 This book is very introductory. I enjoyed it, but many things I already knew. It seemed heavily influenced by Chris Guillebeu’s “The Art of Nonconformity.” However, I could see it really changing my life if I were younger and less exposed to the world.
 read the entire book, the only helpful tip I got from the author was never accept or believe your an expert at anything always stay humble and willing to learn. Dude drops about a million F bombs in this book mixed in with a bunch of random thoughts. With that being said Eckhart Tolle book The Power Of Now provides a more positive outlook on similar issues
 Loved the book; sometimes you need reminders of things that you subconsciously know but just have forgotten and I believe this book does just that. I don’t there is any real ground breaking revelations hidden in the text, but rather a read to refocus yourself and how you live your life. It’s good to be reminded of those things when your life becomes about things that are really not about you.
 I really enjoyed this book. Quick read and easily relatable. I think it could apply to any age group too. It made me think about my own actions and how I can improve the way I approach things, communicate how I feel, be more direct and think about things. It also helps when you are dealing with people that are difficult to get along with, easy to sit back and think and observe instead of reacting all the time. It makes you realize what's important in life. I spent Thanksgiving with family and listened to so many people complaining about the smallest things and it made me realize what an incredible waste of energy that was. It's not what I would consider a life-changing book but definitely worth a look. As far as cursing or anything like that, I did not think it was excessive or offensive. The author is very matter of fact and bottom line. Life 101...
 It is an ok book.<br/>The flagrant over use of ☆*☆* is amusing for the first few paragraphs. After that it just sounds like that annoying drunk at the bar the will not shut up.<br/>Many useful analogies and stories are lost to useless interjections and elementary style writing.<br/>The dust cover makes for an interesting conversation piece; that's about it.
 This book opens up your brain and airs it out, it  undoes some of those knots we have really been working on getting good and tight in civilized society. It goes over aspects of life we are so tangled and wrapped up in and says "Hey,  it's ok, that's actually just life,  congratulations!  You're in pain? You're alive! You're struggling? You're alive!" and then aims for you, the reader, to decide what is important.  Mark Manson gives people blunt and needed perspective on the finality that is life.
 This book was fantastic! I found it to be very helpful while also being hilarious! I also loved the overall message that this book had. You're always going to struggle in life, you just have to find the things that you think are worth struggling for. I loved that this book didn't promote being happy all the time in order to succeed in life. The stories that he shares throughout his book also do a great job of illustrating the logic of his ideas. Overall this is a great book, and I've already recommended that my friends should read this! It's the self-help book that doesn't take itself too seriously.
 This book is a light and airy read, and I was expecting a bit more depth.  Could be my own fault, I guess.  Basically, it's like taking the philosophies of Thic Nhat Hanh (a Zen Buddhist) and making them digestible for those raised in the internet-age.  If you're at all familiar with Buddhism the themes and ideas are very familiar, but the writing style is catered to keep the attention of someone whose only read internet blurbs.  Also, not a fan of the author's numerous attempts at witty humor, which to me fall flat and even make it less readable.
 LOL... I REALLY like this book.  I don't agree 100% with his premise - it's a long book! - but I do agree with most of it, and I love Manson's writing style. It's a keeper.
 Reading this book made me think a lot more than I usually do.  It has put many questions in my head instead of answers.  I can say that this is very much a book that changes lifes, if you think about it enough.  I literally feels like all my values and metrics are in the air and I need to rebuild them.<br/><br/>I recommend this book for anyone who wants to re-evaluate their life and think deeply about how to change.  It is a blunt slap in the face, so you have been warned,  and not for the light hearted.<br/><br/>For everyone else it can be an interesting read and spark a lot of unease.
 Mansion is young and rather callow, despite his extensive travel. That notwithstanding, he is well read and a good writer. I found his philosophy to be practical and helpful and I recommend his book, particularly as an antidote to depression.
 Excellent book. I wish I could’ve read this as a kid not as a senior. This is a seriously sick(good) book
 Pretty easy and a fun read. Really impactful to me. Changes my perspective in life and actually gives me a little bit of peace inside. I will probably read this again to make the concepts sink in more. Definitely buy and read this.
 This book is soo good. Exactly what I needed during this time of my life. It’s filled with humor, curse words, and honesty. This book will definitely teach you something new about yourself. I actually couldn’t put this book down once I started reading and took me about 3 hours to finish it!! :)
 I liked the ease of reading this book. Understanding  the concepts of prioritizing things in the life.  We have choices. And no matter what we choose, we are gonna problems. I think that was the biggest lesson for me. Life is never perfect. We should take the good with the bad. And we shouldn’t skip over the bad just to continue feeling good. It’s amazing how simple the lessons were but how we just never put things in to prospective.
 This book took me a min to read since I get distracted a lot. But I finally finished it and can definitely say with certainty that it’s amazing and quite beneficial! I have bipolar depression and anxiety, I can say this book helped me look at things in a different way and definitely taught me something. Very much recommend it to anyone!
 This book changed my life completely. After reading this, so much of the little stuff I was worried about, I just stopped. Only give f***s about the important things!
 I love this book. It's not arrogant like the title seems, but rather provides many valuable things to consider when leading your life. I think everyone should read this! I even got my boyfriend hooked on it!
 I’m only 72 pages into this book and so far I really am enjoying it . As I was reading I realized something strange .. I was reading a few pages that I had already read ?? This book skipped ahead and then repeats previous part of book - see pic
 Zen for the masses. Cleverly wrapped in foul language and real life antidotes. I had already incorporated some of the content into my own life and it was nice to see it pulled together in this anti-self help book.
 Get the “Summary of the Subtle art of not giving a f*ck”.  Great time saver and gives you the salient points in 1/10 the time
 Unwavering voice of truth, even at the expense of being unpopular. This take on life was much appreciated. Will have me thinking and rethinking for years to come.
 The main point of the book is that life has periods of adversity. Some of it is caused by your bad choices and some of the adversity is caused by things beyond your control. We should learn to accept that there will be periods of adversity and to learn from surviving them to be better prepared for future adversity.
 This is a life changing book if you let it be. It crystallizes everything readers look for in a self help book. How did I never hear of this guy before. Forget your search for happiness and embrace your......oh no read the f'ing book and find out.
 Oh man- what a great book!  It's like amazing, actually.  It's as effective as a great therapy session.  I love his perspective and the pearls of wisdom amidst a sea of "F" Bombs.  This is the last self help book you will ever need and your life will improve as a result.  My best find of 2016.
 In the whole crazy, self-absorbed world we live in, only Mark Manson has had the guts to tell us the truth about life's inevitability and how we come to terms with that reality while realizing that we aren't the center of the universe, but we're still very special.
 This book really dissects what we feel are life’s biggest problems into simple decisions of what matters vs. what doesn’t. I was definitely in a low point of my life when I read it and I’m not saying this is my saving grace but it did really make me think about life differently. It’s a great book, a quick read and I recommend it to anyone who needs to take a step back from life and re-evaluate their priorities. Great job.
 I absolutely love the majority of the points made in this book. Some I disagree with, but I don't care. Reason for taking away a star is it's incredibly redundant. Felt like the author was trying to thicken the book. All the points could have been made in a few chapters or so.
 I alternately laughed and cried through the whole thing. Lots of life's lessons and his tribute to is friend Josh was beautiful in that it really did change his life and put things into a life changing perspective that helped him truly live.
 I really enjoyed this book it really helped me to see how much crap we hold onto from our childhood and throughout our adult lifes.  The lies and self fulfilled prophecies we hold onto that mishaps our views and decisions in life.  But more importantly, just how  much of it really doesn't mean s***.  Thank you for giving me new insights and perspective.
 Best most worthwhile read in a long time, speaks most directly to the modern condition.  Do not be misled by the provocative language, the book is full of deep transformative insights and a great deal of philosophy (stoic I think).  If you are a reflective peeson, it is well worth your time and also easy pleasant to read.
 I thought it was going to be funny but it’s really stupid. The author tries hard to be clever and witty but falls so short. The theme good and done before...don’t sweat the small stuff basically. I fell for it because if the edgy title, was in a mood that day but I regret it.
 Easy to read<br/>Deep messages<br/>Good overall<br/>Will re-read<br/>:)<br/>Had read the original article from his blog some time ago
 The books starts as if it were written by Bender from Futurama but proceeds to offer a surprisingly refreshing, clear and useful insight into human nature and how we can make the most of it.  I despise self help books, but this one offered surprising depth and honesty that allowed me to enjoy it cover to cover.
 Once you get past the first few pages filled with the gratuitous use of the F word (I get it already!) the rest of the book is a thoughtful journey toward a personal paradigm shift.
 Perhaps I am on a high having just read this book. Still, I do not say this lightly.  While there are many nuggets people may be already probably aware of, this book should be required reading for every human being on the planet. I will not add any more hyperbolic language. A book summary coming soon. I want to write a summary so I don’t forget the key take away of which there are many. Chapter titled “You are not special”, pages 171 through 179 on relationships, and end of the book that talks about human mortality are some of the gems that everyone should read.
 I will be pondering points from this book for a while. Mark articulates concepts and ideas that I imagine most of us considered but never put together as a group. This will require many rereadings.
 A lot of very helpful advice in this book.  A lot of it is tongue in cheek, but at the same time, a lot of good advice about how to find what really matters most in life and how to choose the things you really care the most about . . . the things that are right for you and will help you grow and be fulfilled.
 Awesome book to read! Great as I expected.
 I found this book quite refreshing from other "Live your Best Life" books that are flowery and fluffy.  This no-nonsense approach is written in very plain, basic language that doesn't sugar-coat anything and is very "real".  The anecdotes within the book help to get the point across while keeping the reader focused, and are pulled from sources of successful people in the given field rather than obscure references.  Well worth the read, extremely valuable to implement.
 All I can say is that this book really opened my eyes to things that I already knew about myself, but that I now know are okay to want to change about myself without feeling guilty about it. Thank you Mr.Manson. My husband and I both read your book and we really enjoyed it. Please do keep writing.
 The author has some good advice.  This book won't solve all of your problems but he does provide his perspective and some good ideas that if followed would help.  As always, the hard part is following through on implementing the advice.
 Just finished it last night.  Quick read for anyone looking for a self help book, a funny read, or simply passing time with meaningful text.  I'd recommend this book to anyone in their 20-30s and especially to someone working on themselves.
 fantastic audio book. Author voice and narration was done to perfections. It's a shame I have already finished listening to the book (twice)
 What a refreshing look at determining which values serve you and which don’t. There is profanity and sarcasm and irony, the kind that you say in your head but maybe not out loud. That worked for me.
 An interesting examination into how we choose what to value and what not to value. The book touches on everything from everyday choices to work, relationships, and death. By the end of this book you'll likely be a bit more skilled at figuring out what's really important in life.
 The book basically highlights practices and thoughts that we all know but don't do. It open my eyes to things i could do better to improvement my life and relationships. It makes for a good read and the audio book is pretty good as well.
 The swearing initially threw me a bit lol...but it is a really good relatable read; points were outined and discussed well and author's experience were shared to illustrate them. Don't underestimate this book just because the Title sounds like it might be for light entertainment
 I absolutely love this book. It’s definitely one of my favorites. If you’re having trouble with stress in your life, this is definitely what you need
 This book has lots of good advice and it's definitely funny as a gift but I feel like the author repeats himself quite a bit the book probably be half as long and still contain the same amount of information
 My only quibbles with this outside outstanding work are with the authors conception of how a relationship can function  as a healthy partnership and needing an overarching purpose for a good life. Those minor items aside, I will be spending a lot of time thinking over this work.
 In the beginning, I wasn’t certain if this was going to be a good read for me. Some of the statements seemed to not be aligned with my way of valuing life. But, stick with it because Mark really gets deep into how we look at life. As I age (almost 40) and my kids all approach adulthood, I am amazed at how much I have changed over the years. With each passing chapter, I learned ways to rethink how I see and interact with the World around me. The hardest being able to confront my own fears in order to truly live free and happy.
 When comparing to other self help books, Ranson does not deliver with the logistics of actually how to do what he writes, but he provides great points about life and what truly is important and how to measure there importance. As I write this I am starting to read the book again which will be my first time ever doing so because I believe his wealth of info is worth reading twice over.
 Liked this book a lot. I do enjoy hearing real life scenarios of success and failure.  I think if I read this before I read "unfuck yourself" I would have given it 5 stars but I really liked Unf*ck Yourself a bit better.  overall, I enjoyed it, especially the first 3 chapters, and will read again.
 I was really looking forward to reading this...but it just says the same thing over and over again. I would not recommend.
 Good lord, if we all lived like this the world would be an awful place! I tried to like it, I really did! I read it with a friend for a book group. Not one of us made it through. We all decided that the author sounds like the kind of person we all strive to avoid and remove from our lives. If his version of happiness depends on us all being self-service asses then I'm not interested in his version of happiness. Save your money, here's the gist of it...  grab what you want, forget how it makes anyone around you feel, sue when you want, have a beer and move on.  Not the way I want to live, and quite possible exactly what is wrong with the world right now.
 Very interesting book with a different premise than most "self-help" books. Contains some humorous passages and decent advice to boot. I would recommend reading this book to a friend.
 I am not sure if I understood it. Most things seems arbitrary - especially things we should care about.<br/>Author seems contradicting himself from time to time as well. I disagree with him about motivation. Action drives change in how you see yourself no the other way around - at least in most cases.
 Loved this book. Great advice and was a quick read! Couldn’t put it down! It’s a great book to help you realign your values in life and makes you think about what you should really put your time and effort into caring about and what you shouldn’t fret and waste your time on.
 Highly recommend reading this book to anyone. Mark does a great job in breaking his concepts down on how to focus more on the things that really matter. His personal stories and those of others he mentions brings this book to life and resonates with your own life’s trials and tribulations. Great F’n book.
 I good book. The title is eye catching, but the costant f bombs were almost enough to make me stop reading it. Which would have been sad because it really expresses how I feel with out quite so many  "f" words.
 Had a hard time chopping through this one, still not finished. First chapter full of 'F bombs' , I use those myself sometimes, this was a bit much. Also, couldn't come to grips from taking advice from a Blogger, Dr. of Psychiatry , etc. might be more acceptable.<br/>Frank H
 I usually don't reach books much these days, but as soon as I saw this book, I had to have it. The title really struck a chord with me. I read this book in about a week which is unusual for me because I have a limited attention span. The first half of the book really affected me. The book made me reexamine my life/values, and now I feel more inspired to live a better life the way I want.
 Really enjoyed this. Straight to the point. Really enjoyed the section on taking responsibility for your own problems. Enjoyed how many times the f word is used. Hehe. Just felt it started to stray a little bit towards the end but other then that it was good.
 Only parts of this book were of significance to me. It's easy to understand and comprehend however many of the topics are already known to the reader. I wouldn't recommend it to friends and family.
 I loved this quick read! It really gives you a way to form a different perspective on worries and the like, but it's written in a very personable and funny way. I would really recommend it!
 This is one of the best books I've ever read about living your life and understanding this crazy world. I love this author's style of writing, I was hooked from the first page. Before reading the second chapter, I went back with my pencil to the first chapter to highlight his passages that I want to remember and want to refer to when I need to. What an amazing guy this Mark Manson is!!!  I am so enjoying his book. Thank you Mark for helping me finally accept some things I've worried about that weren't all that important.
 I took this book along to read in hospital when I went to detox. The hospital took it away from me and has lost it and I am peniless so don’t have the money to replace this important book that came highly recommended by my therapist Dawn Pappas
 Didn't really understand why everyone has recommended this book so much. If I had not paid $15 for a copy, I would have given up. This one just really didn't do it for me. ...and this is coming from a guy who really enjoyed the author's first book.
 Nothing particularly new here...unless you're really young. After age 60, not giving a f*** becomes second nature.
 Good book. Funny, light-hearted, and some good advice. Explains a lot about why we beat ourselves up about some things and offers suggestions to avoid being so hard on ourselves.
 Written poorly with pots of profanity. Not much in this book that’s informative.
 Bought this to celebrate my recent anger at Washington, and was surprised to read how to manage the frustration, but also be justified in my very thoughts going through my head. Bizarrely calming read, laughter is truly the best medicine.
 As someone who suffers from debilitating anxiety and depression, this is something that I needed to hear.  I need to choose my f***s wisely. I was in tears reading the last few pages. This book should be required reading in high school when peer pressure and bullying are at their worst.
 I recommend this book to anyone who wishes for a better understanding of themselves. The language may put some off, but serves the attitude of the work.This is a self help book that actually helps.
 This has been one of the most enjoyable books I've read in a while. I love self improvement reads, but nothing compares to Masons inspiring in-your-face reality checks. Hearing the truth has never felt so good! It's about time someone says it, and says it right.
 Highly recommend this book. It’s an easy read from a down to earth author. This is not a self help book, but I might say a self awareness book.<br/><br/>There are plenty of areas where anyone could relate and be in the writers shoes. Fully enjoyed turning the wheels in my head while reading.
 I have read hundreds of self help books over the years and this one trumps them all! It's true the book contains some very helpful advice on how to be a happier person. But what's more the book is actually fun to read! I can't say enough good things about this book. PS this is the first review I've felt compelled to write. That's a telling sign.
 Author has a unique view on life and it makes sense. No meanness. Not really a self help book as much as a<br/>philosophy on life. Valuable insights for a younger writer. Congratulations.
 This book is brilliant! Simple, refreshing, no-spin approach. Reading this book convinced me to consider the possibility that maybe sometimes I am the problem. Just merely considering the possibility creates a shift in my thinking and breaks me out of that closed-minded mentality. This book is s great read whether or not you think you need it because even if you don't,  I promise you will know someone who does!
 This is an excellent read.  Many of the lessons have been given in various forms, but the delivery is so relatable and internalizing.  This book has stuck with me for months and I have bought it for others.  Take a chance like I did and maybe your outlook on life will positively change as mine has!
 An interesting book with a collection of ideas. It seemed repetitive at times but it had some interesting topics. I skimmed through it in about an hour
 I am 72 and my 46 year old son mentioned Mark Manson in one of his Instagram posts. I Googled his name, ordered the book, signed up for his blog, and enjoy his enlightened musings every morning with a cup of coffee. I've given the book as a gift and suggested it to many. I look forward to "my time with Mark" every day!
 This book changed my life.  It's helped me re-wire my brain to figure out how to achieve actual happiness instead of chasing temporary relief from my problems.<br/>My only complaint is that I had to order 3 of these books to receive a new one. I did not order used but the first 2 I received were visibly used and damaged.
 This book has been so enlightening to me. It says the things that no one else has or at least maybe its from a view that isn't as offensive. I originally borrowed this book but had to buy it so I could share it with friends.
 The book is spot on.  Really enjoyed the stories and brutal honesty. Not for the faint of heart. Read at your in risk.  You just might find out something about yourself.
 Gives you a mental path to find what is really important, and  allows you to see that some of what you thought was important, well, isn’t. You will learn some not so nice things about yourself too so get ready for that.  Makes you think about what it’s really like to be alive.
 Not anything that wasn't already known.
 I really enjoyed this book. It’s always interesting to see someone’s perspective on life and this guy has a logical way in explaining how you can improve. As with any self-improvement book, you need to put aside your pride to get anything out of it. Quick and easy read. I may read again to take notes on the points that struck me the most. Some lessons I had already learned but they were reiterated. Some parts of the book made me aware of things I may be doing without realizing. Self awareness is an important part of growing.
 Originally, I was going to be quirky and give it 1-star as tribute to not giving a single (expletive)... but that may have confused a lot of people.<br/><br/>So buy it.  Or don't.  I don't care.
 I don't give a s*** if you read it or not, but if your reading the reviews you probably could use the information in this book.
 I loved this book. It really makes you look at the way you react to things and makes you think about things from a different perspective. It is such a fun easy read and keeps you entertained!! There's nothing else I can say about this other than every single person should read this!!!
 Good read with a ton of common sense ideas. A reader should  not be bored if their goal is to expand their thought processes and lives to higher levels with more meaning.
 At first, frank and straightforward words and thoughts make me wonder if this book is going be worth my time but as you read on, you realise the greatness of the points, thoughts and ideas presented and you cannot stop reading until finished. A must-read for anyone who wants to take responsibility for their actions and accept their imperfections, only that way the door opens to opportunities and to improving oneself. Negative feelings and setbacks actually are required to be able to change towards the positive. As the saying goes, "dissatisfaction is the first step towards progress." Begin with yourself first and change your expectations of life. Don't expect the world to change, it's you that needs to change.
 . I would recommend this book to anyone who may be doing some soul searching in this chaotic, beautiful life. I just lost my mom and needed to be reminded how to embrace each day and actually live, rather than simply exist.
 My life journey continues... now with an improved map and travel guide.  Thanks for the insights given in this book to help me see where I had been doing it right and where I had been missing the mark.  Highly recommended.  I will read it again in a few weeks.
 This might be one of the best self development books I've ever read. Despite the title, Manson doesn't advocate not caring. He simply he suggests you change how you mentally evaluate events and situations. The problem, he suggests, is in the way you look at things, not the things themselves.
 As the title suggests, this is not a book for everyone. But for those seeking a less-traveled road to finding meaning by actually simplifying, embracing your choices, and caring more for what really matters, this is a must read.
 A little repetitive at times but that's just because he clearly wants you to get the point. I have already used a few of the lessons in this book to improve my life and I read it just one week ago!
 I don't really read self help books, but this one was written in a way that I could relate to.  It wasn't full of " if you think good thoughts, good things will happen" type of advice you usually get.  It allowed me to look at things from a different point of view.
 If you have been reading 'self help' books for awhile...This one sums them all up with satire, humor and serious intelligence. He combines his personal stories with other life instructing philosophies into a clear, accessible, real world style that you can apply immediately if you are ready and honest with yourself. He manages to elevate the f word into a useful tool that can help you confidently and decisively get to what truly matters and provides ultimate meaning in your life. Highly recommend.
 Absolutely loved the candid, bold and honesty of the book. It was truly better than I expected. I even purchased a copy for my son whose about to graduate from college. The life lessons will definitely benefit him. Enjoy!
 There's a lot to be learned in this book, drawing from his own personal experience, human psychology, and a dash of philosophical consideration here and there, Mark Manson has wrote a collection of stories and lessons that run counter to most of our modern conceptions of ourselves, others, and the world around us. This book will confront you with some really tough facts about life, and the self-defeating ways most people conceptualize their lives (and what we can do instead). Recommended for anyone interested in taking control of their own life and their own mind.
 I love how Manson shares his views and thoughts on the art of living. The wisdoms he share are garnered from his personal experiences, making it extremely relatable. Moreover, he has a very captivating and charming style of writing. I couldn’t help the occasional chuckle while reading it due to his way of explaining complex concepts in a very simple and funny way. This book gives remarkable insight on life from a very human point of view, therefore, I believe it will be suitable for people of all ages. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it!
 Gave this to one of my adult kids and she is really getting into and wants me to read it after. She shares many of the points and I gather the practices are some old school proven.
 This book was an OK read.  What was missing for me - writing was a little wandering (lack of direction) and about half way through felt it was going nowhere. Glad I read it.  Appreciated the perspective of author, but lacked a depth.
 I read Marc's blog and appreciate his no nonsense, counterintuitive and entertaining style. This book delivers more of the same. While it's a bit of a rehash of many of the topics and themes from his blog, it's sufficiently different to make it worth the read. Also, the concepts are expanded and woven together in a way that made a real impact on my thinking and life. A solid effort that's enjoyable and practical. Bravo Mark.
 Manson is smart and insightful.  The book is easy to read and meaningful. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in getting past our petty ego distractions.
 This book should be read by every teenager. Also every adult male or female can benefit from the words on these pages. I found Mark's work to be common sense, insightful and funny at times. I recommend this book and I will probably read it again.
 I wish I could put into words how amazing this book is. Even the most put-together people could benefit from this read. It has definitely cause me to reevaluate every aspect of my life including my thought processes. Too bad they could not make this part of High School curriculum as I believe that it could greatly benefit society as a whole. The things that I have learned in this book will stick with me for the rest of my life. And yes, I will die.
 Not particularly well written but the message is solid. It helped me view my problems differently, setting me in the right direction to recover from a break up and some mild depression.
 I really enjoyed the first chapters, but somewhere down the middle of the book it loses its focus and at some point it looks like a life guiding book (which maybe its the purpose of the book)
 I usually don’t do this but I will say this book was so much different from usual self help books...often times I had to put this book down and think about the concepts...this book made me take action to make my life better instead of memorizing a bunch of mantras to be more happy...I enjoyed it and will read it again
 This is one of the most profound, life-changing and fun books I have ever read. Have already introduced the book to my team, my wife and the majority of my clients. This book is a must.
 Great read if you can get past the first few pages full of the “f” word. The author gives some sound advice, some of which I read to my teenagers (chapter 2) when he talks about goals and the struggles to get there and “how bad do you want it?”
 Probably would not read this book again or recommend it. I thought it would have more ideas that were unconventional but it is very similar to the rest of the current common genre books other there.
 Thanks to someone for giving a fk about writing a book like a true friend would talk to you with beer in hand by the side of a pool (or a railway station). Thoroughly enjoyed this one!
 Finished this book in less than the span of day. Riveting, amazing, thought provoking, gut wrenching. Phenomenal work. I will absolutely recommend this to everyone and anyone.
 Everyone needs to read this book and start focusing on the things in life that actually matter. The first 100 pages or so really make the point.
 Great reminder to pick the few things you really care about and focus on those. The rest - let it go. If you don't like the signature word in the book title, then this book is not for you. It is used a lot - perhaps too often.
 Didn't like it at first, kept reading a couple of pages at a time. But when i reached the last chapter, wow what an excellent eye opener. Its like someone opened a window to a complete new view on life. I will read it again for sure.
 This is a wonderful book that gets straight to the point with no overly psychoanalytical wording. Instead the language is used like a blunt instrument to get you to snap out of it, pay attention to the BS you are doing, stop it, fix it and move on with a fresh perspective and deeper appreciation of life.
 Great for teenagers.
 I  couldn’t put this book down. I found myself learning about history therefore not just feeling like a self-help book. I would recommend. I have also highlighted some pages to re-read later. Helps you understand to not so be so self-critical.
 Every year I try to read one business-related book, something to help me focus on the year ahead- I rarely finish them.  This book was different, I finished it and highlighted a ton of useful information that I'm utilizing with my current job.  I highly recommend this book, it's realistic and not full of a bunch of crap.  Well worth the purchase.
 A surprisingly refreshing assessment of life and an uncanny ability to express the little things in life and to make connections where most would've missed them.<br/>Not for the faint,  but definitely a valuable read.
 I was going to give this as a gift to my friends from school but then I flipped through the book and was hesitant from even just the chapter titles. I know I would have been fine from the book, but I do not know how other people would react.
 An amazing book . I feel like now I can begin to live. Thanks Lt J for recommending this book.
 I especially love the 3rd disc. Great for keeping things in perspective. When I am blue or unmotivated or feeling defeated or sensitive to others, I listen to this.
 One of the very few books on my "everyone must read these at least once in their lifetime" list! Simply amazing! I had read Models before but this book takes Mark Manson up there with Tim Ferris and I can't thank him enough for the inspiration in this book. I also enjoyed the humor very much.
 Excellent book. A different but effective slant on having a good life without getting too bogged down with the stress of every little thing you don't like or that bothers you.
 Interesting and different approach that gets real about struggles with happiness, using comparisons and anecdotes to hit home with various points. Tongue in cheek approach makes it fun to read and Manson uses his own first hand stories to make him easy to relate to. Reading it is like talking to an old college friend about the reality of “adulting” in the modern day world. Decent read.
 I love this book!  It is very vulgar, but I think that's part of the point, don't let yourself get hung up on little things that bother you when it really doesn't matter.  This is one of my favorite books for sure.
 There is lots of swearing but I enjoyed reading this book. I like the message where people are responsible for their emotions, something a lot of people don't understand.
 A great read, fun and occasionally a little confronting maybe.  MAnson walks the delicate line between being direct and having a rant and only sporadically crosses it :) Easy reading
 Mark keeps the reader moving forward with interesting stories and a refreshingly casual and potty mouthed style, all the while dropping deep “meaning of life” bombs. From a meaning of existence standpoint nothing new was covered; the book is just just a good reminder to have the courage to face your fears and pursue what matters.
 Thought provoking yet funny. Easy read that will make you question much of what you know. Recommend to anyone regardless of your place in life.
 Reads like a good friend explaining how to make life more meaningful in terms that are easy to relate to and hard to put down. Excellent for anyone interested in reconfiguring your own values and compass for how to move forward without all the baggage. Should be required for millenials graduating into adulthood.
 This is probably one of the first books I have actually started to read cover to cover. I never found an interest in reading until I started to read this book. As cheesy as it sounds, I cannot put it down. The informal and nontraditional conversationalist approach he takes when writing really breaks the fourth wall and it feels as if he is saying everything to your face. This is stuff we all need to hear/see. If you are on the fence about buying it, just do it. I promise it's worth the buy.
 Not an extraordinary book, but definitely worth the read - he says a lot of which we already know but fail to accept these days. This book is the truth you don’t want to hear, but need to hear. If ya care about something so much, ya care and there’s really nothing that can change that, but this book at least helps you put things into your own perspective &amp; divert your energy into the things that matter to you in the present which you have control over. 100% recommend!
 While crude in its language, this book hits the hard lessons of life with an irreverent tone and very relevant wisdom.  A short read, and not necessarily a revelation in terms of the ideas behind it, the book conveys timeless truths in a way modern readers and pop culture enthusiasts will appreciate.
 The author’s conversational tone made me feel like I was talking to a friend, who cared enough about me to tell me the truth about myself, even if it hurt my feelings. The truths in this book are liberating. The explanations for the counterintuitive approach are clear and concrete. The author shares personal anecdotes to help solidify his assertions. Well written!
 This is a great book, telling things as they are. People of any age can relate to it. I would put it right up there along with Dale Carnegie and Stephen Covey.
 This book came along for me at exactly the right time. I just left my job and was going through a bit of a crisis. The philosophy expressed in this volume is good medicine, and very practical. Highly recommended.
 It might be a good book for people who worry too much about everything and are suffering from that. This book might give you some new perspectives to reduce the burden you put on yourself. However, for someone like me starting out their career, this might not be the best book. You should try not to make excuses for yourself and strive to perform to your peak capabilities.
 Consider this book required reading. After finishing this book you will feel the words resonate within you for eternity. Thank you Mark.<br/><br/>I will pass this gift of knowledge on to anyone who will listen.
 Once past the first chapter, the book defines itself, and presents good examples, of its points.<br/>I am prefferring it over Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance.
 The F bombs were running amuck. But got used to it. The language shouldn’t be a surprise considering the title. There were some worthwhile thoughts. Sometimes pretty funny.
 lot of self_centered, foul language narcissism.  Instead, I found this book to be eye-opening and has given me a new way of looking at my issues and life in general.  The obsession with "positive thinking" in our culture can be  very frustrating to those dealing with severe depression and difficult life situations.  This book brings hope and a totally new perspective!!  Highly recommend this book!!<br/>E
 I’m a big fan of this book. I have read it several times now.<br/><br/>I think the title is a bit misleading.  The author isn’t saying that you should not care about anything.  He points out that you can learn to prioritize what you care about.
 Great for the person who is very self conscious and spends their time trying not to hurt other peoples feeling.  Good review of what to prioritize and what to let go.
 However, I loved it. Although I knew a few of the concepts because I am 52 years old, I gained some new insight to myself and the world around me. Thank you, Mark, for writing such a interesting and thought-provoking book.
 I almost didn't read this book because the title gives a false impression of Mark Manson's true message. While reading chapter one, with the "f-bomb" in almost every sentence, I decided that if the book continued that way, I'd give up on it. Beginning with chapter two, Manson had pretty well gotten most of the expletive repetition out of his system, and continued on with keen observations based mostly on his own life, often written with humor, but offering truths worth thinking about for anyone interested in living a satisfying and honest life. The title may imply that one shouldn't "care" about anything, but that impression if furthest from the true message, which in a nut shell is - "choose carefully that which you care about and discard the rest", or put another way, "choose your battles wisely".
 The whole book is composed of thoughts of a smart man, the author. Those thoughts stemmed from various experiences, happy and sad moments, good times and bad times, success and failures and so on of the author. The thoughts and experiences seem to be honest and that alone makes this book valuable. Any reader may contradict with what the author says in various places which I think is fine. What is important is the truth and honesty. In other words the genuineness of the author makes the book worth reading. Thanks Mark.
 The writing is simple yet smart entertaining and insightful.  This is not another dry sell / motivation book but a set of well told stories that support the writers philosophy.
 what I got from this book is that it's just an opinion. the author's opinion, but to be frank I really like it and I learned from it. if you read the title then you know what the core message is.
 Great book!  Don’t let the title stop you from buying this book. It is the book you would expect Wayne Dyer to write but couldn’t because being that transparent would work with a mor conservative reader.
 Read this! Whether for laughs or its message or both, he's a wonderful writer with a great perspective on life.  Reinforces critical thinking skills: namely what to think about and focus your energy on, rather than letting others ambush and select for you.
 The book is a good read, while I get the shock factor of the profanity, it would have been a good read without it.
 This book was real and to the point. There is a ton of profanity, so if that offends you, probably not the best choice. After reading this, my viewpoint about work and how I find happiness has truly changed for the better. Now I think about whether I can afford to give an ef before stressing out.
 A friend recommended me this book and after reading the whole book, I am speeches! This is an interning book with a lot of  profanity, but what the author says in this book is really what reflects on our daily life’s!
 So far, the book is good. I bought the book in November (along with a few others) to read after an upcoming surgery at the end of January since I would be laid up for awhile. And when near the end of the book I see that pages 169 to 172 are completely missing from the book. The book did come wrapped in plastic wrap and it was bought new. But because I waited to read it until after my surgery I have missed the cut off date for returns so I am unable to exchange it.....bummer!!!! 😕
 Purchased it for a friend and ended up breezing through it myself in two sittings. Once you get past the overabundance of f-bombs in the first 50 pages or so, there are a lot of simple but spot-on life lessons in here to reflect on and learn from. I kept the book I ordered for my friend (so I can refer back to it), and bought another as the gift!
 Sad that common sense isn’t common sense anymore. Fun read and I enjoyed it. Now the running joke I have is that “I give zero F@&amp;*s about...” Enjoy!
 I love this book. It really changed my approach to how I see life, goals, etc.  Other metaphysical and positive thinking books are great, but I found that the motivation didn't last or I had all this information that I didn't use.  This explained things in a very practical, modern life approach.  No one had ever asked me "What kind of pain do you want in life?"  It really put things into perspective for me. Definitely a must read.
 Excellent book with some tremendous life wisdom, lessons and guidance, delivered in a witty format that displays beautifully the point it often makes: by caring too much what other people think, we unwittingly participate in a conspiracy of life-long dishonesty.  I highly, highly recommend this book!!!
 I have now bought this book for my friends and family.  An updated version of chicken soup.  Delightful and informative.  Easy to digest and you will see a little bit of everyone you know in this book.
 This is a good book for a young, twenties-thirties person who deals with frustration from outside influences, however, mature people like myself have already gotten the issues settled in our minds. The message is good.
 It was a little but hard for me to figure out what the author was saying at the beginning, but it really turned around to be a great book with some great wisdom I think we all need.
 Well, I'm over 70 years of age and found this book to be a treasure in my short life. As usual, when you find a treasure as valuable as this book, you wish you would of found it sooner. But then you realize because of what this book teaches you, you have been blessed that you found it at all.
 Have now read this book 3 times in 6 months.  What a great writer Mr Manson is.  The number of aha moments I have had with this book surpass all the others put together.
 The book helped me to look at my personal values and everyday behavior from a new perspective, besides it is well written. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in self development.
 This book is a different perspective on how to take events and things in your life.  I recommend it for anyone that is looking for a different view or looking for a better way to take negative events that occur in your life.
 I love this book and will come back to it over the years. He reaffirms a lot of ideas I have been striving to implement in my life over the years. I wish he made a clean version for adolescents to read.
 Great book! it is very straight forward and to the point. It curses a lot but in a very humorous way. It talks about how you should not sweat the small stuff and always look at the big picture. It is a great book for people who always worry and stress about the little things, i would highly recommend it. I read the book in 3 days and was hooked after the first few pages.
 Overrated and not worth the read.
 Been following this guy since he made the blog article (which is the same exact title of this book) and I can't appreciate this book enough and the timing especially now in my life. It's a great read regardless, and definitely on my, read once in your lifetime list.
 Not eye-opening, not unexpected, just a different perspective on life and the approach to it. I would recommend it as a person who tries to enlighten oneself.
 Personally, I enjoy this book and it helps me when I am having a rough day. It basically gives you permission to stop being a doormat. As a former doormat, I need reaffirmation alot right now and this book does it.
 I loved how his use of profanity somehow made his psychological and philosophical musings more accessible.  Practical yet abstract.  Thoughtful yet carefree.
 He writes and interesting perspective on human behavior,  and although it was difficult at first to go through all those F===ks, I was glad I read it.
 As someone who suffers from bipolar depression and anxiety, you can imagine how many self help books others have recommended for me in lieu of resulting to medication or expensive therapy. None of them seemed to speak to me the way this one did. Mark does an amazing job of "keeping it real" and blunt by telling us what we need to hear even though we may not want to listen. He uses his personal life experiences (along with some good profanity) to make his points.
 A friend of mine suggested I read it saying it reminded him of me. I skimmed the first pages and never looked back. I have since recommended it to everyone I know. Great read. Great reality check.
 One of the best books I've read in a long time.<br/>A must read for anyone who just wants to make a small change in their thinking with BIG results
 Note: my initial review of this book was not accepted by Amazon. I'm assuming it is because I use the exact same four letter spelling as in the title of the book. In other words I actually can't use the title of the book in a review of the book or a word that's in the title of the book in a review of the book. Okay let me try again substituting "darn".  Strange policy. That's what happens when you use an algorithm instead of human thought.<br/><br/>I'm giving this book 5 stars somewhat reluctantly. At times it was difficult to keep going as some of the author's writing seems to be over the top advice I've heard before. There actually is not much new in this book, however it reminds one of what one already knows in a rather different manner than one usually finds in self-help books. The main advice one finds in this book is to focus on what matters and not give a "darn" about the rest.<br/><br/>On page 208 I found this quote:<br/><br/>"You too are going to die, and that's because you too were fortunate enough to have lived."<br/><br/>I think I'm going to paste that on my wall as a reminder to keep things in perspective. Most of the things we give a "darn" about are trivial in comparison.
 A very easy to read and funny book that emphasizes getting your priorities in line as well as not having so many of them. I plan to read this book again in a couple years. The subject matter is just something I would like to be reminded of from time to time.
 Not an uncommon concept amongst those who commonly confront extraordinary risk and danger, mental and/or physical, or have done so in the past.  A good reminder for those as me who may have lost the clarity the concept brings to life.
 Personally, the first half of the book encompasses a lot of what I already knew but just wouldn't accept. The truth is often times hard to swallow. The second half hit me like a ton of bricks since it felt like it was directed at me. Great book. I have 3 copies and have gifted them to friends.<br/><br/>I recommend this book to basically everyone. There is a theme in todays world that has a "poor me" mentality and it kills our ability to progress as human beings and as a world as a whole.
 What a great read for a type A, overthinking, goon like myself. Just offering some great steps to see the big picture and not caring so much about everything.
 Things that you would tell yourself but seldom follow or feel guilty after a couple of days. The book reiterates the same. Its real talk and I loved it!
 Enjoyed this book very much. Mark Manson writes well, cusses a lot, but its all in jest. The life lessons he expounds in this book are very well worth reading and learning about. I can see why this book made it all the way to #1 on the BestSeller List...
 Ordered one for myself and like it so much so far I ordered another one to give as a gift to a like-minded soul.  An entertaining take on not taking life so seriously.
 Simple, better than most self help books. Just keep in mind that you are going to die, and so is everyone else. It sounds  depressing, but it is not. Read and find out.
 So much of a day gets lost in minutia where squirrels run rampant across our brainwaves and command attention.  This is why this book is the squirrel hunter for me.  Focusing on what matters and the new problems that are possible, creates an awareness  for which I was searching.
 I’ve read this book twice and will go back and read it again. I feel like I can’t reinforce the ideals and message from this book to myself enough. It is like I knew everything he was telling me, and yet I had no clue how to make sense of it all (or make it work for me). Slowly but surely, I’m taking that journey...focusing more on what matters, and caring less about what doesn’t.
 This book is EVERYTHING ! This book is a quick check to your value system, causing you to question everything you do and WHY you are honestly doing it. A must read for anyone over the age of 16.
 When a client said, Don, you should buy this audio book, it really helped me put things in proper perspective, I did exactly that. If you're going thru a tough time, either professionally or personally this might help you break the cycle.
 I loved this amazing book and found it enlightening i would suggest everyone read it at least once for not more
 Bought this book a while back and only got the chance to finish it while on vacation. Should have not put it down the first time I picked it up. The writing is light while pointing out some major pitfalls of modern society and even though it will might take me some time to fully grasp the concepts presented here, I'm glad I came across them. It's definitely an interesting way of looking at every day life, one which I've never really entertained. Will surely recommend it
 this book completely fell apart as i opened it. all the pages are fine, but the binding just came right off. there were also weird stains on the cover? it looks like some kind of coating that began to wear off but still, i expected a better quality of this book when i bought it
 It's a bit vulgar in language. But The narrative is amazing. Just don't let yourself get offended. I haven't finished it yet. I'm taking my time to absorb the hard hitting facts in the book and relating them into real life experiences. So far it's a great read.😉
 Boring to me I returned it!
 It all started on the toilet...Actually a great read. Yes it sounds like a joke book for the bathroom or coffee table but if you actually read it, it is a good reality check of a different way of looking at life. It really is a great bathroom book!!
 Hilarious and so true! 100% agreed with entire book except last chapter about relationships - it’s obvious he doesn’t have kids yet and is very young. Probably been married 2 years or less when he wrote this.
 It is truly a mystery why this is a number one best seller. There are a few useful ideas but anyone who relies on this<br/>obnoxious 30 something year old egomaniac to improve his or her life is really grasping at straws. Don't waste your time<br/>reading this book.
 I was brought to this book by Youtuber Bryant Chambers, who is a life coach and Myer Briggs analyst.  He recommended this book for INFP's (introverted, intuitive, feeler, perceivers), but I think this book is good for anyone who feels they have to compromise their values in public life, or for people who are high in trait agreeableness. I had a lot of laughs and aha moments while reading. I highly recommend this book to people who give too many f***s and know it!
 My daughter suggested reading this book. I'm one of those people who worries about everything. This book helped me laugh, and see that life is short and I'm making too big a deal of things.
 This book is a great read and it helps navigate life's problems in a healthy way. Not everybody has people around them to give good advice about life so this book is very helpful.
 This is a book that I will read over and over again to help ground myself in this crazy world.  Get past the title if it offends you and just enjoy the message, the simple message it provides.
 This is an inspiring and thought provoking book. Very well written and worthy of your time. I intend to o read this book every few years in hopes that some of his insights env eventually take root.
 The book is hilarious and brings light to thoughts I never had. Love this author!
 This book was a great read! The title was definitely set up as an attention grabber, and shouldn't dissuade anyone from reading it. The primary premise is that in life we only have a certain amount of true passion, and we tend to spread ourselves pretty thin in areas that really don't deserve our attention, love and drive. The book helped me narrow my focus to things that truly matter. I recommend it.
 The dude is young, but he has some really good ideas - I think this book was recommended by an Alux YouTube video and aim glad I picked it up!
 Excellent book. It starts with a non stop parade of f-words that can startle at first but then it slowly transcends into a deep insight of practical wisdom, with both funny and witty stories we can all relate. Highly recommended if you are on those life on a quick-sand times... Eye opening until the end !
 These were a hit for our white elephant gift exchange. I got them to go with a pair of F off socks.<br/>I own this book though and it is a must read!
 I listened to the audio book first. I normally don't buy books but this one is so good that I purchased the book. Entertaining &amp; humorous, yet contains deep messages. Highly recommend!
 This book is amazing. If cursing isn't your thing, it might be hard to get past the first paragraph, but it's real advice that will not only make you say, "Yes!" and "True", but it will also make you think.
 This book makes sense and makes you laugh. Such a great read that I bought a copy for my bff, my dad my son to read when he is 16 or mature enough for the language and concepts.
 ...the author of this book was exceptionally real, honest and covered materials in a new and refreshing manner...the title of this book was very appropriate....
 It ok me all of three hours to read the 200 or so pages. I think one can reduce the main messages to a single chapter, but that chapter would be very insightful
 I originally read this about a year ago, and it changed my life. I recently bought a copy for my mother - who generally hates profanity - and she absolutely loved it.
 Good book, It helps remember that we are in this life for a limited time and to focus on what really matters in life and not to worry about to many things, understand the fact that as humans we are so imperfect, we learn and improve as a person as we keep making mistakes in  life.
 Amazing book.  So on spot its almost funny if not so sad.  Dont be thrown by the title. Its the key to life in this crazy world.
 Totally changed my view on how I've been approaching my life and why I haven't been happy. It has helped me see how to deal with my anger much better.
 I've read a lot of self help books. This is the first one I've read that hasn't disappointed. I felt like I was beginning to understand something profound, life-changing, while reading this book. And it was fun! A great read for anyone who wants to go one layer deeper.
 A brilliant collection of thoughts presented in a casual / user friendly way.  I enjoyed the casual tone of the book, it allowed the ideas being presented to flow through me like water.  This book was written to be read by anyone and everyone.  At first tbe profanity was offensive but I grew to appreciate it as it deepened the casual tone embbeded in this book.  His critique of the "positive thinking self help trend" was very refreshing!  Loved it and would read it again.
 The book let's you see life through a different lens.  It's very refreshing and thought provoking.  The writer is unpretentious and genuine.  I would strongly recommend it.  I was sad when I saw the review page come up because I didn't realize I finished the book...always an indication that the book was good.
 This is definitely a great read! Learning some things and definitely learning some stuff from this book to carry on in my life.
 enjoyed it. belabored a few points IMO but great advice for putting things in perspective. passed it on to others to read as well. they liked it.<br/><br/>obviously not for folks who get upset at every f-bomb.
 I like Mark's work. I find it refreshing in an age of repeats and regurgitations from countless news sources or gawker articles.<br/><br/>This book was good in the same vein. A refreshing take with new ideas and some half baked as well(thus the 4 stars).<br/><br/>Overall good book for reading and taking a look at your life.
 This would probably be the second book I'll read more than once ever. Read it,<br/>I'm sure you'll have a few aha moments too!😃
 The beginning of the book was great and blunt but in the middle pages in my opinion it wasnt soo effective but other than that i enjoyed reading it learnt a few lesson which can be benefical for me
 I found this book a useful tool to build a better perspective on life. You will feel more grounded and appreciative of who you are and what you have after reading it.
 I am like the book half way through it. Very easy read only 200 some odd pages. He must be a conservative because he mentions snow flakes and blonde women -- a distraction because of his politics but what the hey. I should not give a f%&amp;k
 I have bought this book six different times for six different people. I absolutely love this book and it’s content. Speaks realistically and truthfully from a perspective a lot of the general public can relate to.
 I enjoyed the first half of the book. It had a good message that "stuff" happens and you determine your response. The message is good... but after 100 pages it felt like the first 100 pages. It is still worth reading, but temper your expectations.
 One of the few books that I have read that I actually retained the majority of info. Great job at capturing the reader, great info
 I found this book a great introduction to thoughts on life. I have suggested my sons read it. Now, it might just be that the author and I agree on certain ways of thinking and I hope my boys find it easier to contemplate than a lecture from me.
 This book is all about being in the active position. Problem solving instead of ruminating. Refreshing and very helpful to get your life out of the mud!
 Amazing book that needs to be read especially after going through any tough situation in life. This book helped me think about my values and priorities going forward and why not understanding the importance of values caused certain relationships and situations in my life to fail. A helpful book for everyone.
 I can't lie, I bought it because of the title, but I really liked this book. It was an easy read and went quite fast. Really centered in Buddhist teachings, but I'm good with that. A very worthwhile read.
 Mr. Manson writes a beautiful narrative on good values and acting without fear from them. An eye opener of a book! Would recommend this to anyone who questions the meaning of their life. The answers lie within the pages of this book. Thank you Mark!
 Definitely worth it. His take on problems, responsibility, and pain spoke to me the most. Very much needed this and I plan on rereading it and giving it to my siblings. Great work.
 This book arrived looking used. It has 2 different color pages which is very noticeable.  A few of the pages are riped. This was going to be a gift for someone but I am going to reorder a “new “ one. Very disappointed 👎🏼
 I received this book for my birthday and liked it so much I bought the audio. Amazing audio book. I’m listening to it in my car. The book makes a lot of sense and at the same time is really funny.
 Great book so far I am currently on chapter 3 have learned a lot and can relate to a lot of things great book.
 The anecdotes are entertaining and serve to further illustrate a lot of the points Mark tries to make in the book that you should care less about what other people think and more about what you're doing. It gets very old after a few examples though and in the end it's just a lot of self-boasting about his journey to success. I generally regret buying this book and perpetuating some myth that this guy is giving people a false prescription on how to live a better life (it's easy to tell people not to consider other's opinions when you come from an affluent, privileged background), but waited too long to read it to get a refund.
 I really liked this book and had trouble putting it down. Mark does a great job of providing the reader with a powerful tool for identifying and cutting the bs out of his or her life. My only complaint is that I feel that a few of the home runs Mark hit with this book we're almost direct quotes from Fight Club (the movie).
 I have slowly, throughout my life felt that more often than not, things were taken out of hand or just too seriously. I've often said that we're all going to die, and that too much is taken too seriously. What's the old saying? Will what is happening now matter in 5, 10, 100 years.  The answer is usually no. Manson wrote a book that at times gently speaks, but normally yells the same question and answers.  Nice to have affirmation.
 A nice, somewhat lighthearted take on life's big roadblocks. Sometimes the author stretched a bit too far to bring an idea full circle, but I enjoyed reading it
 I read a couple chapters each night when I go to bed.  Good read.  Reduces my general anxiety about everything and I actually get a little dopamine rush.  It reminds me to live in the moment.  Read it.
 A must read book if you are a breathing human. It will stretch you, challenge you, encourage you, make you laugh and make you think. Personally, I admire the raw reality, no-holds-barred, taking-the-gloves-off authenticity and genuine approach that Mark embraces. This book just does not disappoint! Subscribe to him, too. You'll get even more of his wit, wisdom and the payoff of a really well-read man.
 What Manson reminds us in this tome, is nothing less than the simple but challenging way to a meaningful life.  Whatever you do don’t miss this read!
 This book relies on the overuse of the "WTF" manner of writing.  It works for the first paragraph of the book, but the Author seems to be adding the F-Bomb every few sentences for the whole remainder of the book!  He has good points to make - too bad he is overexcited by the use of the forbidden F-word to make these points. It makes the book sound like an adolescent who just realized he could swear. I thus found his message limited to "no one gives a f---k about your happiness, go grab the world by the balls and stop whining".  Stated multiple times in frequent f-punctuated phrases, his message becomes limited to a single rather uninspiring point, i.e.  "get over yourself".  Mr. Manson's overuse of  f-phrases did not help this reader to bracket or highlight his sociological statements or insights. Instead, they were lost in the harshness of the f-bombs he uses to describe them. The title is alluring, but I didn't expect that the whole book would would rely on the use of disruptive f-word vernacular to make his points.<br/><br/>I did buy the book because it had a neat title, and a good NYT review. Some of the best books I've ever read come back the title words, eventually, almost insidiously.  This work does not have that advantage. Instead, the rhythm and meter of his f-messages disrupts communication of any possible threads of insight. Those nuggets remain buried by the over use of the f-word, and result in a vain attempt to make us "f-ing" listen to what he has to say. Needless to say, I think the book would have been more effective without them.
 Enjoyed the read - obviously judging by the title one would expect some unsavoury language but once he gets into the guts of his presentation the language eases into some good reading - I really enjoyed the book and would love to have given it to my 12 year old to read but the language issue is a prohibiting factor - a good message for all ages. Pity about the swearing - but as said a sound massage.
 I love Mark Manson, his blog is fun, serious, light hearted, and so when he said he finally got his book done I was excited!!! Not Disappointed one bit!!!! If you are not familiar with his work read his book then sign up for his blog!
 Good use of stories to get his points across. Very sound advice on life.  His writing style is powerful and memorable, although it may give English teacher a heart attack.
 Very easy book to read. Gives a great idea on what life is all about. It will make you think about each day differently . In reality materialism is not the answer to being happy and fulfilled.
 4/5 only bc he talked about grade inflation when any fellow BU alum knows we're only allowed to whine about here deflation<br/>Nah just kidding, 5 stars...
 Stupid. Just live your life and look for goodness
 A fantastic and epic book about life and learning all about ourselves.<br/>Refreshing and real perspective and really enjoyed this masterpiece!
 TELLS YOU THE SAME STUFF YOU PROBABLY HEARD THROUGHOUT YOUR LIFE BUT IT'S A FUNNY BOOK AND DOES OPEN UP YOUR AWARENESS OF TOPIC.
 
 This book is a fun quick read and seriously changed my life and my thinking in the few short days it took me to read it. I will definitely re-read it again. It was one of those books that every time I picked it up it seemed to tell me exactly what I needed to hear at exactly the right moment.
 I was intrigued by the title, probably not a great reason to buy a book, but I ended up agreeing with some of the author's points. His Chapter 8, "The Importance of Saying No" is probably the least well-thought-out and convincing. That chapter felt mostly like whole cloth. The author also writes with a glib, snarky tone that I got used to but never fully liked. Listing a few sources, references, and credentials would have helped, too. Really, you're 33, and I'm supposed to take you seriously? Convince me what you're saying has some credibility elsewhere and then I'll think more highly of the self-help advice and psychology your peddling. Recommended with reservations. Let's face it, self-help books only work if you want to change.
 Great book that takes you on a journey from your lows to your highs, elaborates how trivial matters matter none as time passes. The writer has got the knack to comprehend our rock bottom feelings and has put down reality that we all relate irrespective of what phase we're in at the moment. Kick start a new adventure of life, embark a new trail with this amazing encouragement .
 I love this book! It makes so much sense and the humor and sarcasm keep it light hearted when it’s really a deep concept on self help.
 If everyone lived by what is written on this book, this world would be a better place 😉 great work.
 I think everyone needs to read this. There aren't any new concepts necessarily,  but they are finally put into a modern context that strikes you to the core.
 Quick, enjoyable read. I think he really got in to the zone during the second half. Some people would greatly benefit from reading this one. Fortunately (not unfortunately!) I've learned many of the lessons explained by Mark the hard way. His take on victim culture and "outrage porn" is brilliant.
 Returned
 Loved this book, and recommended it to all my friends.<br/>Lots of useful tips to train your brain.<br/>As self help books go, one of the best I've read, if not THE best.
 This book is better than I expected. Well, I didn't know what to expect. He gives a more pragmatic look at life which differs from the usual self help books.
 A must read for all adults and teens. Gets you to understand how to live a life, take responsibility, build relationship, stay committed and live happily.
 Very elementary stuff that most seem to not think about.  Very good read.  My wife is enjoying the book as well and we usually have different tastes when it comes to reading.
 Mark has a great outlook on life, which if followed, leaves little room for self-loathing and failure. We have nothing to be afraid of, and with that realization comes the freedom to mobilize and pursue those actions that we deem to be of value and importance. There is no secret to success, just hard work, perseverance and the willingness to accept failure as a prerequisite to success and happiness. I will be re-reading this book on a fairly regular basis.
 This book is funny, especially at the beginning.  But it is also profound.  If you’re looking for a route forward through life or even just want to look harder at the route you think you’ve chosen, read it. It offers a clarity that is .... I guess the best word is again ... PROFOUND.
 such a great book. mark is a wonderful writer. i have been following his blog for about three years now and to date he hasn't written anything i don't agree with. if you need any further convincing check out markmanson.net and read his free archive, it is full of incite and blog post gems. also id like to note that he is a genuine person and has replied to my emails and given me personal advice. how often do you get to exchange emails with a best seller? seriously can't say enough good things about his writing or his character.
 So the title eventually broke my will, since I was certain that this book had to be rooted in sarcasm and indifference. Au contraire, this is a heartfelt blueprint that shows us that we have a finite number of f***s in life so we’d better spend wisely. Bravo!
 It is a good book to understand principles that seem obvious but always are forgotten. It should be read balancing their content vs some weird language
 One of the best books (audiobooks) I've ever gotten on self-development. It's a kick-in-the-ass approach to improving your life. Love it and highly recommend it to anyone that will listen.
 I chose to give this book a 5 star review because it is a book which is hard to find. The reflexions and anecdotes the author gives are quite accurate conclusions to things I have lived and experience but felt it hard to share or conclude because not many people have had such experiences. I know its his way of seeing live his philosophy I hope I can find mine soon as clear as this book. Totally worth reading
 It was great until....the last few chapters had blank pages! Misprint? Poor publisher? Anyway, it landed in the trash. Ah well. Hope your copy has all the pages lol
 A must read! Will teach you how to handle things that are much more important than the irrelevant once. Will make you realize A LOT of things like youve never thought that theres much more umportant problem than with what ur dealing right now. I hvent finish it yet but reading 5 chapters really made me reevaluate my relationship with my thoughts and shifted me out of crappt mental state. I highly suggest this book!
 This was not a book I picked up and couldn’t put down. It took me a long time to read it since I seemed to have to be in the mood. However, the life lessons are great and the ending left me feeling inspired. I’d recommend taking the time to read this.
 I've been eagerly awaiting this book for the past few years (having enjoyed Models) and I have to say it was well worth the wait. This book very clearly shows you how to pull your head out of your ass, and reorient yourself toward life's meaningful things. As a former positive psychology student, many of his concepts backed by academic research.  have already given this book to two friends, and plan on making it required reading for my future coaching clients.
 Helped me make some really positive changes in my life.  Thank you
 I found this book very insightful. It appeals to me as it's written by a millennial to a millennial. He understands the issues that we go through and has turned a lot of the more old fashion ways of living on its head. At the end of the day, it is about values, regardless of or in addition to religious beliefs that drives what we do. It's strange that a chance browsing of this book at the airport last week, has changed the way I think about my life. Thank you.
 Can’t get into...maybe I already don’t give af
 This book is more than meets the eye when you look at the cover. There is a great message within about focusing on things that matter, and ignoring the noise around you.
 Great book with a GREAT TITLE!!! Justifies the way I think and do things. I heard the author on a podcast with Tim Ferriss and he ROCKS! I think some people might get offended by some of  the concepts and language Mark brings to the table because of the environment they grew up in but one thing is sure, this book, if practiced, will reduce anxiety or stress and make one focused on what is important and what is not.
 Amazing book. Blunt but makes the reader rethink life. Definitely gives the realistic outlook on life. Highly recommended
 I liked how this book blew my mind and changed my perspective.  I liked how this book is so different (counterintuitive approach). I would recommend this book to everyone. I believe it’s required reading. I believe Mark Manson is a genius. I’ve already downloaded his podcasts and am on his mailing list because of this amazing work of art.  Good job, Mark!<br/><br/>I’m a “self help junkie” and have never left a rating on a book until now.
 Loved this book, love Mark Mason, and wouldn't definitely recommend this book to everyone. Mark's writing is easy to read, his writing is easy to read and straightforward. He offers insightful advice and practical ways of explaining ideas like no other writer. This is a must read!
 A very insightful read into the shallow values that unconsciously drive many of us. Manson implores us to take personal responsibility for our thoughts, attention, everything that goes in our lives. When we ignore responsibility, when we choose the wrong values and embody them, we are slaves to the thrashing of our inner world. Mark helps us see a different path
 Wow, seriously love this book. Talk about a slap in the face and shake to wake.... 5 stars, worth reading more than once.
 I like the guy’s style as he’s pretty real. A little on the young immature side but overall an entertaining listen. The content is good but nothing that you probably don’t already know.
 Mark uses an easy to understand, real-world voice that not only leaves you unable to stop laughing, but unable to stop nodding in agreement with his thoughts and opinions. Great book and one I will revisit often to help keep me balanced between what f's I give, and what I choose to not give an f about.
 Very good read. To not give an F is really giving an F to what really matters. Other than that, nothing matters and we as humans are living by the seat of our pants! We must earn this life; something we don't do anymore here in America.
 I bought this for my cousin who said it was great. I wish I could give more info but unfortunately she was not very descriptive. She did say it gave her an all new perspective on life...
 Look, there are going to be few surprises in this book, but the author does a nice job of laying out the landscape, including personal stories and ending on, what I believe to be the central theme, how our acceptance of death frees us from our self-imposed limitations (I am over-simplifying).  I will recommend it to people and will look to re-reads segments again.
 Gave it to my wife as a gift and she absolutely loves it! Does not put it down and is almost done with it. Said it makes her laugh constantly, but yet, it is very profound in what it’s actually pointing out. Great for everyone and anyone. She is now recommending it to all of her family, friends, and coworkers!
 I've not read this book.....Giving it to my best friend for Christmas.......The title describes her perfectly....
 usually would not read something like this but author gives good advice. really good read.
 This book has given me a whole new (in a good way) perspective on life. It's like therapy in a book. (disclaimer: I do not claim that this can serve as a replacement for therapy)
 One of  the best self helped books I've read.  Made some excellent points I've used in my life.
 I listened to the audiobook version of this book. I thought the subject was so on point and thought process that I went back and bought the actual text so I could highlight passages. These are words that more people need to hear.
 I loved this book. Long enough to get a point across yet not to long to get you bored. Several valid points &amp; real life practical help across the board. Recommended
 Exactly what my dr ordered for me to rid. Well written, and will keep it for a long to so I can reread it when necessary.
 An awesome book! Helps keep me from losing my s*** at times. Will be re-reading it.
 Good perspectives. Makes you think outside your little box. Highlighted a lot of my favorite quotes and examples/stories.<br/><br/>Rambles a lot. I don’t agree with everything.
 Funny, clever, to the point! Does not sugar coat life and tells you to expect it to suck! Get over it and over yourself!
 This is a great book. Takes some concentration and introspection, but it’s worth it. Got 3 more for my daughters and friend.
 This book was a waste of money for me. The writing is repetitive and  shallow with the constant use of the F bomb. It was b-o-r-i-n-g... I have read at least a thousand books over the years and this one sits right at the bottom, in my opinion. The author's main philosophical premise upon which this book is based could be  succinctly stated in a few paragraphs. Instead he stretches it out for 200 pages.  I would give it a negative star if I could.
 Definitely a mindset-shifting book. Love Mark Manson's blog and overall body of work and have recommended this to several friends.
 I put it up and forgot to put it with the book when I handed the book out . I looked through it and it’s ok !
 Great book so far.. definitely makes you think about what your values are and caring to much about things that don't really matter.. I've realized I hate my job and I don't need to keep torturing myself with it.. I'm good at more than what I'm doing now and I can move on!
 Worth all the money and time investment 10-fold. Helps keep value in life and to keep focus on what is really important. Highly recommended to anyone looking to improve the quality of their life.
 I honestly didn't know where this book was headed in the beginning...im a weirdo positive person..but thought I was having a nervous break down! Your book had me crying only pages in..thank you for your candid honesty and willingness to share exactly how you feel! Ill be working on me a while. Thank you for your incredible writing. I absolutely loved almost every second of it❤ Marissa
 A dry read that I only found somewhat helpful.
 Very good advice in this book. I throughly enjoyed it.
 I recommend this book. Although the book follows the self-help book recipe of catchy title -&gt; anecdote -&gt; life tip -&gt; next chapter, the author manages to throw some really good nuggets of wisdom in.<br/><br/>However, I felt like the author gets too ahead of himself at times, almost as if he enjoys the sound of his written voice too much to care about being coherent. There are a couple parts of the book where he is flat out contradictory, which really annoyed me as one of my biggest peeves is when self-help books are misleading or destructive for the reader.<br/><br/>Another part I didn't enjoy is his backstory. He was essentially lazy middle-class white dude who spent years traveling and having sex. After he got tired of it, he learned the "value of commitment." He didn't really study philosophy other than self-study, and doesn't have much to his name except a couple thousand highly opinionated and poorly backed, snake-oil style blog posts. Unless he is some kind of genius, I don't see how he is qualified to provide life advice?<br/><br/>The best way to describe this book is a strained effort to piece together all the nuggets of philosophy that the author has picked up over the decades. Some or many parts of the book are wrong and confusing, but like the author says, it's ok to be wrong :)
 Great book! Really helps put important things in perspective! Can't wait to read his second book coming out soon!
 reminds of internet adds where there's this that talks and talks about a problem but never gets to the poait
 a tough read but well worth the time.......a different to the point  spin on measuring self worth and values
 I came across this book as I saw someone sitting across from me on the light rail was reading it. Finally got around to picking up a copy and finished reading it in a few days. Definitely gives you a different perspective on the things that really matter and those that don’t.
 How long will it take you to stop giving a F about everything? Not subtle...a caress to your awareness...in your face...with a chair. Loved it
 This is a fantastic book. We are all reading it. Great laughs with a good message.
 The lessons exposed in the book matches many others found in another books, however Mark really have a excellent way to share his experiences, which makes the book easy to read and really a funny and fulfilling experience.
 This was a fun motivational book I originally got at the library, I loved it, bought it on Amazon and now I'm loaning my copy out to my friends to enjoy.
 Most of the time I feel played by self help books because all they do is tell me to forget my worries and just be happy. Unfortunately I'm the type of person who can't "fake it until you make it". This book goes in to greater detail as to why those ideas are important and explains in more than one way each ideology that we are presented with thoughout life. Read it.
 Literally the best book I've ever read, no preaching just real life thinking with a twist. I will be making all my friends and family read this book.
 The title talks like I do. That's why I chose this. The content is a valuable look into what's important to each of us.
 While reading this I'm laughing like crazy but also say well he is right. It's nice to see someone else thinking that we have to stop catering to people emotions and start telling them the truth.
 Again, save your money; if directed or re-directed to/from Tools of the Titans; these are worthless.  Read something like Aurelius Meditations if you want something meaningful, not one star since it's a little better than totally worthless.
 The title grabs your attention but the value of what's inside is far greater than the title grab.  Its simple in its premise but valuable in its insight.
 Full of good advice in a no-bullshit setting. The read was quick but the impact of the material took much longer to settle. A good book for those who like being uncomfortable and improving.
 I don't know what I expected, but I was pleasantly suprised. It raised some questions I needed to ask myself, but also questions that everyone could ask themselves. Humurous without being overbearing, informative without  preaching. I have recommended the book to several people. Easy read and certainly worthwhile.
 At a certain age, you’ve experienced a lot and hopefully learned a lot. But at low times in our lives, hard-learned lessons sometimes recede from our consciousness so much, we can barely hear the advice they offer. Or, worse, we start to second guess things we shouldn’t. This is a wonderful second voice to remind us of some of the best lessons life has to offer. It’s poignant at times and funny as sh*t!
 Great book about different life topics. It makes you think about the purpose of the life. A lot of great philosofy
 Still haven't finished it. It is definitely a life changer. Wish I  had the money to buy one for each of my friends.
 A quick and mostly entertaining read that confirmation and reminds you what is important. The author does a nice job using examples from his life and others to reinforce his theories on life and the pursuit of happiness.
 I read this book in less than a day. I read it fast because I enjoyed it and didn't want to stop. It's a great read. Props to MM. Insanely insightful and easy to read. Worth reading again and again and again.
 I reviewed the summary which I liked so much I bought the book. Good insights, blunt and clear.
 The book was recommended to me by a friend as a possible help in dealing with perfectionism. It was surprisingly deep and the points made by the author seem very true. The book does a very go job at describing some very uncomfortable truths about life. The practical advice is rather high-level, but it is possible that it is just enough to actually build a better, more fulfilling life.
 This book is a must for those that are in sales.management, and this flips the notion that the customer is always correct .
 Reading this book has opened my eyes to new things, along with expanding my understanding of the universe, and my place in it. I really am thankful that the author wrote this book.
 Life hit the proverbial fan for me. Over the past year I’ve done a lot of study, therapy, and introspection, which led to a better and more mature self. This book summarized many of the realizations and conclusions I have found.<br/><br/>It’s funny and easy to read and understand, yet very deep.
 Great book. Fun to read. I think the main message was on choosing what is meaningul in your life and not delving in the things you can't change. What causes suffering is usually due to the values and goals you choose to live by. I enjoyed the part on choosing your values carefully and the metrics by which you are going to evaluate your actions and behavior.
 Enjoyable read! Humor helps swallow messages that might be hard to hear about clarifying goals and values, then being true to them! Good refresh for a caretaker like me!
 Sick of all those self help books that leave you empty and unsatisfied and constantly reaching out for yet more self help?  This book puts the sense back into  your search for happiness by getting back to basic.  This is a reality shot to get you back on track with What Is.  I was reminded of tge wisdom of Alan Watts, Buddhism, Lao Tzu, that I had forgotten and left for the inane insanity you find in today's self-help industry that promises to more, but always makes you wanting more like an addictive fix.  We Americans have been lead by the nose so far into fake happiness and enslavement to consumerism that we have become fake people lying to ourselves and everyone else while remaining enslaved to marketing gurus who don't know sh*t about what really makes us whole and alive.  This book gives you the tools to take back what you've lost to the marketing machine that eats souls.
 Love this book. I give it away to friends and family and have reread it several times.Good reminder that not everything needs your constant attention. Some things can just be.
 Quick, easy reading. A great reminder that it is okay to give yourself permission to focus on your wants and needs without feeling guilty!
 I couldn't put this book down! I personally like the author's writing style. This books shows you what values are important... what parts of life, thoughts, behaviors, relationships and situations you are responsible for and how to face failure and rejection. I found it much more relatable than most self help books. I will read this over and over.
 Have bought many for others after reading it. Great for friends, family whether they are adults or teens. Makes you rethinking how you approach everyday issues and the read is light enough to not want to put it down once you start!
 This is like having someone come visit you and tell you the way life really is.  No fluff.  It was an eye opener for me.<br/>Am reading it again because I need another wake up call.
 This guy MUST be in AA, this is a really good book, almost self-help for how to navigate life and the a-holes in it!
 So far so good, I’m halfway through the book and it’s hilarious and informative, it’s s light read for sure
 Interesting message about choosing the most important things and letting the rest go, needs to tone down the language. He has a 'teenager mad at my parents' vibe that gets a little old.
 Just read  the truth in a very amusing way. And just go something! It's a funny but very deep read.
 Is the book understandable by someone in their mid 30s only? I am pondering over that while truly appreciating mark’s stories. Well structured echoing thoughts that a conscious man asks when he understands the subtleties of most things in life. Recommended read.
 Felt like I was buying a self help book, which technically it is... but he goes about it in a completely different way. His perspective on tough issues is nothing I've seen. Mark doesn't coddle you, he's blunt and some truths are hard to swallow. Instead of trying to change me into some peaceful yogi monk he showed me a different way of thinking that I can actually use and still be ME, just a better version of myself. I definitely recommend
 This book is truly amazing!! I loved every bit of it, I’m thinking of reading it again, it’s that good!
 This has to be one of the best books I've read in a long time. The principles in it: whether the acceptance of failure; the owning up to everything in your life or the realiazition of the inevitability of death (and it's impact on a person's life) have truly changed how I have started to see the world around me. I see myself returning to this book multiple more times in the future.
 Written directly and simply. Will likely read again. Bravo to the author for having the guts to search his soul perhaps more than most do in a lifetime. In the process he helps others. A groundbreaking book.
 Great book! No non-sense approach of how to pay attention and do what really is important to you. Its not how positive you are, its what you do about what needs to be done. Great read!
 I read this book in a little over a day due to the storytelling and lessons learned in this book. The author happily shares his life in an honest manner which helps me the reader really connect with life's struggles and turmoils. Thank you for taking the time to share your life!
 Manson's writing at times is immature and some anecdotes were irrelevant but he makes some very very good points about why people care and hope casing too much can be crippling.<br/><br/>The most valuable idea I got was that I don't have to Care about everything and all the advice I've got my whole life. I can choose what values are most important and focus on those things and stop letting the little things in life bother me.
 highly recommend this book, coming from someone who cares too much about what others think it has definitely helped me change my mindset
 Mark Manson has a good book about not letting society control us.  However, the language is hard to cut through.
 It's written better than 90% of “self help" book, which tend to get repetitive and feel like they're written at a 5th grade level period this one was easy to read and introduced some readily applicable ideas that I've never heard before in my life
 I was recommended this book by a friend, and I wanted to love it, but I just couldn't. I had read Furiously Happy (Lawson) right before, and perhaps had high expectations, wishing this would fill that same kind of genre, but it comes nowhere near. It is helpful, and it is good, just not as good as I'd hoped.
 Book is easy to read &amp; once u get to the middle of it it goes fast. Last chapter was a bit daunting but overall good advice
 SO much of what my father taught me is in this book!  However Mark Manson is more entertaining by far.  Enjoy!
 We had to choose a book for our health insurance discount and I was pleasantly surprised at the content  and delivery.
 I thoroughly enjoyed this book, but I feel as if reading it again and again will help me understand it much better. The fact that I cannot wait to read it again, soaking up as much as I can is the real point I wish to leave with you.
 I enjoyed reading this book. It really makes you self examine. At times he’s a bit over the top with using the F word, but if you weed through that he gives a lot of good advice. I especially liked the ending when he talks about confronting death. That really brought it all together for me.
 It's a must read for people who care too much about being perfect. The POV of this book has really helped me change my attitude about how I approach work, stress, and being disappointed by people. My new mantra is "Don't Try....Just Do".
 First half has some good tidbits but seems to have lost me after about the half way mark.
 One of the most blunt, straight forward, life changing/ analyzing books I've ever read. I highly recommend this! Easy Read.
 Really made it clear on where your attention should be on and not on. This clears a lot of nonsense and you live much better. Thank you for amazing book.
 This book started awesome and then it was like, “been there, done that”.  Nothing new under the sun or that inspiring.
 If you're going through a rough period, this is a great book to help realize the important things in life. I definitely plan on reading this again. It really helped me prioritize what to really give a f&amp;*k about.
 When you get past the f-bombs, this book has good points to make. perhaps the title should be, "The no-so-subtle art of grandstanding to get your book read"
 Very practical. Helped me look at failure in a different way and made me look forward to overcoming challenges. Great principles. The only reason it's not 5 star is the language. Could have made the same points without the foul language. The only reason I got past the title is that someone recommended the book to me.
 Great book, easy read. Finished it in one sitting!
 Best book I've ever read! I read it twice over then gifted it to my little brother and bought another copy!
 I liked this book because it presents original ideas about the reason I am in the predicament in my life. He doesn't mince words and his bluntness is refreshing.
 Fantastic book, I've written an outstanding review for this book about 5 times but amazon rejects it because I use the name of the book. Silly amazon; all that aside but this book it is a necessity and should be taught in high schools around the world.
 The parts that really stuck out were thinking about entitlement, and why choosing your suffering is better than trying to avoid it.<br/><br/>I had to think about how if i choose my suffering I'd likely be able to reach my goals faster because I accept the struggle instead of avoiding it.
 If you're looking at this book, you already have a reason. Buy it. Read it. There are some really good opportunities to "call yourself out" on some of the b.s. in your life.
 A fun perspective on Stoic philosophy. Mark has an upbeat and irreverent writing style that makes this a compelling and easy read. As deep or as shallow as you'd like it to be.
 Love this book. It’s a quick read and, while it’s not for those who object to profanity, it delivers a wonderful zen message.
 Everyone should read this book!
 Is a good read. Funny at times. Nothing ground breaking. If anything it's a reader digest version of the authors years and years of therapy
 Brutal honesty gets us back to where we should have been all along
 I bought this as a gift for a friend, but I read the first chapter before giving it to her. The writing style is funny and enjoyable to read. Definitely not a stuffy self help book.
 What a life changer.  Great philosophy shift to be more mellow and not get all frazzled about stuff that won’t matter in the long run.
 if you can get past the f-bombs the substance of this book was thought provoking and right on target.  really appreciated the perspective and new way to look at things.
 At first it seems like just another self-help book. It’s really about a paradigm shift in the way we view life
 Best book that I have read in a while. Highly recommend to EVERYONE if you need to get your life together and stop wasting so much time caring about trivial things. Very fast-paced, easy to read, insightful, and hilarious.
 Great read!  Deeper and more profound than what the title suggests...especially with profanity in the title.  Everyone should read this.  I just read it for the second time to make sure I didn't miss anything.
 This package is not the book; it is other item which I bought a week ago
 Great book ! down to earth concepts that you may get on self-help books. However, this book provides a different twist/perspective on how to evaluate and contemplate everyday life circumstances.
 Decent book can put things in perspective. But at times starts to ramble and get off course and become basically a long blog.
 best book every
 great book. filled with more than just the F word. many common sense thoughts that have been lost.
 Just great. I recommended it to several friends and they all loved it too. Refreshing take on modern life. Dude gets a little braggy. We get it. You sexed a lot of ladies. But overall a real good read.
 A game changer for me. Mark gave me a lot to think about and his advice was wise and spot on.
 Would not recommend this book.  No new ideas.<br/>Old ideas presented differently.
 quick and easy read... excellent insight into how you can prioritize what is important and what is not...
 I’d like my child to read this, but a lot of profanity...  I will say that I have bought several copies for friends and relatives, whom I believe may benefit equally or more than I did in reading this book.  Extremely naked and concise human distractions revealed for one’s reexamination of life’s happiness.
 I loved this book for so many reasons. It's raw unfiltered energy is something that kept me intrigued and excited the entire time reading. The author does a great job at hitting home the message of the book and I highly recommend this read.
 Haven't had much time to read, busy memorizing for a show. But the first chapter certainly was highly engaging. I enjoy his blunt almost non-chellant writing style. Straight to the point. I would recommend this highly and will be passing it around the office when done.
 This is a no nonsense, no sugarcoating book that puts forward the idea at a point blank range and makes the reader think from their own perspective.
 good read.  this book is not for the sensitive so if you tend to get offended very easily don't even bother reading it.  I like how the author is right-in-your-face blunt about everything.  sometimes you just have to be honest about stuff and not sugar coat reality.
 Funny but also totally full of practical advice about life! Interesting, not preachy. It's also only 200 pages so it's a quick read.
 Loved how obvious all the advise was, yet we tend to really look past it for mundane day to day life. Highly recommend reading if you feel a bit stuck in a rut or flat with life, gives you good perspective! It’s like taking a blindfold off to not giving a f***!
 Love the fact truth is told without sugar coating.
 Bought this as a gift for my family members and they loved it. Vert funny writing style.
 Awesome !!! I sent it to my son who is 35, He loved it!!! it's the bottom line! We all need to read stuff like this, it cleans out the mothballs In our brain and refreshes our thinking!
 This book really helps you get over petty crap in your life. You realize that most things in your life no one gives an F*** so neither should you.
 Book wasn’t as bleak as it sounded. There’s a freedom to be found here. Truly worth living again. Highly recommended
 I loved the book. Very entertaining! The author is hilarious and sarcastic, but definitely does offer some really great knowledge and quotes that continue to help me. The book was right up my ally. I hope you get the same benefit I did.
 This book is actually a lot more insightful than it's playful, shocking title would make it seem.  Really good food for thought
 Enjoyed the read I was impressed with how young the author is and yet how worldly he became. I liked the fact that it is not a happy fairy tale of how you should think and live your life but a guide on how to put life in perspective.
 This has been one of the most helpful books I have ever read. Literally my new favorite, changed the way I think about and process my life and it's issues. I am in my early 20s and I highly recommend to anyone.
 Just started reading this book first couple of pages and I was laughing and saying...you are so right.
 This is by far one of my favorite books. If you do not like cussing then this might not be the book for you, but if you don’t mind cussing then totally buy the book.
 Excellent read...I'm one that will put a book down and let dust collect. Not this one, finished it 2nd sitting.
 Interesting book with insightful advice. Only four stars because the book came with a tear on the cover.
 While many may pass this book up because of the coarseness of the language they will be missing out. This book is blunt. It is also artfully subtle.  The jarring language used throughout will drive the reader to question every word, as well as their own view of the world.<br/><br/>The book is offensive. The truth often is.
 This book isn't for everyone. This book will not inspire or motivate you to become great. This book is for those that don't need motivation to get work done, but tend to get caught up in the details because of a tendency towards perfectionism.
 insightful and hillarious
 A must read for life advice.  Well written, I can see why my psychiatrist and therapist highly recommended this book.
 Very inspirational yet down to earth book.  Helps put lifes challenges in perspective.  I enjoyed the writers style and relatable self reflection.  He speaks from the heart.  My kids recommended this book and I see why.
 Started very interesting. Great reminder of what really get focused on, what’s important and what not. Easy read. Books like this should be re-read every 3 months.
 Recieved as indicated, book had no damages, book was slow at first but overall a great read.
 What an amazing book about how to focus on what is important to you and make every second count. Witty writing mixed with pure logic make for an easy read and easy application!
 This was a really good read I love the way it was written I love the humor in this book if you are not one for profanity then it's not for you but the profanity actually makes it feel like a friend talking to you he makes a lot of really valid points it's very realistic I loved it
 Loved it! To be fair he writes exactly the way I think, but I found the book to be a fairly quick and entertaining read. His format could be seen as blunt or maybe even crude but his message is extremely clear. He takes what can be a very complicated subject and delivers it in an easily understood and humorous way.
 DOPE! This book is not for the faint of heart. If you're not ready for the hard cold truth-have a seat please.<br/>Mark's humor is incredible! He's become one of my favorite writers. Buy the book dammit!
 This book is pretty good. However my copy was missing some pages out of the first chapter. Well the pages were there, they were just blank.
 Better than any grief recovery book, this book helped me re-evaluate my goals and values and understand how the loss of a loved one has in fact helped me live a more peaceful life by reminding me what truly matters.
 forget the title. Its a really good book. It's only drawback is the F words. Aside from that its a deeply meaningful book.
 Awesome book! Really enjoyed it!
 A book about truly taking responsibility for things within and without of your control and letting the less important things go.
 Makes its point in a funny and meaningful manner.  Whenever I start stressing about something someone has done to me, I play this
 Do not be fooled by the name of this book. It really is a self help book written with refreshing honesty. I read it in 2 days. This book put so many things in perspective for me. I have recommended to many people.. A must read.
 A very insightful read. Filled with practical look life prescriptions without pretense. Colloquial language, yet deep philosophy within the body of this lovely writing style.
 Pretty good book, and funny as well.
 Don't waste your money. I suggest go have a beer and a good conversation instead of reading this book. I tossed it out, should have done my research regarding the author before purchasing.
 I would like to thank Mark Manson for writing such a helpful book. Although he kindly emphasizes in his book that his views may&amp;will be surpassed in time, I presume, at least on my behalf, that his views may always serve as building steps for a better life. I consider his book as a vital compass which will help the reader to stay away from so many pitfalls considered as “succes” by so many...
 This book is fantastic. Get over the massive use of the "F" word on the first disc. The message is outstanding
 Very funny, made me LOL pretty often. Passed it along to some other friends/family, and everyone loves it!
 Outstanding book. The first couple of chapters are a little much but the rest is outstanding.
 Out of all of the so called self help books I have read (and trust me,  I've read a lot),  there are only a handful that I think are truly helpful and worthwhile. This is one of those. Mark is thoughtful, sympathetic,  brash and honest.  There is no fluff here,  neither in the writing nor the meaning. Like a laser he sees through the B.S. of the self help, psychology and other industries, as well as the B.S. of life and calls it all out by name.  This forthrightness is refreshing and much needed in today's world. This book is not for those wanting a secret that they and the world are all okay.  It is one that will make you seriously contemplate the deeper meanings of your loce by pulling away the veil you and everyone hides behind.  Glorious and inspirational,  I tip my hat to you, Mark Manson, for doing what all great thinkers do,  show us the truth no matter how ugly that is.  And in that truth is the light we all need to see by, and the beacon which both calls us forth and shows is the way.
 Very contemporary way to deliver pretty well known message and ideas originated by ancient Stoics. The book will be a good entertainment for you on a long flight or in a subway to make something out of the commute 👍🏻
 This was a very interesting book that I can really relate to in many ways. I can think of a number of people that this book would benefit but imagine they will never read it. What a shame.
 Best self help book to have been written. Through laughter, this author has helped me in my healing process.
 This is a book that shows what accountability means.  Highly recommend.
 It's an interesting read. It gives you something to think about when you run into problems.
 I went back and re-read my highlights, and I still really like the philosophies in this book.  He makes some good points if you can get past his language.
 Really enjoyed the book.  Seventy percent of the book I read casually and it was interesting.  However the other 30% really caught my attention and helped alter my approach to life and decisions.  This book has something for everybody.  I think each person will take something different away from it.
 Loved the book!  I read it in 1 day and walked away with a new perspective on life.  I would highly recommend  "The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F'ck".
 I purchased the book as a new item and not used but when I received the book it was damaged on every edge of the book. This is very disappointing and takes away from the excitement of wanting to read the book.
 Good, solid, healthy advice just a bit difficult to actually do. I'll have to read it again to have it sink in. I had a hard time relating to a man in this regard.
 You've read enough reviews, so just buy it and start reading the book instead! Stop wasting more of your time.
 Headline says it all. Going to present this at the men's ministry at the church.  Yes I said the church.  What's in this book is what people now a days need to hear, study and digest.
 A very eye opening lesson in values. I highly recommend this to anyone who needs direction and/or purpose in life. The title is somewhat misleading.
 An honest modern take on old questions. Deftly illuminates the experience of growing up in the 21st century but draws the same conclusions as many great thinkers. Life is short, don't wait to live.
 This book really made me think and put life's anxieties in perspective. You see the title of the chapter and think,  "Seriously? "But then read the chapter and it makes perfect sense.
 I liked it.. the writing seemed natural, felt like speaking to a friend. The last chapter is truly the jewel though, keeping death.. the gut churning reality of your own mortality in mind as much as you can bear while going through the life is truly the best way to stop caring so much about things that ultimately mean nothing to you.
 The whole thing was just stupid. Repeating the same thing over and over.
 It was a pretty dry read for me. There is information to be acquired,  and I will give the author credit for being original,  but it is just one more book about focusing on what matters. Kinda like the ultra predictable movie that got stellar ratings....
 One of the best books I've read in a long time.  I would highly recommend to anyone.  Whether you're going through a hard time or just like reading these types of books, it didn't get repetitive like I find these self-help books can do occasionally.  Great work Manson!
 He takes the reader to the edge and challenges him to look in and out of him &amp;/or herself.<br/><br/>Very enlightening!
 This is a fantastic book
 This book is a great and funny read. I was really surprised at how much I got out of this book. I have already recommended it to a ton of my friends and family.
 I really wish I had this book when I was 25. It would have saved me a lot of wasted energy. This has become my new "book I give to everyone."
 Honesty is the best policy. Learn to be honest with yourself and let go of life's anchors. This book is, in my opinion, suited well for those looking to get back on track with life's path. I'm not a clinical psychologist, so I can't say if his theories are psychologically correct, but they do indeed bring a lot of clarity.
 I am still reading it, but it's about how to choose what u you truly don't give a f--- about and to make your life simpler
 This book is a new ideology, a new theology. It has opened me up and inspired me to finally face my fears and step into the abyss of uncertainty we call life. 10 out of 10 from me! It inspired me to read more and finish writing the books I’ve started myself.
 Entertaining at times but nothing really new. I only like the first half of the book, the rest I only skimmed through.
 Never has a book led me to examine my thought processes and filters with which I interpret the world more so than this one. The author has such a simple, relatable way of explaining topics that many believe to be very complicated and only suitable for a high level philosophy class. Crazy to realize the idiotic pressures over trivial things we put on ourselves as we go through life.
 Good book. Recommened to read. Gives the reader a different perspective.
 Love this book. Gives you a great dose of how to be humble and deal with reality that many other books fail to mention.
 I love this book! Everyone should read it! It's weird and funny but also inspiring without the author sounding like a narcissist.
 This book is very informative,  enlightening,  and entertaining.  The author is knowledgeable,  a great story teller, and a good writer.
 This book is just amazing and exactly what worry worriers need.
 This book has honestly opened my eyes to some personal anxiety and panic about life that I have. I began reading and was lost. I read to page 121 and had stopped reading the book for some reason. I am trying to get back into it but my interest has gone away.
 Love this book.  He really makess some great points.  Makes you look at things alittle different.
 I got the referral for this book from entrepreneur magazine. I decided to buy it because I could use some knowledge in the area of not giving too many "effs". The author has some good ideas and relatively relatable examples but, overall, he just comes off as crude. I think that he eliminates a wider range of audience by dropping 15 F bombs per sentence. We get it! You're cool and don't care because you use the F word in a book! I can look past that, it's not a big deal, but honestly his lax writing style loses him credibility. He went from informed and experienced author at the beginning of the book to joe shmoe who gets his 15 minutes of fame for having the F word in the title of a book. Edgy....but that doesn't make him an informed author.<br/>I realize the irony in this review, being that I clearly give too many F's (haha) but I think if I would have known at the beginning of the book that he was just a guy who doesn't care about anyone or anything, I wouldn't have bought the book. So, I thought I'd offer the information to anyone else who is like me. The guy has some good ideas and thoughts but it's hard to take the advice of a guy whose audience is only targeted to be the people who already don't give an F.
 Very enjoyable. If you are a codependent this is one of the more entertaining books on the subject of not people pleasing although it's not marketed as such.
 Absolutely one of the best "self-help" books I've read. I was a bit skeptical in the beginning, but I absolutely loved this book. Honestly, I was sad when I got to the end of it. It really made me think about where my values lie and what I want out of life. I don't typically re-read books, but I do see this book as one that I will pick up and read again.
 He's very straight up. Not really a guide to put things pretty just to focus on the most important things.
 Loved the title when I first saw it and loved the entire book.  This is a keeper.  I agree completely about commitment being so important in life but hadn’t given as much thought before to the areas outside of personal relationships that benefit from this commitment as well.  Thank you.
 I love this book. At first I was a little skeptical because he talks a lot about not trying in the beginning but he has sound logic to his ideas and it's actually really helpful because it makes you think about the things that actually matter to you. I enjoy his writing style as well.
 Excellent book, especially for young folks entering the workforce
 To me it was an awesome, great ans funny cool book to read.
 Got bored quick.
 Love reading Mark's stuff...I also subscribe to his website markmanson.net.  He has numerous articles for free, and some for paying customers...and a subscription is less than $50 a year....about $4 a month....
 Irreverent, and full of way more hard hitting truths than I had expected. There's a reason a lot of people have been recommending this book.
 It's absolutely must read to any person in the world. The author's perception of life is based on different religion movements, it's a mix of modern psychogical ideas, but it's all about practical solutions in day to day real life. So, if anybody asks me, what I suggest to read when something goes wrong in life, I'd highly recommend this book!
 Why let the actions of others reduce your happiness? This is not a book for slackers (as the title might imply) but instead a way to take control of your own life.
 I dated it highly because everything I read made sense to me. The more I read, the more I wanted to read. This man is authenic ! I think I probably will read it again to make sure I didn't miss anything. Great book!
 Just started reading this book but so far I love it. Can’t wait to finish. Sent a copy to my son as well.
 The author's well researched ideas coupled with his deep self-analysis in the wake of various life challenges and tragedy make for a book that is both accessible and applicable to any and all. Thank you, Mark!! This is one immortality project that you can count a success!!
 I've been eyeballing this book for a while, and I'm glad I finally bought it. Let me preface this by saying I am not a huge reader or "book person." I honestly can't tell you the last time I finished a book, but I finished this book from start to finish... in one evening!!! I even broke out the highlighter and started taking notes. This book is so thought-provoking, honest, and REAL. Manson cuts the crap and gets straight to the point, which I really enjoyed. However, some parts may be a little too straightforward for some people.  trigger warning] One section is blatantly titled "Kill Yourself." Of course, Manson doesn't mean to actually kill yourself, but the section's title still caught me off guard. For me, most of the relevant information is throughout chapters 1-6. After that, Manson relates the information to anecdotes from his personal learning experiences and relationships. There are a few decent pages on relationship advice and the like, but my favorite parts were definitely in the first 2/3 of the book. Overall, I have already recommended this book to all of my friends and family members, so I recommend it to anyone reading this review, too!
 Great book, very funny and insightful. The author belabors the point in a few cases, but definitely worth a read.
 Don't let the title fool you -- this is a spectacular book.  Extremely well-written and insightful, so much so that I bought a copy for each of my family members.  I hesitate to call it a self-help book:  it's more like a pragmatic philosophy book.
 Neither of them cared what people thought and they focused on their core values of doing their Father’s will.<br/><br/>I don’t care either...
 pretty good read and I like talking about it with people. They laugh but also agree about the message sent.
 This book is actually about caring too much about everything is a waste of energy and detrimental. Be very careful what you are willing to care about. Gave me great insight. Easy to read. Glad I read it and useful at home and at work.
 Got positive feedback from person to whom I have this to.
 Really what else can be said?  I have zero effs to give.
 Great self help book.  Or great life lessons book.  Or great funny book.  Or great reminders of how to be a good person book.  It can be any of these.<br/><br/>I read this book because it was recommended to me by a shipmate.  Her job is to care about others, and basically, to give a fork about a lot of stuff.  Kind of ironic.  I liked the title and thought I'd give it a shot.<br/><br/>Mark Manson is funny and has a great way of explaining things.  His advice is not academic.  His stories are interesting and universal.<br/><br/>I didn't find anything in this book earth-shattering.  What I did find was that I already do most of these things, but now I can see a better reason as to why I should keep doing what I am doing.<br/><br/>What's missing is a conclusion to tie everything together.  There's a lot of what and why but not a lot of how.  The reader should be prepared to step back on his/her own and reflect.  There are no exercises or empty pages to complete (well, duh.  I read this on my kindle).  I did appreciate the depth of each of the chapters.  I would have liked a conclusion.<br/><br/>This is a book that I'll give as gifts to people.  Beware family and friends!  Or prepare to enjoy!
 This book reintroduced me to the process of of defining values for my life and reminded me I have that freedom to modify those as I lead my life. While I was feeling frustrated and overwhelmed, Mark's description of how we go about defining ourselves and pursuing lives of meaning gave me a refreshing and encouraging perspective.
 Although I have so far to go when it comes to accepting and fully embracing Marks philosophies in this book, I couldn't agree with them more. He shed a light on some of the most important<br/>values we should have as humans on this earth. Can't thank you enough for sharing this with the world!
 I have read many "self help" books in my time, but this book really made me stop and think about my life, my values and my inevitable death.
 This book changed my life. Although I know most of what he says, the way Mark writes allows the knowledge to sink in. Thank you Mark Manson!
 This book had me genuinely cracking up laughing while providing great, positive, helpful insight! I absolutely love this book and I am passing it on to all of my friends and family members as I truly feel it can help the way they view their "problems" in life.
 A powerful message if you’re willing to hear the truth. Mark delivers some of the most simple, clear life-defining advice for anyone on this earth. He gets deep enough to make you really think about what truly matters in life. A must-read for anyone on the pursuit to happiness!
 For my taste it's a superficial book. It was the first book I've read when I have started exploring ways in which I needed to change my life attitude, alongside with starting a therapy. As therapy slowly but surely was opening my eyes on how I was lost in my own pathological thought patterns, the content of this book had becoming more and more superficial and, at times, almost childish and immature, in contrast. There are some amount of good advice and tips, but generally I don't consider this book helpful in any way, I'm sorry. I hope the author will continue to self reflect, explore mindfulness and dig dipper and who knows, maybe his next book will be much more insightful into what it really means to "not give a f".
 Awesome! This book should be the mantra of every living man, woman and child!
 The title isn't as revealing of the contents inside the book but it is catchy. Being the same age as the author I can fully relate to his view on life. This is an honest, open, well-written account of what to value in life and he ends it perfectly with the chapter on death. Good job Mark. This has inspired me to write more as well.
 Although I don't agree completely with the conclusive reasoning, how the author got there was clear, logical and made some very good points, which were well illustrated despite a few too many f-bombs and what often seemed forced and out of place profanity. Overall, though, a good and interesting read.
 Insights were original, in that they were Manson’s.  There’s not much original insight a self help book can have, besides telling a story well, and Manson does that.  The book is good, deserves the attention it’s getting, probably over-hyped nonetheless.
 Fantastic read!!  I bought the book after listening to the Urban Monk podcast he was being interviewed on. The book, like his interview, was extremely entertaining yet insightful.
 Loved every sentence . Changed how I live my life . Simply don’t give a f about what others have to say about you and just do what you want to do in life . This is how you’ll be successful. Don’t care about fear and just move forward .
 I couldn't get past 3 chapters.
 This saved my relationship and career, and saved me from making the same mistakes of negative  thinking. It's better than actual relationship books!
 Great thoughts.. It’s a rock and roll philosophy of the right things to care about..
 Loved the book. Great write-up book. Straight to the point.
 A quick read. Perhaps the title sums it all up, but good kernels along the way. Perhaps it could have been consolidated into a short story.
 I bought it just to lend out to friends. I definitely recommend.
 I’d gladly have conversations about many topics addressed in the book. I appreciate the comedic relief yet honest criticism regarding many prevalent personal issues in the American/21st century society. I’m not saying I agree with everything that was said, but I definitely think the collective work speaks to things that need to be talked about.
 Highly recommended for everyone. Pulls together helpful information. If offended by the f word, tough.
 This book is life changing. I am a helping professional and recommend this book to my clients. It is authentic and applicable in so many scenarios in life. Cannot say enough about how amazing this book is, and I hate reading haha
 This book is a great reminder of to quit confirming. Be you and don’t put so much pressure on yourself to make yourself into something you are not cut out to be.
 Interesting, thought provoking book.  How to<br/>cut through the lies of our open and free society.  You have to decide what you value, and no one else can do the hard work but you.
 Awesome book. In the end you will be a happier person and will not have all that nasty stress in your life.
 This book will make you question everything you think you know about yourself. It's equally engaging, motivating, funny and challenging and I couldn't put it down.
 Got a bit slow towards the end but has some very important nuggets of wisdom throughout.
 Definitely helped me have a healthier outlook on life. I recommend this to everyone I know.
 If you are a deep feeler; this book is indispensable.
 As Described.
 Loved it. Everyone should read it. Not quite expected but a really great book. The end was a great reminder to remember to LIVE.
 I really enjoyed reading this. It reflects and affirms so many big truths about life, but explores them in a much more accessible way than many Buddhist and philosophical texts. You'll still need to read those "denser" texts to get a thorough understanding of the concepts. Or maybe not? This book makes the philosophical operational, a worthwhile read.
 Cant say enough great things about this book, practical and spot on. I tell everyone to buy it!
 This book really opened my mind. As a 20 something feeling lost, it has a calming effect as well as a swift kick in the butt. This book makes you think twice and maybe three times about your current problems. My problems aren't all that bad after all... The title was created for marketing reasons, but it was successful at grabbing my attention. I would recommend this book to anyone at any age, because there's always time to change ourselves.
 Irreverent, offensive, enlightening. Reading this book is like condensing years of wisdom that should have come from a parental figure, that somehow despite growing up in a normal middle class house, I had missed out on. Also, it has plenty of humour to lighten the emotional blows from how we missed the mark on what being a decent person means.
 This is not a feel good book. It's a motivating book. 10/10
 Eye opening and thought provoking.
 This is one of my favorite reads so far in 2017. I found myself actually laughing out loud while I was reading the first couple of chapters. There is a whole lot of curse words in the book but the way Manson says them is how a lot of people are thinking them. Overall I got a lot out of the book and have been able to apply some of the key points to my life and my interactions with others. I find myself looking at those people who say that they are going to do something different in a new light. It isn't cynicism as much as reality and dealing in reality gets things done so it is easier to cut through people's BS. I have already recommended the book to a couple of colleagues to read.
 I liked the first 38%, but then it got way too preachy for me.  Good undertone of streamlining angst in daily life and realizing important things... but it gets too prophetic after a while.
 Not your average fluffy self-help book. Actually very insightful without all the malarkey and journal taking.
 I like the way he writes,  it's modern.<br/>He makes good points.<br/>I love the ending! I can't wait for the next one.
 I’m sure the books will be a fine read but it came crumpled on one corner and sticky on the back. The package was perfect and it was new.
 After reading his blog post that kicked this off, I figured the whole book would be at least as good and I was wrong.  Save your money and just read the blog post.  The rest of the self help in all the other chapters just doesn't live up to the expectations.  All the other chapters could probably be reduced into one or two decent chapters.  Still less than a book.
 Arrived on time and packaged perfectly.  2 chapters in and love it so far.  Very much in line with my philosophy of life and happiness.
 Halfway through book. Love the humor. So far....it falls in line with my thinking. Great entertaining read to reinforce that mentality.
 Honest and true and worth the read. Gets to the point in an entertaining way. Can recommend for anyone struggling to understand their purpose
 This is it. Don't let the title fool you. This book is about digging deep and caring about all the things that matter to you. You will definitely think differently during and after you finish.
 There are a couple points where the book bogs down a bit, but overall it is well written and a quick read.
 Don't let the title fool you. This isn't about not caring it's about knowing WHAT to care about.
 Author has anger management issues and resentment due to an old breakup he can’t seam to get over. Written more like a personal rant. Got 3/4 in and by the time he was defending child molestors the book became nauseating and completely unreadable. Give it two stars for the catchy title but thats it.
 Good read
 I'm telling everyone I know to read it. The other day a friend called me with a problem wanting to know what to do and I told her that she already knew what she was going to do (and doing it) but the situation still sucked because, sometimes, that's just the way it is. She was in awe of my wisdom and I was only half way through the book.
 I'm almost finished with this &amp; can handle wait to start reading it again. Well done!
 Good starting point to restart your life. I enjoyed reading this book. It puts your life on track if you have lost your way.
 With a nice and fluid style, helps readers understand to prioritize our very scarce time, attention and intentions. Really enjoyed it and highly recommend for stressed people. (All of us?)
 Mark's writing is easy to read, like your best friend put his hand on your shoulder to talk to you. Worth reading if you have a "friend" keep asking you for money, your another half cheating on you, or your life is miserable because of others.
 Loooved this book, it really makes you think and puts life in perspective. An easy read and I found myself agreeing to many of the topics he discusses. This will be a book I keep on my desk as a reminder, would be something worth re-reading!
 Such a great book! Gives you great advice and pieces to take away and apply to your life. The author also had a really great sense of humor.
 Great if you are over self help...but not totally. To generalized idea of true blue DSM accorded Narcissistic personality disorder
 Great book! Clever name and great information
 I love it! Helped me put things back in order of priority. Makes me question what really matters to me.
 This is like music to my ears. Simplistic concepts you'd think are just common knowledge but society messes with your minds.
 As I read, I felt that the main value of the book could be ascertained within the first couple chapters. After those first few, the author becomes rather repetitive. Additionally, the adopted voice feels forced and purely for shock value. I think skimming a brief summary of the book would satiate most readers’ level of interest.
 Dont let the title fool you. The is not what you would expect it to be. Truly thought provoking. The words of these pages will have you asking yourself why do I do the things I do. And will also help you to look at your life in a different perspective. Not a very long read either. Would be easy to read in a day or so!
 Great book for reinforcing your center. Pretty straight forward and more smack in your face than mystic.
 I liked it so much my book club is now reading it
 Read this. Every single word. Carefully. Chew on it. Read it again. Reflect. I lost several people to death in a short period of time. Very important and dear people in my life. This book is spot on on. Live. Live well. Choose. Read this and understand.
 I'm not American so I will get to the point: The book is easy to read and entertaining.<br/>It's psychology with a comical twist. Lots of good examples.<br/>I could relate to lots of it, and got tons of slaps in the face.<br/>I loved it, and so did my brother in law who got it for Christmas.
 Not as expected .... really is great book for teenagers and no one with life experience ! Very disappointing
 I enjoyed this book a lot, it gave me some insight into trying to find what matters to me most.
 This book will force you to ask yourself the hard questions and hopefully you will be able to identify what you are doing and how to change.  (Don't let a little cussing keep you from learning about yourself. )
 Loved this book. Very enlightening and the way it's written, very entertaining.  You will get over the expletives, trust me. It's worth it,. I bought two paperbacks for friends but not available until September!
 I'm only a little bit through this book and my perspective on life is already being awakened! Written in a forward, no crap manner, the author gets right to the point with no fluff. Excellent self help book!
 Everyone should read this book, satirical but true
 I am new to book reading, very good book , this book teach life lessons
 This was a well written book that kept me interested. Every self help book I’ve read I’ve never finished. This one i did. It also addressed death which put a different thought process in my mind about it.<br/><br/>I am definitely getting this book for a friend. I know she’ll read it and pass it on.
 He us a bit crazy but I like his views
 From the start the author writes so honestly and raw, truly such a good book, so far.
 Mark Manson forces you to thoroughly examine your convictions within your social context. When you reflect back on this book hopefully you’ll discover that this read was a must read and not a waste of your precious time. One of the better books I read this year. I highly recommend this book.
 Honestly I have not read this book even though I bought it a year ago. I simply have so few fcks left to give I can’t even bring myself to reading a book about giving even fewer.<br/>I do love leaving it on my coffee table as a constant reminder though.
 Absolutely amazing book. Thank you for writing this Mark Manson. This has truly changed my perspective on life.
 I quite enjoyed this book. Though there were certain points where I thought to myself: "Nope, I'm not really on board with that insight...", it did not detract from the healthy dose of wisdom this book provides. Easily digestible, thought-provoking, and fun.
 I'm going to be honest I have only read the first chapter, but already in the first chapter the concepts are so simple and counter to the 'positive' way we are being forced into.  I love this book already.
 Thought this would be a pop psychology book, but was pleasantly surprised at the depth at which Mark was able to take us. Highly recommend to anyone wanting to better themselves.
 This book changed my life. Mark Manson is pretty funny.
 I had to stop reading this book at night because I was keeping my wife up laughing.  Very funny perspective.
 Mark Manson is able to offer insight about the most complicated problems in such a simple way you wonder why you didn’t think of it yourself.  I’m about to start my third reading.  The parts about dealing with pain have helped me through a difficult time.  If you haven’t read any of his articles, start now.
 I really enjoyed this book.  As someone who suffers from depression and anxiety, this book really helped me start to look at things with a different perspective.  Mark does a great job of distilling complex ideas down to a relatable way no matter what your personal situation is.  The last part of the book about death didn't really resonate with me but the rest of the book was great.  I highly recommend this book.
 Truly inspiring. I now follow Mark's blog and look forward to new articles.  I'm not big on profanity and almost didn't chose this book because of it but glad I didn't let it stop me. I would recommend this book to all my friends.
 Very good book! Got it for my husband but ended up reading it myself. You should definitely give it a try!
 I really enjoyed this book ! I was curious about whether or not I’d like it but found it very enlightening. It’s easy to look at the title and think .. it’s one of those books... but there are so many glowing insights to share!
 Get passed the language and this book is great!! Funny, informative and full of good life practices. Manson is hysterical in his writing style with stories and practical life advice. Well done
 Informative,  good food for thought.
 Don't waste your money.  Bought this as a book club selection.
 I kept hearing about this book from many people and social media, I decided to read the first chapter one day at a bookstore and ended up reading three chapters that night. I bought it the next day and finished it in 3 days. It's entertaining, beautifully written, and very honest. It has become one of my favorite books of all time and I've already started recommending it to my friends.
 Definitely an entertaining book and a quick read, and don’t let any of that take away from the actual weight of the subject matter or the value in the advice given.  This is a great read and should pay dividends to anyone looking at ways to reprioritize daily living
 Funny at first. And then highly reflective. Thought provoking. A good read. I have a friend who recommended it to me.
 This is my new favorite book. I listened to it on the way to work in one week. Love it.
 Easy read, and some good nuggets of wisdom in here, as long as you can get by the repetitive use of the F-word.  His willingness to provide insight from his own life instead of the theoretical is appealing.
 Very insightful. I've tried incorporating many of the philosophies into my daily life. I will likely read again down the road. Highly recommend!
 The title is all you need to read and understand how you can’t comtrol everything and worry about you.
 I read all the bad reviews from the armchair intellectual types but I personally found the book refreshing with quite a few well made points. Overall I enjoyed it quite a bit.
 If you're someone that struggles with pleasing people, this is the book for you. I loved this book, great insight in humorous way.
 A great book on self reflection and now to make the most of our lives. I love it.
 Not what I would call a terrific read, but is worth the time.  The book reminds us that we do not have to conform.  Choose what is important to you, and let the rest go.
 I really like this no nonsense book. I enjoyed its honesty. I would definitely recommend this to everyone. Must read!
 This wasn't fundamentally new or insightful (based on my history of reading, etc.) but the book takes a fresh look with an invigorating tone to land some key messages that can help one to focus on building new habits and ditching those that we decide don't serve our life's purpose. It's dry and funny, which is a bonus.
 Rudely Inspiring. It's like if "I hope they serve beer in hell" was a self help book.
 The presentation of tge marerial is great. Fun and easy to read. The material it self is ok. I don’t think I learned much from this book.
 I liked this book a lot, helped me to chenge prespective.
 Love it.  Very good humorous reading.  Very good points throughout.
 Love this book, once you get past the beginning it starts to make good points!
 This book will change your life. I’ve read it three times already! A different perspective on how to deal with the inevitable low points in life- you will not be disappointed!
 So I’ve never been one to read self-help books and I’m not going through anything in particular to think that I needed to read one. But one was recommended to me. It was brutally honest and the type of self-help book you don’t know you needed.
 I don't know why it took me so long to find this GREAT BOOK! Do yourself a favor and read this...It will change your life
 By far one of the best books I've ever read. It struck a chord that I can't even begin to explain.
 Do not find it interesting as expected.
 Should be a must read for everyone. I bought an extra copy for my sister :-)
 This book is extremely infrmational and has changed my way of thinking and also my way of life. I have learned so much from this book that i will probably read it again, i highly reccomend this read to everyone!
 This books is hilarious. It was written in a way you will get hooked and learn something valuable. The author did a great job writing it. The quality of the book both physically and mentally were great.
 Great read, I felt the last couple of chapters really drove the message home. The book may be a bit drawn out or hyped up but it is a great read to assist you in aligning your priorities. I recommend!
 Great book. Puts dumb stuff into perspective. A must read.
 Great book, fantastic sense of humour, the author knows what he writes about.
 This is honestly one of the best books I have ever read.  Very to the point on topics such as motivation, identity, and basically how to be a happy<br/>bada**.  Great stories and tied together perfectly at the end with the concept of death( which we mostly dread to think about as humans). Can't recommend this book enough.
 As someone who has been reading "self-help" books, this is a really yet needed slap in the face.
 Totally worth the read!
 I have now read this book 4 times, in a row. I have also bought copies for friends and family. Hanson's book is straight up, no-nonsense, "You are Here....Come this way for a satisfying life.". Loved it, love it, will continue to love it.
 I expected more.  It just seems like cussing for the sake of cussing, without any real emotion or intent.
 Lots of profanity but the title gives that away. Awesome read though. Highly recommend.
 I let my life be a bit too ruled by others or thinking I need to be more, do more to the point of mentally exhausting myself and never ever feeling good enough. This book helped me a lot with this mentality and my almost entitled way of thinking. 10/10 will recommend and have already recommended lol. Great read!
 Amazing book!! Loved it. Mark is a wise man. There is no doubt that I will keep it and re-read it many times over my life as well as recommend it to friends and family. Don’t let the Fbombs of the first chapter dissuade you from finishing the book. I found the way it is written as refreshing, honest, deep, and humorous.
 LOL... all I can say is it's a good read
 Had some interesting points.
 Brilliant no-nonsense "self-help" book. A totally different approach. My 34 year old son was enjoying it, so I decided to download it - wow - everyone should read this book. A magnifying glass into my ego - uncomfortable shake-up but looking forward to trying on new values and metrics and letting go of entitlement.
 Bought as a Christmas gift for my husband &amp; he loves it. States it’s a must read for everyone
 This one lays it down as it is.  Mark Manson's advice is solid and his writing style is straight forward with no B.S..  Really insightful.
 I am only half way through this book and love it so much. I have laughed out loud at some of the hilarious and well-written points. I have needed a pick-me-up lately too and this book is getting me out of my funk. About to buy more copies to give to my friends as gifts!
 Great insight, tone, message, and execution. Must read. Don't think about it. Don't consider it. Just buy the book and start reading it now.
 Great book!! Kept me laughing, and thinking...!
 I finished it in one sitting, and immediately ordered copies for people I care about.<br/><br/>Mark Manson is the voice of millennials everywhere.<br/><br/>I wouldn't be surprised to see him as one of the most known and respected authors of this generation.
 Really happy that I didn't buy a step by step guide on how to live a better life. I purchased it  to gain perspective on my own experiences and philosophies. To that end, I'm incredibly happy with the content and maybe a little bit happier about my life. That is, a little bit happier then I already was! Soooo yeah, buy it.
 This was a gift for a friend.  She really loved the book.
 A good book to take for a plane round trip. Definitely can see the difference between the authors experiences and views versus those of older generations. Love the story of Disappointment Panda.
 If you're someone who struggles with reading or finding some self worth in life, pick this up immediately. Honestly, im not a big reader of books but I decided to buy this on Amazon and use the Kindle app to read it on my phone and my oh my what a reward and good choice this was. 10/10. Best 101 improvwmwnt book I've picked up
 I wish everyone had to read this book. Amazing and very eye opening
 A pleasure to read.<br/><br/>The most impactful line was 'with great responsibility comes great power.'<br/><br/>Keep writing! We need more writers like this.
 I liked some parts of the book and did not really like other parts.  It is way over simplified and not as easy as the author tries to make it sound.
 If you are like me you might have read few self help book which tell you to do things and take actions and  control the situation and what not . I liked this book as it starts with setting up a real expectation. This book personally helped me to let go of things and give “ckuf” to only relevant and important stuff
 Excellent book! So many great points and comparisons to real world topics/conversations.
 This is one of my all time favorites. This book is a very easy read and it keeps the reader's attention.
 Mark's ideas are very well articulated and easy to understand. The book's best quality is that it invites the reader to challenge their long held notions using unambiguous and uncomplicated arguments. I'm glad that I read it!!
 This is one of my favorites. There are some moments when you're like, h do we really need to know this? But those moments are few, there are so many good things in here.
 Simply an amazing book. I can't wait to read it again to capture details I've surely missed. I wish I'd had something like this to read as a 20 something year old, which is why I bought copies for my kids. As a matter of fact, I've purchased 10 copies so far as gifts to help enlighten important people in my life.
 worth listening too
 In spite of the of the title this is a significant book.  The author Cleverly uses the f bomb to get your attention. It works.
 I really liked this book. It relates to what is happening in society now. Marc is honest and upfront and showed me that sometimes I do give too many f***ks but it’s okay I can change that.
 Hard-hitting, get real book.  Gets your priorities straight!
 Open. Honest. Funny. Poignant.<br/>Please get over avoidance of the f-word, and read this book. The message is relevant to everyone and commuicates clearly the issues we all face in an instantaneously critical society. Then it explains how we can better deal with this to relieve our self-inflicted stress and anxiety.
 I absolutely loved this book! It was funny, but serious and educational at the same time. Easy, interesting reading. The whole book made so much sense!!
 Relatively captivating and definitely unconventional in terms of self-help/improvement; it resonated with me, but it won’t be for everyone. Regardless, it is short, sweet and reads fast, so go for it!
 In an era of "it's not you, it's them" feel good books, this author turns tables and makes the reader confront their own responsibility for their life...terrific read!
 Great read!  I would recommend to everyone !
 I love the grit and in-your-face truth. This book has restarted my whole outlook on life and has inspired me to seek better values. I recommend this book to anyone and highly recommend this book to those people who feel lost in life and need a new start.
 Very readable. Comical take on a serious subject. I finished reading within 2 hours. I then let my mom borrow it and she loved it too! I wish it were longer!
 Relatable, easy reading book but didn’t stand out to me. It is just another self help book. I was expecting more  The chapters seem to repeat. Redundancy.
 I never review anything, but I can't help myself here–this book deserves praise and everybody should read it. It's something that I could not put down and when it was finally over I felt quite introspective, questioning what exactly were the things I valued. It makes you really take an honest look at your own life and being okay with being ordinary.<br/><br/>Great read. Highly recommended.
 sortof over the top with the f bombs... but I guess the book is targeted at a certain audience that would not otherwise be exposed to more formal discussions of this subject
 This is the book that I actually want to read again. Honest, logical and makes me reconsider so many things. BUY IT NOW . you will not be disappointed.
 This isn't a happy read.  It's a book of a young adults turmoil to find ones place in the world and making sense of it all.  There are bits of sound wisdom but I'm not all the more enlightened by the read.  Respect for the writing but wouldn't recommend it to others.
 Had me laughing out loud and really makes you think about life and what's important. I loved that the author doesn't sugar coat anything and just when you think you disagree with the ideals or you may be getting offended, his theory comes full circle and you start to understand the thought behind it. Funny, entertaining, and outside the box.
 It's rare when finding a book, song, or something that resembles a situation that you're going through in life. In finding and reading this book.  Helped me with the re introduction of life that it's ok to be different and think outside of the box.
 Love this book have already purchased 5 for family and clients :)
 If you can get past some of the expletives, this book is a jewel of helpful insight for those struggling with getting through some of life's challenges.  I've passed this book on to co-workers.
 70% of people gave this book 5 stars. I feel at home with the majority of readers who like this book and give the finger to the people who clearly give to much of a f@ck to understand it.
 Best leader book I have read.<br/><br/> An incredible book and an anti-establishment book. I am a leadership expert (put me in google). This rails against what is wrong with our US society, military and for that matter the West. Everyone is brainwashed to believe unless they are constantly happy, praised, center of attention, a millionaire, beautiful (false) person, you must be great at everything. Mark Manson brings the harsh reality to life, that the people that go through failure, pain and setbacks, but never quit because the "give a @#$%" about one or a few things, instead of everything. He sheds light too that the so-called brilliant people have many downfalls, but focused on one narrow niche; yet that does not make them better than any individual that also focuses on one or a few areas to master them after a series of harsh experiences. I taught a graduate course at Georgetown University using the Gettysburg Campaign as the platform to teach leadership and strength of character. We talked about the Gettysburg Address, one of the most brilliant short 7 minute talks ever. The students believed the myth that Lincoln wrote the speech on the train travelling to Gettsyburg from Washington D.C. Nothing can be further from the truth, as Lincoln got an invite (behind the main speaker) weeks before, he began the draft, and worked on it day and night, while allowing his team of rivals like Secretary of State Steward, to edit, and he even worked on it the night before the talk at the new National Cemetery. My point is that people are led to believe that talent is natural and comes easy, when in fact it does not. Achievements generally come from years if not decades of hard work and numerous setbacks. Those who "Give a @#$%" about just that, and never give up, are the happiest of people. They never give up. It was also a trait that the best armies in the world focused on, not the perfect officer (as we do today in the US Army) but the leader that never gave up, and always over came failure, through strength of character. This book is about how to develop strength of character, the bedrock of leadership.
 ...said in a contemporary voice and laced with humor in such a way that the text keeps the subject engaging enough for any brain, no matter how preoccupied, to finish the book and enjoy doing it.
 Was for my son he likes it
 I am not someone who likes to read and this book made me interested in finishing it. It is deep, it is funny, it is engaging, it is unapologetic and above all else, it is real. Thank you for writing this book and giving me a new perspective to life.
 My daughter recommended.  Too much cussing for me.
 it's a funny book but a bit too harsh and arrogant for my taste... these type of subjects should be addressed with kindness in my point of view
 The book helps identify where to focus and what needs to be let go. Worth reading it. Plus, I do like the humorous way the book is written.
 Most of this book seemed like an excuse to swear.  The final couple of chapters tied things together pretty well though.
 There is some merit in this mindset to manage ones mental state
 Something everyone should read. Reality at its best. If you want to grow as a person, then this is for you
 Mark Manson addresses many issues in this book that will force you to think critically about your life values and direction. I definitely recommend this for someone suffering from anxiety or life in general.<br/><br/>Great read. Not flowery and brutally honest
 A good read when you really need to prioritize an evaluate what you want and really should care about.
 I have not finished reading the book and I already love it!  Great read!
 This is a great book!  Just what I needed.  Everyone should read this!
 Please, please, please read this book! I urge you to read this life changing work by Mr. Manson. He tells you not to live your life, with just positivity but with practicality, and how to operate your life according to yourself and not according to anyone or anything else.
 Despite the title, this book offers some great advice and it really hits on some of the key issues our society deals with today.  Great for anyone who wants a quick read and light approach to self improvement
 The book was very intriguing and insightful. Great read. It really opened my eyes so I could view my life differently.
 Actually a really good book, not too preachy like a self-help book just a lot of good information.
 I was pleasantly surprised at how forward, but entertaining, this book is. Happy to recommend to those who need a reminder that life is life and to not get held up on the little things.
 It's an amazing book with so much insight. I was applying these words of wisdom immediately and I will continue to do so.
 What more can you say.  The article helped change my life.  So I bought the book because I felt I owed it to Mark Manson.  The book is great and it has other info the article doesn't have.  If you find yourself giving to many F...s buy this book.
 Life isn't a grand narrative with meeting there's no great summary that Ties up all the loose ends at the end. We are nothing more than a relationships with the people around us.<br/><br/>Mark suggest that we don't treat those people like crap it's good idea.
 Excellent book, thoroughly well written with lots of practical ideas. The five principles in the second half came as a big and very welcome surprise after quite an irreverent but very entertaining opening few chapters.
 No better way to put it, AMAZING. the author speaks the truth the entire time. I definitely recommend.
 Candid book offering good insight into self-preservation
 I love that this book is not the typical self help book. Its filled with humor and a little profanity.
 I give this book 5 stars just because it turned out to be exactly what I needed during a difficult time. I appreciate this authors raw honesty and his use of past experiences to show us what life and death really mean.
 It took me in directions that where very unexpected &amp; I am excited that it did. I would recommend this to anyone looking to shift towards a more positive way of looking at your life.
 Great title - but other than that the writing and advice is sub-par.
 Great read and beautiful addition to any shelf.
 This book gave me life. Also helped me realize that my relationship was not a healthy one. I got out of it and I’m better today than I was when I was with him. Great read on entitlements. I recommend this book to anyone who feels like the world is coming down on them.
 Purchased for a friend who struggles with anxiety and it has provided resources that are unratable. She continues to pull from this book in her daily life.
 This book feels like real life. I think anyone could learn and improve themselves with this book. I like the honesty of where Western culture is currently at socially.
 Best book I read in a long time. Manson's insightful &amp; entertaining style made me analyze and start calling myself on my own BS.  Highest recommendation.
 This is a great book. It’s an easy read and once you start, you want to finish it as quickly as possible. The author uses humor to drive only serious topic. I highly recommend this for everyone.
 The approach to life being constant choices makes every decision at every point absolutely ok. Whether it was in hindsight wrong  or right, it was the correct decision. My life makes more sense to me from this perspective .<br/><br/>I plan to recommend this book to everyone !!<br/><br/>Eli Wilner
 So far i'm enjoying the book  lot.
 Good read. Felt a little repetitive, but all-in-all would recommend.
 While you can’t really not give an F... because not giving on F... means you give an F... This book teaches you to care about what is important such as family, true love, friendships and not care so much about the superficial in order to attain a higher level of happiness.
 One of the best books I've ever read.
 So far, I'm really enjoying this book. It's a good read. It's made me rethink a lot of things and have more appreciation for the things I do have and not dwell so much on what I wish I had. It's made me appreciate my failed attempts and really just have a different outlook on things in life.
 never mind the expletives, this is a serious book.  The best self help I've read since Habits.
 I originally bought this book as a gag gift, but it turned out to be a great book! Great perspective infused with some dry humor. Good read for a long plane ride.
 I really enjoyed this book, by far surpassed what I read in reviews thanks mark for your advice and help on some of the subjects everyone avoids Each day
 This is not nearly as cynical as I would have presumed; well written
 Content is not consistent nor is it applicable. Too bad -- the basic idea is true.
 Great book and quick read. Def a positive silver lining book for any debbie downers
 Everyone should read this book.  Hilariously gets to the point about so many things in life.  Amazing Book.  Bought extra copies and send them to family members and friends.  They also thoroughly enjoyed.  Author does you the "F" word extensively, but if you are able to get past that....ENJOY!
 Good summer read. It had some very intuitive points as to why not to give a F during these high-paced social media times. The author didn’t have to go into his age, etc. I think that’s where it dragged and unneeded. The last chapters were good reminder and worth the read.
 Interesting twist on self-help books.  It made me think, and I like that.<br/>Don't let the title fool you.  It is not telling you to stop caring about things!<br/>It advises you to consider carefully what you devote your time/energy to.
 A great perspective on the importance of expecting and dealing with life's stressors.  A few too many f-bombs for my preference, but I have to admit it gets one's attention.
 Love this book. Easy to read and great writing.
 I've met Mark a few times and seen him on his journey helping people and developing his message. Subtle Art is a great read both in terms of its educational and entertainment value. Inspirational and enlightening. Zero filler. Highly recommended.
 I think my "eh" review is mostly a reflection of the ridiculous hype that this book received. IMO, nothing "Best Selling" here.
 A good read beyond the typical bus book re how to succeed, etc but  rather a reminder of how and why to live.
 Ehh... read half of it and got bored with it
 Love love love this book if there is a book I recommend to read it is this one
 My wife is reading the book, but she is still giving to many f’s
 Changed my life!
 Really is a nuanced approach. Great book, prime for rereads.
 I enjoyed reading this book, and found myself highlighting a lot of it. It is mostly about personal responsibility, but some of the ways he illustrates it are unique and entertaining. A good kick in the pants to be self- reflective and take charge. I recommend it!
 It was OK but honestly i could've written this book myself. I learned nothing new and already have the mindset of the author. I can see other people benefiting from reading this book but i'm not one of them.
 Very interesting way of looking at life. Though at first it may shock some people and it may sound very depressing but when given enough thought it makes a lot of sense.
 All I can say is if you're thinking about purchasing, do yourself a favor and grab this book. Very helpful. Probably one of the best "self help" books I've read thus far!
 Not like your typical self help book... fun to read, good pace and most importantly no complex framework of things to remember / try. Puts down on paper very sensible thoughts that intuitively we all know but quickly lose sight of during day to day life.
 Yea to this book
 I just received my book and I couldn't be more excited to read it! Only thing is I realized there is a tear in the bottom right corner. It's unfortunate because I always keep my books in mint condition but other than that I am excited to read it!
 Thoroughly enjoyed.  While a little uneven, the strong points shine.  Recommend for anyone feeling overwhelmed or adrift, looking for some well reasoned advice.
 Take this book with a grain of salt but there are some great points in here. You'll want a highlighter as you read.
 Purchased as a gift, already own the audio book. This is a great book for anyone who gets anxious easily and holds on to things.
 Decent read. Some ideals can be debated stated in the book. Amazing pristine condition
 Ok regular-guy philosophy on what not to care about.... but also what to care about.
 3 stars for what's inside. To be fair it's not terrible, I did skim through most of it, rather than tossing it after the first few chapters. It's too politically correct for my liking, especially for a book with this title.
 This is a book everyone should read. I absolutely loved it. I bought a copy for my sister even before I finished it myself. It's deep and reflective but it is also super fun to read and endlessly entertaining. A real page turner to the very end.
 Loved this book! Awesome unique perspective and very funny! I laughed out loud a few times while reading. Would definitely recommend to anyone!
 The breaking down of life in such a short form is an art on its own. I’m left with serious questions and lights glaring on my shortcomings. It feels like this was written specifically for me.
 Love it... well writen. I love Mark Manson blog he is one of the kind...
 So very.  insightful, this really reminds the reader to take a different approach to the things that stress us out and helping with how to choose what we care about
 Growing up in an entitled generation, this book helped me understand the importance of what ones values and why you value them. But more importantly when it’s time, and how, to change or improve them. Just read it. It’s barely 200 pages.
 Liked the way the author is so frank and gives examples from his and others lives. It’s all in the title. This book tells you what to let go and what to care about. It’s for anyone who is in a confused state and thinks that 24 hours a day is not enough time. Highly recommend.
 Very frank and to the point about priorities we have or choose to have. It's witty too and the author does not shy from telling it like it is.
 While driving I listened to Mark being interviewed on one of Lewis Howes' podcasts "The School of Greatness."  He was authentic and very entertaining.  Mark's book is more than I expected.  Really digs deep with experiential examples that explains the shroud of entitlement we wear in trying to be better than others or conversely being the victim.  His theme appears to be honesty and to forget about finding self.  Instead, grow.  Focus on value, a legacy that serves others, not I.  His message is complex and takes attention when reading, but Mark's book will be easy to use as a reference point.  I intend to read it again
 Followed his free blog for a while.  Love his writing... great book
 I'm here for the same reason you are - Chris Hemsworth's instagram photo. So I picked up Mark Manson's #TheSubtleArtOfNotGivingAF* and at first I thought it was a cute coincidence that Bukowski and Orwell are referenced in the first chapter, not because Bukowski's a mastermind but because it made sense since this book seems like a 3rd cousin to his flippant writing style and philosophy.<br/><br/>By the 3rd chapter I started wondering if "New York Times BestSeller" means anything anymore. This is getting a 2-star review from me on Amazon 😌<br/><br/>The word "superficial" comes to mind and not in a materialistic kind of way, but the way that means on the surface, like Buzzfeed articles and teenybopper listicles read: they graze the tip of an iceberg matter before they fear losing readers so nothing ends up a fully researched and well-written point, instead one-liners and memes have replaced the rest of what could have been a good article.<br/><br/>Manson's whole book is like all his blogs pieced together, and none of them are long-form. Peppered with the overuse of f-bombs which I was offended by not because of the vulgarity, but because he butchers the art of using profanity to drive a point home. Every time I read a bad book I think it's time I write one myself, then I remember how long it takes me to write an email or over-wordy Instagram post and realize I don't have 11 years to spare. #aspergerproblems
 I like the audible books... I am having a hard time focusing on this one... not sure why... Maybe I just don't give a F***
 Makes you put the world and yourself into perspective. Helped me to fight my own bad thoughts. Written in a direct, confronting style. Love it!
 Good book. The person who got it really needed it. I hope it helps.
 Thought it was going to be more humorous but was surprised and delighted with the thoughtful insights... very good read
 Great read
 Good read that keep me interested throughout the chapters. You definitely will gain some insight about the way you value things and what you may think of as a failure may actually be a step towards success.
 A must read!
 Now, I understand why 5 million bought this book!  I've recommended it to all my clients.  Loads of truth, told in a hard-hitting manner. Really glad folks are listening.
 Frank, honest, vernacular, from the heart
 “Don’t worry... be happy!”  Or, at least, don’t let your worry spiral into a self-defeating addiction.  Yes, be furious... selectively.  And, then, act wisely upon your indignation!
 must read
 Great philosophical book about the mindset needed to achieve a better life. Again it does show you how just puts ideas out there and dicusses then. Well written great humor
 First book out of the many self help books I have started. It is definitely a must read. Manson shows a different tough love approach of life. Each section can be applied to anything and probably everyone. I will definitely be referencing back to this book and keep its values close to heart throughout my life
 Very helpful
 Can't recommend it enough or to enough people.  One of my top reads of the year.  No f-ing kidding!
 *warning F bomb &amp; many, many other fascinating words* 🙌🏻💪🏻😂😜👍🏼👍🏼<br/><br/>I just started reading this book, I’m only 30 pages in and I love it.  I’m getting my priorities in check and this is helping and making me laugh.  I can’t go wrong with this. 🥂
 I love the honesty of the book. He states we think too much of ourselves and he lays down the reasons very succinctly. Great book that acts as a mirror to your values. What do you stand for?
 Very straightforward and to the point. Liked the frankness. Good read.
 Hands-down my favorite book
 EVERYONE should read this!
 I don't read much, but this was a must read.
 Great book! Helped me rethink a lot of things in my day
 Wow!!!! Talk about simply choosing to have a different perspective!!! Great informative book! I stopped a few times to think about my own life and values. How fear has often crippled me but now realizing in the same breath it could be the one thing that pushes me to live!!!
 Good smart-ass title for humorous but serious subject. Great insights, applicable examples, good read, good reference to keep on-hand.
 very easy to understand and very coherent
 Love the book and it's really informative.
 Love this
 This book is both hilarious and offers fantastic advice! It's full of foul language, poop jokes, and fascinating insight. I honestly wish more people would read this (some people really need to listen to what Mark has to say).
 This book. Is an easy read but I got about two thirds through and put it down for a year or so and finally just finished it ~ wished I'd done so earlier- the best part is at the end.
 This book is not just for people who are looking for help or strategies to deal with one of lifes many struggles, it is equally important for people who don't realise that they may need help or need to consider alternate strategies in dealing with lifes struggles that they think they have successfully conquered.
 The wisdom in this book will astonish you.<br/>Give this book a shot. It will really shake you.
 My favorite book of all time. I’ve bought it for all my friends and family
 Great book for prioritizing what you need to focus on.
 For sharing a heartfelt, funny and inspiring read about living a full and fearless authentic existence. Just read this book, you will be so stoked that you did.
 Excellent thought-provoking book that makes you reassess your core values and choices in life. Highly recommended for anyone seeking meaning in their life and pursuing self-improvement.
 I really enjoyed the first 2/3 of this book. After that, I nearly lost interest. But, I decided that not finishing would be a problem I did not want to solve. So I muscled through it. Good info. Easy read.
 Don’t let the title for you. This is an awesome read. I have bought this book for several of my friends they also have enjoyed it
 The title makes it sound alluring but it's not that deep. I would suggest you check it out from library and read it before deciding to buy a copy for your collection.
 Very insightful! Helped me make since of things in a dark time of my life! I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a fresh perspective and different outlook on life. Definitely bucks the norm, but doesn’t at the same time.
 Just had a karate kid moment with this book, i loved that by the end everything felt clear and all the lessons concise.
 It was an easy read. Some lessons learned.
 I have mastered the subtle art.
 The book itself conveys a  lasting message of how we all should prioritize our lives. The text reads easily and is fluid in flow. Greatly appreciated by the people I have gifted a copy to, who are from early 20's to 50's in age.
 Carefully pick your battles WISELY.
 Fantastic Read.! A must read for someone who is tired of the So called "Self Help" gurus out there that do not really define the problems that you may be dealing with.
 This is not hour traditional self help book.  Mark makes you laugh and he makes you think.  Read this book.
 Good read
 Reinforces some common sense ideas. Some what repetitive
 Don’t be discouraged by the first chapter...power through the author’s shoe horning of the word “f*@$” and you won’t be sorry.  Great read and lots of food for thought.  Mark obviously has studied and incorporated many of the great philosophers, and simplified the message.  A unique expression of life’s truth.  Bravo!
 Good
 Thanks
 Lost interest
 Funny
 Funny ass, REAL book!
 This book is for anyone who worries too much (so basically for everyone). Really changed my perspective and made me stress less and love more.
 Great book! In amazing condition!
 Recommend this to all young people. Shares some very good life lessons. Being true to yourself and your close relationships can be gleaned from this book.
 I have been resisting reading this book, it seemed a bit too mainstream and predictable, I was wrong. It's awesome, and super interesting and -possibly life changing. So happy to have bought this.
 Love
 I loved this book! Its not going to solve all your problems, but it helps you to think about your problems in a different way. I enjoyed the humor throughout! I laughed more than I ever have. Reading this felt like I was talking to my "honest friend' who tells it like it is - good advice, without the bullsh*t.
 Wow! What a Book.
 A very honest and straight foward approach to learning to adjust your mentality as you navigate life's happenings. This was written with a good sense of humor which was a nice touch.
 Ok
 Good book
 Loved it! A must read for anyone who wants to admit they have no clue in life or what they are doing.
 Good book.  As a person with a psych background and working in clinical psychology and within the 12 step community, I enjoyed the style of this book as a pleasant departure from the standard self help style literature.  Recommended.
 I’d recommend this book to anyone, especially anyone who is confused or scared about the future. Whoever is anxious. This was a great read and kept me interested and wanting to read what’s next. And the conclusion... chilling and satisfying. I am very happy that I read and completed this book.
 If you don't believe in this just a little bit after reading this book you never will. An eye opener, a reality check and what a way to take a good look in the mirror. Fabulous read.
 This is the best book I have ever read in my life. It changed my mind set in so many ways.
 At turns deeply insightful and laugh out loud hilarious, this book is a great read for anyone who thinks. The title belies the depth. Prompted some serious soul searching in this reviewer.
 This book is great and it’s so real. It really made me think about how I view things in my life
 This book has lots of good takeaways and good for anyone going through something or just interested in learning a new outlook on life. Would definitely recommend.
 Great book and definitely recommend! Author is blunt and to the point.
 great book for millenials to read to gain a more grounded understanding of reality in our social media dominated world.
 Wish I had written it!
 Amazing, everyone should read this book.
 Mark Manson is very personable.  I love how blunt he puts things.
 I am a Christian and try to lead my life with Christian principles. I found this book extremely helpful because to me it was practicable. Many good concepts to apply to your life. We are not prefect and we do not live in a perfect world. This book could change your life!
 A very good read
 I like to think of myself as more introspective than the average person and when I began reading this book it sucked me in with all the affirmations.  The book was thoughtful,  funny, and well written.  There are a handful of people I'm going to share this with!
 Take time to listen to at least a chapter at a time. I like this convenient way to " read" a book. Wear good ear buds when possible.
 This book was refreshingly honest and thought provoking. It's not going to change your life but it certainly tempts you to dangle your legs over the edge of your own metaphorical cliff.
 I loved this book and everyone I know that bought it concurs.
 great book. always loved mark manson for his articles and loved his humor in this
 And that's good.  If you ever were to stamd in front of a group of accomplished writers in this feild and say, "Now look. Just level with me",  this perspective from Mark Manson is the one that is not designed to make you feel better or special. It tells you what you need to hear ... with light hearted humour along the way.
 Still reading
 if you have not read this book yet, you're doing it wrong.
 This book is perfect for gift. Manson’s blog is my go to for a pick me up article or advice. This book helped me get over a break up. Highly recommend it to anyone’
 I havent read this yet but My book was RIPPED at the spine. Like all the pages are hanging on by a string. Its too much hassle to return it and I dont really mind....but just know that this could happen
 Interesting perspective. Easy read.
 Good book
 Generally speaking, it's a good book about some philosophy of the attitude to life. However, the author makes a lot of claims without scientific evidence backing them up.<br/>The general ideas like choosing your values, admitting problems, and taking responsibilities are good for refreshing the mind in an atmosphere of encouraging "positive thinking". However, it lacks specific techniques that are shown to be useful. Most of the time, the change of mind doesn't lead to change of behavior. Also, the author has a lot of speculations about social phenomena and their causes, solely based on his own observations. It is not much different from other self-help books in this regard. To be fair, those things are not critical for the book. I think it's worth reading. And readers can think about his ideas. But it's not as scientific as I would like it to be.
 This is a provocatively-titled book with some good points in it. Ultimately, it is poorly written and is many, many times longer than it needs to be, just to fill the book. Ultimately, largely a waste of time unless you skim large sections of the book.
 Really makes you self aware and think about where you are, where you’ve been and what is yet to come. I will read it again and again.
 The author does a great job at making a point. Intuitive, funny and very helpful.
 It's not about lazy thinking. It's actually the opposite. Relevant for today's social media addicted society.
 Entertaining read. Read it on a plane. Good perspective Would recommend everyone give it a read. Mostly applicable to young people
 There was a little more personal narrative than I expected,  but I will re-listen to parts of it to remind myself that it takes constant remembering of what I do deeply care about in order to not give a f*.
 helped me put a new perspective on work challenges
 Title of the book caught my attention. Writer uses light humour and own experiences to bring across his points clearly. Each chapter progressively help readers to gain insights of how to be happier and to view things in different perspectives.  A good read anytime of the day!
 Catches you on the first page.
 Recommended by a friend and lives up to the hype.<br/>I wish many people in my life would read it.
 Great book! No fluff, no feel good pop psychology, just no nonsense life advise designed for people who need to hear the truth but might not want to.
 This is my favorite book!! Hands down.
 It was just OK for me.  Passed along to a friend who was VERY excited to read it and will appreciate it more than me.
 Terrific book!
 This is the realest book I have ever read.  Thank you for opening my mind!  I hope I can change my values on life.
 Yes this book contains some swear-words and is written in a conversational tone. Yes - it does not contain bullet-points at the end of each section. Neither does it contain many references. It's not an academic book. So what? Does it mean I can't learn anything from it? No. I haven't reread many books but this is one of them. Because it delivers some meaning and doesn't focus on being more productive, happy, fulfilled etc. However, reading this book and implementing some of the wisdom in the book will make the reader exactly more productive, happy and fulfilled.
 After hearing multiple people recommend this book, and after an unfortunate experience of almost getting a ticket from a grumpy old lady over a terribly stupid thing (cardboard on the ground for 10 minutes in an empty area so that I could save a stray dog, I had no room in my car for him), I decided it was time to read this book. I was worrying too much over trivial things, so it was time.<br/><br/>I've been told in my life that I am a super analytical person, but Mark has me topped tenfold. He is analytical to a fault, going round and round in his head with all of these ideas.<br/><br/>I don't normally do this but I actually read about 86 percent of the book (kindle tells you percent) and decided I needed a break to read something else, and then read Disaster Artist which I liked way better. His round and round way of talking got tiresome and I started to feel a desperate need to read something more straight forward.<br/><br/>Is it helpful? Yeah I guess. It told me stuff I felt like I already knew but hearing it in his words is helpful. Also it can be insightful with references to people and things I didn't know about so it sort of feels like a history class that way. I especially liked the bit about the Beatles drummer that was kicked from the band right before they got famous, but he found success in his own way and was happy. Shame on the Beatles for that, just terrible. He was too good looking and popular and they kicked him from the band, even made the manager do it.<br/><br/>This book is not like other books I have read. It may even be worth reading a couple sections a day just to think about it and ponder on it for a while rather then just read it straight through. It is super thoughtful and maybe worth discussing parts as we go. This would be a great book to have in a class.<br/><br/>I'm rating it 4 stars because I felt like it didn't know when to end, and the last fifth of the book I found I liked significantly less. Just seemed a little too long and toward the end became less interesting. Sometimes less is more with these things. Also having to take a break to read another book I think says something.<br/><br/>However it's not a bad book and I can see why people recommended it. I hope he continues to write.<br/><br/>Probably worth re-reading down the line also.
 I also got the summary version of this by in a nutshell publishing and it is a great 'guide' to refer back to on a regular basis.
 I liked the realness of the book and how straightforward it was. There were something’s that I second guessed but overall I’d say it was a good read. Not for the faint of heart or people that can’t take sarcasm and/or vulgar humor
 Sumbitch can write.
 Although there were a few of the authors views I didn't fully agree with, overall the book  was amazing. It has some very hard truths in it that many people need to hear.
 Books like this force you to think about things that should be obvious, but fly below the radar in everyday life. Very interesting read and entertaining writing style. Would have finished much quicker had i not been sidelined by personal projects
 Arrived damaged,  not to pleased
 Awesome read for literally anyone!
 I recently went through a terrible break up, and found myself looking at self help books, cause i suppose that’s what you do when you’re depressed after your fiancé and girlfriend of 3 years leaves you outta the blue. I found Mark Manson’s website and read a few of his articles. The one that hit me hardest was “Love is not enough”. In this article he discusses how love does not conquere all. Love is not always enough for you. Following this article i read The reviews for this book. I bought it and listened to it in one day. And then listened to it again. After that i read His earlier work “Models”.<br/><br/>Mark has a way of writing as if you are getting good advice from a friend, but a friend with a psychology and philosophy background. The “advice” he offers you in this book was ground breaking for me. I never realized how much effort i put into stuff that really didn’t matter to me. This extra stuff in my life ate at me, and then after i read Models (just the first 1/4)i realized that i really Didn’t even know who I was. I was left asking myself some really hard questions. These questions were about who i am, and what the f i was Doing. It has opened my eyes to being a happier, and more care free person.<br/><br/>These books aren’t a pill. They do not solve all problems. They will not bring your dead pet back to life, make ex come back to you, or even do your laundry for you, but they help you identify what is important to you, so you can focus in on what matters most. Once you do that, your level of happiness will go up one notch. And when you’ve just been dumped, one notch feels like a lot.<br/><br/>I’m happy to say that “models” clued me into how needy i was, and helped me identify how badly i really Needed professional help to talk about my issues. I’m not crazy, or clinically depressed, but I wanted to be a better person, and understand my effect on people, that way i didnt repeat mistakes that i made In future relationships.
 This book will have something for any person willing to read and accept the painful truth and mistakes in our lives, that we have unconsciously overlooked.
 This book has helped create a shift in my thinking. After reading it (and now listening to the Audible version), I have shifted my focus away from minutia and people who push my buttons to what's really important.<br/><br/>I realized that little people and little things were bothering me, and that was MY responsibility to change, not theirs. I have stopped sweating the small stuff and it's made a difference in my stress levels and mindset.<br/><br/>Ever seen someone try to light a lighter that simply won't light? That's how it looks when someone who panics over stupid crap is around me now. Also, people who try to lead through fear, intimidation, and manipulation make me just shake my head. They used to really upset me, now it's almost like I'm watching them in a movie.<br/><br/>Read this book slowly. I read one chapter a day. It starts slow, almost like the author is trying to weed out those who aren't serious about change. The last several chapters are potentially life changing. Seriously.<br/><br/>I am in the personal development game. I have a podcast and have written books. There is a lot of nonsense, plagiarism, and so-called gurus pointing out the obvious in this industry. Manson is not one of them. So many Les Brown and Jen Sincero types are picking on your weaknesses like bullies. Not Manson. He tells it straight, challenges you to wake up and take responsibility for your life, happiness, success, and growth.<br/><br/>Kudos, Mark Manson. I have never read a book like this. I am now giving it as gifts to a select few in my life who will actually absorb it.
 This is a revolutionary examination of life, death, and what motivates our life choices.  Told in language that makes it a joy to read and absorb.  Loved it.
 This is simply a book that every single one of the us who say 'we' must read. Entitlement is the root cause of our predicament today.
 I am not a reader, but I follow his blog because his writing is captivating and easy to follow, but thought provoking at the same time. I loved reading this book! I would highly recommended to readers and non-readers alike. It invites you to explore a different mentality about your behavior and life decisions.
 Not finished reading but so far this is a good book.
 Arrived as stated. Thank you
 This book is awesome! It's written in a funny way that makes it interesting, but it has great advice. If you don't like cussing, then don't purchase this. If you're looking for help on letting things go, (not sweating the small stuff) then this is perfect! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!
 Ok book. I enjoyed the read but it's not among the list of books I'd recommend. It's fast and casual with practical wisdom.
 One of my all-time favorite books. It helped me broaden my perspective in a dark time after I graduated college!
 Great audio book!
 Mark's best work yet. The book isn't really vulgar, only some chapters and that is fine. His points really do put perspective what you are doing right now, and to my biggest suprise some of my values that I thought were bad actually quite good.<br/>Would recommend this to anyone, amazing thought-inspiring book which you cannot put down.
 Great Condition!
 First 1/3 is absolutely inspiring and amazing. Then it gets repetitive. Still, worth a buy.
 Great read. definitely sharing the book with friends.
 I have read a lot of books over the course of my life, but this one stands out above the rest.  It cuts away the clutter and crap we think we have to suffer through and goes to the core of what matters in this world.  Stunning...
 Loved loved loved the honesty and slap in the face reality of how to own up to your responsibility in how we respond to everything that happens to us. I laughed, I cried, and I even went through the hell cycles a bit. Great read. I recommend it to anyone that needs a dose of tough love with great insight.
 Curse words don't bother me in my readings, but I do know they bother some people. However, I urge anyone to not let that play into the factor whether they read this book or not. It is a fantastic book with great messages on how to live life, and not the let the little stuff bother you. Pick what you are passionate about and go for it! Those who care about you will follow, and those who only have negatives to say will drop off. The ending story of the book on the clip tops gave me the chills when i read it. I've already bought two copies that I've given to a family member and a friend. Highly highly recommend.
 As I started reading I was instantly hooked because every other word was a curse word but written in a way that helped me feel relieved the more and more I read.  Mark Manson has a way of helping you feel better about not giving a f&amp;@k.  Read it!  You’ll thank me later!
 I rarely write reviews for books, but the honesty and truth I discovered in this book will hopefully move me toward the path of what I truly value and what I want  to leave behind.  Thank you Mark for your insight and sharing your soul with us.<br/><br/>Gina Forberg
 A fun read with some useful lessons.
 I've read more than a few of Mark's articles on numerous occasions at work, if not all of them at work after being introduced to Mark by a close friend of mine. This is the no nonsense book you've been waiting to read. This was the best book I've read in 2016. Practical and honest. Love your work Mark!!!
 Great read for today's madness.
 Legit, to the point advice. Read a free version online and was so grateful for the knowledge in this book i BOUGHT the kindle version!
 Decent book; good advice that was delivered in a humorous, easy to remember, direct manner.
 The book I've been waiting for. A lot of "Aha" moments while reading it. Ive read a lot of books just like this but this one hit the core so right.
 Mark Manson writes with truth, conviction and brutal honesty about the most important subjects we ponder every day.  I am in awe of the wisdom he has gained at such a young age.  He is passionate, funny, uninhibited and his book is brilliant.
 Great condition
 In my view this book is overrated. I am still giving 5 stars, cause I learnt 2 things from it: What pain do you want to sustain? And Immortality Projects.
 Love this book. It's a pretty easy read. Finish it in 2 days. Gave me a great new perspective on life
 Loved the book, easy read.  Seemed very honest and sensible. He was able to make sense of common reactions and mistakes everyone makes.
 It’s fun to read, helps a lot !!!!! 😊
 Absolutely stop what your doing and buy this book. It’s life changing and I give it out as gifts all the time!
 I've read this book three times now once on the kindle app and twice on paper. It's a constant reminder of the truths we all try to suppress. Thank you for the much needed insight to my own bullsh*t Mark.
 Highly entertaining, thoughtful, and intelligent book. Manson does a good job delivering on timeless concepts. All in all a trememndous read.
 I LOVE this book so far. It's put into words a lot of the things I already believe to be true and It's certainly teaching me a lot about personal growth. Thanks Mark for your frankness in a world where most of us would rather bury our heads in the sand!
 I read a lot of self improvement books, and this one is something you can actually implement. Especially the end is eye opening. To accept death. Don't even be afraid of it. Or anything. Ever.
 Before you read any other self help book read this one. Once you clear your head you'll be shocked how easy it is to move on in a healthy path!!!  Thank you for writing this!
 Despite the title as an eye catcher...some great information and advice given.  Good read, I'd recommend but read to the end.
 This book as really shifted my view 180. Manson provided a different view of struggle than the typical self help book, which I appreciated.
 Well written, entertaining all the way through. Felt like a slap in a face that turned out to be a friendly pat on the back. If its honesty your looking for then read this book. It'll give you a new perspective that will guide you on your own journey of embetterment.
 We all need to learn to choose our battles, not sweat the small stuff, etc.......<br/>Growing up is a long journey.
 This books will quite possibly change your perspective on things for the better. I couldn't put it down. A must-read.
 Bought as a gift... cause books make the best gifts... for my fiance who is pretty shy and intorverted.  She loves it, says it changed her perspective!
 Phenomenal. The ending was empowering in a way I wasn't expecting... I will definitely read it again!
 Such a great reminder of how impermanent life actually is, and to more selective about the F***s you give.
 This book is a game changer. I love everything this book talks about. The author is real and to the point. It’s a definite eye-opener. 10/10!
 I’m not one for self help books but read this at the recommendation on my sister. It was very straight forward. I personally am a very religious person and appreciated his unbiased approach (he did not outwardly support religion but understood the need to believe in something bigger than yourself) to religion. I enjoyed it!
 I loved this book. It was a life changer for sure. The author gives a wonderful perspective on life. I also bought the hard copy to keep in the house when I need a refresher.
 I LIKED EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS BOOK AND SO DID MY NEIGHBOR  I LOANED IT TO AND SHE LOANED IT TO HER MOM, AUNT, AND ON AND ON.  SO, WHAT'S MORE TO BE SAID..........<br/><br/>MOOMAY
 This book came highly recommended from one of my friends who rarely reads non-fiction. That awkward combination lead me to pick this amazing piece of writing. Mark Manson truly touches on some ideals to live by and entwines it with his personal experiences.<br/>Happy Panda.
 Read this you won’t regret it it is an amazing book!!!!!
 The author was a little too narcissistic for my taste.
 Decent book
 Why, you ask? I thought this would be funnier but I found myself disappointed. The first half is funny and then it’s more of a self help book that drops the f word every now and then
 This book was an easy read, easily relatable and honest. Mark Manson's writing is captivating and hysterical. Definitely keeps the book interesting throughout.
 Very helpful
 This book serves as a good explanation for something that we seem to think we understand. Why is it that those who seem to not care get everything they want? It’s explained.
 Awesome book, won't say any more about it, read it and you'll know.  Worth every penny.
 Helpful reading. Have recommended it to several of my friends.
 Was a great gift for my friend, I am sure she will get a lot from it
 Really nice book, easy to read and also funny. It gives you a different perspective on how to look events in your life.
 This is pretty much the best book I've ever read. I love Manson's writing style and this book opened my eyes to so much. Highly recommend.
 Very happy with my purchase, thank you!
 Sometimes it is good to not give a damn. I just started reading this book and so far I like what I see.
 Love this approach!
 I will read it again for the second time. It started like reading a blog but slowly immersed to the experiences of the author. It helped me to live a better life.
 Most of the book is rambling pop psychology. Author Manson spends the first 1/3 of the book telling you how messed up you are and how no other self-help guru can help you. When he does get down to it, he has some really priceless gems to share that frankly, helped me a lot. But definitely not worth $14 for a Kindle copy, and the sum total of his wisdom could fit on 3 pages.
 The profanity spoke to me in ways other books have never been able to, it touched me deeply on a level that speaking with profanity could only do. I hope to find more books with this style. Thanks for the good read
 This book is life changing, the author is so authentic and makes you laugh and think about tings in your life. I recommend this book to everyone you will not be disappointed
 I loved how easy Mark made this book to read. Anyone and everyone can relate to his words. I recommend this book to anyone that wants a broad and honest view at life!
 You really have to read it for yourself, but I can officially say no book has ever made me feel a certain or look at life differently.
 I strongly recommend this book<br/>Whether your situation is good or bad , this book will teach you great lessons
 This book will make you think about whats important in life. Simple yet really worth the read. Really enjoyed it.
 Moderately enlightened. Good entry level text for self improvement.
 I love this book so much!  It has motivated me to take a huge step back from friendships and other situations in my life and to really think about what it is that I value the most.  Perfect purchase and read before a New Year!
 Many interesting ideas that will make you rethink a lot of things in life. Totally recommended!
 This is a great book! I am now a Mark Manson fan.
 Such a great self-help book!!! Love his writing style and bluntness
 Fantastic book. Recommended it to several other people who said the same thing.
 ☺👙👟👍✊✌🎅💩🙇🙋😎🙌♌🔯⚓🏮🐃🐴🐑 I would like to say something else but right now I M just filling space until I can post this review. Just read the damn book.
 Despite the language, a good read. A little cynical, but makes some very good points.
 great read!
 The book was a pleasure to read. The reverse concept of entitlement was very interesting. Help me a lot .
 Everything was perfect, the book is in perfect condition and arriveid very quickly. I’m very happy! I can’t put the book down! I
 Amazing book, very insightful and full of real work wisdom. I would recommend this to any person, no matter the age.
 This book really made you look at life differently.  It makes you realize what values you are choosing to live with and which are more important.  It really gives you some good lessons and makes you realize that you only have one life and need to live it to the fullest.
 Amazing book. Simple, guy next door interpretation of Buddhism. But very deep and feels like author really lived through the experience. I read it while being at the crossroads of my life trying to decide where to go from there. The book helped me to get the right perspective on where I chose to go.
 the title was the best part.
 The name says it all
 Interesting views. Click-baity title
 Excellent book....
 Mark does a fantastic job of digging into a number of difficult topics. He doesn’t just make you question why you’ve believed what you believe for your entire life, but also helps address how to take the next step in becoming a better human. Worth the read.
 I read this book when I need it to remind me what I knew but for some reason forgot, and to do what I need to do next in pursuit of not giving a fuck.r
 I bought it by mistake and forcing myself to read it. But I find myself getting a headache when going through it. It's like he can't get his point across without cussing every other sentence.
 GREAT TRANSACTION GOOD PRODUCTS!
 This is one of the best books that I have read in years! Mark Manson's writing style is quick, clever, and enjoyable to read.  I purchased a copy for all of my adult children because it is full of excellent advice. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to mentally grow without being preached to.
 This book is very unlike anything I've ever read. The author speaks frankly and vunerably about his baggage and formative experiences. Several passages and concepts have been highlighted, by me. I'm going to re-read this book and give the concepts another chance to sink in. I highly recommend this book.
 Good read. Worth the price and it's also funny. Wish it had more examples because the ones given are great.
 Trendy, just okay.  No new ground broken for one who has read popular self-help books in the past and is beyond that stage in life.
 Do yourself a favor and read this, then go explore his website. Or the reverse. Whatever!  La la la la
 Read it even if you don't agree with it. Internalize it. It just might stop you from repeating the pattern of self victimization.
 My face hurts from smiling, and I am only on page 10. Reading in a taproom and probably making other's think I am crazy... but IDGAF! Love this book already.
 This is the book for you!
 not a big fan
 I did not purchase this book.
 Good advice
 LOVES THIS BOOK.  Since my husband died at 51 of cancer, this book has affirmed how I've been living my life.  I do not fear death.  I have not solidified yet all my values, but I'm  working in it. Thank you for helping me on the journey.
 Great book couldn’t put it down!!
 Yes! This guy gets it. This book is super entertaining and enlightening at the same time. What more could you ask for? If you feel stuck (who doesn't from time to time) - and even if you don't - get this book. It's the perfect, motivational kick we all need and reading it is super enjoyable. Hope he continues to publish more and more gems like this one.
 The author has a very interesting perspective about life, personal values, and setting the right goals. Just reading this book made me realize the areas in my life that need some readjusting. It definitely exceeded my expectations.
 Should be required reading for all sociology majors.
 This book scored the highest possible review from me due to its genuine approach and the very frank and blunt introspection it offers to its readers.<br/>I enjoyed reading it and did a lot of reflecting along the way.<br/>Certainly recommend it.
 Wonderful book.  Really gets you to reflect on your thoughts, values and actions in a non-judgy way.
 Great introduction to modern stoicism! Mark has a very distinct style of writing that I wasn't a huge fan of at first. As I continued reading it kind of free on me and I found it very relatable and enjoyable. Thank you, Mark for being so candid and sincere ^_^&gt;
 Who gives a flying F. Go F off
 Great book... I learned a lot!
 great read would recommend it for anyone awsome
 Great book!
 He makes good points. Not a pie-in-the-sky type of book. Seems honest. Reality is key for me, and I would recommend it.
 Engaging book. 10/10
 Great book! Hard for me to put down.  Really opened my eyes to things I would of never thought of.  I have friends who are currently borrowing my book because I was raving at how good it was.
 Helped me understand me, my relationships, and the people around me and beginning to discard the superficial aspects of my existence. Long road ahead for me but willing to take the journey.
 Not a good read
 A must read!  Fast Shipping
 quick read after the s***y election to help get mind off things.  still in a crummy mood but like the authors perspective.
 Very good book. I recommended it to friends and gave my copy away after reading it.
 Good straightforward advice. When I read it at night I hear things under my bed. I think it may be a monster.
 This is one of the more interesting takes on simplifying one's life. I've taken many of the ideas I've found in the book to heart. It's made me a little less popular, but much more relaxed.
 BUY IT! AMAZING WORK! GO READ HIS WORK IN HIS WEBSITE AS WELL!
 I find Mark's blog to be pretty cool, the book is also a pretty good read.
 I got this book because I thought it would be funny. It’s not. It is harsh reality. We can’t buy our way to happy, no matter how much we have available to spend.
 Good stress reliever read!
 Really good book! A must read.
 Well, I am not sure where to start. But, this book has given me something to think about. No fear!
 I am a huge fan of Mark Manson. This book tells it like it is, and actually give you a better sense of security within yourself. I have recommended this book to several friends and they have all read it and raved about it.  I also wrote a small story on LinkedIn about the concept of this book .
 Muy bueno
 Worth the read. Its important to control the number of F***s you give away.
 Recommended by a friend. Loved it and bought a book for another friend of mine.  Gives you a different perspective on life and what tonstress about...or not.
 People read this than not read this. So I gave It a 4. Though I think it needs a three. Easy enough to read quickly, and points to argue internally with or ignore altogether.
 Tacky title to a book that is to the point, says much about this scattered world and how to set goals which are logical and comfortable .
 This book was hilarious and insightful. The blunt delivery is very effective. I highlighted many sections of this book to come back to later.
 Best book I have read in a while. Straight to the point.
 Great read, truly helpful advice
 Love this book!  If everyone figured out what his book is telling them, a lot of people would be much happier.
 Item as described!
 I read and then gave to a friend that stresses out over everything. She loved it. Great read.
 great book!
 This book is absolutely amazing as it decipheres life in very funny and simplistic ways. It forces you to rationalize your value system and helps you realize a new path forward. It is a must read for anyone who simply wants to be a better human. Absolutely amazing!
 I have to read this again. I love the blunt, no nonsense tone of this book!
 It’s like the author is speaking right to you. Just having a casual conversation! I love this book! Best read in a while.
 Just live life as it is. Don't worry too much! Worry less and just live in the moment. Each day has trouble of its own.
 Mark has a gift for giving serious perspective in a voice thats very relatable. With a great deal of candor, introspection, and wit, he cuts to the core of some major preoccupations of our time. His advice is much needed by many, its the kind of book I want to give to friends.
 Great read, something we all should try to do more of.
 I've been reading Mark Manson's website for a while, so this book is what I expected. Excellently written, helpful, and to the point. I love it!
 Amazing book. Shipped fast too.
 A fantastic and well written book
 If you gain nothing from reading this at all, either because you already live this mantra, or because like mark describes, it's your choice to reject and say no, then it's already changed you. Subtlety...<br/>Refreshing writing style overall, but I don't think it's message could be done any other way.
 This book is life changing. Really makes you look at life in a different way. I have recommended it to all of my family and friends. A great read for millennials and young people in general.
 Funny and true.  Makes you think.
 I found more value in this book after reading it for a second time. The material hit home &amp; the principles are workable (but do they really require work 🧐). Recommending this book to friends &amp; family.
 This book helps me a lot. Instead of thinking positively and avoiding the negative things, I should instead accept my negativity and solve my problems that make me unhappy. It's a book that does not make you lie about yourself; rather, it makes you acknowledge about yourself.
 LOVE this book. I have been telling everyone about it.
 Great book and quick delivery. Book in mint condition upon arrival. Excellent!
 I purchased as an Audio book and then went back and bought the paperback as well.  This is probably the most helpful book I've ever read.  I may well wear out the pages on this one.
 Good read
 Caring about the right things in life is crucial. I loved the focus on reevaluating values and challenging your perception of oneself. I definitely recommend.
 Great book and good read. Mark has some great advice.
 Love it! Read more than once.,
 He really gets it. I have so many things highlighted its ridiculous. Loved the book. Fast read . I highly recommend it.
 Love his examples, highlighted quite a few sentences that really hit home with me that I will go back and refer to.
 A real intuitive look at life just as the reviews state. I am mentally happier reading this book. Easy read,  hilarious yet factual.
 i loved this book, I've recommended it to others and I plan on reading it again!
 Just a bunch of blog articles. Subscribe to the blog which is fantastic.
 funny and informative enough
 I skipped every reading I had to do during uni, and I've read this book a couple of times so far to get a better hold of what it says. Even though I bought it would be a really funny and stupid book, but it ended up being a really meaningful and funny book. I highly recommend it, I feel like this should be a mandatory reading in our last year of school, not without a graded exam but instead a class discussion.
 Unique insight and just plain hilarious.
 great book
 Excellent! I quite enjoyed listening to this audiobook during my morning run. Definitely recommend it!
 Excellent.  Shipped quickly.
 Great book that is needed for today’s busy life and it was a fun read
 Best book I've read in while
 I enjoyed his honesty and funny panda story that shows up on someone's door step to give them that truth and reality check we all need some times.
 Don't let the title put you off, or said another way "don't judge a book by its cover," right?  Good ideas with beneficial suggestions and tips. I was grateful for the read.
 A good insight on basic life stuff.
 Perfect gift!
 Amazing book
 A really great book and I will be re reading it for years to come. We need to remind ourselves about the things he talks about... Some of it we know already but we forget sometimes.
 I Give a F@$# about this book. A very grown up look into an interesting way of thinking. An interesting way of thinking about things.
 I don’t necessarily agree with everything in the book. But to read it and look at your life from different perspective is definitely worth it
 Hilarious - right on point - highly relevant to today's culture.
 My therapist recommended this because she noticed I care a lot about what other people think of me. I learned for more than that from this book.
 Manson breaks through all the artful BS of the self-help world and distills truth from life and experience in a clear, hilarious, and refreshing voice
 This book should be required reading for everyone who thinks the world owes them something.  It will make you take a long look in the mirror.
 A good read!
 I’ve heard nothing but good things about this book! I’m still reading it but it’s because I work two jobs and I’m in school, but when I have free time, I read as much as I can!
 F'in good read
 Not as unintelligent as the title suggests. Really good insight to human psychology and our obsession with being perfect. Not done with the book yet. But has been a good read so far.
 I loved it! Nothing like what I have read before. I couldn't stop after the first chapter. Helped me to really see things in a different light. I hope this book changes you like it changed me.
 I liked it’s bluntness, it’s realism, it’s precise description of everyday redundant feelings. I’d recommend it to all who are struggling with themselves, feeling drowned in over analysis and spiraling out of control. This book will make you get a grip - and smile. I chose this rating because I appreciate its blunt honesty.
 I like the direct tone and approach. Get thru the first 15-20 pages and it rips. You’ll finish in a day and have all the relevant questions one needs to assess and choose how you want to define your tomorrows.
 As someone who has struggled to please others in the past, I found this book to be both liberating and refreshing.
 Got as a gift, so I haven't read it, but the whole theme is great.
 A must read!  Well written and easy to understand.  Author has a great sense of humor which keeps the book interesting. This will be a book that I will go back to from time to time.
 excellent book
 But its good to know that I'm not the only one who's suffered like this. It took some time sorting it out and will probably take more to get it figured out, but my values are getting better.
 enjoyable
 Amazing read...put it into practice while reading and boy did it shake what I thought I knew....my evening, my day, my week....everything was better because I accepted responsibility....WOW!! Such a simple thing but such an impossible thing as well...
 Some of this book really hit home for me, really liked this book and the ideas in it. It's nice when a book makes you think.
 Great book!
 Not at all what you think it would be about but loved it more!
 The auther was able to put into perspective that no matter what life deals you, it matters how you handle the bad times because there will be bad times.
 This book is superb. It will completely change your perspective and have you realigning your life in a way so that you actually focus on what matters. Do yourself a favor and buy it now
 Well written, enjoyed immensely as someone who used to be bothered by everything in his 20's. Got in an accident and only now usually cares about what matters now. Enforced that that's more than OK. Great read
 Makes you take a hard look at your life and ask important questions about what you really care about. I appreciate the language and candor. I can relate to it more.<br/><br/>If you are trying to become more self-aware and want to grow closer to your true self, this book is for you.
 This book is great, and its a no-bs perspective changer.
 Super funny! Interesting content that makes you think. Very well written.
 Very bood Listen
 Quite a current book that fits into how modern life has become and some of the things we worry ourselves with. I'd highly recommend reading, and it's a book worth re-register reading at a later date.
 I really don't give a f! Works great
 Enjoyable, quick and smart.  I found it deeper than i expected.  There were some real bits of wisdom.  The idea of humans being inundated with distraction to the point of becoming numb on what really matters resonated.
 I really enjoyed the book for the most part. Chapter 8 was my favorite, but it lost me on chapter 9. I felt like going into the existential crisis of dying belonged in a different book. So the overall tone I felt didn’t match by the end.
 Changing my life, this book has real hit home for me. I’m excited, I recommended this book to anyone who thinks they need to change their values and metrics. Or for people who may think they have life’s answers until they read this book.
 I am very Happy to have read the book. And, for those who are life long leaners, A Must Read! Dr Mkh
 Question yourself, question why you want to do certain things, question why you didn't do certain things, take accountability for everything and don't beat yourself up for screwing up in the past, just grow from it.
 Thanks!
 I'll be rereading this book often as a way to center myself and separate from my anxiety. Very insightful and honest.
 First of all, this book is an obvious money grab. It's just a beefed up version of his most popular blog post. There is no new information in the book, it's just been significantly lengthened with anecdotes, personal stories, and couple of studies that are only vaguely relevant to the topic at hand. Apparently even this wasn't enough to make something he could justify charging people for, so he also opted for large font, wide spacing, and thick margins. That did the trick. Now introducing... (drum roll)... The Exact Same Blog Post (Now 857% Longer)<br/><br/>As far as content, don't be fooled by the forced humor and edgy language, this is just another disposable, pep-talk style self-help book that follows the same basic formula as a thousand others, and provides no satisfying reasons to think the advice therein is worthwhile. Most of this book is comprised either of Mark pontificating on the keys to a happy life (based almost exclusively on personal experience) and/or ranting about "our" skewed priorities. Speaking of, the "our" was a major pet peeve of mine...<br/><br/>He speaks in the ubiquitous self-help "we/our/us" throughout the entire book. "We fear," "we want," "we try," "we always," "we need to," "we should..."  We who? You mean you? It's one thing to take truths of psychology or human behavior at large and assume they probably apply to one's self. It's another thing entirely to take truths about one's self (in this case Mark's self) and assume they apply to humanity at large. Mark spends the entire book doing the latter. Something worked or didn't work for him, did or did not make him happy,was or was not a profoun experience, so he insists we should all think/act/be/do the same.<br/><br/>Anyway, I know the edgy title has your interest piqued, so if you're dead-set on hearing what he has to say, I'm tellin' ya, just save yourself the four hours and $20 and just read the much more succinct source material.
 Clear cut seat of your pants narrative.
 One of the best books on life I have ever read.
 This book is great. Got my whole family into this book!
 Mark gives some great advice on all aspects of life. Doesn't matter how old or young you are this book provides solid advice to make your life more fulfilling.
 A good, purposeful, meaningful book. Recommended for all those who get lost on small things in life and need a reminder to let some of it go.
 Good book with some refreshing take on old ideas.  The second half of the book seemed a little less structured.<br/>Recommended read.
 Good read. Would recommend but the author repeats the same thing over and over, just in different words.
 In love with this book from the very first page. It put things in perspective for me. Opened my mind into a different mind set.
 Great book. Read it over and over until it's internalized and you will be a changed person.
 I mean it’s just good.
 A must read!! Easy to read and an incredible message!
 Great book. Fun writing style. Highly recommend.
 Excellent read.  Thought provoking.  Actionable.  As long as you can get beyond the incessant use of F**K and any other words and understand the underlying message.  I have already recommended this to 3 of my friends.
 good read
 I loved this book because it enlighted me to a whole new vision of life.<br/>It makes you think outside the box. Makes you question some of your beliefs and thoughts without offending.<br/>Loved it and recommend it.
 Helpful book
 kind of enlightning
 Had to be convinced by my book club to read this as l thought I would not like it. Interesting and sometimes disarming reflections on the values we hold so dear. Values that could actually be prenventing our personal/professional growth. Success? Failure? Aspirations? May not be what you thought.
 Great read, would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys philosophy and psychology.  Also enjoyed the length as it wasn’t too long or too short.
 The best anti-self-help book I've read. I enjoyed it. Read it over a couple days.
 A lot of great content. I strongly recommend this book especially to millennials. Felt the last chapter was a bit of a filler that just dragged on about nothing but still a book that I'm keeping on the bookshelf and recommending to anyone I care about.
 Great book. Made me re-examine my life.
 I love how blunt and inspiring the author is.
 I'm amazed how someone can take such complicated concepts, and strip them down into bare-boned, clearly expressed axioms. Great stuff.
 Could have left out all the foul language
 Hilarious but very repetitive.  The whole book can be summed up as "you'll be much happier if you'd just give more thought to the things you choose to dedicate your time and emotions to."
 i just love it
 Thanks for going beyond yourself. I will refer back to your book many times and<br/>with great appreciation. Hopefully you will have the time for more.
 Gets to the heart of a lot of things
 First two chapters of the book you can see that the pages were inserted incorrectly. The. You get to pages 42+ and I’m missing complete pages in 5 different sections didn’t even bother going through the whole thing.
 I've read similar books that stuck with me more. The title is catchy but there's nothing new here. Same stuff
 Bought this on the recommendation of the DailyStoic.com folks. Disappointing read - felt it was kind of a long whine. Not really aimed at me (I'm an old fart), it felt like it was written for millennial's. Loved "Ego Is The Enemy", buy that instead 10x the book.
 I enjoyed this book and would recommend. It was an easy read. It is about 200 pages so you can get through it fairly fast. Definitely a great self-help book if you struggle with personal relationships or struggling with caring too much. It’s a great self-help book even if you don’t need help with those things. Mark Manson does a great job of giving this book humor but also keeping it serious. He does repeat himself throughout the book but he gives real life examples that make you think. Manson is a great writer and this book should go on your list of self-help books to read.
 Love this book! Changed my life!
 Great book and I will probably purchase more to share with friends
 Really great opportunity to realign with what is important and give up being a saver. Appreciate the candid initiation to stop acting so entitled.
 Now I don't give a F*******ckkkkkkk
 Funny and inlightening. Lots of laughs
 Awesome read
 excellent book. You should read it too.
 Could have been shorter. Didn’t like all of the swearing. Their is a story that could trigger those with suicidal thoughts. Overall it was ok but get it from the library.
 Great book. I am trying out his ideas. It makes sense to figure out your values and guide your life by them
 I really enjoyed reading this book. In fact, it hit home for a lot of things. Mark has a funny, but truthful and direct way of putting things. I've been telling everyone I know to read it.
 Love it!
 The books were super affordable and came quickly. I needed them for a present, and I was able to give it on time! I haven't read it yet, but I can tell its a great book. Paperback was the way to go!
 I loved the book. If you're on the fence, undecided if you want to read it, take the jump. You'll be glad you did.
 Everyone should read this.
 What a fantastic book. I loved every page I read. I enjoyed every passage. I am glad I had the chance to read it!
 A little crass, conceptionaly  sound. Really goes along with what we all know, there only so much time and some money, now we know the third, there’s only so much give a damn.
 Good advice
 Chuck all of your "self-help" and the "you are the greatest human being since the beginning of time," books in the crapper and read this!
 I love the last chapter. The idea about reminding oneself of their inevitable death in an attempt to live more freely and without fear is quite moving.
 This book brought me true clarity on prioritizing my life. It's amazing ! Not your average self help book. Read on and prepare to laugh, cry, and be enlightened.
 I've listened to this book over five times in a few months period. Amazing book.
 I find myself quoting, or relating passages of this book to others often. Really great and compelling ideas.
 This book is amazing - I highly recommend it!
 Very insightful and helpful guide.  I very highly recommend this book to anyone that can read. I have already given this book to 2 friends.  Hopefully they will pass it on as well. We need this perspective in our culture.
 Fantastic book!!! Entertaining and informative.
 Time will tell, but I think this book just may have cured me of my self-help book addiction.  I'll read his previous book and any future book though.
 Great read
 Easy read with some great insight!
 Great book, fun to read.<br/>I personally think Marks previous book "Models" was better written, however there is no doubt that this one is a great piece of work, with tons of value!
 good stuff
 Great book, would recommend!
 Surprisingly strong message through rough and crude language. I enjoyed the way the author portrays himself as humble yet successful, its very motivating. A most read.
 Thanks for this book!<br/>REAL.
 Great book full of lots of uncomfortable and honest ideas, which are the best kind. Put me on a path of transforming my thinking and my life.
 Best ending I've read in a while. must read!
 Great attitude adjustment
 At first, I thought it must be something lame af like chicken soup sraps, then I tried sample book and I was wrong. This is the real stuff. The way the author presents is very much similr to my favorite critics George Carlin would. Love it.
 Not an easy read
 Book is very repetitive, but is a good conversation starter if left out.
 It's not about not giving a f#@% but rather understanding that you are responsible for the f@#$s you give and how to take control of that responsibility ... if you want to...
 Not a lot of insight and lots of gratuitous profanity are the hallmarks of this book. Pretty much a waste of time.
 Great Book,it has really great advice.
 Greay read
 This is a really good book. It is a no nonsense approach to personal development and don't worry about anything else just get on and do things!! ;-)
 Good book to read buzzed on a plane
 Great read!
 I would recommend this book to all freethinkers. It has helped me to re-evaluate how I see and value things in my life. I constantly refer back to things that were written in this book when I start stressing about anything. Very engaging book as well!
 Totally not what you expect. Must read for sure.<br/><br/>Really relatable and thought provoking.<br/>I need 4 more words. Thanks.
 I wanted it to go on for another 100 pages. Like Mark became a friend imparting the best wisdom and helping me feel braver and lighter with each page.
 The Subtle Art isn’t so much about not caring, but about caring wisely. Why? With finite energy and time, the extraneous stuff just isn’t worth the trouble. It’s a fun read, with cool, memorable presentation of venerated self-help concepts.<br/><br/>Favorite quote, which was actually from somebody named Bukowski: “We’re all going to die. What a circus! That alone should make us love one another, but it doesn’t. We are terrorized and flattened by life’s trivialities; we are eaten up by nothing.” Upshot: let the small stuff slide, and cut your fellow man some slack. We’re all dealing with the same crap.<br/><br/>2nd Favorite quote (this one by Mr. Manson): “You are already great because in the face of endless confusion and certain death, you continue to choose what to give a  bleep] about and what not to. This mere fact, this simple optioning for your own values in life, already makes you beautiful, already makes you successful, and already loved. Even if you don’t realize it. Even if you’re sleeping in a gutter and starving.”<br/><br/>Favorite story: a Japanese soldier who waged guerrilla warfare years (decades) after WWII ended, all because he was driven by crummy values. Upshot: check your values. Ensure they’re worth your allegiance.<br/><br/>Nice work, Mr. Manson. Planning to share some of your ideas with my audiences. Minus the Fs.
 Great read! I really enjoyed it. It was easy to read and understand and was a book I could read at my leisure. He makes some great points about life and the importance of accepting your own death and values.
 Excellent book. Really enjoyed reading and learning from the book. Mark has a unique way of telling stories to convey his message.
 Awesome book, easy to read. Has a unique perspective for a self-help book. Book was in brand new great condition when delivered.
 Super entertaining read which really puts things in perspective.  Definitely got me thinkng
 I read this book in a few days. The author kept it moving and interesting. It will allow you to value things differently.
 Great book.
 Highly recommended! Will change your life.
 I would recommend this book for those who are drowned in world of too much information, too much expectation, and too much thinking.
 The author is smart and funny which makes it a worthwhile read, and effective selling point.
 Good speaker easy to listen to. Helping a lot on not getting stuck on the little things. Giving myself permission to say no
 What an entertaining and thought provoking find! Initially I wanted to read it only because of the title, however as I kept reading I realized the deeper value of this book and the concepts. Such a lost character asset. Taking responsibility of everything in our lives is a radical notion. I like it.. A LOT!
 This is an awesome read. I have recommended this book to many of my friends, all love it as well.
 I've been recommending this book to EVERYONE. My parents, friends, my doctor, my boss...must read.
 Great book. Don't just read it. Absorb it. Think about it carefully and examine where you stand in your own life.
 A must read. I actually bought multiple copies for my coworkers as this just really stuck with me.
 The author keep the reader engaged with a very funny but down to earth style of content. His message is simple and practical yet it is presented in a way that kept me enhanced the entire time I was reading it. Will recommend to all my friends and family.
 Superb book. Fun read with excellent reminders of important lessons.
 Definitely Mark did a great job with this book.  I have to read again and meditate many of the the ideas.  The transparency and honesty makes this book an excellent source for personal and practical awareness, and to a happier life.
 Read twice. Loved it!
 I've never wrote a review before but this book deserves one. Or it drove one out of me, I don't know. I've never read any kind of self help book and never thought I would but damn glad it was this one. I'll probably be reading it again.
 Love this book great read
 Great book!
 hard to grasp
 I loved this book. It was laugh out loud funny and puts things in perspective.
 book group discussion
 Reading this book was awesome! So interesting and uncovnentional!
 Had my attention from start to finish.  Really opened up a few things and how I viewed them. Finding what truly matters is really hard at times due to distractions, or our own emotions. Really enjoyed this book, I’ll definitely read it again.
 Just. Life-changing. Many of the concepts are things I think I was subconsciously aware of, but had never paid much attention to or been able to articulate. I've been told my behaviour has notably changed for the better since reading, and I feel empowered and inspired!
 Yes yes yes yes!!!! Love it. I'm not into self help books because I feel it's BS. I people who are direct and get to the point. Definitely suggest this book to anyone
 I love this book.
 Great book, gave some good perspective on things. I told my friends to all read it. They all loved it as well
 Literally such a wonderful and inspiring book. This guy does a hell of a job of saying what so many are too afraid to say! If you are looking for a good read then this is it!!!
 Read it.
 The whole book is intriguing to a point where you as a reader start questioning what &amp; how you can learn from Mason. Captivation is something this man does so well through the pages that it leaves you hungry for more when it ends.
 Thought provoking.<br/>An affirmation of the healthy journey that I've been on for over 25 years.<br/>Working on ego deflation in an attempt to be just another bozo on the bus, which is key to setting yourself free.
 A must read book for anyone who wants to live a happier and more peaceful life. Mark Manson, as always, succeeded to put the simple, though important things of real happiness in life in a funny understandable writing.
 My sense of entitlement didn’t like reading this book, but I did.<br/>It’s a good book to have when you need to reminded AGAIN that you should wake the f up.
 Great perspectives, a way to look at the ways we are taught to conduct our lives in US culture in a new light.
 Great book
 This book can teach everyone on all ages,the meaning of:<br/>1) Not giving a f*** on trivial and unimportant things in our life<br/>2) Give a f*** on real and more valuable realizations in our lives<br/><br/>A true great learner to everyone
 Great read!
 Great book!  So much life advice that I have underlined sections to return to later. Heavy reading material that makes you think!
 Absolutely loved this!
 An excellent book!  Very inspiring.  (regarding the negative reviews: if you read this book and get what the author is driving at... chances are you'll find the negative reviews tragically ironic and actually somewhat humorous).
 Great read.  Fun and easy to read.  You can relate to whatever the issue is in your life.  Must get!
 Bought it for the young 20 somethings in my family for Xmas. They loved it. It self-help in their language. What a concept!
 Common sense stuff. Nothing innovative. Just a lot of cursing with no real point.
 This book taught how to live life with a deeper sense of simplicity. There are just too many things we struggle and worry about that in the end doesn't mean much. I choose simplicity. In values, relationships, business etc. And it's because of this book. Thanks Mark
 Literally the Best book I've ever purchased. I was able to influence 5 people to purchase this book and passed it down to a good friend. Thank you Mark for sharing your greatness .
 Author have the ability to tell good stories to let me laugh but more importantly is that the stories lead to deep meaning to life philosophy and author know how to describe and share well on his thoughts on many complex issue, even for no native English reader.
 This book is perfect for perfectionists and people that don't immediately recover after making mistakes!
 Just one guys opinion of life<br/>Good easy read and some refreshing takes in the last 1/4 ]of the book
 Mark is always funny and satire, I love him from his website and podcast and once I heard he published a book - I buy it right away! Love his deduction and teaching in this book
 Good lessons you need to read this book to reinforce and implement into your life. I don’t believe this a five star book though, still, worthy of reading.
 This book is an amazing telling of life lessons and stories told in the most realistic fashion. Every bit relatable as it is enjoyable.
 I found myself stopping on each page in absolute amazement of what I've been missing in my life.<br/>This book is Prozac
 Fun self-help book
 The book arrived in very good condition.  I wanted to read it, but really wanted to give it to my son to read.  He  thoroughly enjoyed it.  A very interesting read.
 Excellent "kick your b... " book. Easy to read, insightful and concise. Nothing really new, yet a very good reminder of the efficient ways to kick the status quo in your mind and move forward, for the best. Excellent purchase. Will re-read it again once in a while.
 I've been reading Mark's blog for about a year and have found it incredibly helpful. This book lived up to my hype; its fantastic.
 I liked the author’s authenticity, wit and insights into what really matters in life based on his own experiences. At times found it a bit ‘macho’ and perhaps isolating to female readers but overall very glad I read it and would recommend!
 Loved this book. A very honest explication of what matters. Especially enjoyed the discussion of Becker's Denial of Death, which I had read many years ago and may now revisit.
 its okay we both read it and it was mainly about not giving a damn and keep it moving...we live like that already lol
 With social media it’s easy to get over extended. This book helps me find balance
 best therapy ever! I loved the book. It is hilariously accurate.
 Picture a toy train laying on its' side derailed with its' wheels still spinning weeks after disaster. That was me before this book. Great read!
 This author opened my eyes to an entirely different perspective. The narrative was a wake up call for me that still bounces around my head every day...
 not much new good for young people maybe.
 Nice book to read and make sense.
 It could also be titled the art of picking your fights. Remarkably clever, funny and useful. I really loved it and offered it to good  friends.
 I LOVED this book.
 Very honest about our deep inside our mind and the bottom line. By accepting the death, we can think or act different and meaningful.
 Enlightening!<br/><br/>This book is as real as it gets. Must read!  Quick read too and hits your core.  Highly recommend it for anyone struggling.
 Awesome read. Made me realize that I was giving my focus to too many things. Recommend it to anyone who is confused with life and themselves.
 A must read
 Amazing book!!! Start applying to my life and I have been stress free and felt as if a dead weight just got lifted from my shoulder
 Good read
 A very tangible way of understanding something very profound. I like the examples given and I think the world would be a better place if more people lived by the philosophy of this book. But a little too long with the same points when you got it the first time.
 I am still a fan of positivity, but this book highlights really good values everyone should try to possess.
 Wow!!
 I liked the many stories that supported his ideas.  A fantastic book for looking  at myself and discovering me, the covered up me.  I will re-read this book .
 Set my mind straight with some tough love and gave me a larger understanding of the not-so-good mechanisms of our culture and its impact on the values we possess in life. A real wake-up call. Would recommend for everyone.
 This is a must read for anyone who is stuck in life. Actually, this is a must read. Period. Read it.
 This book is awesome
 . I would definitely recommend this book to anyone. This book has the true words to live life and enjoy.
 This book was shown as a suggestion while I was buying another book so I bought it as well. Judging by the title j figured it was going to be pure satire, but its actually a very helpful and meaningful book
 I was very pleased with this book. I was skeptical at first based off the title, but it has a great message. I highly recommend this book to anyone who doesn’t mind the profanity.
 This book is amazing! Insightful- coming from a therapist. Easy to read and entertaining.
 Good content, worth the time invested in reading it cover to cover. I think this should be a subject taught in schools to give kids a good head start.
 Digging this read.
 This book is an awesome read. I've been struggling in some areas in my life. I assume everyone does. However, I was thinking about seeking professional help. After reading this book (and I do not recommend replacing professional help when truly needed) I was able to figure out how to manage my perspective on my immature view on certain things on an emotional level. It is wonderful information that I've used to improve my relationships. I've had an intuition about some topics in the book, but Manson does a great job at putting those hard to explain concepts into words and giving great "to the point" examples.<br/><br/>Manson talks about taking responsibility, how we have to choose what to care about, the importance of values and how we should think twice about values we choose to live for, how we tend to ignore things that threaten our identity (the image we have of ourselves), the unavoidable certainty of death, and many more cool concepts. I wholeheartedly recommend this book for personal growth.
 A+
 awesome self help book !one of the best i've ever read.<br/> the author is very insightful.
 My daughter loved the book!
 I'd like to start by saying, this book is for everyone. Why? Because everyone experiences anger, anxiety, depression, and worrying. Mark Manson does an outstanding job of explaining how not giving a f*** about anything is wrong and he redirects you on what values to give a f*** about. Utilizing examples instead of broad statements, he shows you how many of our feelings above are brought on by giving a f*** about the wrong values in life and not addressing our personally unique negative traits. Most self-improvement books try to convince you to be happy at all times and accept all things as they are. Manson address how it's not realistic and how to go about situations as a 21st century adult. This book is a must read for women and men that have open minds and are willing to drop their ego for a minute, to read a book, about changing where they give a f*** and what really matters in life.
 It's an amazing book. I reccomend to any and every one.<br/>Delivered fast.
 So many needs, wants, "have to's", .....so much to keep track of.....this book helps put life into perspective in ways I never imagined.  Well done. Excellent read.
 Anyone who needs a mindset shift and a boost in life in general READ THIS BOOK!! It gives you a break down of different aspects of life and shows how to attack life. Great book in my opinion will read again!
 Reading for a book club, but it really is something I would read again. You only have so much time &amp; energy, make sure you choose wisely what you give a fxxx about
 This is a great book. I finished it and immediately started reading it over as well as added a hard copy to my Kindle purchase as a loaner copy. I am 81 years old and only wish I had been taught some of the principles I discovered in this book at an earlier age. I have recommended this book to so many of my friends and can't think of any book that has had a more profound beneficial effect on my life than this book.
 Great book, concise author, shameless read, finished curious about his advice in regards to women and their fatal attraction to honesty in man.
 I used to read Mark Mansons's blog all the time and his writing always used to be helpful and entertaining. I think he matured a lot of from his blog days and his writing sjows. Still entertaining but way more deeper!
 Refreshing read to get you to think about what's really important in our day to day lives. Most of the BS we worry over isn't worth the stress and anguish we cause ourselves.
 The title caught my attention, the premise brought me in. I can honestly say I enjoyed this book thoroughly and learned some important lessons. It absolutely deserves all five stars and I'm glad I purchased it. Thank you Mark!
 Great read from a guy who usually gets bored, a good take on self improvement without becoming numb to life
 I wish they had a PG version of this book that I could give to kids. A great read and instruction manual on getting through and Thur icing through life.
 Great dirty sSanta gift.
 A good read to pass some time. It's a book that reinforces what one should know after experiencing life.
 Very well written. Made me think of my anxiety and what best to do with it. I will try to not give a f!#@. It will be hard.
 Mark gives us insight of self awareness and choosing what we really are through our values. Great book for in depth explanation on this idea and provides good examples. I have already recommended this book to a few friends, read it!!
 Choosing what is worth giving a "F" about is a great concept and thoroughly agree with Mark Mason. Thanks for figuring a lot out for your readers so we can save ourselves from unnecessary struggles/ stress
 This is an amazing book- would recommended to everyone.
 A.M.A.Z.I.N.G. book! It is so on point for life and learning not to be a doormat.
 Hilarious! Great quick read
 I bought the audio cd version of this to listen as I drove back and forth to work.  There is a lot of valuable insight and information; but for me personally, it was too much of the "F" word; after awhile it seemed that was all I could hear.  Otherwise, I liked it.
 I always thought I had a decent worldview but I've realized that I'm incorrect. This was proven multiple times from this book. The only reason I gave four instead of five stars is because of some contradictions that occurred in the book. Don't let that discourage you from reading since this is a must because the takeaways are infinite.
 I enjoyed this book, I found most of what Mark offers to be helpful and have shifted my thinking as a result.
 In my opinion, this was a great book. I liked the overall message and he made some really great points.
 This is a must read book, but once you start it is almost impossible to put it down.
 This is not a self help book, this is a tale of an enlightened man, who is sharing his knowledge. I enjoyed reading this factual book, and learned from his life realizations tremendously!!!
 I can't give this fewer than five stars because Mark Manson has been paramount in changing my outlook on life.  Only downside is a good fraction of it is literally copy and pasted directly from his own blog, as though that was the template/outline for the book, so if you've been an avid reader of his blog before buying this book, you might be a little disappointed.  But yet again, if you are an avid reader on the blog, you obviously like Manson's writing enough that it doesn't matter.<br/><br/>I really wish Manson weren't so ashamed of his past. His old/classic pick-up articles (circa 2010-2012) were blunt and very much tied to his 20s-self, but brilliant and unique; truthfully, THAT is where he changed the industry. He's extremely reflective, but those articles ARE the reason he is where he's at today, not because he was discussing soft talking points about how it's not of a high value system to have indiscriminate sex (which he mentions in this book). Not only has he removed all of his old articles from the blog, but his talking points are now suggestive that he's trying to bury his past.<br/><br/>One point in the book that stood out to me was: "I know for myself, quitting my day job in finance after only six weeks TO START AN INTERNET BUSINESS ranks pretty high up there in my own “didn’t give a fudge” hall of fame. Same with deciding to sell most of my possessions and move to South America. Fudges given? None. Just went and did it.<br/><br/>Same quote from his original blog:<br/>"I know for myself, quitting my day job in finance after only six weeks and telling my boss that I was going to start selling dating advice online ranks pretty high up there in my own “didn’t give a fudge” hall of fame. Same with deciding to sell most of my possessions and move to South America. Fudges given? None. Just went and did it."<br/><br/>^^ - Now I mean, on the surface, who cares.  But, really, what's that about? Why soften it? Why the fear about just being real about what the past was. Mark would probably rebut/rationalize with 'but the scope of what i've been doing with the internet and my writing has evolved so extensively that the original reason is no longer the full truth.'<br/><br/>------------<br/><br/>My point being: Mark, if you're reading this, some new talking points for additional writing could be exploring why you might be burying your past. It's interesting seeing and following your evolution as a writer and person, but from the reader perspective, it seems as though you're putting forth a lot of effort to essentially erase the 'player persona' as if it never existed (at least it comes off that way in your writing!).<br/><br/>A lot of us would really like to know HOW YOU WERE ABLE TO commit/change your mindset in order to get married, because even if a marriage/relationship is fulfilling to be in, how do you ignore urges and justify the decision to marry?  **This question is less about why one would be in a relationship, and more about how to say no to red pill urges.  Because do they ever go away?**  I mean, do you have an actual mechanism through which you could be in a coffee shop somewhere and legitimately not want to talk to a new girl.  If this is a question of not getting esteem through that type of behavior anymore, could you please explain?  Are the urges still there but you simply don't act out of respect for the relationship?<br/><br/>I also think you should have an archived section of all of your old writing for subscribers only. I think you should ask yourself why you took it all down. Anyway, you're my favorite author though and changed my life, which is why I took the time to write this.
 With all the great things I have heard about this book, I was definitely glad I bought this book. Taught me lots of lessons and uncertainities that life throws at each of us.
 ok
 Brilliant. This book gave me a lot to think about. I listened to the Audible version. A+
 Definitely would recommend and really enjoyed reading.  I'm not going to go as far as to say this book changed my life, but it did make me look at the way my brain works and, hence, how I behave from a new and refreshing behavior.
 This book was awesome. I’m going to reread it to really comprehend it all. Gives you such a different look at life and how significant but insignificant it all really is.
 This book might not be for everyone. But for certain people in certain situations in a certain time in a certain place, it could really change your life.
 So far I love this book! However I was super disappointed to find out there was two pages stuck together that I had to rip in order to read them.
 I loved everything about this book. Funny, direct, enlightening...I could use so many adjectives, but the most important thing I can say is if you are really struggling with keeping your sanity in this f’d-up world, then just read it. Now.
 The narrative is solid and actionable. I enjoyed the consolidation of similar viewpoints and philosophies into a single narrative. That the book seems to end abruptly is my only critiqie.
 Changing my life.
 Easy read and very thought provoking.  I would recommend this book.  I felt like i could hear the authors own inner thoughts as he told his story.
 One of the few books I finished in one sitting. There is definitely a lot of good advice in it, however I can see how his writing can be a turn off to some people. Personally, I enjoyed it immensely.
 Awesome read with practical advice for dealing with things in life you might feel like you have no control over. There isn't as much cursing as one might think and the author's sense of humor is spot on.<br/><br/>An easy recommendation
 Solid wisdom with a dose of irreverent humor.  Manson combines solid psychological research with his own unique style of communication for a win!
 Amazing read.
 There are so many self help books out there, but this one? This one has to be TOP 3 most effective and amazing books! You won’t be disappointed.
 Not finish with the book yet, but enjoying every bit of it😁
 Great can wait to read
 I enjoyed reading this book. It really opens your eyes and makes you snap out of this little bubble we tend to live in. I will continue to read this again. Lots of great advice I will need to read over.
 So true what Mark talks about! Its real life.  Great eye opener!
 The title is almost click-bait. Maybe that's the subtle genius of it though as it hints at what it is by telling you what it isn't. A good read that feels more like a pep talk than a self help book. I really enjoyed it.
 This is a great read for people all generations... especially young ones. Highly recommend it. Thank you very much. Boom 💥
 Fun, engaging, just a little too extreme sometimes.
 Its good
 Excellent book!
 The book is clever no doubt. But I have a few problems with it.<br/><br/>First, after doing some more research on the author, reading his other materials and stuff written about him, and just generally consuming his content, I sense that Manson is just making a career out of being that person who's contrarian just for the sake of it. He has this very sarcastic view on life. Yes, some people might need that wake up call, but I'm pretty sure that most truly successful people don't think that way.<br/><br/>Second, and this might be a bit trite, but I don't trust authors who have to resort to using profanity to get their point across. I understand the use of language in movies and TV and such in order to increase dramatic effect. But in terms of a self-help book...I don't see the use. Reading his book, although interesting, was actually somewhat annoying because of how frequently he uses satirical, foul language to get his point across. This is neither professional or necessary.<br/><br/>I might be one of those self-entitled losers (according to Manson) who gets easily offended by books like this...but I'm not. I've read other contrarian advice books about business and life that didn't use sarcastic, foul, cynical language to get their points across. I honestly felt depressed after reading his book - not encouraged and certainly not convicted to change. Just depressed. I suggest reading the book, only if you want to see how low some people will go to 'gain attention' for their self-help methods.<br/><br/>I suggest that you read books by people who have actually accomplished things in life, apart from their own blogs and marketing schemes. Read books by people who have built enterprises and changed the world. It's okay read books by 'thinkers' whose main job is to "think about and analyze (and blog)" about the world around them...but be careful.
 Manson does have a writing style that keeps you interested in the material. I have absolutely no problem with profanity used in books, I actually think it makes the reading more "real" and impactful when utilized correctly. But throughout some parts of the book, I felt like some profanity were thrown in there just to be in there. Some were unnecessary and tried to bring attention to areas that weren't attention-worthy. Some parts felt forceful, such as sentences written in a way as an attempt to be clever. I thought the book gets increasingly better in the later chapters. The lessons are more profound and his personal stories made it more relatable.
 I couldn't finish this book. I found the advice and thought process shallow. It will help those without the cognitive focus to appreciate a book like Dr. Jordan Peterson's excellent, "12 Rules for Life." In the Marines, long before Mr. Manson was born, we used to say, "Don't sweat the small stuff." That's a good summary of this book. (In Vietnam we said, "It's only a movie." Same thought.) The title, of course, is brilliant marketing to our degenerated culture. As a state senator, I once clashed with an intern who like to wear revealing tops and who felt that a sentence without the F word was incomplete, even when talking to my constituents on the phone. She left, but would doubtless enjoy this book. if you are a focused thinker, you can do better.
 The author presents very intriguing perspective. I really enjoyed the reading and certainly I recommend it. I even could picture myself on some of the chapters as I read
 It si a nice book for all people, it gives you a good point of view of life and how life works.
 Looks like life is gonna improve for several people I care for.
 For my smart a$$ kid.
 Mark makes an excellent point about how to preserve oneself in the midst of our modern culture.  He also brings the reader through beautifully simple and comfortable explanations of our existence and a lot of "alternate" thought.  Well said.  I enjoyed reading it.
 Great book, a must read for all young adult who want to live a full life true to self.
 While the content is great, I am returning the book and getting a new copy. At page 104 my book repeats pages 74-103 then skips to page 121.
 One of the best books I've read in a while
 Interesting. keeps your attention.
 I have read a boat-load of self-help books and up until now have never finished a single one. It's not sugar-coated; it's realistic.
 Funny, well written, and insightful.  Recommended for anyone who cares too much about trivial things. After reading this book I had to ask myself what I value and if it's worth it to do so.
 What a fun read!
 I thought the book was thought provoking. I wasn't sure what to expect, but im glad to have ready it. I would recommend this book to anyone who struggles with anxiety.
 I'm not very far into the book and it has already changed the way I think. It's kind of scary how accurate the things he says is.
 a good book
 Great read!
 Great read, very insightful.
 I highly recommend this book, it gives a message that we as humans don't want to hear about it, we are all so desperately looking for things in life that don't matter. Highly recommended!!
 Absolutely loved this book even though it made me reflect on my life and come to the realization that I should not give a %$#&amp; about so many trivial things in my life!
 This book is ON POINT!
 Good read
 Great book!
 I found this book an eye-opener about values (personal, social, professional, etc.). When you get over the title, the content of the book is worth the read.
 Great book of advice for living in the real world.
 Excellent read.
 Very Helpful  A++++
 so true..love it
 Great
 Accountability, responsibility and identifying entitlement - are brilliantly and deeply explained. Simplifying life and setting priorities is not always easy, but this book gives many good reasons to do it - unapologetically.
 Loved it!
 Came on time and looks as pictured. A good read and a eye catching coffee table book :) Giving it to my friend as a gift.
 Manson is the man.  Not your typical self help book.  Read this if you're tired of the garbage.  I read it in two days.  Mark wouldn't want me to just talk about it though.  He'd want me to about it.  So I'm gonna start living my life now.  Pce
 EVERYONE should read this book! It turns our ideals &amp; participation in modern society &amp; how we interact with it &amp; see ourselves in it, on its head &amp; that's flippin brilliant. Loved it! Thank you Mark!
 MUST MUST MUST Read! I absolutely loved this book that I know own 2 so I can circulate to all my friends because its THAT good. Then in Sept I'm buying it in paperback for my forever copy!
 Great book, love it!!
 Fun book. Product as described.
 awesome book
 Covered several times, great insight
 Humorous and fun to read. Basically, it’s ok to accept yourself as you are.
 Not really into these type of books but I've had so many friends read this, I thought I'd give it a go. I'm glad I did!! Everything on the book is so down to earth, straight forward, and fckn TRUTH!
 Excellent read, experience it with an open mind and a fresh pair of underware handy....It's insightful and extremely funny.
 The beginning is great, down to earth with looking at ourselves from a different perspective.  The writing style is friendly like the author is a friend of yours.  The author does not bring you back to the subtle art of....  and the point of the book according to the title.
 Lots of great points and things to think about. Nice and blunt with life experiences and his take on things.
 Son enjoyed
 The book is direct to the point, easy to get engaged and keep reading.
 Mark definitely doesn’t mince words (the title should tell you as much), but this is a very straightforward book. It really helped me to look at my own life and reevaluate what is most important to me.
 Once I started I couldn’t stop reading it! This book will transform how you view your world and everyone and everything in it! A must read!!!
 interesting
 Hilarious
 Really. Read this book. It is a self-help book, unlike anything else. You will learn things, important things, about yourself and others. It’s more a philosophy and psychology book, rather than a self-help book really.
 Makes you alive. Breaks down life's purpose into finer details. How unimportant are things people spend their lives pondering on. Definitely recommend this as a reading.
 I think the title and first chapter are there to weed out the faint of heart.  If you get passed that, there are a lot of amazing points he makes.  It goes a little deeper than most self help books - but really after the first chapter the language calms down so skip that one if the word offends you!  There isn’t anything important in that first chapter anyway.  I’d hate for someone to miss out on the gems in this book - but I think the point is that if you are offended by the F word, then you probably are not ready to go as deep as this book leads the reader.
 Good read...Food for Thought!
 Great book, delivered on time and FANTASTIC!
 JUST AMAZING
 He’s telling you everything you already know but putting it into a perspective that helps you gain the tools and confidence to implement into your life
 Good book.
 Loved this book and it’s perspective on life. It’s a very quick read for those who don’t really like reading. It will definitely change your outlook.
 Great book!
 Best book ever!
 great product
 Super no bs style is refreshing and fun<br/><br/> ...nice alternative to "feel good all the time" genre....highly recommend to young folks
 Aside from the title ( which I love but most of my friends just snicker), this book has helped me choose a direction, where, before I had none. At 64, you'd think that odd but I'm more resolute to live my life as I please- not as society dictates.
 Excellent Book
 This is a great reality check. It helped me look at things differently and taught me to stop and think about what deserves to be thought about and what's just a waste of time
 Thank you Danny Avidan
 Loved the book, but I mean the first two words were “Charles Bukouski” so who wouldn’t.
 It’s a very good book, full of life experience, very practical. The introduction is very annoying - with the f*** word in every sentence (which almost made me quit reading) but the rest of the book is just brilliant.
 Love reading this at school. My teacher lets me read it too.
 Good thing I thumbed through this before I started reading it. Multiple pages were missing and typed over and the cover was ripped.
 Just got it today and already love it. Looking forward to nightly reading
 This book is excellent. It came without a scratch on it. Brand new hard cover. Very Nice!!!
 In his own funny way, Manson is able to pin down deep values for us to reflect on. Great read.
 One of the best things this book did for me was give me a mirror to examine against.<br/><br/>It showed how I was contributing to my own unhappiness.<br/>It taught me that fault and responsibility are two different thing<br/>Yes I was not at fault for everything but I was responsible for everything. I wasn't taking responsibility which was "tilting" me.<br/>It made me realize what an entitlement little bitch I was.<br/>I expected the world to be "just right" for me and the fact of the matter is I don't have a right nor the means to make that claim.<br/> and that's why I love this book.
 My new Guide to Living. I had to buy my own copy so I can write in the margins and underline specific points.
 Pages 9 through 21 are either blank or as pictured above.  Printing is unreadable. I bought 2 unfortunately.  When I pressed return link it said it was uneligable for return
 This book makes you see life differently and makes you want to change the way you’re living. I like the laid-back writing style, and I would recommend it anyone, but I think it’s especially good for young adults.
 No shattering news, simply a good presentation of several knowns that we often ignore in the daily thread mill. Enjoyable and reassuring.
 Well since it's an audio book there was nothing to expect
 Great and entertaining book that provides wonderful insights.
 Great!
 Helpful and real
 Starts out humorous, gets more practical as it goes along. Good advice.
 Puts the wonder of life into perspective. I feel that most things in life do not deserve the importance we put on them.
 In general I'm very skeptical of self-help books, and the title made me even more so. However this book was extremely well written - funny yet deep. It has actually changed the way I see myself and reflect/question my values.
 This is a neat little book.  You will enjoy it.
 Great book.
 Good book.
 I recommend this to everyone now. A great way to figure things out for yourself.
 Loved this book helped me get a new perspective on how to deal with life and constant stresses i face, recommended to several friends who struggle with anxiety they liked it just as much
 My adult kids loved it. LOL, they said.
 Great book...must read or listen to ....
 stupid book waist of money
 Fantastic book. A keeper. An amusing and easy to follow book on choosing what is important in life and making sure you are caring and nurturing those ideas.
 A book that presents a platform for genuine self evaluation and discovery. A Bold and exhilarating analysis of modern day insecurities, self-absorption, and cultural niceties that challenge authenticity and honest expression.
 Nice book to start a quest of reading
 Fantastic book! Decided to give my life a bit of a change around and this was motivation to push me further in the right direction. it's a book about finding yourself ...knowing what's important and letting go of what is not
 It gives you a real, honest view regarding how to live a good life in this fast paced and crazy world.
 Great book!!! I love it
 I won't repeat the title of the book since the vulgarity confuses Amazon although they have no problem selling it..  I don't mind the words, but they go on and on with no real point.  This is a guy who is basically bragging about his sex life and his alleged enlightenment, but he never gets to the point.  His grasp of psychology is pretty thin ( a few months of Psychology Today).  His humility is non existent.  He's sanctimonious and meandering in his writing.  He's basically taken a blog and stretched it for 200 pages.  The basic point is figure out what matters in your life and go for it and if you're doing other things that distract you from that, stop doing those things.  He's also exceptionally judgmental about choices other folks make that might not align with his values.  Not worth the read.  PS  - Amazon.....when folks use the title of his book  it's not vulgarity.
 Sage advice wrapped in common sense - devoured in a day! The last chapter especially is so honest and insightful, with a surprisingly different tone to the rest of the book. Loved it.  The perfect way to end my 2016 self-help binge ;)
 Best self help book I’ve ever read.
 Mark Manson gives details of his personal life as well as some pretty notable figures and how they have become the persons they are today by following guidelines that can be found in this book.
 I like the writing style. It’s easy to read. The contents are also inspiring. It reminds me what are important things in life and how to enjoy them. Now it’s the time to practice living a good one.
 The title of this book drew me in but the quality and depth of the content kept me there. This should be required reading for anybody who thinks their opinion actually matters.
 Very practical in Funny book for men.
 Great listen. Fun stories.
 Fantastic and confident read. Definitely turns heads when in public
 This book helped me a lot !
 Great read! Many important lessons for dealing with life the right way - and some good humor to go along.
 Great book for people that need a different life perspective.
 Great book, but not great printing quality. Text on the bottom of multiple pages has had bleeding through from the other side.
 This is a very well written book.  One of the most dangerous threats to our society is entitlement, and I appreciate the way the author highlights this enormous problem.
 Love this book! Great read! I am 10 months social media free!
 A well organized read that creates quick application for otherwise lofty philosophies. Helps to take the pressure off and create freedom in everyday life.
 Awesome book.
 Didn't get a whole lot of this book, however, it did get me to thinking and had some really great advice.
 A really great book with tons of deep introspective thought. I bought the audio cd because I like to listen to books on the way to work. This one was the best audio book that I have heard so far. There is a lot of really deep introspective thought here. The title may not imply as such, but I think the author did a great job of visualizing his viewpoint on life and happiness. This book is so much better than the regular 'You can do it" self-help book. The author is clearly authentic and just sharing his views, which is refreshing in comparison to the many other "scammy" self-help authors out there.
 Loved it. It felt like I was reading advice from Deadpool.This is not a bad thing! I would read this book again.
 I’m kind of thick headed like that... Why is 20 more words required, isn’t reading it twice enough? Damn automation.
 If you’re looking for real talk, in your face advice, spend the money and give this book a read, will not regret
 A great read, especially toward the end. Profound insight into consumerism and living a satisfying life. Helped me during a time of anxiety as a new mom in a seemingly endless world of violence. Takeaway: it's not so bad, after all.
 I enjoyed it! I read it in 3 days. It was hard to put the book down. There was a lot of common sense stuff but it was reassuring and empowering to read it from someone else.
 Just the attitude adjustment I needed!
 Great book, raunchy, but a great insight on how to live for yourself and not others.
 This is a great book. The title doesn't do it justice. It's about the importance of hardship as a learning experience, dealing with adversity and overall being happy. It's a great no BS read. Definitely recommend this one to all my friends.
 I liked the book. It’s a quick read filled practical advice and thought provoking content. Counterintuitive approach tame the mind.
 Irreverent language adds to the fun of this self-help book, which makes clear what actually is true about living a happy, meaningful life.
 A very deep view of human mind in a very casual dialogue with the reader. Loved it. Cannot wait to read more of the author’s work.
 This is a wonderful "self help" book if you'd call it that. The author spoke to me in a way I could understand and gain his perspective. I enjoyed every moment of this book and look forward to using it as a tool in my life.
 Simply put, the best "self-help" book ever written.  Mark Manson has had  some pretty cool life experiences and he has had  the wherewithal to keep a running catalog of his exploits. Both humorous and insightful, you will benefit from this book.  Buy it right now.
 I read "Models" by Mark Manson, and it was DAMN good. I'm only a couple pages in, and I'm already very interested in finishing this. I know that from reading "Models" this will be a quality read.
 You must read this book!!!
 Manson nailed it.
 Really enjoyed the book, unlike any other books, very interesting and engaging read, also very funny and well written! Highly Recommend!
 Loved this book I bought more after reading for gifts.
 Good advice
 Quick easy read. Keeps you engaged and some useful information. I think a lot of teens could read this too. 16+ due to a lot of F-bombs but they say or hear worse than that anyhow.
 This book is awesome!
 Have recommended this to many friends
 It makes you look into the mirror and realize how terrible you really are.
 great read
 This book is pure gold. It shipped really fast too!
 Mark breaks the myth of positive thinking, than he explains how our values are often wrong and ends with talking about death. All in a funny, easy to digest manner.
 I listened to it twice in audible and bought 2 as gift for 2 people I care about.  it sure is subtle, but the message is delivered kindly, funny at times and with strength.
 The start was a bit shaky for me and not sure I’d love all the every other words in there and then the content just bam sucked me right in. Nice work Mark. Great content.
 First book I've completed in years! I'm gonna re-read it to make sure I capture everything. Makes you look at life in a different perspective.
 Hardback book, as advertised.
 This book is fantastic and a refreshing perspective in today's day and age. Definitely recommend.
 Bought this as a bday gift for a friend hoping she enjoys it as much as the reviews I’ve read
 Very helpful for people who find themselves caring for so long about so much that they feel as if they have reached wits end. Helpful for living a life full of caring about the right things to care about.
 Claro, conciso, intenso. Muy bien condensado para dar un fuerte mensaje: analiza tus valores, la forma en que mides tu vida, hazte consciente de tu mortalidad y vive!
 Great book about accepting every aspect of ones life!
 I admire the "brutal" honesty and frankness of this book. If you are honest with yourself throughout the book, many of the points hit home. This "tell it like it is" work is an enlightening page turner, sure to provoke thought.
 I don't give a f*** enough to write 20 or more words about this book, you'll just have to read it.
 I enjoyed the approach that the author takes to teach us to value the good things in life. I also liked that he doesn't pretend to have all the answers,  but rather a toolkit for figuring it out yourself. A great read!
 An equally powerful and enjoyable read reminding me to focus on the things that matter. This book would be suitable for anyone hoping to rid their life of unnecessary mind clutter and replace it with purposeful action.
 In a book full of humorous dialog, I didn’t expect any real lessons to be taken from it. But I would recommend this book to anyone at any age. Go in with an open mind and you’ll find a fortune
 Don't let the title fool you.  It is a interesting book.  The sad thing is I mention some of their concepts to my employees.
 I've been preaching this to my patients for years! Manson is engaging in a way that makes sense to the average person.
 I love the Charles Bukowski references, reading the first three pages, I knew I'd enjoy this book. Good read for anyone looking to broaden their mind and daily grind way of thinking.
 Reading this book really helped get me out of a funk. This was the first self-help book I've read, so I can't compare it to others, but it's got a thumbs up from me. What I got out of it is: I got to care about things because I'm human; I just need to evaluate what I choose to care about.
 Decent read but very similar to his blog. Quick read, insightful.
 Not what I expected but much more informative,. Nice read a few chapters in.
 Highly recommend for motivating people to break out of their shells.
 Amazing book! Very refreshing. Recommend to everyone  who is battling depression or just struggling with life...Well written. Easy to read in a day or two.
 Good read
 A perfect book that makes me re-view and re-think the world and values. It helps me to deal with daily problems easily. Literally changed me.
 Awesome book
 Great read. Mark Manson gives you insight on some of the pointless thoughts we have day to day. Stupid things we choose to care about while we let life slip away. Unleash yourself from the world of inhibition!
 It is in general a very well written book. It holds a lot of concepts that make you think. It was a little bit of a downer though
 A good read with some good points. Not my favorite.
 Deeply philosophical but in a very down to earth way.  It is also a useful book with reminders about what is important and what is keeping you where you are.
 Excellent read.
 Mark Manson’s book helped me realize many things in this book and has inspired me to become a better person each day. Highly recommended.
 It is really easy to blow through this book in a day. I recommend trying to slow it down and really take in the message.
 Good read, interesting perspective on life and how to live it. The stories intertwined were both funny and relevant!  Makes you look at life in much different way. Probably read it again!!!!
 Just listened to it again for the third time and gets better every time. Enjoy!!
 Fabulous! Worth the read!
 I would recommend this book to anyone who might be feeling like life has been getting the best of him. It changes the way you look at the big picture of life.
 Good short read.
 Thoughts and opinions that take years of experience to gather are captured eloquently and colorfully. The title will scare a lot off but they may be the ones who truly need it the most
 everyone needs to read this book.
 I did not order this book.<br/>The very title turned me off.<br/>I asked Amazon to remove it<br/>from my list.  I hope this was done.<br/>Now I am surprised that it is still<br/>on my list.  Please remove it.
 I was expecting the hard cover version to be orange, but it comes with a kind of wrapper and it is actually a black cover.
 Very useful reading for me. Of course the main subject of treated can be found in many other books, but his work is just great and I don't see the need to look for another book about this matter.
 I couldn't put it down. Well worth the read and very insightful. I can't wait to read it again! Amazing!
 very insightful, really makes me review my choices and the energy I invest
 Enjoyed!
 Unique way of delivery. writing-wise. Some times it seems contradictory but I will reread portions. I recommend. Quick read. Thanks.
 Easy read. Good advice. Great book to share.
 I liked how this book delivers in a fun way our responsibility for making choices and suggests how rejecting other choices is a good thing
 It felt like I just had a conversation with him while drinking a beer instead of reading a book. His style of writing keeps you captivated from the beginning, as he tells the best way to get the most out of life.
 I can’t believe I let someone talk me into reading this garbage written by a rich kid twit who’s realized what a n’er do well loser he is. Fortunately I quit 1/4 of the way through.
 Decent book. Enjoyable read.
 Great read! I'm changing the way I think and am looking at the situations around me in a new light. I feel lighter after reading this book and happier too.
 great book
 Great book for everyone!
 I was not sure what to expect when I began this book, but it was recommended by a friend.  So many great insights!!
 Great book to read if you want to give yourself a Reality Check.
 Interesting view of how to conduct your life based on what is really important to you.  What do you really care about.  And those things you should not invest your time and soul into.  Gets a little repetitive and heady toward the end.  I could related to many ways to avoid personal grief by not not really caring about certain things I do not have any control over or no interest in.  Also, relationships are seen from a more practical aspect which includes looking at oneself as opposed to blaming others for your condition in life.
 Love, love, LOVE it.
 Funny read.  Actually insightful. Arrived on time
 Absolutely everyone should read this book!
 Such a good book!
 Solid. Nothing new. 50-100 pages too long. Compelling essay stretched in a book.
 Recomended
 Awesome read
 It teaches you to prioritize. It’s important to care, but not to worry. Don’t get caught up in the unimportant things.
 Keeps you engaged throughout and easy to read. Should be required reading in school in my opinion. Message is solid.
 Meh. Nothing in it I didn’t already know, so it isn’t helpful for me. I have done a lot of therapy and read a lot of self help books already.
 it was funny
 I heard about this book from a podcast he spoke on. I’m very glad I have read it and will likely read it again in the near future to take in all of the insights it offers
 This book changed my life, and has the potential to change society!
 I really enjoyed this book. I was skeptical at first because of the title, but it turned out to be a fantastic read, with many great lessons to apply to my own life.
 This book can make you laugh and completely re-evaluate your place in life in less words than I have written here. Definitely worth the read!
 The perfect 2018 start!
 Buy this paper back read it then read it again. Outstanding.
 Excellent and easy read. Philosophical yet approachable, 'The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck' is a book that I will turn to for quotes &amp; anecdotes for years to come!
 Sometimes fun, sometimes immature, amateurishly psychological, occasionally shallow, unfocused, self-conscious and conflicted, this book started out well enough but lost steam for me when he judged people who "felt too good" about themselves or were what he considered overly self-confident for no reason, which kind of describes the author himself in my opinion. Something prickled at the back of my consciousness when he made thin, amateurish case assessments of people he deemed full of themselves or clueless about whether or not they were actually successful or happy. I kept thinking, Who is he to judge? Is he an experienced therapist who has dealt extensively with narcissistic and other personality disorders? I felt these assessments to be frivolously tossed out just to substantiate any given point he was trying to make - but didn't. For me, the writer is a would-be smart-ass-turned-"deep thinker" with a good book title that sold an overworked editor on an otherwise confused thought process. I gave up a little after halfway through because I could see it was just going to be more of the same annoying claptrap most of us have already encountered in the millions of so-called self-help books thrown at us since high school.
 Im not a reader, but this book is so awesome, so easy to understand and digest that I would recomend it to anybody that goles through my mind
 Great read!
 This book is amazing. Such great insight on life. Sometimes we need to stop and realize how lucky we are to just be alive. This book will lift you up with real life scenarios of coping, accepting, and just loving life. Great read.
 Despite the seemingly cynical title it was a great and very empowering read. I definitely will apply the principles in this book.
 Everyone I mean everyone should read this
 Came broken
 A lot of wisdom in this book.
 I liked the honesty.  Good read. On the expensive side. Using the f word so much was unnecessary. Worked too hard to work the F word in.
 Easy read with a lot of useful content. He brings some thoughts that seems simple but are very powerful.<br/>I founded many of the advises in the book very helpful.
 Mark provides a lot of insight and presents in an honest and straightforward approach.
 Loved this book!!
 Puts a fresh perspective on tried and true wisdom from both philosophy and psychology.  The consistent humor along with numerous ahhah! moments kept my attention throughout, and I have too many highlights to count
 Overall great book.  Highly recommend.
 Simple and powerful. I recommend this book to everyone and really think that everyone could benefit from reading it and learning more about how we stress too much.
 Incredible. I enjoyed the many topics and how easily they flow from the authors mouth. Great reality check and pick me up. Looking forward to another book.
 Love it. Makes a great gift too
 Great book on adjusting our thought patterns as to what is really important in life and how to get the most out of life.  Highly recommend it to everyone!
 Great buy!
 Got this for my sister (who is in college) for her birthday. She LOVED it and said it was spot on.
 Just stop worrying about what others are saying, thinking, feeling, and doing......you've got to stop giving a F if you want to be successful in any area of your life. This is one of my top 10 reads and I wouldn't hesitate to read it again. So many books on inspiration and self improvement want you to spend tireless hours doing journaling, meditating, and self awareness exercises.......when what it comes down to is you've just gotta stop doing what you're doing!!! I love Mark Manson!!<br/><br/>He's Real .... He's Raw....and he's the kinda guy I could hang with and truly feel that I've gained some kind of elevation.  I have nothing but respect for people who shoot from the hip and are direct like this....<br/><br/>Well written!!
 Thanks for sharing Mark.<br/>Was a book I could not put down.<br/>All about just getting on with it. Do something, anything.
 I really liked this book. It taught me a lot about the good values and the shitty ones and how to take responsibility for my own choices and problems. It is easy to read and quite entertaining. I totally recommend it!
 Great book! Highly recommend it!
 Amazing perspective, I wish I looked at things this way a long time ago. It will change my life for the better!
 After reading this book. I choose to reject all but the very best people and experiences and values in my life.
 Book is excellent and an easy read. Relatable and gives you a giggle every now and then. I love the stories in it as well that can be easily connected to
 Enjoyed the masculine insight and plan to give his recommendations a shot!
 This book is spectacular. It made sense to me. I could relate each chapter to an event or situation in my life and turn it from negative to positive. Definitely will have to read a solid 2 or 3 times to fully master this way of thinking but that's the point.
 There are some aspects about this book that i dont agree. Howerver, after tired seeing a same pattern again and again in this field, this book will deliver a new insight to your mind.
 This book taught me how to deal with my day-by-day choices and what’s important and what’s not. I recommend this book to anxious people like me, who deserve a peaceful state of mind.
 Potty mouth author.
 good read
 One of the best books I’ve ever read in my life. Made me introspect on myself and realize the real important things in life are simple. Recommended, great read
 Currently reading-what a great approach on life. There are many reviews on here i feel people have been very impacted by this book. I am one of them. Great book!
 Much more readable than some self help books. Which, I love reading. But the humor and attitude of the books makes the information very deliverable. Introduces good concepts that may help you self reflect to better yourself.
 It's mainly rehashed, then "effed-up" for effect, westernized, stripped-down Buddhism--to me, not contrarian or new. The method could be explained thoroughly, and has been by others, without basing it on popularized eastern religious teachings.<br/><br/>This wise way of encountering life can become self-evident without referencing any religion or philosophy--just from studying in the "school of hard knocks," aka living the fun and pain of everyday experiences plus reflecting then learning, moment by moment. But modernized old religion is how this author came into his insights, so, of course, he explains his findings and method in such terms.<br/><br/>His is certainly a valid way to find and to describe this method--with f-bombs throughout (so, for readers who hate those, better pass on this, obviously). Still, as self-help books go, I rate it better than most.
 I’m not a avid reader but I couldn’t put this book down. Puts a new perspective on how to cut down the stress in ones life.
 Great read! Highly reccomend It!  Real game changer
 Honestly the only thing I am going to give him credit for is the title.  His attempt at using historical figures in pop culture to illustrate his point was futile and pedestrian. He never gave the so called secret recipe at the end. Although he claims that he does not value a promiscuous lifestyle, he constantly brags about sleeping around. His values changed from conning women into sleeping with him to conning or misleading  the public into buying his anticlimactic fanfic
 DISCLAIMER: I am going to qualify my review by first acknowledging that I am new to the genre of self-help books. With this being the first one I've listened to and now read, I do not have the ability to compare its philosophies with predecessors or others.<br/><br/>With that out of the way, I believe that this book has a lot of good ideas and concepts in the first 5 chapters of the book. With those concepts, there are some great anecdotes to drive the ideas home and allow the reader to take a step back and possibly consider things from a different perspective. Sure, there is a lot of swearing in the early chapters but that is most certainly intentional. In my opinion, it exists to narrow the audience such that those who are left are the ones that are truly searching for help.<br/><br/>The last 3 chapters did not have the same impact on me. While they also had their share of nuggets, I did not find them nearly as insightful as the first 5. That's ok though. Nothing and no one is perfect.
 I get the point. Buddhist philosophy told a different way.
 Some very profound realizations that we can all learn from. Need now to go back and reread. 1st book I have finished in years, read it for yourself and you will see.
 Everyone should read this. Great way to live life.
 Don't let the name throw you off, it's actually very insightful and deep book. I took a lot out of it!! Definitely worth the read!
 This book was recommended to me by a friend and gives me a much better perspective on life.  Loved every page.  Very insightful to how one should view life.
 purchased as a gift for my son  he is enoying the book
 So far so good
 The i sights into how relationships function alone is worth whatever you end up paying for this book. Read it.
 Thanks Mark!
 Great read! Highly recommend
 The author articulated the realities well, and let us see and more importantly, face them. A good read indeed for this generation.
 Amazing! Completely in your face advice. It really shows you how to stop blaming other people for your problems and accept responsibility for yourself.
 Great read. Light but gave good insight especially in this crazy social media filled world. I liked how the author was very supportive
 Got this as a gift for my mother in law,  who loves to practice this lifestyle, and she loves it. Says that it is more than just a funny gift but also a joy to read.
 entertaining book.
 Made some good points but it’s not that great. Seemed kinda egocentric at times.
 Honest advice without sugar-coating. If you aren’t where you want to be, don’t know who you are or what you want, this is what you need to read.
 Brandy M<br/>Read this book to get a new idea of looking at life and the situations we find ourselves in.
 An extremely insightful and outside the box approach to self improvement. The outside the box examples were completely off the wall but fit perfectly with the book's purpose.
 very interesting book!
 Wonderful and funny and honest.
 Real, raw, fun, insightful. Great read. I laughed I thought carefully and opened my mind to learning. I highly recommend.
 great
 Get to read with someone else!  Great conversation piece.
 Excellent book! Full of valuable lessons and outlooks on life. Easy to read and funny as well. Highly recommended!
 Another great book, I really like the guy s ideas. Worth reading and rereading from time to time. His legacy project is looking good.
 Great Read, and make makes you laugh too!!!
 A must read!!
 The author uses humor and honesty to create a writing style that held my interest.  I found myself laughing out loud.  I'm done with self help books but I found this is thought provoking, offering much more substance than I expected.  An interesting guide to life's choices.
 Candid, amusing, existential yet easily grasped. Should be read by all that are yearning for a bit more or maybe less....
 This book is awesome! It really breaks down how to prioritize what you are giving your focus and energy to. Also, it is a very quick and easy read.
 It's definitely a great read!
 Mark's words are not just insightful and helpful in a practical way, but they're so well crafted with the rare skill of writing in his natural tone of voice. A great read. A great gift. A great perspective on a less stressful life.
 Stoicism with swears. I like it. Got in an argument this morning, got really low, then remembered some of the stuff in this book and felt a lot better.
 If you want to know how Millenials think, this is a great book to learn the art.
 Another self help book that tells you the same thing as all the other self help books.  Don't know why I bought this.
 I really enjoyed this book and was surprised at how well written it was and insightful.  While reading it, I began to see things that it was describing about myself and my friends - I feel that with this knowledge, I can eventually become a better person than I was before reading it.  The only reason I don't give it five stars is because the book is written from the point of view of an American Male in their 30's and I feel like it is speaking directly to those types of people; I would buy this book to give other male friends in their 30's but I wouldn't recommend it to any of my female friends.  It's not that it's sexist (although some other reviews do believe it to be), but rather I see more guys laughing about the situational humor in the book than ladies as most of the experiences described are from the point of view of a male.
 This book is mind openning, sharp, full of insight and truth. I will definitely read it again. And again! Very highly recommended!
 I truly recommend this book.<br/>Great examples and learnings from different concepts that helps make your life much simpler, and helps you understand which fights to take.
 the book contains some useful advice, I'd say 40-50% is good content. It does ramble a bit but well worth it. However, major thumbs down for the audible version as the narrator indulged in some terrible voice acting, speaking in extremely annoying and stereotypical fake voices whe the book is quoting women, minorities, and anyone other than the author. Major turn off and really detracted from the content
 This book puts a lot into perspective.<br/>Enjoyed the authors take on life.
 Happy with this purchase. Arrived in good condition and speedy, too. Was packaged just right.
 Great book if you can make it past the wave of expletives. Surprisingly insightful and a quality read.
 A gritty, honest analysis of why we think and act the way we do. Great anecdotes and easy to read summaries of ideas. Only downside is the all too frequent use of swearing. Used in moderation it is fine, but at times seems unnecessary.
 Although somewhat crassly written it is a valid reminder of life, our expectations and how they don’t necessarily always match up.
 Love this book, very unapologetic and precise. I like the potty-mouth approach as well and how understanding death helps you to go on living!
 good book.
 First i thought it would be about how to shift your focus, don't be bothered by others. Well, it is not.<br/>It goes so much deeper while staying funny. One of the best reads of the year!
 This book has opened my eyes to the reality around me. This is not a "solve your problems" book, it is rather a blatant explanation of what life is behind the facade.
 I’ve read lots of “self help” books and always find them cheesy. This book is unlike any I’ve read. It was so insightful and made me laugh more times than I can count.
 Wonderful book, so funny at times, helpful!
 Different approach, totally doable
 The book was alright, and some of the pages came crushed.
 Great read! Such insights on life interwoven with his own experiences. Highly recommend this to all beginning their adult lives!
 Good book with some interesting points. I'm not exactly sure what I expected, but it wasn't that. Definitely gives a person some things to think about and consider.
 Mark provides very meaningful decisions each of need to make in order to improve our lives. Good material and examples.
 Only four chapters into it atm but it is very uplifting and rejuvinating... Highly recommend!
 Good for some self reflection, some interesting views raised. A refreshing chabge from conventional self-help ideas that put into perspective our behaviours
 This book is a great guide to life and hilariously written. Thoroughly recommend it. Lots of real life examples too.
 This book provides some great examples of how whittling down what to focus your energy on will enhance your life exponentially.
 Enjoyed this book a lot, learned some really helpful stuff.  Quite a bit of humorous material also.  I definitely recommend it.
 He does a good job at making you think about things you care about. He gives you the ugly blunt truth about life and all our little emotions. I’d recommend.
 He puts personal stories, historical anecdotes, and thoughtful insight into a quality read with a hell of a "hook" for a title.
 Worth reading more than once. The subject matter really makes you take a look inside. I will definitely be re-reading this book another time.
 But this book changed my perspective and I would recommend to anyone who breathes.
 Phenomenal
 Unique approach and well written but who gives a F***
 I saw the great reviews and truly wanted to like this. It was awful. He just repeats the title over and over with no real keen insight. I decided to listen to the whole thing, praying it would get better. It did not. However the case, there were small, tiny, minuscule tid bits of advice that I found helpful which is why I'm giving it two stars.
 Just OK.  Don't get me wrong, there is some useful stuff in this book. My issue is that the writing is sub-par.  The book seems to jump around all over the place (kind of like a blog) with no roundup of what you just spent the last hour reading.  I found myself drifting away from whatever the message was supposed to be (maybe I got sidetracked by the author's repeated examples of how many girls he has slept with).  Personally, I find the book "The Four Agreements" to be a better format for these lessons.  Not terrible, just not great.
 Great book
 Great read so far, no question about it, it touches are topics that we are afraid of, very honest book and makes you have to self-reflect while reading it.
 Life changing advice. Great read.
 Listened to the audio and liked it so much I bought the book.  Amazed at how wise he is at such a young age.
 I believe this book found me.  It might not change your life immediately but it can change the way you think.
 Get it
 This book takes a look at ancient teachings phrased in modern outside the box type terminology. A very worthwhile read
 This book is great.
 Great book to give as a graduation gift to someone, a niche read full of clever references that is easy to digest.
 Good book, it makes you think
 I love this book ! Helps me master the art of not giving a F*** in life
 Some useful observations. Some wrong conclusions. On the whole not as clever or insightful as it purports to be, but the end is better than the beginning.
 Life changing book! This book is a book i think everyone need to read.<br/>It gives so much more meaning to life.
 This book was recommended by a friend and I LOVE IT! Because it pissed me off at times, made me laugh hysterically and totally made me nod in acknowledging the truth in the words.
 Great, easy read
 This book was great from start to finish. Brutally honest and well written.  I would definitely recommend this book to my friends and family and I will most certainly be reading this again.
 Mark Manson gives a fresh, practical take on the wisdom of the ages.
 I loved this book. Very eye opening for me. Especially the self entitled parts and death parts . I need part 2
 Its books like these that bring the world into perspective. Everyone would benefit greatly as a human being after reading g this book. I will recommend to everyone I know
 Love this book!!!!!
 I really enjoyed the main concepts of this book and the philosophical views. It’s very relatable and insightful.<br/><br/>I would recommend this book for anyone.
 GREAT READ! GET IT! And, then buy it for your inner circle.
 Read marks blogs regularly. This book is fun to read.
 Mark has done it again! Forgive any bias that I have because I am a fan of his work. I pre-order this book because I had high expectations. These expectations were delivered on completely. Minus a tad bit excessive profanity, I truly enjoyed this book. I believe this book has something for everyone. For me it was the last chapter, I feel I am better able to hone in on  what is truly important in life. I just think of it in the context of a cliff at the edge of the world, if I slipped would this be important. For me this was a revelation but when I offered advice through this lense to a friend he complained about me being black and white and the world doesn't work this way. That's why people need to read this book because maybe to you seeing your problems through a clif lense IS too black and white. We are all different people, some things may hit you where you need it and others you may not agree upon. But this book is filled with advice and strategies for dealing with life based in significant psychological research I think just for the sake of learning about how people's brains (yours included) this book warrants its cost. Looking forward to the next book!
 Stop thinking if you should  buy this or not! Just buy the damn book. It will change your mindset completely.
 Mark again has a winner. The book was on my door step the minute it was available
 I loved the presentation and the content.  Authors use of humor makes for engaging story.  Great how Author owns his story.
 Loved this book!!
 This was a must read. It put into perspective on how you should focus only on what truly matters to you and has some sort of significant impact on your life.
 The early pages are hard to take due to the profanity but it is as advertised and does convey the passion with which the author believes in his theories. Well written and researched, I would highly recommend to others.
 Excellent philosophy book.
 Nothing else to say....
 This is a great book. The language should not sway you from reading it. I would recommend this book to anyone who is dealing with issues in their life.
 Great book. Perfect for providing perspective.
 the last 2-3 chapters of the book appeared to me most honest ones and interestingly written ones. Recommend for reading for everyone being suspicious that there is something wrong with their current lifestyle, adopted values
 Greats read!
 Read it in one day!! &lt;3
 Read the entire book in 24 hours. Very easy read and a lot of great points. The author also adds in stories from his life that a lot of people can relate to. Highly recommend!
 I’ve enjoyed this book very much. It’s a good start if you want to find balance between attachment and detachment. I have recommended it to friends and family.
 I loved that it was a very honest and direct approach to dealing with life.  Refreshing look at self-help!!
 I got a lot out of this book and sent a copy to a friend as well. When I hear the word "values" I often shut down because it makes me think of republicans and conservatives. But of course we all have values whether we are aware of them or not, and we prioritize certain values over others, which can create problems. Since reading this book I've become more aware of my own values, and how I am choosing to prioritize some of them over others, and considering whether or not that's getting me what I really want out of life. It is empowering to realize this, and that I can choose to focus on other values that might be more in line with the results I want.<br/><br/>I really like Mark Manson's work and since reading this have taken some of his courses on his website.
 great book
 Awesome book. So true, and very well connected to today's world.
 Great for simple change in mindset. Was a nice book to pick up and read here and there. Helps get your head out of your....recommend if you’re in a funk and need a boost in life!
 It took me a while to read this book, to be more precise about 2-3 months. Not because of the book, but because of many other distractions in life. However, under normal circumstances I would've ended the read and moved to another book despite not finishing it. But something about this book kept me going back to it.<br/><br/>The book (I cannot use it's name as Amazon rejected due to profanity despite the asterisk) is an interesting read with some great insights into your life and philosophy about living your life by helping yourself avoid stress. The book has nine chapters. Of all these chapters, the most remarkable chapter, and the one that kept my mind fully and philosophically focused, was chapter 9 "... And Then You Die". If this was a book where skipping chapters was something that author encouraged for one reason or another, then Chapter 9 would have been my advice to you to read. But because this book discusses how to focus on your life and how to filter what is relevant to you and what is not, chapter 9 would sound like an everyday big-headed discussion on life. Each chapter has an interesting point to make. Some of the points might be something that you are already aware of but you were not thinking about it or you thought you might be the only one focusing on it, there is something to learn and to keep you thoughts engaged.<br/><br/>So why four stars? At times the author lost my attention. Although most of the book is trying to keep you focused and engaged, I found it on a couple of occasions that my mind was flooded by some irrelevant things.
 I can only envy Mark Manson for achieving such clarity at such a young age. I'm excited about the next path he will light up armed with a vision of existence that makes you open your eyes and say 'yeah, that's exactly it.'
 Awesome book! Couldn't put t down!
 Great book. Helps fe focus on what really matters to me. Less focus on stress and Drama.
 Great book, very informative and funny!
 This book was... not for me. It was, at best, a first grader primer when I was looking for something a little meatier.<br/><br/>I read it all the way through (it had been recced to me, and I wanted to give it a fair shake), but never shook the impression that it was facile and shallow. (Which, I suppose I could have gathered from the title, but I was literally trying not to judge a book by its cover.)<br/><br/>I'm honestly not sure if the author is a slick huckster selling a couple hundred pages of shopworn "observations," or if he's just young and this is as far as he's gotten. I suppose for a similarly young and inexperienced reader, this book might be helpful, so I don't want to knock it too hard, but if you've spent any time at all reading and thinking about mindful living, this little book is of no value. Sorry. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
 very insightful
 Great read! Finished in two nights cause I couldn’t put it down easily.
 Exactly the kind of "kick in your pants" and "get your s*** together" book my millenial peers need to read and to gain perspective from. It's humorous and insightful, can definitely be read in one sitting.
 A Must Read.  Spot - On and made me smile!
 Great book for anyone who likes personal development books. Mark Manson really gets thinking on what's really important in life and why staying over artificial concepts is really not worth it.
 During a recent low point in my life, I happened to find the title of this book and naturally thought to give it a try. I learned that it is my responsibility to give a f$&amp;k about what is really important to me. I learned that as humans we are all subject to problems, but I can trade my old problems for better ones, provided I take responsibility for my decisions. I had to highlight many chunks of the book since so much of it was personally valuable. I can revisit what I highlighted and remind myself I can give a f&amp;$k about some things as long as I choose the best path.
 Great gifts!
 I enjoyed this audio book, great content to start the new year on the right foot!
 A fundamental read to make your life better. If you’re looking for your next read, this is a really great choice. Great story teller
 Good read
 Writer made a lot of very good points, for a person 22 years younger than me, that has never been short of cash, how does he know about struggling?
 This is an introspective book of how to live your life. Or more accurately, how not to live it. You have to be on an introspective mood to love it.
 This book truly simplifies life and what should truly matter.  It was very eye-opening and raw!  I loved every word!
 A must read for anyone!
 What an awesome book. I think it is a must read.
 A good way to remember to not sweat the small stuff and it's almost all small stuff.
 Great read, and plenty of swears! He writes about stoic philosophy without ever actually mentioning stoicism or its acolytes (that I can recall). Overall, EXCELLENT book.
 This book is quite helpful in figuring out how to structure one's life.
 great book
 Good read but the narrative really meanders from topic to topic.  Not that I could have done any better.  Read it twice taking notes helped.  Definitely worth reading and trying to apply.
 An interesting read.
 This book will change the way you look at life and how you overcome obstacles. Great for anyone ready to self improve
 It's a book well written, great pieces of advice you  may find as if a friend was talking to you, right to the point.
 A+
 It’s a great book. The way the author writes, keeps the audience entertained. You can definitely learn from this book.
 This book has changed my life...seriously...<br/>as much as I hate to admit... ( hating any sort of self help book on the planet).
 Good deal!
 Consider being thoughtful to those around you, and have a better outlook on life. Good read and challenging ideas here.
 Really repetative, started funny, got old quick!
 Great book.  I'm ready to read it again!
 Easy to read because it had a great balance of humor, story-telling, and profound insights that somehow I hadn’t come across before. So glad I bought it, will read again when trapped in an existential pity party!
 Great read! Well written and down to earth advice. Sometimes we really need that bite of reality to get us back on track. Very worth the read!
 Loved it, read it in a week.
 Every chapter made me realize how much more there is to life than what i know. Enjoyed reading this thoughtful book.
 The title says it all!
 It's only subtle if you're doing it right. ;-)
 respond."<br/><br/>I find a book with the F word in the title pretty hard to resist, which is why I chose to buy this one, even though I hate self-help books. The first few times I read the F word in the book, I smiled. Eventually, it stopped being funny. I think that several of the ideas in this book make sense, for example (p 7), "...we humans have the luxury of being able to have thoughts about our thoughts." Thinking about your thinking, I think, is an important part of good mental health. The author gives the example of situations involving a couple of musicians. One's less success than expected bothered him a lot, the other guy realized that things turned out well for him in spite of the fact that he was kicked out of the Beatles and replaced by Ringo. In fact, he provides lots of examples like this. He also debunks the whole Power of Positive Thinking concept, saying that all that positive thinking happens because we think that the way we are without those affirmations is somehow not okay. I'm not a proponent of affirmations, so I'm not sure I have an opinion on that.<br/><br/>There are a few other concepts that I remember off the top of my head that are useful, that of having to work really hard to be really good at things (the 10,000 hours of Gladwell's Outliers), the fact that You Are Not Special (wish my acquaintances could say that about their kids and themselves), the fact that most struggle with mortality and although we all know we are going to die someday, we don't (can't) deal with that in a healthful way.<br/><br/>It's not so much that I don't like the author's ideas or in your face writing style, it's more the fact that I find others' ideas more useful. For example, best book of all time on this subject: Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl. Content of the Subtle Art pales in comparison. Coming Home: Uncovering the Foundations of Psychological Well-being by Dr. Dicken Bettinger and Natasha Swerdloff is also better...but you have to have a certain level of background knowledge about this thinking about your thinking to "get" that book. Also, The Power of Meaning: Crafting a Life That Matters by Emily Esfahani Smith has a few flaws, but overall, is a really useful book that explains that searching for happiness is not the path to happiness. Doing good deeds will lead to happiness (as my existentialist son points out, we do nice things for people because it makes us feel good, a point about which I can't disagree).<br/><br/>In summary, while the author makes a few good points in this over the top in your face sort of story, by the end, the novelty of excessive F Word usage wore off. A better book (besides the ones already mentioned) 10% Happier by Dan Harris. Entertaining, useful...and very few swear words.
 Book really makes you think and gives you a good new perspective on life.  I will definitely be reading more books like this.  Would highly recommend.
 Came sooner than expected, great book!
 Life changer of a book. Best one I've read in a year.
 Excellent way of stating very simple truths. Direct from personal experience added with serious study. This book make you change your ways.<br/>Waiting for the Spanish transtation to recommend it to my friends"
 Fantastic read if you really want to live and enjoy life, an eye opener for me and will recommend highly.
 I really enjoyed this book. It was a slap in the face that we all need and full of humor and bad words. I loved it!
 OK quick read, almost there, but not enough value added take-away new ideas.
 I really like the experiences that being presented in the book. The message that being conveyed is very clear and unforgettable.
 I've been following Manson's blog for a while now and this book did not disappoint.  A collection and summary of some of the greatest material from the blog, along with plenty of new insights and thought-provoking anecdotes.  Just finished reading it for the first time, ready to start round #2.  Thanks Mark.
 really good read, reminded me to check myself and remember the important things in life
 very insightful.  full of great information told in a format that makes a lot of sense.  well done and worth reading
 I was amazed reading this book. There is so much in it to practice and learn.<br/>I liked the direct talk of this book.<br/>I would recommend it to everyone.
 great message...but a little over the top
 Loved it
 gift
 A great book to help change your thinking on what's important and what really deserves your attention in life.
 Good self help advise
 The book is as hilarious as it is thought provoking. It’s like a defibrillator for your soul. Absolutely recommend to everyone.
 very good book.. recommend to read it..
 I liked how Manson shared the tragedy of his friend. Not only how did it happened but now it made him realize the value of life.
 This book is awesome! I highly recommend!
 Quick and easy read with some helpful insights about the nature of being human, and what we can do to try and rise above them.
 I highly recommend reading this book. I feel like I have learned some things, but also laughed hysterically at some of the moments.
 This is a tough-love kind of inspirational book. Amidst the current sea of so-called "remain positive" kind of self-development literature, this was an eye-opening and thought expansive book. Highly recommended!
 Loved everything about this book. Makes you think very differently and opens your mind to different views on life. Great read.
 All out of Fuks
 interesting reflective reading.  I enjoyed reading this book a lot more than u<br/>I thought I would. I highly recommend!
 For women who care too much about everyone and everything, this is a refreshing new look at life.  You can still care and give, just don't give it all away.  This read helps you prioritize what to care about, who to care about in your life, starting with YOU.  Yes, he swears, but honestly he does it so often you end up laughing and then not giving a F*#k about the silly word.  Definitely worth buying and reading.
 Really a great book, think words can't describe it. You must read it to experience it. A great life lessons book.
 Great book!
 Great book. Teaches you tonlet go of some things that aren’t important.
 Love this book bought copies for my friends.
 This book is a refreshing spin on self-help and takes a unique angle. Everyone can take something from it and improve their approach to life.
 Best so called ‘self-help’ book I’ve ever read. Gets to the core in unadulterated honest truth - you nailed it!
 Great new angle on life!
 Add to your required reading list. As soon as I finished I couldn't wait to read it again. I just finished reading for the second time.
 Can't put it down
 Too negatively written
 Phenomenal book. Life changing. This book should be compulsory reading for every single person. So many profound lessons! Highly recommended.
 A really good chapter about values,  why we do what we do and a good read over all. If anyone knows any other book that talks about values, please reply. Thanks.
 Boring and trite.
 This book shows a balance that many do not. The other note is that it is the first book in a long time that got me to stay up late reading.
 Great book, nothing less. In a direct no shit tone the big questions and our stupid small answers are being put on magnifier for the reader to reflect on what to give a f!ck about.
 This is the most refreshing self help book I have ever read . A true antidote to the fake and forced optimism of new age bullshit. Totally worth it!
 Great read.
 Great book to put a little perspective into life
 Inspiring book and a great read! It allowed me to question my own priorities in life and certainly put things into a different perspective!
 FIND THE BOOK THAT WILL GET YOU OFF OF  THE YOUR COUCH  of fear...I FOUND IT IN THIS  BOOK and  I am greatful.  Yes the title is harsh.......but so is the life you so passionately want to carve out in such  away that affects the lives of others.....A teacher of many years....but I am so excited about my next journey....Thank you Mr. MANSON...This book will be a constant re-read as I spread my wings in a new life altering experience...that will positively affect the lives of others...
 Must read!
 Good way to look at life!  Expect that sucky things are going to happen, so "embrace the suck."
 Very insightful! Enjoyed reading
 Great book.  Read it.
 Certainly glad I read the book. Showed me how entitled I am being. Plan is to work on questioning myself more
 If you feel that you are again and again facing the same emotional problems and just can't figure out how to break the spell...
 This book presents many ways to see your own blind spots if you're brave enough to weather them. Sometimes people read self-help books to learn how to fix someone one else or change something that an external force has created but this book will give you a mirror from which to listen to voice in your own head that talks to you.
 Enjoyed this book for many reasons. Even bought a copy for my daughter to read after just the first couple chapters. A lot of practical wisdom packed into a succinct package. Going to read it again to try and soak it all in again.
 Brilliant book that is worth the read. Provides a valuable perspective on life that I found thought provoking in a very positive way
 Amazing read! A refreshing, authentic perspective on life! This book was full of gems. I couldn’t stop reading it and taking notes.
 Great book, full of helpful life insights, that guide you to a more meaningful journey. Strongly recommend to family and friends.
 I think this is a good book. Mark Manson is a good story teller as well. Although I don't always agree with his point of view, but still this one is worth to read.
 A simple to understand, yet deep thought provoking spin on embracing life and choosing to pursue your passions while enjoying the challenges they bring with them.
 Just read it! It may just add a little perspective to your life and set you on a new course.
 Great read, will def read a few times over
 I loved mark's pervious book "models" and thought I should give it a try, this book really gives you nice perspective on things and What matters in your life. I would give it a five stars. 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
 Great book on life and super funny too. Stoicism combined with real life examples about how to be happy: awesome!
 It’s an absolutely great book, teaches a lot about life- we all suffer in life but knowing what the purpose of suffering is , changed my perspective
 People read this! It will really change your view on some stuff and if it doesn't then read it again because it made me have a lot of weight off my shoulders
 This book really has a  way of getting  your attention.  Most practical and sound advice  I have read.
 Has some interesting and thought provoking views. I may not have agreed with every single concept in it but i did reflect a lot on them
 Kind of contradicts himself on behaviors but the overall concept it solid. It was a book club book and the discussion between my boyfriend and myself were enlightening
 Great quick read!!
 If you're in any doubt of buying this book, I'm here to tell you that doubt can be moved away. Get this book.
 Well written, couldn't put it down.... Very fitting read for these days and times.  I am going to read it again many times.  Highly recommend!
 This book will kick you right in your self entitled butt and you won't be the same. We all need that kick!
 I will definitely choose to focus on things that matter a bit more after reading this. I’m sure my ego will relax a bit as well.
 The best book I've ever read in my lifetime.  Especially going through a fairly tuff time it brought me back full circle.  Thanks Mark.
 Good read overall and inspirational to an extent. Self focus is important in understanding the nuances of this author and the message he is trying to send.
 Finished this entire book in 2 hours and passed it on to friends.
 Great read which offers lots of new perspectives on life and the way we live it. Definitely recommended for any with a curious and open mind!
 I liked the video because I could listen as I drove.
 Awesome book!!!! Really makes sense on how we think and need to break the cycle. Gives positive outlook on negative things
 So I am "trying again".  I used the TITLE word altered as it is on the book cover, yet my review was rejected as inappropriate.  So hear goes again. WOW! This is a great look of philosophy and leadership. Manson reminds his readers that it is inefficient to even try to care about everything. But it does not mean being indifferent. Manson contends that when doing the right thing, a person just can't give too much concern to adverse consequences, whether is being threatened to lose a job, or getting an unfavorable review. Reminds me a lot of the West Point cadet prayer, which advocates "Make us to choose the harder right instead of the easier wrong, and never to be content with a half truth when the whole can be won. Endow us with courage that is born of loyalty to all that is noble and worthy, that scorns to compromise with vice and injustice and knows no fear when truth and right are in jeopardy." This can be an excellent viewpoint when individuals are forced to lead from the middle.
 A classic--acceptability check for all of us.
 The best book I have ever read in my 40 years of existence, I have learned so much from this book mote than I could have ever imagined. Brilliant author
 Very good book. Keeps my attention with funny stories and hilarious anecdotes.
 A lot of in your face advice. Funny and serious. Allows you to really reflect and reprioritize your life.
 Delivered as promised.
 Entertaining... intriguing... captivating and informative.  An excellent read. Amazon wants  me to write more soooooooo hereeee you goooooo! You happy?
 A simple concept told in a straight forward way. Brilliant! Absolutely love it! I would recommend to anyone to read this.
 A book everyone should read.😊 a lot of really neat and relevant perspectives
 Love it
 This book sucked me in.. it had me laughing, questioning my life.. wanting to change my goals. I thoroughly enjoyed this book.
 I'm still reading this but I've found myself recommending it to people already!
 I really enjoyed the book. Learned a lot from it! This will definitely help me out in my personal life.
 After shipping and delivery issues, I finally open the book only to find out the binding had come apart. Not impressed.
 Definitely recommend reading this!
 Do not hesitate to buy this book.
 great read.
 What everyone of us needs to know, but is afraid to hear. If everyone read this, the world would be a brightet place.
 Great Book!
 The book makes some good points. But his "I used to get girls all the time" attitude/ego comes out a little too often.  As the reader, I don't care about the author's past.  Ultimately did not finish the book because this ego came out one too many times for me.
 A real eye-opening book that I plan on re-reading every few years!<br/>Thank you for a great read Mark.<br/>Sam
 Arrived in perfect condition.
 Excellent
 Actually happy of being clickbaited by this book. Well written. Entretaining. Good and useful practical content.
 Excellent
 An ok read
 Best book ever
 I really think this is a great book for everyone to read.
 One of the best books I’ve read to date. Grab a copy for yourself you won’t regret it. I’ve read many self help books, but this is something else and it’s a good something else.
 This is an excellent book. Different perspective that makes a lot of sense. Bought one for my sister.
 A good reminder that life is too short to waste time.  The final chapter wraps the book up very well.
 An easy read.<br/><br/>Love the part about taking responsibility for your own life and choices. Interesting life stories help demonstrate the theory.
 Love this book! Bought several to give as gifts.
 Amazing book
 Amazing Books, would recommend to anyone!
 This is by far one of the most insightful books I have read so far. Such a good read, I highly recommend to anyone.
 I like the story telling method...this is a work book not just a book...one needs to read revise and reflect..engage to get most out of it.
 Great book! Funny insights and easy to read. Great content and useful “tools” for your every day life. Loved it
 Boring
 Gift
 Taught me what to truly value in life. I highly recommend it to anyone who is going through struggles, self doubt, insecurities, etc.
 this is a book i will read over and over. great buy
 Mark has helped me and others understand ourselves. He enables us to love ourselves because we are each beautiful without the social pressures to<br/> be a rockstar.
 It was ok. There are better self help books out there. Wouldn't read it again. Book feels very pessimistic. Meh.
 Read this book. If you take a moment to let Manson’s concepts really sink in, it will change how you see the world and yourself.
 He really hits on points that we all believe to be strengths but are actually weaknesses. Great way to make change in your life.
 Profound insights coupled with refreshing candor make this a book I'll definitely be reading again and again. I'd definitely recommend.
 Perfect.
 I have yet to listen to this product but my classmate really enjoys this book
 Snarky not witty.
 Love it
 This is one of the most impactful books you will ever read. Very engaging and easy read. Thought provoking and inspiring.
 It brought to my attention things I had not thought about.  I think the book is informative and makes a lot of sense.
 Everyone should read this book.  If you can get past the language  It will give you  a different outlook on life.
 Such a good read. Makes you think about things. I highly recommend.
 One of the most important books I have ever read.
 Not only is this great insight into a lot of issues, but its hysterical!
 Powerful reminder of how, and why, to set priorities of what and who receives our energy.
 Hilarious. Loved reading this. Have purchased as a gift twice.
 one of the best books Ive read
 great
 Best book!!
 I read this book at a critical point in my life, and think about it everyday.  Take accountability, focus on your values and focus only on the things worth caring about.  Great direction and writing style.
 Love this book.. awesome!!! Must Read!!!!
 BUY THIS BOOK! It’s amazing.
 good advise, love the swearing
 I loved this book!
 Great read. Mark connected with the audience well. He said it how it is, there was no sugar coating his points.
 This is a book that'll change your life. Made me think me losing a job was something to look into as an exciting life journey
 Very to the point book.
 A must read for everyone. I loved every page. You will not regret purchasing this book. Pure magic, honestly. Highly recommend.
 The title sucks you in, but it was 100 times better and different then I expected.  I will re read this
 This book hits home on a lot of levels. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone. I loved it.
 Manson is asking the questions we've been asking ourselves. The only difference is he's not beating around the bush when it's time to answer, no vague "deep" response, just the ugly  truth. 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍😂😂😁😂😁😂😁😁😂
 Was a great read and will definitely be recommending to others. I loved how it was to the point and true in so many ways. It's made me open my mind and eyes to the bs we hear from others and ourselves.
 Once you get past the "F" word, everyone can learn something from Mark's writhing. Great refocus on basic, essential life questions. Must read!
 I really like this book. One of the best self improvement books I have ever bought. I wish I knew about this book years ago.
 I bought this book for my father-in-law for Christmas. He loves the book. I have not read it yet, but he recommended I do.
 good, funny, quick read.
 Good concepts. Interesting life story. Like reading a blog post in book form. I would read another book by the author.
 I am totally obsessed with this book!! I listen to it all the time and honestly it has totally changed my marriage for the better for both my husband and i
 I found his delivery very refreshing...expressing thruths equivalent to classic masters...with a contemporary frame.  I especially enjoyed his take on social media.
 Interesting look at values and daily life.
 Nice book<br/> Realities redefined in a simple way<br/>Some of the book elements I don’t agree with but still an amazing read
 Ive read countless books on self improvement and this is by far the best one. Whether youre having a crisis or just want to have a more meaningful life, give it a tryz. 100% worth it
 I mean, honestly, considering the amount of noise in today's world... This book is a must read!
 Great advice
 What a refreshing way of looking at life
 = )
 Interesting of thinking about life<br/>It is a book that worth reading<br/>Also the ending gets better<br/>Worth my time
 Great read, challenges the mental masturbation of self-help genre. I would recommend this to anyone looking to work on themselves
 The funniest self-help/motivation book I've read in a long while.
 Great motivational book
 Very helpful book
 This book is life changing from the first chapter!
 Any book that reminds us to assess and attack our sense of entitlement(especially when we don't think we are entitled) is worth the time to read, consider and implement
 Great book
 This is such a simple message about balance, priorities, and choice which is glaringly absent from the mainstream today. Even though the language is not for everyone, get past that and hear the message.
 Nothing like a fresh new hard covered book! Book came without any damage and was a good read.
 Love it
 Very well written. There’s nothing profound in here really but just everything one NEEDS to hear. Definitely something most people should read.
 I really learned more about myself through this book. Mark teaches quite a few great lessons. Highly recommend this book!
 A well written and thought provoking book.<br/>Don't let the title throw you....
 hilarious
 It's an enjoyable read for those who are looking for that little something; who are questioning current life values and how to operate in the contemporary world.
 This book quickly puts things into perspective. It is a great read and is well laid out. The ending is literally breathtaking.
 Amazing. This is a real gem. A lot of the concepts are buddhist, but they are so much more clear than buddhist texts. But it also has other insights that can really change one's attitude towards life.
 this book made me truly re assess and self-actualize who i am , a must read.
 I aggressively read the book and every step of the way reflecting on my current life . To me this book wasn't just to read but much more than I can describe . Thank you for this lovely adventure .
 Wonderful Books a great self help in orden to trulla Value your worth and most important to CARE about what really matters😍🇩🇴!
 I thought the book was very well written with a powerful message. Author shares his life experiences and transformation from self centered ignorance to a life of service with purposeful meaning
 The 1st few chapters will have you looking at your life like you've been living it wrong. It forces you too rethink your priorities.
 Every American should read this book!
 Love the author's sense of humor.
 This book is a great read! It’s not your typical “self help” book. Instead, it’s very real and gives you ideas to think about that will make your outlook on life better.
 the author had a point but the rest of the book content is not that relevant to the subject
 Dreadful. It’s like being lectured by a glib 10-year old.<br/>Nice title, though. That’s how I got conned into buying this book.
 very informative
 Really liked this book. After reading it, bought several copies and gave to friends and family members.
 I totally recommend it, it's really helps to change the point of view for life's events<br/><br/>Best book I've ever read
 Liked the book
 Matter of  fact  and  relatable writing.. Definitely makes you sit up and think about your priorities in life and what you really give an FYI about!
 Great read! Provides some good knowledge and insight that you can use to improve your life!
 Honestly, I don't have much to add that hasn't already been said. Mark Manson is just really great at giving life advice.
 Some chapters relate to the reader more then others depending on their current place in life.  Nonetheless, great read, great advice, positive vibes.
 Enjoyed the 2nd third a lot. Good perspective about life. Good advice on how to embrace death and life. Would recommend it.
 I give too many everyday and the book tittle said it all! Easy to read and follow, the stories are both hilarious and relatable.
 I just loved this book, read it twice! The subtle art of good writing and good living. Thank you, Mark!
 Made me laugh and really think.  Informational and enjoyable.
 GREAT book. A real game changer.
 Great read. Deifnitely will come back to listen to this often.
 I had never heard of Mark Manson up until I saw a stranger reading this on the train during a particularly stressful time in my life.  I googled it and read Mark Manson's manifesto on his website and I was hooked.<br/>I ordered the book and I've never had any other book do such an adjustment on my attitude in over a decade.  It's done wonders in terms of bringing me out of a deep depression and helping me to cope with anxiety issues, and it's really just so chock full of gems that I don't know where to start.<br/>Read the title; does it seem like something that you'd be compatible with?  If so, it's worth a read.  If not, you already knew you didn't want this book.  Just take off the cover sleeve if you're going to read it at work or church, it has a pretty classy black hardcover underneath.<br/>Thank you, Mark Manson, for all of the help you probably didn't even realize you were giving when you wrote this.
 Great book
 Loved it
 An awesome read!
 Great read
 I'm not quite done with it but it's a great read so far.
 it giveme a lot thing's to tink, all things we can do and accomplish if we center only in the this to really care
 I enjoyed every pierce of this book. Couldn't put it down and already using much that I learned on the regular. Amazing incite and life lessons to take with you always!!
 I must admit this book is packed full of wisdom.  Mark not only entertains you but educates you.  This book won't show you how to get more stuff out of life. It actually is about doing less but committing yourself to what is truly important to you.
 loved the book!
 Loved it, made me realize many things I was subconsciously doing! Worth the read!
 Totally jive with these ideas. This book is everything I've unconsciously taught myself but never been able to define. I'm gonna read it again
 Read it; you will be pleased with its simplicity, humor, with and depth .. I'd like to read it all over again
 Decent read but nothing new. A rehash with the F word thrown in to get you to buy it.
 Very good read
 Awesome book. It makes you think. Read it.
 Great book! Delivers promptly and I'm great condition! As promised!
 Excellent, practical,  humorous perspective.  Built on studies psychology and philosophy,  but applicable here in the year of 2017. You will literally laugh out loud.
 Pulls your head out of your a$$... really teaches you to think in many different perspectives. I really loved it!
 Love the brutal honesty and he perspective which the author adopts to tell all of us what we really need to hear.
 Best book I’ve read in awhile!!! Whole new out look on how to deal with everyday struggles in life
 I found this very thought provoking and I gained some valuable insight from reading it. I enjoyed the tone and the humour and Mark's conversational writing style. I wasn't a huge fan of the ending though. Hence the four stars.
 Fantastic read with thoughtful and useful advice. If you are a fan of author and even if you aren’t I recommend it! Hopefully this is just the start of a series of books from Mark Manson.
 Interesting concept, but all the ideas are based on his personal opinion. There is no real substance to the ideas.
 Quick read and goood i for but nothing i hadn’t found in other self help books 4 more words required
 Looking for a good read?  Get this book ASAP
 Exactly as advertised.
 Amazing book! So refreshing, and much needed.
 Great
 Deep, real and thought provoking. This book has refreshed my view on life and challenged my values in the best way possible.
 A perspective worth giving a chance at the very least ... Definitely worth the time reading ... Hats off ...
 Quite a remarkable book by someone barely out of his 20's.  I'm interested in books that explore how our actions are sabotaged by our screwed up minds and emotions.  The book,The Power of Now made a certain amount of sense but was very confusing to me and somewhat painful to read.  This book, with its profanity and anecdotes made perfect sense.  A profound book that is easy and enjoyable to read.
 I found many nuggets of practical wisdom in this book. It has helped me to realize that there is power in simplifying the things that I deeply care about in life.
 Should have known better.  Just somebody writing their opinions.  Book construction was bad also.
 Great book
 While this book read more like an assortment of loosely related blog posts, the themes and advice were cohesive and interesting.
 Great Book!
 Good ideas at the beginning. The second part of the book is disorganized, lots of ideas don't fully develop.
 Love and book and it is a book that I’m looking forward to read again and again.
 Good book especially for those who struggle with anxiety.
 I feel like this book is amazing, but as I said already not perfect. Author might have deviated a little bit in the middle to give relationshiop advices that were unnecessary.
 This is the best book I’ve ever read. Honest and to the point. I’d recommend to anyone looking for a good read.
 Really enjoyed this book.
 This book taught me some very valuable lessons. I encourage you to buy this book and read it as soon as you can. It has me in tears as I'm writing this. Mark Manson is a visionary and I respect him highly.
 This is the beat self help book I have ever read. And it might very well be the last I ever read. I feel alive.
 Certainly an eye opener. Never heard of this man or the book before but I would certainly read more by him and more books like it.
 One of the best books I’ve ever read
 Seems to be a good book but I haven’t finished it yet.
 I really enjoyed it. Great introspect on life and how to view it. That last chapter was a powerful reminder! I definitely recommend this book for anyone looking to improve their life.
 Replace problems with projects, and you have a tad more optimistic book on the puzzle of life.  This book came into my life at just the right time.  Thanks for sharing your thoughts Mark.
 The author repeats himself all the time,so it gets boring.
 This book made me really open my eyes and see things in a different light. Highly recommend to anyone who needs a reality check
 Love it
 Awesome book so far! Can't wait to finish it
 The book is never boring.  Everything he says here is true even if you think it or know it already it’s still refreshing to hear
 Bought book as brand new product, but it showed up with tattered edges and folds.
 this is actually amazingly right on target - it really is helping me think right!
 Great read gives you a lot to think about.
 Great book
 Great insights!
 Mark Manson is a fantastic writer .. have been reading his blogs since a while now .. he did not disappoint with this book
 The book was amazing but I’m disappointed that the binding has already started to fall apart.
 Not  much value in this bolk. The author speaks about his life when is no need.
 Fantastic read!
 I read this book for one of my courses in college and it changed my perspective on life. 100% recommend.
 The Manson makes you consider your values while reminding you that life is short.
 Great way to view lifes little details
 I loved the book it hit home in more ways than one! Its a great read that will make you reconsider the way you think about your life.
 Very disappointing. Going through a tough time and could've used a few good pointers. But not much in the book that I wasn't already aware of. Oh well - it's always easier said and/or written than done.
 I loved the message and the perspective of this book! Thank you!
 I loved it , easy read, flows wonderfully and stays in point.
 This is an excellent book. But it is a counter-intuitive way of thinking and reacting. It mainly teaches/explains how to care and not care about specific things.
 I really enjoyed this book; the author has the right idea.
 Review (20 Or more words required.)<br/><br/>I liked the book. I gave it 5 stars. The end. But that’s not enough words for Amazon. Now it is.
 The book is pretty awesome!! But I’m wondering why the cover of this book is detachable. I just need to put a tape on it. :(
 Simply mind-opening to a point that your entire outlook on life changes. Have recommended this book to a number of people now.
 Best book I've read in quite sometime. The only one I've binge read in years! Well worth the time and money!
 Must read!
 A Must Read!
 Hilarious.
 This is one of my favorite books so far... I recommend it to anyone not afraid to be himself / herself..
 An amazing and simple book on how to help yourself to not sweat the small s***, and to move into happiness.  Funny and at times very touching.<br/>it was a delight to read.
 Must read
 This book will open up yourself to a genuine life lesson. Personally, this book open up my mind to problems that i didn’t realize they were problems.
 Great read for strong minded people.
 Read on a plane ride. Nothing too mind blowing. Good reminders on how to live a good life on your own terms.
 A must read
 The further we explore the dark the more we are able to see the light. Engaging and well written piece.
 Same ideals, said in a different way, I loved it.
 Eye-opening.
 I enjoyed this book, it’s not for everyone, but I would recommend it if you are a bit stressed and need to think through what’s really important in your life.
 This book aids you in throwing out the mental garbage of your life so you focus on whats truly  important.  Its a philosophy you can easily understand that requires diligence and perseverance to really live...its worth it!
 I bought this book out of boredom, thinking it would be a short entertaining read. I found it to be insightful, thought provoking and right on time.
 A great read.
 Fabulous!
 Best book I ever read.  Bought numerous copies as gifts.
 The insights surprised and shocked me.  The first audio book I have ever listened to.  I was not disappointed.  A must.
 This is an excellent book. I’ve recommended it as a must read for my family and friends.
 It may change your perception and open your eyes, to view the world a little bit differently. I needed 3 more words.
 Good read
 An insightful book that really resonated with me. Not your typical “self-help” book and well worth the read. Highly recommend it!!
 This was a quick read that offered plenty of eye opening life concepts. At the end, we worry about things that really don't matter and life is too short to waste our worries.
 This is a good reminder of the power and responsibility we all have in our own lives, and where to put it to use.
 Best book on how to lead a good life that I've read in a long time. More thoughtful than the title suggests.
 It's life changing, I want to read again, simple because it he so much aha and important moments, that you need to read it all over again to complete absorb it.<br/><br/>And yes, I cried at the end!
 Bought this as a birthday present for my sister - she loved it.
 Lots of hard truths and honestly.
 A must read
 Ordered as a gift for the bestie. She loves it! Ha!
 Love this book! Made me laugh, think and  reflect upon my values by asking questions I never would've thought of asking. Would def recommend it
 amazing !! they really know what they are talking about !!
 Great short read that to forces you to deal with yourself. I dont agree with every thing written but i absolutely enjoyed reading the viewpoints.
 One of the best books I ever read.
 I guess this is a self-help book for people who don't read self-help books.<br/><br/>The ideas in this book are not original, so rest assured you'll be able to find them elsewhere. Mostly, you pay for the "voice" and presentation style of the material.<br/><br/>It wasn't for me. As someone who has read some self-help books, this is probably the worst I've come across.<br/><br/>Example: He describes life like climbing a rope, and says "The joy is in the climb itself." Seriously?<br/><br/>Major credibility lost when he describes getting caught with marijuana in middle school and the peaceful divorce of his parents as traumatic and requiring 10 years of therapy.
 Book came quickly, good read
 Excellent book. Good as New. Recomemded.
 Really good non-BS self development. Definitely worth a reread. Ending is probably the best part so read all the way through
 Great read
 It will blow your mind. This book is amazing
 Filled with those moments of clarity that intuitively make sense, but you have never thought of. Mark does a great job of putting onto paper the messy world of our emotions, beliefs and values and making sense of them. Quick read that is well worth it.
 This book is for anyone and everyone. Happy, sad, up, down or sideways. Everyone needs this reality cheque
 Love, love, love this book! Mark Manson is by far my new favorite writer! Through all of the f&amp;$cks, lies much brilliance and insight. I also have the audio version of this book. Amazing!
 Simple and clear approach on how to really be happy. Easy read. Funny and yet to the point and easy to embrace.
 Perfect!
 Easy and relevant content, not too much psycho babble. Real language structure was refreshing. Good for a long flight. Enjoy
 Mark takes the time to breakdown what most might consider to be complex over-arching themes and theories and turns them into VCR questions.
 Great book , very enjoyable reading.
 A few full on bits, but overall, it’s a bloody good read
 The book was very interesting. Several valid points that were relatable and could be applied in day to day situations.
 good book
 I read this book abd made this review so it would get off my homepage
 just great
 Definitely a book that I will read again and again and pass down to my kids to read one day love it!!!
 I'm only halfway through this book but I have to review it. Best book I've ever bought. Life changing, eye opener. I'm recommending it to everyone I know!
 Not only funny and enjoyable but also thought provoking and true. I would recommend to anyone who needs a quick reality check on what is truly important in life.
 Good life lessons!
 Gives a whole new perspective on so many issues, not all relevant to everyone reading but there's enough in 1-3 chapters to make it worth the price.
 On point and easily to understand
 Very nice book
 Perfect book for people who cares about too much things.
 Good in your face common sense advice we all need. I would recommend this to anyone who needs help prioritizing what is important in life.
 I've already read pretty much everything Mark has written in the self-improvement space - so there were no surprises in here for me, no major 'aha' moments. That said, it's a great compendium of his unique take on the world and it's nice to have all those thoughts in one, easy-to-access spot. And for all I said there were no surprises, my highlighter still got a very big workout
 He makes some pretty good observations although I'm tempted to check back in with him in a few years and see if he still thinks he had it all figured out in his 30s.
 Mark has a unique writing style and an important message. The title caught my attention and didn't disappoint. Thanks for putting pen to paper Mark.
 Mark Manson is a great author, who condenses the wisdom of others with his own insights to share, in a clear and also entertaining language, how to live better, more fulfilling lives. I recommend this book and his blog.
 This isn't a bad book, but it's really just the repackaging of ideas I've read in many other self help books before.<br/><br/>If you haven't read a lot of self help books and don't mind some locker room style humor, there are a handful of good ideas in here.  However, mark tends to ramble a lot and there are a lot of paragraphs that just do not logically connect to each other.  I blame this on bad editing.
 It was thought provoking and surprisingly well written!  I hope to read another work of his. Great book club read
 Advice to live by! We often do care too much about stuff that is unimportant or adds no value to our lives.
 Good book.
 This book helps put your life into perspective and makes you think about what's really important to you in your life.
 I like the authors message but there is a lot going on all the time. Hard to follow at times.
 This is book by far falls in my top 5. Easy to read and understand. Teaches you to be REAL! Period! The concepts in this book taught me to value more than myself and that I'm already great!
 great book
 Sorta hits a hole in the perfectionist soul.  Enjoyable read if you are the sort that constantly finds yourself being beaten up by yourself or if your trying to get a grip on someone you know with that problem.
 Hilarious read, good advice to live by.
 The author gives a vivid description of standing at the edge of a cliff at the Cape of Good Hope that is worth the reading alone.
 This is the most pragmatic approach to getting along in life. Great read, the writing style is totally congruent with the title.
 Great Product!
 Not a bad read. Has good logic, but seems scatterbrained at times.
 It changed my view on the path I was taking in life both professionally and personally. It was timely in my life and I appreciate Mark for writing it.
 Pages 74-75 are BLANK... just 2 blank pages. Page 76 picks up mid-sentance. Unbelievable!!!
 Excellent read! I recommend it for everyone.
 Should be required reading.
 Hilarious! Put into words some things I was thinking but couldn't articulate. VERY EASY READ!!!!<br/>Also has helpful insights.
 Great book. Will read it again
 A very interesting take on changing ones mind state to further themselves. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and think a lot of its principles can be applied to life.
 Nice read ... makes you think
 Loved this book! Was great informative but also realistic . A great read for everyone no matter the job. Ok
 Totally recommend this, and the book quality is like a new one.
 For real! Read it
 Choose your suffering guys<br/>It's the ongoing process of "doing" that give life meaning or happiness<br/>Thank you for giving that perspective
 Very blatant. Filled with my type of sarcasm. Not for everyone. If you are not ready to face some of your own truths, don't venture into this book. Book is easily read. Reads more like a casual conversation.
 Great work, Mark!  This book is a modern day Road Less Traveled.  Worth your time and money, and a great gift for Millennials who are trying to chart their way through life.  Keep it up!
 Thank God for the life of Mark Manson. Had he never lived I would have never read this book. My life has been changed for the better.
 I did not know but I needed to see this book. Inspiring and life changing. Incredible work. Absolutely breathe taking.
 Amazon suggested I pick this book up, based on some things in my cart.  This is how I found one of the most important books I've read as an adult.  I've dealt with anxiety the majority of my life.  In retrospect, I've more or less mastered the art of playing it safe.  As a result, I've never really experienced anything that resembles true satisfaction.  Reading this book not only brought this to my attention, but gave me info on what to do about it.  This book may rub you the wrong way, figuratively slap you in the face or any point in between.  It's a wake up call for those constantly chasing happiness, approval, and value externally.
 This really helps you clear out your negative thoughts!!
 Rambling and full of illogical arguments - Criticizes self help gurus while seemingly forgetting that it is a self help book... It might be a good book for someone, but if you have an analytical brain with a rational viewpoint of your life, you will find almost nothing useful in it.
 First few chapters were really good and hilarious. I think last few chapters were tough to get through but overall a good read
 I read this all in a day without pause. It just spoke to me in the most basic of ways despite the depth of the content. Funny, on point, non-conformist, refreshing and so much more.
 Good so far!
 Amazingly written spotlight on life in modern times, and how to recapture delight when we're surrounded by stress and suffering. A must read!
 Great book counterintuitive approach to happiness and life. Speaks the truth. Offers alternate theory of looking at life from a different psychological point of view.
 Great read with great life advice. Not your typical happy go lucky you can do this book . Would recommend.
 Very nice book I suggest everyone gives a read
 well written, with good points. Ending is a little cheesy, but makes a good visual
 Excellent read.. made me reconsider my daily worries and helped me focus on the big picture
 If you are looking for a well written self help book that puts the power and the responsibility for making your own happiness back on you...YOU FOUND IT . The title is a catchy one... And when I.gave this to my best friend, she was a bit surprised.<br/>Then she read it.. And realized she was giving a "F" about the wrong things...<br/>As with any self help book... You take what you want from it... If it helps just to get you too think about things differently... Then in my eyes... That's a win.<br/>Besides ,my.copy is on my living room table... Great conversation starter...
 I loved loved loved it! Made me really rethink the way I am living and made me gain a deeper desire for truly wanting to live, not just be alive.
 Very direct and very mind opening. He offers a different view to looking at life and how value things that matter.
 Learned a thing or two. Enjoyable bed time reading. Light but well thought out. Glad that I read it. 👍
 This book is entertaining although not deep in substance... until everything culminates with the "meaning" of not giving a fu@$. Must read!
 Definitely more than I expected! Many of us have misguided priorities and this can pave the way to a better life. Thanks Mark!
 Amazing Book!
 Do not buy this item. Everyone who reported the pages to be double printed were right.
 Good and quick read. Worth the purchase. It's not as crass as the title and has good material<br/>Inside. I've recommended it to my friends.
 Great book! Must read
 Great
 I like the perspective of the author. This is one of must read book that I’ll recommend to all of you.
 I have been following Mark's blog for years, his clarity of thought and "in your face" authentic writing in this book is refreshing.<br/><br/>It will be my most gifted book of the holiday season.<br/><br/>Well done Mark!
 I came to acknowledge the problems in my life, which I haven’t been certain of, but now i do. And now I’m ready to deal with it, thanks
 I'm much more likey to chose what to give a duck about that before I read this book. This book is raw truth
 Great book, Highly recommend
 Easily the best book of kind.
 I thought that this would be either interesting or funny, it was neither!
 A great read on getting your priorities right to enable a life fully alive. I strongly recommend the book to people of ALL ages
 Every one should read this at least once!
 A great read to boost your confidence! Helped me a lot.
 Expected a bit more form the book, reading the reviews.
 Brand new book and received it quickly, thanks
 Thid isn't the kind of book I normally read, but I enjoyed it. Well-written and a quick read. I would recommend.
 Such a good book and funny too!
 Got it a day earlier.. awesome
 This book is a great narrative of what all of us are thinking but afraid to say out loud...this book will tease all the thoughts you keep hidden away from yourself and bathe them in the light of liberation.
 Arrived quickly, very pleased
 This book offers many great insights, some of which most readers will share &amp; can relate to. Well done x
 Great read, love the material of the cover as well.
 I can't say more than that but i recommend it as a read, last seven obligatory words by Amazon kindle
 how can you not give that 5 stars?
 This book is awesome.
 A very practical way to approach life!!  I only hated that it ended way to quick, wanted more.
 Would definitely recommend.
 Half way threw and great so far
 I absolutely loved the book thank you for allowing me to see a different perspective on life. Thank you so much
 Brutally honest but SUCH a necessary read.
 This book, as its name (and just about everything else) claims, isn't pulling any punches. Mark gives it to you straight.<br/><br/>For example:<br/>- He says "f that kid" about a kid crying about the color of his hat (not in real life... I don't think)<br/>- He says that if you want to be happy and in life, your response is so common it doesn't mean anything<br/>- He calls everyone on the planet a "finely ornamented ape"<br/>- When his wife asks if she looks good and she doesn't, he tells her so<br/><br/>And I could go on and on. The whole book is like this. And it's wonderful, and eye-opening. It's like having a conversation with a friend who is honest about stuff. I love it.<br/><br/>This book is NOT for everyone. I'm not going to buy a copy for my mom's birthday (sorry, Mark). But if you're the kind of person who likes a frank, analytical look at human nature? You should have read this book yesterday.
 Great book would recommend it to everyone. Definitely a must have if you are into self help books.
 Good reading!
 Definitely would recommend. Puts life in perspective. Much better than the other self improvement books. Deserves a 5 star rating.
 Great read!
 Great book, hysterically funny!
 Absolutely the best book that I have read in awhile.  Please keep writing Mark Manson!
 Funny and too honest. Great Book!
 I don't usually leave reviews unless something was absolutely the worst or exceptional. Lucky for you, this book is the latter. This book is absolutely hilarious with its witty quips and side notes. Mark Manson is a really great story teller and he doesn't waste anytime on the fluff. I've read many a self-help book, but this is the first one that felt user friendly. If you're like me and have been trying to think so positively and be so accepting that you swear rainbows are coming out of your butt yet still find yourself unfulfilled, this book is for you! The title says it. It's time we all stop caring about which Kardashian is dyeing their hair purple and put our efforts into something more meaningful. I'm not going to tell you that you'll be a better person after reading this book, but i will tell you to be prepared for an existential crisis. I could go on and on about how much I love this book, but just trust me when I say this, it is awesome.
 Read it! Is worth it. It's real and easy to read, sometimes funny sometimes disturbing. In a glance: choice is king!
 Haven’t finished it but so far so good
 Insightful book with down-to-earth exposition and colourful examples. However I found some portions rambling. A good read for anyone seeking the meaning of it all.
 Great read! I became instantly more engaged with everything and everyone in my life. One of my favorite reads of 2017
 Mark speaks reality to the point minus all the sugar coated bullshit. This is life, crude yet beautiful in it's existence.
 kind of a cool book
 Great Read
 Can help you change your life! Seriously!
 The main purpose of this book is an attempt to analyze what are the things worth giving a f. about. Great read! Even if you would not agree with everything, the book will make you re-think many things.
 This is an amazing book that has helped me &amp; many members of my inner circle. I'd most highly recommend this book and anything els mark Manson has written. He's my new favorite author
 I love the way he writes. His experiences and life choices are pretty cool. I have recommended this book to all my friends.
 Very interesting point of view on how to view life. Great stories and examples from stories of well known famouse people
 Makes you think about the obvious at a deeper level. Definitely something I can read a few times over and still learn something new.
 Great read!
 this clicked with me more than any other BS self help book I've ever tried to read. Thanks, Mark.
 Clever title. Lots of good advice.
 Insights on priorities and values are well put. I would recommend this good, quick read to my friends and colleagues.
 Great and honest book so far. Examples used are a little far left but also good comedic relief when necessary.
 I'm only three chapters in and this book is already helping me to see through my bulls***. If you want to CHANGE your life and endure the discomfort that'll come with it, then you should probably get this book.
 Hey Mark! Keep up the great work. You really saved the best for last. Time to go have a chat with Disappointment Panda!
 This is a 5 star read for anyone looking to step outside of their comfort zone and blatantly examine their lives. It is truthful, captivating and inspiring!
 Very raw and good lessons to take from this book. Recommended for anyone who likes honest feedback and self improvement.
 It makes you look at everything differently and re evaluate what is important and what should be your focus. Read it!
 Down to earth untraditional and speaks the truth the cold hard truth. Good book to learn by.
 All things we kind of know but always ignore. Really enjoyed reading this book.
 Helped me with so much day to day.
 Friendly easy reading. Probably nothing new here but Manson says things in a refreshing way that gives a slightly different angle on some of the bigger issues in life.  A reflection on his own journey that has benefits for others too and is definitely  an inviting entree into  the world of  thought.
 Informative book, but also funny and helpful. Definitely a good read
 This book gives a different perspective.  I loved it!  The book really made me think about my own values.  Thank you!
 Devoured this book!  Manson has done the hard work of integrating core concepts of positive psych., human behavior, and Buddhism (!!) into a great book that is totally accessible to anyone...especially those who are deeply skeptical about this genre.  Language is bad, but authentic, and prevents this book from becoming some sort of preachy, hugely researched time that you will never finish.
 i liked the fun little quips this guy had to offer. eye opening book, loved it.
 An easy read but helps reevaluate your plan &amp; goals in life. I especially recommend this to the younger audience.
 I love this. It makes you think in different ways. Recommend!
 Great way of explaining and exploring ideas on how to be authentic and true to be yourself and others!! Great Job Mark
 While the title of the book seems to suggest how not to care about things, it is really about how to care about things, the things that matter.  It was an easy/quick read that drives home the message home with no BS.  The language is light and funny.  The author draws from his own life experience and from others as well.  What more to say :)
 Easy and enjoyable to read again and again. Prepare to feel refreshingly slapped across the face the whole time you're reading it.
 Easy to read, makes you think and have a lot of laughs. I really liked it.
 Deep reaching insights about life and being happy laid out in amazingly entertaining manner. I want to reread this book every three months until I internalize all its lessons.<br/>Thanks Mark
 Loved it!
 😎
 I feel like a new person after reading this. I owe it all to this book for allowing me to find myself
 One of the Top 5 books on my shelf. Everyone in the world should read this... After waiting tables for a few months.
 Also a really enjoyable read. I look forward to how he will tweak his thoughts during his next 20-30 years of life.
 I have recommended this book to everyone I know. Definitely a game changer.
 I'm going through the pain after divorce, and what a great help. I had doubts whether this book was for me, but I was wrong. Nice job.
 If there was a book that should be reread whenever you're lost in life, I believe it should be this one.
 Reality check in a book!
 He's as about automatic these days as death! Never a bad read, from his blog, to his books, Mark Manson is a always a hit. Everything you expect from this book, you'll get! Simple as that.
 This book is seriously awesome. It makes you think while also making you laugh your ass off the whole time. I would highly reccommend it!
 This book challenge simple truths about what it takes to be successful. Hope you enjoy this as much as I did!
 I didn’t like the tone of the book &amp; author tries to be funny but isn’t
 This book was truly an inspiration and a great read! I truly believe every young adult/adult should read this book! Eye opening and real!
 If you need a life-check, some inspiration, or a dose of some much needed realism- this book will definitely give you the kick in the ass you need.
 Good book. The blurb on Manson's previous book, Models, said it was the last PUA book you'll ever need, and the guy who wrote that was right. I haven't bothered with PU stuff since and haven't needed to (nor will I ever again). This book is much the same, only for self-help books. The advice boils down to: get over yourself. And all the subtle mind games we play on ourselves when we get too self-involved. A lot of the stuff Manson wrote covers ground I was already figuring out for myself, but as a recovering narcissist I have to say it's nice to have some outside confirmation. Good job, Mark.
 the Buddha's insights distilled for millennial in a very funny way. I devoured the book. I . Found the emphasis on wise value construction insightful
 I love this book. It makes me realise that I do not need to live my life to please others
 Mark Manson definitely has a way to make sense of the chaotic world that is constantly pulling out attention in all directions.
 Great read with a fresh and honest perspective on how to approach life. Especially enjoyed the chapters on facing death
 Thought provoking, great read, relatable parables and fun. Well worth the read, after I read the ebook I bought the paper back as it was that good.
 best book I have read
 This book, like any great book, changes the way you see the world and the decisions you make in it. I find that I've become happier since reading it and highly recommend to anyone
 I think the aproach of the author is life changing
 I bought this book.  I bought it because I loved the title, but it turned out to be a grest book as well !
 Very insightful. Definitely changed the way I look at life, myself, and the things around me.
 Best book I read this year!
 Fabulous and refreshing read! Has a sharp edge that will put your mind to work and possibly change your perception of how to live  a life.
 Clever and thought-provoking!  Thank you!
 Great book
 Amazing book. Wish I've found it earlier :) I have to say that I've already knew and used some of the presented concepts but still got a lead of good stuff. Beware! Requires lots of curage to implement
 hilarious
 Awesome book!
 Good read!<br/>The part about relationships was very accurate in my case. I've been married 28 years and this book made me understand why!
 Blunt, unapologetic, and most importantly, necessary.  Something for everyone in this book. The title can be off putting, but it's not what you may take off first glance. Fantastic read
 Great, easy read that I think everyone can find something in.
 Good read!!
 Ok
 Just what I was hoping for. The book's use of language is glorious to hear, and entertaining to listen to, while also being instructional and informative.
 I really liked this book. This book was the book that got me into reading more books and opening my mind to new ideas.
 I liked this book so much more than I expected to. I loved the bits and pieces of history and personal stories that kept me engaged. I was able to make notes from this book and know these reminders will serve me well in the future. Mark makes excellent points that take true thought to recognize in oneself. His writing is authentic and transparent. The title lures you in but the meat of this book contains much more depth than anticipated. Definitely a book worth reading over again.
 Some interesting ideas in this book...worth reading even if you find you don't agree with it all. This is a book I will be thinking about for a long time after finishing it.
 Great one, shatters all the life-is-all-rainbows-and- butterflies if you let it be concept. Slaps you back to reality. Highly recommended
 First chapter was good. After that I stopped reading
 Read it many times! No matter the stage in your life, no matter how busy you are or how confident you are in your path.
 Mark does a decent job of explaining why you're insecure, or your unsatisfied, or what have you. Stoic ideas, in modern text.
 A must read
 This book is great. Read this damm book if you're a person who is lost in life or tends over think everything. Really puts life in its proper perspective while also being highly funny and entertaining. 👌
 Awesome book, great seller. DEFINITELY buying for them again... Thanks!!!
 If you like books that tell you that you should start your day by looking in the mirror and telling yourself how 'super awesome' you are, this is not the book for you. This book is a cross between Zen philosopher's tale and a guy who tells you how life is, sometimes sh***y and difficult, okay mostly sh***y and difficult. I believe in our culture today this would be a great book for younger folks entering college or the workplace. Read this book with an open mind and I believe you will get a lot out of it. Enjoy!
 Love
 I need to have this type of reading in my life so I can be a better father and husband
 Great read!!!
 Excellent. I feel like a new fresh and hella better human being. Join the new mindset. Let go of your supressing ego.
 I bought it with Audible.  Really funny but also full of important and insightful concepts.  I highly recommend experiencing this work with audio for added comedic value.
 It has been very interesting and funny
 I started this and couldn't put it down.
 so far, so good
 I bought and started reading this book on the recommendation of a client that I have a lot of respect for. This title would have NEVER led me to this book. But it's really worth the read. It's not about not caring. It's about not caring about the trivial distractions in life so that you have the time and energy to focus on what really matters. I'm impressed it was written by someone so young. I couldn't have written this in my 30s. Kudos to Mark.
 Awesome Book
 Everything l needed to read right now. Nothing l didn't already know in my heart. Amazing wisdom from a young man.
 Great book!! It's funny and very informative
 Very soul soothing :-)
 Love it!
 This book is a must read. Especially if you're young and have a lot of years to live. It brings forth questions that people don't even bother thinking of.
 I loved it. So gripping and relatable for any in need for a reality check. Made me think of the important things in life.
 Great to read an unabashed counterpoint. This book gets you to thinking about the conditions that you place on yourself.
 A great weekend reading, and make me think about whether those values which one hold dearly really matter or not.
 Good seller, fast shipping, product as described!!!  Thanks
 I purchased this book because the title made it sound like something I would write. I was correct. A friend of mine read a couple of paragraphs and laughed out loud at the similarities between my voice and that of Mark Manson. So I guess it's no surprise that I can get behind pretty much everything in here with only one or two small exceptions. Sure, you might not like the language, but if you can get over yourself long enough to just read the first couple of chapters, you may find yourself pleasantly surprised by this logical approach.
 This was an enjoyable read with interesting anecdotes. Some real perspective-altering points discussed.
 I read a lot of personal development books and this one resonates the most. I read it in one sitting because I couldn't put it down. Mark you're the man. Just what I needed.
 The last few pages were what really lit a fire under my ass. Loved every second of it though. Yay!
 Awesome read! Makes you really appreciate what really matters in life.
 Simply a pleasure to read, especially for people who are fans of psychology and stoicism.<br/>Having recently read Ryan Holiday's The Obstacle is the way, which I loved, this a funnier and more interesting take on life.
 This writer needs to be grown up more, but this book is great
 Amazing book, would highly recommend to anyone!
 Best book ever
 This book explains the whole problem. Simple. Straightforward. Funny. Truth-bombs nearly every paragraph. Should be required reading for high-school and college.
 Good read
 Amazing, fun. Quick read with great analogies and stories.
 Great Book!
 My favorite author presently.  Self taught guy.  Entertaining and insightful.  Quite a large following.
 One of the best Books that I’ve ever read !!
 Life changer
 pages 2,3,6,and 7 are not printed lol... great
 Great book!
 Felt like I had discovered some of these insights deep down, but was finally seeing them on paper. Highly recommend.
 I love reading this book!
 amazing read. I looooove this book. Waiting for my hard copy in the mail so I can read again and highlight pages and share this book with friends.
 Great book
 Insightful, fresh insights into what to care about and how. And how to stop wasting time and energy on insignificant matters.
 One of the best reads of my life. A must buy!
 Made for real people. Good book.
 gifts everything good
 Believe me this s*** speaks the truth in every word.  I felt sad that i read the book so fast every page motivated me to the point i couldnt care if the book had a 1000 pages
 Ordered for a gift. No issues. They loved it
 This book was a breakthrough for me because  I have been worrying about what people thought about me for the longest and this book made me realize what is really important<br/>Thank you Mark..
 Great reminder on setting priorities and focusing on the big stuff.
 fun book
 No review, the book worked.
 Every American should get one with their tax return!
 Nice product. It shows you a lot of stuff.
 Brilliant. This really gets to the essence of what is important in order to live a more fulfilling life.<br/>.
 This is a Fantastic book beyond the crude title and raw language there is a lot of valuable information ...it gives you a reality check and helps rethink life in a more realistic view ... which in turn eases the pressure in life and you can better tackle what is really important- I have already put a lot of what I have read into practice and am able to think more clearly
 Bought this as a Father's Day gift and my husband loves it!
 Revieved Book in the Mail in Excellent Condition.
 Better than years of therapy. Fantastic read.
 For all the people that live scared, and in doubt, stop thinking in trivial things, helps to get up and<br/>Iive
 I listed to this book. It was  entertaining and motivating.
 I used to have serious social anxiety problems. Like panic attacks and all that. I had been sort of developing this way of thinking over time as I dealt with my underlying issues, but this book puts what I was thinking into words in a way I never did. It gets a bit long winded and I honestly haven't finished it yet, but I really identify with the author's view and it was helpful to hear this thing I had just been vaguely feeling put into words. I highly recommend it.
 Written in a light but very thought provoking manner, don’t be misguided by F word usage in the title and throughout the book.
 Fantastic book! Big fan.
 Life Changing
 Loved the realness.  Relatable. Thanks for sharing your story. I will be recommending this book to my friends. Peace and blessings all.
 Great book for young adults or young in spirit, easy to read, good stories that are relevant to the points the author is trying to make
 Great book!!!
 Amazing! Must read for everyone!
 I truly enjoyed this book. It's helped me de-stress and has shortened my list of "worries." I've already recommended it to friends.
 Sounds hilarious but was seriously inspiring/motivating
 Fabulous thoughts. What we mostly think but don't articulate.
 Interesting perspective
 This guy is an armchair psychologist and way too much of a bro. Save some time, just read the title and do that, don't give a....about this book.
 Great pointe of view and encouraging. It really helps put things into perspective. I would recommend it for sure. THx
 Funny, witty, striking, empowering, and above all moving. What a talented craftsmen! I've recommended it to anyone who has listened to me rave about this book!
 Very enlighting! I would read more than once has many interesting points and perspectives. Very good read. I will recommend
 I like how it made me think if I was pushing myself too much for no reason in areas in my life that are not the most important for me.
 Mark Manson, you have created another excellent piece of writing, I hope you continue to express your ponderings and thoughts on life. Thanks a lot.
 I love this book; very funny, witty and intelligent.  Well written and spot on.
 A great read with some productive ideas on how to cut the day to day crap from our lives and care about what really matters.
 Totally love the book really down to earth
 This will be a gift
 Pretty decent read. I read over winter break it was a good motivator.
 Best book I read in my life. No exageration.
 One of the worst books!
 Great book! Highly recommended it
 Best book I've read I  a. long time!!!
 Liked the initial idea and the mini stories in it. A nice read if you're curious about yourself at the moment.
 If I had the choice, I'd give this four and a half stars.  Very worthwhile ideas that are very worth reading.  But the author does primarily if not exclusively use men as examples, and, perhaps once, he, denigrated a woman to make his point, referring to her as some old lady who will probably die in a diaper. Well, as a woman who isn't young, I found this someone offputting, not to mention, that many of us may die in diapers --  but this may be a digression. Overall, I loved this book.
 Good
 THE ABSOLUTE BEST book on outlook, awareness and "self-h*lp" I've read, maybe ever.
 This book was absolutely amazing! It really opened my eyes and inspired me to live my best life possible so that I can die in peace!
 Great book written with some humour to help get mental peace.
 Interesting perspective on how each person has to make their own decisions on what to care about (or give a F as the author says). Not the deepest work, has some reasonable real life examples from the author; overall is a shallow dive into self awareness and prioritizing your life. I would recommend reading but it's not a top 10 in my opinion.
 There are better ones
 A great read: crystalises a lot of common sense thinking around what to focus on &amp; how.
 This is a must read, I'm a 24 year old male and it has only reaffirmed how I feel about my values and how to move through a complicated life.
 Great book. Funny but to the point.
 Awesome book. Great purchase! The voice of the narrator is really a bore but if you stay focused, the book is well worth the read or listen!
 Loved the way this was written.
 Easy to read and insightful book. It is not kind of bible book, citing similar things from Steven Cohen books but overall it is ok.
 Amazing book for someone who needs to hear the message the author is sending. Life altering perception changing reading experience.
 This Book is GREAT.
 This book is totally awesome and you should give a f*** about reading it. It is worth recomandation to everyone :)
 Great writing style and some fabulous ideas about life, values, character and more. I learned a lot and will keep this book in mind for a long while.
 Amazing book. Grabs you attention for sure.
 Good
 So simple yet so spot on.
 I don't often read these types of books, but I heard about mark manson on the tropical MBA podcast and really enjoyed what he had to say, so I checked out his blog, and eventually bought the book.
 A no bulls*** approach to setting your priorities in life. NOT SO SUBTLE!
 Great.
 Good Product fast shipping
 Very blunt and in your face at the beginning. Practical towards the end. Just the way I like it. I recommend this book.
 Absolutely love this book! Recommended to all!
 I collect self-help books. I'm kind of a self-help junkie. Over the years I found myself increasingly resentful of the way self-help authors focus on positivity and self-transformation. They skip right over the fact that sometimes, in fact maybe even most of the time, life is pretty crappy.<br/><br/>Manson takes this aspect of human life head on. I can't speak to how accurately he's pinned down human psychology, but many of the things he wrote in this book resonated with me. He's also very funny.
 Best book I've read in a long time.
 This book is not meant for everyone, yet it can be enlightening to many and life changing to some. Fin
 I never received my ties and want to cancel the order. If it does arrive eventually what do you recommend I do?
 It's just OK.
 Great book; totally on-point and advice cuts through all the BS out there.
 Excellent book and it was easy to read. There were a lot of great points and I'll probably recommend it to a few of my friends.
 I downloaded this book after reading several articles on Mark's site. Some of the material is repeated between the two, but the flow of the book is a whole separate experience from the website. I'm trudging through the worst experience of my life and this book really offers incite, comfort, and perspective through all the darkness. I appreciate the wisdom, but especially the presentation and phrasing of the concepts. This is for the thinking person, for the philosophical poet, but not hippie woo-woo or psycho-babble.  Plus, Mark writes with the foulness that I speak, so his ideas really sink into my brain. Great book - especially when life effs with you.
 Puts a lot of things in perspective.  Makes you think in a different way .  Enjoyable read. Highly recommend this book.
 Some parts are a bit ridiculous but the points made are very helpful to someone looking for purpose and meaning. Inspirational and a quick read.
 Just give it a shot. You have nothing to lose. He explains in a dark way how to find yourself and really gain insight
 Excellent read. Tremendous insight. Totally worth it.
 Should be mandatory reading in every college.
 One of my favourite books of all time. If you're reading this then buy the book.
 Fantastic read!!!
 Ai think the world would a simpler place if everyone read this book. Great writing style and not over the top .
 Mr. Manson showed us the inherent strength that lies within us all, achieved simply by choosing how we wish to suffer.
 Great book
 This book was great and straight to the point. Loved it.
 Same concept as “Men From Mars/Women From Hell”.  Good old common sense........
 Great book- everybody needs to read this.
 Every word well written
 Brilliant! Thanks! Loved it. It explains complicated ideas in a simple way and it teaches a lifestyle  based on reality!  Worth every dollar.
 hilarious, down to earth, right to the point book. Great read!
 Totally made me rethink my priorities. I recently had a near death experience and thus was so helpful in gaining insight into how to move forward
 Great read
 Great title. Better book. A lot of important insights. Learnt a lot from this. Recommended it to a few friends as well.
 Loved it!!
 Who does. No one cares. So why not.
 Great book! Arrived on time.
 This book is definitely a must read, Mark Manson is a man with a brilliant mind and an interesting way of thinking.
 Great book for this time in my life.
 Thank you! Just what I needed! I would recommend this book to become curriculum in middle school! N.F.G have a wonderful and full filling life!
 Just got this yesterday. Halfway through but holy crap....I love this book. I'm already planning on reading it again before sending off to my super duper, ball of fire, determined daughter.  I make a point not to give unsolicited advice. We'll let Mark do that for me :)<br/><br/>I detest self-help books. This isn't that. If you're open to it, it gives you a road map to what you may need to work on internally. Taking notes. Big time. As an INFJ and don't feel quite so...awkward. This is so funny, smart and great writing. I really appreciate the great editing. Haven't been annoyed yet!<br/><br/>Congratulations. Great book. Great Blog.  Looking forward to more!
 Great read and helpful. Funny too! I wish there were more books like this. Words words words words words words
 I enjoyed this book, but for some reason I expected something more.  (Not the author's fault I had higher expectations.)  I think there is some solid advice in here.  I appreciate his style of writing.  I think it's both entertaining and perhaps a way people mired in the real world can gain access to some fairly spiritual (and dare I say Taoist) concepts.  It's amazing Mark Manson produced something like this at a fairly young age.  I look forward to how he grows and matures and what he shares along the road.  I may even start reading his blog.
 Great philosophy, but the author curses too much.
 This is a must read.  Gives valuable perspective.
 Best book I ever read. It is fun but you also take from the book good advices.
 A fresh look at old principles. I laughed and learned from this honest look at human behavior. A very worthy read.
 Loved the book!! Best read for the start of my year
 Must read for all. Everyone will relate to this book in some way
 Very entertaining as well as full of useful ideas about looking at life and its experiences differently.
 One of my favorite books
 This is a must read. It definitely changed the way I think about things.
 Practical advice, timely, funny.
 I like it a lot, but for me the teachings in this book is a little bit all over the place. I feel a lot of contradictions, and not focused ideas. But it's really fun to read.
 Awesome book
 This book will make you question what is most important in your life which we all need to spend time doing.
 Inspirational and eye opening. Indulge in every part of this book. I will say the last chapter was the best!
 Love love love this book!
 So many bookmarks and so much food for thought. A great read.
 sdfs
 Great read and sample! Can't wait to read the rest!!! I will recommend this book to everyone I know definitely!
 Straight the point !
 Awesome read...life changing
 Absolutely loved this book.  The title kind of turned me off at first and so did the F word when said inside but it eventually died out in future chapters, thank goodness.  I highly recommend this book.  I'm on my third read.
 Reading this book makes you see life in a very simple and different way. Period. This is the kind of book you would read randomly every now and then.
 IMO a decent book on how to live you best and happiest life and minimize the self imposed anxieties and stress.....
 Blank pages for chapter 8 and 9
 I recommend this book to everyone,even if you don't take everything out of this book and apply it to your life im sure you will use some of it.
 Excellent advise. Probably the last self-help book I'll ever read.
 Not a great book about how to go about self improvement. The chapter about why russians are better than americans at figuring out who to trust and who not is kind of a masterpiece in generalization and attempts at interpreting history. Basically russians are more trustworthy because they are not caught up in trying to be nice to please like americans. Why? Because they have had to distrust for so many years with KGB coopting their families and neighbors into ratting on them... I don't know if I buy this. Well. It was good reading. Just not really self improvement. I think Mark Manson should have titled this: How I grew up from college party boy/playboy to serious man with a dose of common sense in me.
 Really well written, insightful, I always read this when I needed a bit of levity and wisdom in my day.
 This is a extraordinary read!
 This book brings me to a state of self realization that I've never been before. I will read it over again and again.
 Great great book!! The title says it all about what the book is about. Nothing subtle, and that is what I loved about it.
 If you enjoy his blog and sense is humor you will love this book.  Surprisingly personal, Mark helps you to identify why some relationships aren't working and how to appreciate what you have, and help you to discover where you want to go.  This is not a help book full of exercises but instead of fascinating stories and philosophies.  The only person that can solve your problems is you.  This book will help you figure out which problems are worth solving.
 I've reached a new level awareness after reading this book! I absolutely loved it and it's one of those books I will be reading again.
 Really makes you think about life and put things into perspective! Love this book and will recommend it to family
 The book is a riot. I'm loving it so far. Warning: it's as real as real can get. Not for the faint of heart or realism.
 Quick book with one or two things to easily think about and apply to your life. I highly recommend it.
 Great book
 The best and teach us see life in simple perception<br/>To be better in many ways possible<br/>Very good to read to enchanted our souls
 I had never been into the e-book thing but my brother nudged me to try it.  I have a short attention span, especially on my long commute to work and back but this book kept me totally engaged. Besides the fact that the info is amazing and totally applicable to life, the narrator is by far the best.  I have tried a few e books since and the narrators suck so bad I can't even listen to it, I wish this guy did all books.  I haven't really ever read/listened to a book where everything he said I was like, "OMG yes! I can totally relate to this! This is me!" I have since listened to the whole book two more times.  Loved it.
 Read this book and take notes!
 Excellent read as long as you don't mind lots of F Bombs
 A good read,  gives good life tips and /or reminders with a sprinkle of good  humor.<br/>I would recommend it.
 Amazing Book! Would definitely recommend this to everyone!
 Great book
 The first 40 pages were excellent...
 I found the book a humorous take on modern review of stoicism. Simple statements that are easy to digest and action. Valuable learning tool.
 worth reading
 The most amazing read.  I have reread it twice so I could go back and highlight and make notes in the book
 It explains all I believe in and sometimes forget. It could do with less swearing in the initial chapters. A good buy.
 This is on my list of life changing books. Up there with "Daring Greatly" by Brené Brown. I plan on reading Mark's book 3 more times, so his messages/points really sink in.
 Amazing book. This  book grounds you an places thing in to perspective. Especially for those who occupy themselves with self help books
 I liked the beginning of the book - it was fresh and unorthodox. But then it kind of deteriorated into generic life advice and got boring.
 Gives you pause to think about the times we live in and why we do what we do.  Buy it!
 the book is on point !
 Good
 Had to turn my cover white side out so no one would see the title.  Would hate to explain why I'm reading this at 75, but agree with almost everything he says.
 I have very mixed feelings about this book. While I found a few interesting points, I found most of the book boring and repetitive. I had no issue with the profanity-laced text, but I found the book to be negative and a bit distressful.<br/><br/>I purchased the Audible version. I would listen in the car on the way to meetings and found myself feeling awful about society and the world after listening. I also found the tone of the narrator to be really annoying as well.<br/><br/>I purchased this book because it was listed as number 1 in the same category as <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Everything-I-Never-Learned-in-School-A-Guide-to-Success/dp/1545467366/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Everything I Never Learned in School: A Guide to Success</a> which I had just finished reading. I think I'll go back to the list and find another book!
 Nice Book
 Highly recommended reading. So many ah-hah, straight-talking, funny &amp; serious parts. I couldn't put it down. Absolutely loved the book!
 Great book shipped fast! Brand new! I am very pleased!
 Very insightful ideas. May not be so easy to implement, but good things don't come easily.
 Immature and superficial
 One of the best books I have ever read
 nothing like this book
 Awesome!
 Looking forward to reading it again. I will refer to this book often, hopefully for the rest of my life. Many thanks to the author for his efforts. A success.
 Was a little disappointed that ma ost of it was articles you already wrote instead of new content. But it was still well put together and a great read.
 Anyone stressed about life should read this
 Excellent Product.
 I wish I read this book sooner so that I could have returned it! Reading about his rude description of a "grandma who clips coupons" and JLo's body was offensive. If you are a woman or any person of color don't bother reading this entitled man's unchecked version of life.
 Cover of book arrived damaged
 Easy and fun to read.
 Great value
 I need to read this book at least 2 more times, very entertaining and straight to the point. All good reminders.
 best book ive read in awhile. highly recommend
 Manson's deep thinking and humor is a benefit to all.  I walk away from the book with new perspective that will stick with me forever, thank you Mark!
 The novel began funny but quickly became enlightening, significant and eye opening. It really helped me to look at things differently to prioritize my values.
 Highly recommended!
 I love Mark's writing and I really enjoyed this book. This is a fresh take on the self-help genre and Mark offers a perspective all his own. Highly recommend.
 Definitely insightful and deep.  I recommend that everyone read this book. You'll gain a lot from it
 Such a great, down-to-earth account of ones own value system.  This is most helpful, non-self help book I've read.  A must read for anyone and everyone.
 I could not put this book down. I will surely read it again and again.  A true reality check.  This book would make a great gift for anyone.
 Good read. Lots of good pointers.
 Life changing must read. Do it. Do it now. Get out of your mind and into your life. Just read it.
 Loving it thus far!
 A book everyone needs to read!
 A very interesting way to look at things.
 It's funny and witty! It will open you to a lot of realizations. Share it with your loved ones too :)
 I'm extremely happy with this book! I love the real-life advice. If you are easily offended by the profanity then maybe this isn't the book for you. I found it funny and refreshing. Vulgarity amuses me. It's not even that vulgar but if you are easily offended. Stay away. This is the opposite but not really of most self help books. I say not really because they all say deal with your problems. This one is different because it's not all rainbows and fairy dust. You know be positive and your life will change! This book says when life throws you lemons, just deal with the lemons. You can't always make lemonade. I like that. It feels authentic.
 A wonderful book about learning about what matters in your life and not letting other issues make you miserable. It is hard and makes no apologies and neither should you about the meaningful choices you make.
 The book really makes you question yourself and think outside of the box about yourself and others, really enjoyed reading it.
 Wise and entertaining.
 I loved this book. Mr. Manson is very insightful, smart and funny. I really understood his ideas. I will read this book again and again.
 Loving this book!
 Great book.
 Exceptional book.
 This book is great and helps to see life in other perspectives. For sure recommending this to anyone who will listen.
 I love reading Mark's articles and this book was even better.  It's a quick read with good insights on focusing on the important values in life.  We are what we value so if we are unhappy, chances are we are not valuing good things.  It's not a book about caring less, it's more a book about caring less about stupid things that really don't matter in the long run.  It made me think and I enjoyed reading it.  A friend of mine who is a therapist thought it was amazing and also found it insightful.  I highly recommend.
 Enjoyed the audio version.  Good life tips that people should take to heart.
 I enjoyed some of the concepts and it was fun to read. Definitely recommend as it also puts things in perspective
 amazing book!
 Such an awesome book.
 Very well written with pointers on the money.
 Waste of your time. The title says it all, best advice your going to find from the entire work since the contents leave much to be desired. Save some money-<br/>"Be yourself &amp; don't care what others think, it's not worth it in the longrun." Cheers.
 Don’t mind the flood of F-bombs in the first two chapters...I almost quit after starting it, but it gets more reasonable. Very conversational voice and easy to read quickly. I reccomend this book for ANYONE searching for more meaning in their life at any level. I wouldn’t reccomend it for anyone suffering from severe depression, as this book does not sugar coat any realities and can be discouraging at times to digest.
 Superb and insightful.
 Worth reading twice!
 Once I endured the onslought of profanity, probably a way for Mark to enhance the ending, I was immersed in the shift of my own reality. Breaking into the subconcious layers of my mind's defenses, the new ideas of Mark's thoughts made a lot of sense. After a lot of stopping to digest the foundation of his theories, the new picture emerged and made sense.<br/><br/>This is the type of book that will take several readings to fully grasp all tne nuances he lays out as well as sorting out my reactions and self realizations which I hope to relegate into my daily life.<br/><br/>Thank you Mark for your contribution to the world.
 Great book!!!
 WHEW that was tough to get through!<br/>I agree with the author's concepts (which are not his own).  So that's why he gets 2 stars.  The missing stars are due to his inability to form a well written sentences, his glib oversimplification  of the human condition, his blanket statements about "what is," and how he's constantly referencing how many woman he's slept with.<br/>I could write a super long review citing all of the things that were so horrific about this book, but then that would be me wasting MORE time on sweet Mark.<br/>There are so many amazing books out there that teach you the same concepts but do it so much better.  Go find one of those. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.
 Straight up,  It's a great book.
 There is a good reason why this book is a New York Times Bestseller and the supportive quotes on the back sleeve hit the mark. We learn quickly that this book's title does not lead to a text that gives permission for sociopathic behavior; indeed, quite the opposite. This is a book that points to a way for taking full responsibility for your life and your mortality, explaining in highly energized and enjoyable writing how this is possible and why this makes for a life well-lived. One of the very best, in my view, of the current wave of "grit" and "daily tasks to greatness" books.
 I really love this book! I'm reading it for the second time.
 This is not your typical self-help book! No fairy dust here but not top-heavy on cynicism either.
 What a fantastic book. An excellent balance of humor, practicality, and enlightenment. It has changed my perspective a while lot the past month and a half and helped me feel less anxious about tomorrow and appreciative of life instead of always being focused on the unimportant details. I've always felt like the next step forward was rather hazy, and this book. If you want a sincere, brash, hilarious novel that can alter your perspective, this is the book for you.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Humorous<br/>Engaging<br/>Very thoughtful advice and explanations<br/>Challenging of the world in a healthy way<br/>Clear and concise<br/>Not full of new age acceptance and fake optimism exercises<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>There is no action plan here. It's as if you've been given a map that you must follow the route on. (Although Mark warns this book won't hold your hand). I appreciate it, though some may desire physical steps laid out
 Best book Ive ever picked up.
 I need my four hours of my life back. Waste of time
 Good read
 Enjoyed the book
 The book is beat up...
 love this
 An interesting way of looking at our world, what is held important in society, and what is truly important in life.
 Excellent read.
 This is my F%#king bible.
 First chapter is a bit rough given the amount of expletives...but it's a great book!
 One of my favorite authors of all time. Damn this dude has perspective. Easy to read, harder to accept ;)
 Woke from reading this book. Great purchase
 Great book!
 Buy this book NOW! Then... READ IT!
 As one of the many subscribers to Mark's blog, I think this book was definitely a good read. He does a good job explaining truths about life that aren't immediately obvious, as well as giving you realistic examples and stories. My favorite thing about his writing is his ability to give incredibly insightful advice in a down to earth, understandable way that sounds like a real person. My only gripe is that as a longtime reader, I recognized a lot of bits and pieces in the book were taken word for word off of certain blog posts. But ignoring that, they made sense in context, and it's all still great quality. If you've never read Mark Mason's work, there's no reason not to pick this up (unless you hate swear words THAT much), and even if you have this is still a great guidebook that's thought provoking all the way through.
 Thought-provoking and a fast read.
 Absolutely amazing, I couldn't put it down.
 great read
 Great book, better than I expected.
 This book hit all of the things holding me back.  Time to get to work and live.  Thank you Mark
 This book gives the reader perspective. More so than any self help book will ever do.
 Starts out great. You really think you're going to learn a lot. Fizzles out midway through book and the end is just meh.
 This book started out like a profane, humorous stand-up comedy act, but turned into a beautiful and timely essay on how to just live a better life.
 Great read!!
 This book really made me think, which is good, since it's an explorative book
 If you ever get beyond the curse words, this book has something to offer. I enjoyed reading it and it helped shape my perception of relationships.
 Would be even better if it was read by Samuel Jackson!
 amazing book!!
 I hate most self help books but this one is worth the read. It's straight forward and easy to digest.
 love this book!
 This was a needed message.
 This was an honest read which addresses those things that hold us back
 Good book. A little hard to stay interested but glad I made it to the end. Sometimes it felt like it jumped all over but I liked the underlying message.
 A great down to earth way of looking at how to live with a clearer mind.
 Great easy read to show and discuss that everything doesn't need the attention we give.  Highly recommended and straight forward.
 Incredibly funny and very much relatable.
 One of the best books I've picked up in a long time!
 The other one star reviews have detailed the issues of lack of citation and naive, pretentious content. The writing is so bad, yet it’s a best seller? The author states in chapter one that the book is about “laughing at your tears as you cry them”. Good grief.  At least I’m only out the price of a meal at a local taco shop, having bought it on Amazon instead of paying the full jacket price. But maybe the lesson here is to not buy books on Amazon unless I’ve leafed through them at a brick and mortar store first.  I actually think I’ll toss in the dumpster rather than donate it to the Goodwill because I don’t want to be complicit in its distribution. What a waste of our natural resources.
 Is all about changing perspectives!! A whole new look to your life and what do you want to do with it!! Amazing!!
 I recommended my friend &amp; family to read it.
 Goot mbook
 Best book I have read this year.
 Absolutely love it. I wish there was a list of values I could create while reading - but this book is a necessary read for millenials.
 Not for people over the age of 30....I'm a pretty cool 44 year old. I actually do stand up, so I get the joke. However, I couldn't get through the first couple pages. This book is too cool for school. Or I'm too old...The message is good, the delivery is just too hipster for me.
 the best book I've read in a while.
 Fantastic read, anyone looking for genuine advice rather than a quick fix to all of their solutions should read asap.
 This is not a book about adquiring the attitude of not caring about anything, as I thought it would be. But about cleansing &amp; ridding yourself from bad conditionings. Gaining the wisdom of reprioritizing your life to start valuing what's really important in it. This book hits a nerve on the way we live our lives, how we have let society guide us to seek happiness outside of ourselves, always astriving to have more, to be more, and never actually enjoying life<br/><br/>I'm reading the book exactly when I needed it and I haven't even finished it yet.<br/><br/>Thanks, Mark Manson.
 I absolutely loved this book. His writing style was poignant and humorous to read. While many "self help" books spew all this BS about the pursuit of happiness blah, blah, Mark gives it straight up and in your face. If you are looking for a different approach to your view of life, relationships, career, hobbies, etc and how to make them more impactful, I encourage you to read this. It'll change your world. You'll feel more alive. He does say the F word ALOT in this book but it didn't bother me at all.  Some people have said it deters from the message, but I disagree, I think it spices it up.  It's brutal honesty.
 Great read; makes you question your priorities.
 This book is one that will help open your eyes to figuring out what matters most in your life.  Too often we squander the few years we are given on accepting mediocrity, dead-end jobs that take over our lives, and a life that it's not the kind of life we would choose.  For me, this book has placed me on a course to decide what matters most to me, and to reclaim my life.  Highly recommended.
 this is unacceptable!!
 On point for so many things...very refreshing read
 Great, easy &amp; fun read
 Great read!
 Hilarious and thought provoking. Highly recommend
 Loved it!
 Interesting
 loved it, was easy to read and gave a lot of to think about.
 Don't let the title fool you, this book is filled with wisdom. I love a book that helps me see things differently and this one does.<br/><br/>If foul language bothers you, then you probably won't like it.<br/><br/>But if you feel like you want to change some things in your life and are open to hearing a fresh perspective this book is for you.<br/><br/>I love how he speaks the truth without sugar-coating it. Wonderful, wonderful book.
 This book has a very no-nonsense, talking-to-a-bartender voice, but in the end the advice is great.
 Great book!
 Fantastic...absolutely recommend
 Good read. Very easy to understand yet too much to take in at once. I will this every 5 years for the rest of my life.
 Modern day stoicism at its best. Every driven person should read this. If you're not too squeamish about language, I'd even give it to kids 12 and up, especially if they are struggling with pressures in school or athletics. I'm 32 now, an international-level rugby player and amateur MMA fighter and wish I had read this 20 years ago. It's my most gifted book and I recommend it to all of my friends and family who aren't prudes and the f-bombs. From here you can go on to read Seneca and Marcus Aurelius with better understanding.
 Not a very mature perspective. The author comes across as negative and jaded and just not really a high level person.
 Great biok
 Silly to read any other book than this, completely life changing and absolutely AMAZING!
 This book is absolutely wonderful! I should state, however, that the book is wonderful only if you are willing to take the honest look at yourself that it discusses. If you're going to argue with the insight and common sense approaches, then read something specifically written to stroke your fragile ego, because this book asks you to be real and honest and face possibly uncomfortable truths. Truly a great read!
 Perfect vacation reading.  Highly recommend to anyone looking to value your life.
 Great read!
 Great reading material! It comes off as harsh but everything expressed is enough to think about your direction in life for the better.
 great book!
 This was my first book of 2017. It took a chapter or two to get used to his writing style but the stories and parallels are very clearly presented and the whole message of the book accessible. I found myself referring to it during conversations while I was reading it. I may even read again because it's the type of book that taps into your daily internal dialog and reminds you of what is essential productive thinking and what you really need to let go of; these things are constantly changing, aren't they? It's a great reset button for someone who is on the path to change.
 Mark Manson's book should be required reading for anyone beyond the 12th grade. He's awesome and really wants people to have better lives.
 A fresh take on practical wisdom.  This book captivates its audience with truth and before you know it your begging for more.
 One of the best books I read in a while.
 I enjoyed the book but I feel that it was a bit lightweight. Some interesting points and fair writing style, though the structure and general red thread leaves a bit to be desired in opinion.
 Great fxcking book!
 Really liked this book. So many good nuggets to take away from this book. I will definitely be rereading this.
 If you're a big fan of self help, this book should be the only one you should read and use as a guideline to improve yourself!
 Very well done. Love the insight.
 Excellent and relevant advice for anyone wanting a better perspective on what really matters or should matter in our lives .
 I need to write this review becAuse the kindle won't let me continue until I do. Loved the book lots!
 It was a bad ass book. I would recommend this to anyone who would listen. I'm gonna come back to this book often
 Excellent  ook
 I started out with the audio book, and honestly I had just downloaded it because I thought it would be something interesting to listen to during a long car ride.  We didn't listen to it on the trip, but shortly thereafter I was getting treatment for depression and anxiety again.  Listening to this book was one of the things that helped me the most with my anxiety, to the point that I wanted the hard copy so I could read specific parts when I needed to, or make notes about something without having to listen to a whole section again.  There is a certain relief in the straight forward way that Mark Manson points out the flaws in the self esteem movement, and the lessons that suffering is not a negative experience, but the values you choose make the experiences easier or more difficult on yourself.  When my anxiety would get so high that I couldn't focus on anything else I would just start chapter one and listen to his description of the feedback loop from h*ll which would help me work my wait out of it. When I would start to feel hopeless or frustrated or angry or whatever emotion I was dealing with seemed to have a corresponding chapter with it that would help me refocus what I was experiencing, and eventually rethink everything.  I have never been one to read self help books but have always been interested in the human psyche and this book was so insightful to myself as well as the people around me that it didn't really seem like a self help book. "The solution lies in the acceptance and active engagement of that negative experience, not the avoidance of it, not the salvation of it."
 best.book.ever.
 Such a honest, blunt, and entertaining self-help book!
 Well constructed, very interesting perspective on life. A great read.
 Great read. Changed my life.
 Awesome book
 Spectacular, funny, and useful.
 A very refreshing point of view.  I liked the way the author explain the idea in every day language.
 This is an excellent book. Cleverly written and very honest. I am recommending it to all my friends!
 One of the best books to read for self guidance.
 Awesome book. Super insightful, and very humorous.
 Good book!
 I really don't think I can properly express how much I enjoyed this book. If you are not easily offended and open to analyzing yourself, this book is for you. So much more is covered than lack of f's given. It's more about choosing the right f's to give.<br/>I say thank you because a lot of work went into this book and I've learned so much from it. I've gushed about several topics to my friends and hope they read the book, too. Rather than being a how-to, this book can change the way you think about yourself if you let it. I'll be reading it again!
 If I was a God, this would be the bible I would want my followers to read.
 Cheers.  Great read (be ready to put your ego in check and be pleasantly offended)
 Great book, great read! A must!
 Great book worth the investment time and money wise!
 Mark puts together a bunch of truths and disspells urban legends to paint a picture of life not as we know it.
 Interesting facts that we might already know put together in a beautiful context!<br/>I think I might give it another read
 At age 20 I would have said this book was a great read but too negative or sarcastic in theory. Today at 66 I have found a great read that is so true to life it is scary. Better than any professor in Psychiatry could communicate, this book explains the way it is with humanity and the world.<br/>Sensitive or naive world perspectives have to opportunity  to see the wisdom in his words. What a talented author, even though I hate expletives in movies, I believe his use of F**## was easy to overlook to get to his brilliant points made all throughout.
 I loved this book. Without being too crass, it's very humorous and tongue in cheek. The swearing isn't too excessive (for me, at least). And it's so inspiring. I loved the emphasis on acceptance, learning that the negative in life is actually a good thing you can learn and grow from. It's easy to read because it's not one of those aggressively positive self help books. It's the first book of this type that I feel I actually agree with everything in it. And I appreciate the author's honesty - He has messed up, he's had a rough life, but he's made the most of it. I love this book and will recommend it to everyone I'm close with. A+
 The author was trying far too hard. His writing style is juvenile and most of what he says is obvious to anyone who is even a tiny bit self aware. The book could have been half the size if the author cut out the bits where he attempted, and failed, to be funny.
 I think everyone should read this book, especially those in their 20's it really makes you think and make mental changes for the better
 This is a must read. Highly recommend this one to anyone.
 Good reading, few but important concepts.
 The best book ever written.
 We have this bright orange book with an F-bomb in the title that kind of grabs your attention doesn't it? It seemed a bit "gimmicky" to me and perhaps that preconceived notion prevented me from truly enjoying this book. They say, "don't judge a book by its cover" and perhaps I'm guilty of pre-judging with this book.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what it was, but I felt like I was reading "Don't Sweat the Small Stuff" on steroids with a lot more cursing and from a less mature and less polished author.<br/><br/>I felt that much of the material was common-sense thinking that we've heard plenty of times before like not sweating the small stuff, pick your battles, etc. These are the things we learn as we mature, grow, and find as we battle through the adversity that life throws at us.<br/><br/>Now, I don't want to just bash here because I always find value in every book I read so I'll point to the interesting story of Dave Mustaine, the founder of Megadeth, who was kicked out of Metallica before they became a powerhouse rock band. This was a great anecdotal story about not comparing yourself to others.<br/><br/>The single best piece of value is something that continues to come up in my reading and that's about taking action. Just DO SOMETHING! Take Action! Mark points out that taking action creates an endless loop that looks like this;<br/><br/>Inspiration -&gt; Motivation -&gt; Action -&gt; Inspiration -&gt; Motivation -&gt; Action -&gt; and on and on.<br/><br/>I couldn't agree more here with our author. So many people are paralyzed with trying to perfect something and we just need to take "Imperfect Action" to get that forward momentum or inertia working in our favor.<br/><br/>This book was published in September of 2016 and it has some raving fans who felt a lot different about the book's content and value. It has a 4.6 rating on Amazon with 1,214 reviews and Goodreads gives it 4.03 stars with 30,489 ratings and 2,248 reviews. So, maybe it's just me? Maybe I was having a bad day? I'm going with 3 stars, and that's generous. Pick it up and give it a read and tell me if I'm full of crap!
 Author is clearly deeper than what he seems,  especially the part of death being the light to provide the shadow for our life
 I've followed Mark's Blog for years, from when I was a young naïve college student, to now as I graduate from residency and start my career as a young doctor.  I can honestly say, Mark's wisdom has changed my life for the better by making me a happier, more successful, more resilient person.  His articles hit on deep truths that many of us feel, but never articulate - he's like a great comedian in that sense.
 When I first bought this book I didn't think much of it. I was a fan of his blog for a while and I had already read a handful of self help books before. Going into this I prepared myself to hear superficial adviced like "smile more" or "visualize". What I got instead was a huge, hard to swallow pill, and a glass of salt to wash it down.<br/>Even the "all time great" self help books can't hold a match to this giant house fire of a book. From the very beginning this book calls you out on your actions, and tells you that you're a whiny, entitled jerk. Afterwards it tells you that you're the source of your problems. As a whiny, entitled jerk you have superficial values that reinforces your entitlement, which in turn reinforces your whiny, jerky ways.<br/>Where this book really shines though is instead of giving you some daily mantra, or telling you to work harder at your superficial goals, it tells you to quit the bulls*** and stop being such a whiny, entitled jerk.
 excellent book
 Absolutely loved this book. Brilliant advice given in the most engaging manner. Really enjoyed reading it.!!
 Very informative book !
 wow.<br/>In a, shall we say 'interesting', way of writing Mark gets his points across in a way that makes for very enjoyable reading.
 The best little book I've read for a long time. Very sane, very sensible and extremely readable and entertaining
 I agree with Mark Manson's basic values underlying this book, and I find his style of writing extremely entertaining as well.<br/><br/>I did not give it 5 stars because I found the structure of the book all over the place with not much coherence and flow into it.<br/><br/>Definitely worth a read, could just be organized better in terms of chapters and transitions.
 Awesome viewpoint! Love it so far!
 Mind changing, cool read!
 awesome book! A must read, definitely!
 Good food for thought in this quick-reading book.
 Way toooooo many f------
 Thought provoking.  I am going to reread .
 Anecdotal, witty, and really a fun quick read! It's also available as an audiobook!
 Quick read! Eye-opening way to approaching life and begin to live life with greater meaning/purpose.
 I got this due to the title and reviews. Mr. Manson has done a good job of linking his life's experiences to the lessons / ideas in this book. Think of it as a summary of ideas, sort of a compendium of thoughts that are helpful in viewing life from a different view. Maybe it's due to my age, experiences and education and successes ( and failures) that I think this book would be more helpful for someone in their twenties and thirties.
 Do not buy the book, very week content . Waste of money and time and very over rated.
 Gave it to a friend as a gift. Great read!
 Good book.Lots of food for thought.
 This book was refreshing and a pleasure to read. I would recommend to this book to anyone who enjoys a slice of raw wisdom.
 great read
 Funny. Well written. Insightful. All around great read.
 Fantastic, brilliant
 Changes my life!
 Everybody should read this. It should be a requirement for a better mind set and a better understanding of life.
 Love this book very interesting read
 Awesome read! Just what I needed at this point in life. One of the best books I have ever read!
 Great book!!
 love the book
 Mark delivers as usual.  This book contains a clear and important message drastically needed in today's world.
 The ultimate non self help self help book. Very thought provoking (and funny)
 Thought it was excellently written. Highly recommend this book.
 Great book, must read!
 I cannot express in words how much I love this book.  What a breath of fresh air!
 Great Read
 This book can help you get rid of your useless baggage that has stuck to you for many years. Go for it!
 A refreshing change from the psychobabble of most self development books.
 I have recommended this book to everyone I know.
 Love it!
 Fantastic book.  If you don't walk away with some profound realizations about yourself in this book then you really were not looking for personal improvement.  I am way older than his target market and even I found it funny, inspiring and thought provoking.  It is all a great read but Chapter 5 is a real kick in the pants.<br/><br/>I have now bought 7 of these to give to those I care for.  Kids, wife, friends and family and there has not been one of them that has not walked away with the same feelings I had.
 It's as if the author took mushrooms and LSD then wrote all his epiphanies in one rambling book which he attempted to crudely compartmentalize into different chapters, theories, postulates about life. I bought this book as it was a #2 bestseller and forced myself to read the rest of it in case I was truly missing some hidden gem.<br/>Has some thought-provoking ideas - similar to the ones that people experience when they're under the influence and think they're the next genius. This book sucks.
 It's hard to say if Mark Manson changed my life. What I do know is that when trying to make decisions, from trivial to life-changing ones, or give advice to friends, I'll often refer to to the perspective and values in Mark's writing. This goes against his advice of being more skeptical, and this can freeze most people with indecision or analysis paralysis, but his other advice of Accepting Responsibility helps me make choices with full recognition of consequences much more calmly and with a more level head.<br/><br/>In reading his writing, I feel less lost. And when I still feel lost, I sit with my emotions, accept them, and kindly ask if they'd like some coffee or tea. Even the negative ones.<br/><br/>So thank you, Mark, for publishing this book. It's hard to imagine what can top this and Models, but I'm already looking forward to it.
 Makes me think about my choices everyday. To some it will be mind blowing.
 Intriguing!
 I ended up downloading the audio book as well as the kindle version for this book, and I'm so glad I got the audible version. It was hilarious. I listened to it on a long plane ride and caught myself laughing out loud multiple times. I'm sure my neighbors thought I was crazy. This book definitely makes you challenge the way you approach your thought process and makes you really think about how we all force ourselves to care so much about every single thing, when that is really difficult to sustain.
 Just great guide how to live. Amazing piece that is must read for anyone interested in personal development.
 Such a wake up call
 A cool look at people, perspectives and personality traits. Mark clearly has had some real life experiences
 Standing Ovation. I bought this book a couple days ago, and am reading through again for the second time.
 Love this book!
 Giving the actual young age of the writer in comparison with the subject of how to live life, he has a good outlook. Combining his thoughts the book turns inward towards the middle and shoots out the end with a large thought. I wouldn't call it life changing advise for those in middle age but I would say it gives something to bounce values off and think about.
 Great book.
 Great "read".
 Got the audio book first then the hard copy
 👍
 Excellent book! Just excellent!!!
 A really good book👍🏼
 Best read. just keeps on giving every time you read it.
 Great!<br/>More than i was expecting!!
 Perfect
 I read a lot of books about self help and how to be better and do better. THIS IS THE BEST. I am reading it slowly because I want to fully take it in. I am about 3/4 of the way through and I am pretty sure I am going to read it again. It's so logical and freeing.
 This is exactly what you need to read. The book to shatter your self-indulgent bs, your delusions, with heavy-handed wanton reality. Give a fck about this book, fck the rest. ~ Disappointment Panda
 Such an easy and fun read. Can give some really great introspection to anyone that is stuck in a rut at their current moment in life. Reinforces great ideas on how to move forward and not dwell on things.<br/><br/>My only critique of this book would be the title haha. It's a funny and great title, but the book is more about "Choosing your battles" and "Picking your spots" in life if you were to ask me. Mark is a terrific writer and this is a book you don't want to put down once you really get going.
 Awesome intuitive stuff
 Thanks!
 Awesome book!
 Made my life less complicated
 No issues whatsoever
 Not particularly insightful, the first couple of pages read well, but then you quickly realize that there is not meat to this meal.
 Great value.
 Great read!
 Overall, good book with a lot of "hard" common sense practicality.
 This book is a gem!
 Modern philosophy with lots of f-bombs
 This book is a game-changer self improvement read.
 Chances are this book will either make you laugh or offend you greatly. If it makes you laugh, great. If you're offended by its content, put it down for a while, take a look at how miserably you live your life, and get back to it later. Just my opinion, it is sort of a layman's version of Wherever You Go, There You Are; kind of Alan Watts with a stinger. Overall a good read and intended to bring you back into this moment, instead of running amok in the brambles of your mind.
 One word Excellent!
 I loved this book, best advice i have ever read. Very refreshing and realistic.
 The title may seem otherwise but this is a serious and honest book. It's a must read. I've spent so much time reading self help books and this one rings true.....maybe more than any other book I've read. It does it in a believe able, no nonsense and concise way. High five Mark! This book rocks.
 Excelente
 For anyone who follows Mark's blog, you will probably have already read about a third of the book. It reiterates a lot of common anecdotes from his life that he's already covered in his blog, such as his upbringing and his journey to becoming a "digital nomad." It also brings up a lot of common themes from his website, such as the paradox of goal setting, and the value of acting over planning.<br/><br/>However, the beauty of this book lies in the extra insight he adds to each theme, and the familiar sardonic humor that he expertly intertwines into each page to keep you hooked. Yes, at some points I was kind of like, "Ok, already read this post on his site, let's skim and move on." But at other points, such as his extrapolation on "good" values versus "bad" ones and not forcing yourself to be happy all the time, there's pure effing gold.<br/><br/>As a disclaimer, I usually hate self-help books. They always make me feel like that pathetic loser at the bar chugging a stiffy, all alone, unloading a diarrhea hurricane of narcissistic "woe is me" crap onto anyone unfortunate enough to be in earshot.<br/><br/>But I like to think of Mark's new book as more of a philosophy on embracing negativity and, as he says it, "fighting the sh*t storm." He doesn't force you to trudge through lists of superficial ways to pretend that life is a golden egg made from rainbow unicorn piss and the creepy baby sun from the Teletubbies. He rather creates a framework for setting your own self-help agenda based off of your own values, not the other way around.<br/><br/>DEFINITELY recommend this book to people weathering "the sh*t storm," or just in general feeling like you have no idea what the hell you're doing in life. He gives some unnecessary examples of his themes that are a little lengthy and deserve skimming, which is why I give it four stars instead of five. Other parts, though, you will want to tattoo to your body, because you'll want to refer to them over and over again as you deal with whatever drama you're dealing with that led you to consider reading this book.<br/><br/>Overall amazing and potentially life-changing read for all orientations, genders, ages (over 18 due to some swearing), and races!
 Great book.  I'll usually read half and get bored. Read the whole thing in a week.
 Great Book!  Well written and funny.
 Great book. Challenging your point of view in life. And still it makes you laugh. I really like it.
 Great read! Mark's views on life are not only eye opening, but spot on.
 A must read for everyone struggling with anything!
 love it
 Amazing
 Love it!
 Excellent!
 This book is a gift that I happened into-- I did not expect to run into it, and I was certainly looking for something more lightweight and self-help-y, that I could read &amp; mostly forget. I read most of it, then put it aside for a couple of weeks. I just had a lousy day, and finished the last 20 or so pages before sleeping. I'm impressed, and somehow looking at my values and life is OK. Good Book, actually useful in opening up my thinking, instead of telling me someone else's good ideas.
 In perfect condition.
 A quite shallow book. Great feelgood-read, lining up small pieces to nod at: Yeah, that's how it is.<br/><br/>But if there is anything in the book that you didn't already know, you probably won't learn it by reading this book. Nothing is backed up, or argued for, or explained.<br/><br/>Basically, a rant.
 Thanks.
 Good read!
 Great read everyone should look at.
 Good read
 This book changed my life.
 awesome awesome book!
 wonderful book. The book is really about helping people prioritize what's important life and not giving a flip about the little things.  I bought a copy for both of my kids (one in high school and the other in college).  My college aged son let one of his friends read it.  His friend commented that it was one of the best books he ever read.
 I just finished this book. I needed to hear this
 Without realizing it when I bought this book, this book is about life and values. It's about consciously choosing your values in order to live a more full life. I will read this book many times. Highly recommended.
 I'm not a big fan of self-help books. The last time I read a self-help book that was helpful with several decades ago. Tony Robbins. I didn't think his books would be helpful either, but they really were. And now, decades later, I picked up this book only because I thought the title was funny. But, inside, isn't very clear discussion, a very clear explanation, of the types of toxic thinking that we engage in as individuals. And, better, there's a very clear roadmap presented in an easy-to-understand way, showing us how to jettison some of that thinking.<br/><br/>As the title suggests, there is quite a bit of swearing in this book. But it neither masks ineffective noise, nor does it detract from the message. In a strange way, it fits. And the book moves along, at a very good pace, and encourages you as you read it to go through your own process of examining yourself and figuring out what really needs to change.<br/><br/>I wish I could do a better job of explaining this review, all I can say is, for me, this was a very good book, and I'm very glad I picked it up. Well recommended to everyone, whether you're feeling negative or not.
 Lighthearted and resourceful. Will read his next one.
 Save your money and time<br/>I'll sum up the book for you. 1. Live in the now. 2. Only care about things worth caring about 3. Don't get mad about anything that won't matter in 5 years.<br/><br/>This book is light on facts and heavy from a blowhard's point of view.
 Worst book 📚 I ever tried to get through. I can’t believe I wasted my money. My friend recommended it. I cannot imagine why. Useless! He has just enough advice in here for a 4 or 5 page essay, not a book. He says the “F” word too many times, distracting from the content.
 So, I listened to this on Audible. 3 times. Then I bought the book.  So I could highlight in it. ... Like, the whole thing....  Stop reading reviews, because you could be using this time reading the book... or listening to it... seriously. Stop.
 "This book will not teach you how to gain or achieve, but rather how to lose and let go."<br/><br/>I'm quoting the author here, but this is it, in a nutshell.<br/><br/>This short book will challenge you to reevaluate your standards, your values, your way of life, your relationships and your perspective on life (and death).<br/><br/>It will prompt you to dislodge yourself from the way things are and prompt you to ask yourself if this is what you really want. It will help you see effort, pain, fear and sacrifice in a new light. It will force you to grow up and own up to your decisions and mistakes.<br/><br/>I, for one, loved this book. It's written by someone who has been through life, who has failed and who has experienced success and true happiness. It's the result of a man's ability to see reality for what it is rather than a version distorted by personal projections.<br/><br/>Read it. It'll shake you.
 Right on!
 I've been following Mark's blog for a couple of years. I love his sense of humor, his grounded insight, and everything he writes. This is probably the best self-help book out there. Its a no-nonsense, straight-forward, honest approach to evaluating yourself and the values you live by. Its helped me let-go of a lot of "bulls***" and focus on what is really important in my life. We only go around this world once. Better make the best of it with the people we love the most.Thank you Mark, for publishing this book.
 Don't waste you $$$ on this! I should have researched the author before the purchase. In my opinion, the content is between 6th and 7th grade level and it appears to me that the author constantly uses profanity as a simple shallow content filler which only serves to bore you.  I would not recommend this book at all!
 I just finished reading the book and it was totally worth my time! I have read most of his articles on his blog and though some of it was repeated in this book, there is also a lot of fresh content. I gained some fantastic insights from this book particularly on healthy relationships, "do something" attitude, attitude towards pain and suffering, and being aware of emotional highs and confusing that with happiness. It is remarkable that the author was able to gather this wisdom based on his life experiences and able to present it in a compelling way!
 If I could I would have given 10 stars! This is absolutely the most fantastic self help book which lays the truth out on you just like it is, without sugar coating anything. Majority of people already know solutions to all of our problems - we are just scared to say them out loud and act on them because we are afraid to hurt the other persons feelings or hurt our fragile ego. It's much easier to sit and do nothing and wallow in your own victimhood. We all are afraid of something without realizing that life's short and you need to not give a f%^* about your fears. Buy this book - you won't regret it!
 This book is wonderful! I couldn't put it down, and finished it in 2 days. It really helped me put things in prospective, of what is something to care about and what is a waste of my care on. Now, putting it in place is taking a little more work (lol, of course) but I am working on it!!!! The book is a refreshing revamp on the tradition self help books, and it great for the 20-somethings looking for a self help book written for the. Would very much recommend this book to my friends.
 This book offers a great insight into life --unfiltered from all the politically correct bs that other authors are too afraid to say. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for an honest perspective into life's quandaries, with the benefit that it's hilarious too.  The author's many points are very valid and have foundations in psychological science as well.  I loved the book and have already recommended it to my close friends and family. I'll keep it in my house for guests to ask about it. :)
 At first I was thrown off by what he says in the first few chapters. How can we ever be happy if we are constantly in this cycle of worrying, then feeling guilty, then worrying about feeling guilty....and it goes on and on....It makes sense to me and I'm ready to let go of the cycle and try it his way....so read it and see if trying it his way doesn't take some, if not all, the stress of worrying away and open up a whole new way of thinking and living!
 Great read! Highly recommended
 Amazing. Great new views on living consciously and on your own terms
 At a young age, the author has learned lessons it took me 50 years to learn. There is no replacement for common sense and if you don't yet have common sense, this book may help you achieve it. If I were younger and less smart, I would have  enjoyed this reading more. As it is, I read many of my own philosophies.
 The is a self help book with out a bunch of gobildy gook in it
 increible!!!!!!
 Sounds like a petulant privileged child wrote this.
 Very good read, very quick read, and very funny read.
 Great!
 I liked the simplicity of the message. I've read and listened to the greats in personal growth and I know message pretty good by now. While there is certainly nothing wrong and I encourage people to read and listen to those messages, its important not to get tied to any one way of thinking, without challenging it. I believe this book challenges the 'just think happy thoughts' mentality and gives you the straight dope. Stop trying to fix everything about you. You're actually doing the best you can and being told you have so many things wrong and a whole slew of books was written about you to help fix all those things, is a bit daunting, to say the least. I give it 5 stars because it challenged my thinking and made me ask whats really important in my life? I've stopped trying to be superman and fix all my issues.  Sometimes the very things we think are the answers, are the very things that hold us back.
 Love it!
 A beacon of safe like advice in a sea of mediocrity.
 This is one of the best books I have ever read. The information that is in the book is to scary and at the same way helpful. In the middle of reading this book I felt like, then what is the point on living? Why just don't die if we are going to do it anyways. I started to feel strange inside of me. I was scared because everything he writes about Is true. We all try to hard on impressing people. Try hard to make big goals and try to achieve them. But in the end we do it not for ourselfs we do it for the attention we will get in the result for that. We are not special, but in the same time we are. We are all unique bit not more special than the others. We live our life trying to be "successful" and convince ourself that it is because we want it for us. But in some cases we are not. We (and when I mean "we" I mean myself) try so much to achieve goals working hard everyday trying to come closer to that goal. But when I readed this book my eyes opened. I was wrong. I was not doing it for myself. I was doing it to prove others I am worth of their attention. Because I wanted to feel special because yeah. I always said to myself "nobody work hard enough for success so I am special I work harder than the others and that is why i deserve it more". I was every day working hard, I did not want to accept it but when I readed this book it really hurted me. I felt like he was 100% seeing through me. I felt like my life was pointless. All I did, the goals I was pursuing was only to make other think in the future. "Wow he is special. He worked hard to obtaining he's goals. He is inspiring". I wanted to show the people that made me feel bad about myself see me in the future and look up on me and say to themselves. "Well I think I am the real loser". But in this book I began to think. I was always looking at other people judging them about being at their 30-40 having a s***ty job, family, complaining about everyone and everything etc. Or the ones on my ages always working hard, making fools of themselves trying to get the attention of others. Or people screaming at others just to feel like they are better than the other person. I always felt sorry about them. When reading this book I realised I am exactly at them. We live our whole life trying to be somebody. When the real thing we should do is try to be the person we want to be. But it is not easy. The society always look up to successes and winners but never at the ones that are not that "successful" but are happy. And that make us all feel like we are not enough. Which we think is true. We give fu*ks about so many things that are not really important and that does not mean anything at all. The fact that we are going to die is terrifying. Not because we don't know what comes next, it's because, we thing yeah if we all will die then what is the point of trying? That's the reason this book is good it does not just make you unsure about all your beliefs. It also makes you realise that it does not mather at all if you are going to die. The real problem is what you should care about while you are alive. The old lady crossing the road in the pace of a turtle. Or the really fact that we are alive and are able to choose what we want to care about.<br/><br/>Why did i writte a so long post? Well because if this can help somebody in my situation it will be nice. And the other reason was for myself. Because even if I say I don't care I actually care about what others think about me, and even if you don't know me in person. Knowing someone readed this and got the inspiration to read the book then it's enough for me. To feel like I did something good.<br/><br/>And the third reason is because I liked the super hero "Disappointed Panda". He is cool and I would like a hero like that. Instead of the false super heroes that lies to others just to get liked by them.<br/><br/>So this is an executive book. It gives a new way to look at things. I really recomend it for the people that are tired of this world and the humans on it, and even worst that tries way to hard to imprese those humans you hate, because you were told that is the right way to fulfill yourself. "You should do like the rest",they said. It does not help in the long run. It have never and will never!
 Bought this for my husband.  He loves it and makes sure to tell everyone how much he loves it.  His explanation of the book to others has resulted in at least 5 new books being purchased.  They are all hooked and ready to read it themselves because he raves about it so much.  It has helped in see things a little clearer and decide what is worth extra attention and what to just let go.  I am going to read it when he is done!
 In many ways, this is a book about Buddhism (Life is suffering.), with some Taoism (Life is incomprehensible.) thrown in. I think of it as, “Life is one big dichotomy,” but the general theme is that we care about too many things that don’t really matter. And we do it because we see things through the single perspective of feelings like pleasure, anger, superiority, etc., all of which are fleeting (impermanent in the vernacular of Buddhism) and hollow (i.e. illusory or myopic).<br/><br/>You can’t have it all – as in you can’t embrace all values. You need to choose. And you need to choose wisely. We need better values, and those are the ones that face inward, that speak to the person you really are, not the way people may perceive you.<br/><br/>The writing is witty, fluid, and to the point. It’s a bit of a cross between Hunter S. Thompson and a British social comic, although the Brits call it irony.<br/><br/>There is a fair amount of pseudo-cussing, if you will, but it’s more a call to attention than a vessel filled with meaning. Manson admits in the beginning that based on his earlier life he is an unlikely messenger of such philosophical gravitas. The language, more than anything, simply establishes the credibility of that claim and serves to enhance the power of the contrast between old self (eventful) and current self (fulfilled, or getting there).<br/><br/>The money line, for me, was an insight about the impact of technology. “Our lives today are filled with the information from the extremes of the bell curve of human experience…This flood of extreme information has conditioned us to believe that exceptionalism is the new normal.” If you haven’t gone viral yet, or your small business hasn’t disrupted an entire industry, you’re nobody.<br/><br/>That said, I hesitate to call this book exceptional, although Manson is a big fan of calling things what they are. So, yes, this is an exceptional book.
 I read a review on this book and thought it sounded fabulous so I ordered five copies to give as Christmas gifts... After reading the book I can't give it the five stars I would have liked to... It is just not that good... not bad, but I have a lot of better similar books...
 So to preface this I just went through a sort of existential crisis, some of the worst depression of my life. I've finished college but have just been drifting, friends are moving on with life, starting families, having kids, moving away. Romances faded, all are now married and moving on as well. Basically I was left with nothing and nobody, and when you sort of defined yourself by your relationships then your life as you know it is actually sort of over. That doesn't have to be a bad thing though.<br/><br/>This book has comeplely changed the way I look at pain, at responsibility, and at how I define myself and my life. Usually that would sound like I'm full of crap but here me out. I started reading this a few days ago as I started on a trip to see an ex if mine, we had been talking again and it was a 50/50 chance of any future there, but I felt I needed to do some due diligence at least. So I'm on this trip and completely at ease in a situation that would have otherwise been a bit anxiety inducing. I wasn't worried about impressing her, or even about shaping the outcome, I just knew that I was there to find the truth and was happy with that. Things went great at first but didn't work out. I walked away with dignity, and because of that actually quite happy and pleased with myself. Because I recognized where I had a choice and where I didn't, that my value wasn't determined by this girl who was torn in what she wanted but rather in how I felt I was handling things. I don't know if I can emphasize enough how empowering that feels.<br/><br/>I'm excited about the future for the first time in a long time. To the author thank you, it's made a world of difference, and it's only been a few days.<br/><br/>Tldr; got rejected, but because of this book it was a personal victory instead of something that felt like an attack
 The focus of this book, in many ways, mirrored Stephen Covey's "7 Habits of Highly Effective People" with different and more colorful language.<br/><br/>Several notes that I gained from this book included:<br/>• The Do Something Principle<br/>• Pain is a part of the process<br/>• Commitment frees us<br/>• And the ability to chose what to truly care about.<br/><br/>I would recommend this book to friends because of its focus, insight, and down to earth, coffee table approach of sharing wisdom. It was REAL which I enjoyed.
 Awesome book!
 Seemed like more, "Personal Responsibility" bologna. Yes, we are all responsible for our stuff. No, I am not responsible for everyone else's stuff. If you run over my dog, I am not at fault because I feel bad about it. I will not be over it in an hour because you think I should be. Worse, because that is what you would do.
 I just lost my cousin, who is like my sister, to cancer, a very rare one.  She was just about to turn 43. I also lost my brother at age 29 to a brain tumor, 16 years ago. I was feeling very depressed,  sad etc. My cousin, Melanie, lived the message of this book, and when it showed up.on.my phone the other day, the day before her 43rd birthday, I thought what the F? Let's read it. I have never read a book on my phone but found myself with a free 30 minutes..this never happens..so I started reading and could not stop. It was like Mel sent me a book with all her messages..with her wisdom, I could hear her voice,  saying it to.me. I am going to believe this is a gift from her and I am going to work at living. Thanks Mark, Thanks, Mel.
 AMAZING!!!
 An intriguing read
 I have been reading Manson's blog for a while, and while the information is well organized and thorough, I felt as though I was just rereading several of his better articles from his blog. However, it is well written with a wry style that is what drew me to start reading his blog in the first place. This book is a perfect way to share a lot of the information that I learned from his blog with friends who are less willing to go through all the articles themselves. I have already bought two copies and given them both away.
 Amazing book
 Hysterical and so true.
 It's hard to put this into words. If I could, I would have very person consume this book in one form or another. A book on the meaning of being alive and how to live it? Closest to a yes that I've ever found.
 Emphasizes what is known to be understood easily.
 Awakening / thought provoking
 Interesting and entertaining read but should have saved my money and borrowed it from the library. I suppose this applies to most of the self-help books.
 This book was fantastic and very real. It breaks down all those things we ball up and cling to inside, things that are unproductive and/or destructive and helps illuminate why we do them, and how to question ourselves to be better and think differently. This was super well written and really helped to hold a mirror for which we should all take a look at ourselves in and question why we do what we do and what we truly value. For anyone who is open to questioning themselves, questioning life and interested in trying to really live more fully - I think this will be a great read! I think everyone needs to read it.
 If i had the money id buy and send a copy of this book to every American in this country. We have become a nation of self entitled, narcissistic, cry baby little pricks and they could learn a lot from reading this book and realizing that no one really gives a $H$% about how they are feeling and whats upsetting them today. A wonderful book that got me mentally back on track after going through some incredibly difficult times in my life.
 The Kindle sample was literally nothing but I bought it anyway and am glad I did.  It's an enlightening book with lots of wisdom that will help you see life differently.  The author has an authenticity that I found delightful.
 Mark Manson writes well, and this book doesn't disappoint. My kindle is highlighted all over the chapters. The first chapter is a little weak, but the meat comes 20 percent into the book and all the way to the end.  I'm forced to think about redefining the way I  understand my values.<br/><br/>Even greater is that I'm forced to overcome issues with rejection and failure. It's hard but within this book, I realized why it's hard and that's because your identity is threatened. The last chapter on confronting death is a powerful one as well.<br/><br/>I'd recommend the book as it had new nuggets for me to take away and internalize. Great job Mark Manson!
 Have recommended to all of my friends!
 Having bought the book and spent the money, I will finish it.  Not sure there are any effin pearls of wisdom here.  Guess catchy titles sell.
 Updated Review - July 8, 2017<br/><br/>Originally, I didn't give an F about this book and it wasn’t because of the usage of adult language. I'm cool with potty mouths, especially since I have one myself, so for you sensitive folks, don’t knock it just because of the title. And the language goes to PG-13 after the first couple of chapters, so quit crying and giving an F about the language. Anyway, after punching myself in the face and almost selling the book after only reading 2 chapters of it, I sat the F down and gave it a shot over a week long session while mulling over what I truly give an F about. After all, as I mentioned below, Manson’s got a great blog so I thought that there had to be some useful nuggets within. Indeed, I found a bunch. Though I was initially confused as to who is giving an F and who wasn’t, and whether the F bomb in a given sentence was a verb, noun, adjective, adverb, etc., I got over myself and opened my mind. Simply by me giving an F to what I truly value (learning, improving), I found this book to be utterly liberating. And that’s the message that Manson is conveying. Give an F to what you truly value. Don’t give an F to meaningless F---Facebook posts, to wayward values, nor to what other people think. Especially since they are just as insecure as you are.<br/>So, get over yourself and your fear of the F word and quit crying that it’s nothing new because, it is. It’s a slap to the face of most of the feel-good, coddling self-help books that have been out on the market for the last 3 decades. It will show you that you don’t need to be coddled and suffocated with annoying positivity. What you need, and what I needed, is good ole fashioned pain and suffering if you want to get anywhere in life. After all, that’s why you’re reading a self-help book, now isn’t it?<br/>Lastly, for those of you who read self-help books, you can’t just read it in one sitting and have any expectation of transformation or improvement. The mind does not work that way. Look up that fact. Read a chapter, apply the ideas to your life, check back, do it again. Then again. And yes, again! That’s called active learning. That’s how improvement comes. Not by simply reading a book and expecting a magic panda to come along out of the bamboo forest and erase your problems. Got it? Great, now get the F to reading this book.<br/><br/>Original Review:<br/><br/>Funny how Amazon kicked back my initial review because I used a word contained in the title of the book itself! Oh well, I don't give a f---. Here's the review with the censorship bug turned on:<br/><br/>Catchy title and definitely a great philosophy - to not give a f--- that is. However, the title misleads because all that you really need to know about this art is that it's not as subtle as Mark Manson claims it is (though I greatly respect his writing in his blog). For the art to be successful, one must explicitly make clear to all those around him or her that there is no doubt that there are zero f---s given in this or that particular situation. And thus, for this book, I really didn't give a f--- about it because it's all over the place, making it difficult to know who is giving a f---, who is supposed to be giving a f--- and who isn't.
 Manson is excellent through the first 75% of this book. The choosing what to care about is extremely helpful in this day and age. He's humorous and smart and isn't just giving his opinion - it's actually backed up by a lot of good citing and science. The last 25% loses steam and is largely irrelevant in my opinion. Maybe not for others. I liked it, I was encouraged by it, and it has helped me refocus my energy.
 Mark Manson is my favorite writer of all time. He really captures you in this book with his blunt sense of humor and straight up honesty. I was so excited to get this book that read it in a day and now I'm in the process of reading it again. After reading this book my whole perspective on life immediately changed and I felt so relieved after reading all the amazing points he makes in this book. If you love his blog you'll definitely love this book.
 Great read. Couldn't put it down.
 Marks counter intuitive approach rings true. So his paradox is that it's counter-counter so therefore rather intuitive? But darn it, he says I can't rely on this. But I don't have to because I'm almost always wrong anyway? S*** happens, not all is roses so just buy it a realise you'll be dead soon. By the way - this is the best self help book I've ever read. His blog is equally better. Genius (he's crazy right?). Buy!!
 Fast delivery and nice book
 great philosophy....;
 This guy makes a lot of sense.
 Pay attention...this book may be funny and have the F word in it one too many times for some people (personally, I thought it was hysterical and not overdone), but take it seriously because it is filled with the secret to your own happiness. If you're ready to grow as an individual, improve your life and have a good laugh in the process, this is a must read. Very well written. Very smooth reading. Love it.
 It was an accident (or maybe not) that I came across this book but it was exactly what I needed. The concept of fault and responsibly-- it helped put events in my life into perspective.  I know I wasn't at fault for the events but the book helped me understand that it is my responsibility as to how I look and react to the events going forward.
 A major, realistic, perspective changer...
 Horrible book.  Written by someone with little  perspective
 Anyone after reading this book will have a complete different understanding of life. A lot of good examples were shared by the author. His approach of life is perfect to me.
 Amazing book, Mark Masons writing is superb!
 Amazing book.
 I gave this to my wife and she liked it waaaay too much. Now she won't make dinner.
 After the initial few f-bombs and irreverent intro, it becomes a common sense self-help book and not particularly insightful. If you have had any thoughtful examination of your own life, or therapy, or read any self help books, this is kind of a waste of time. Bought it as an audio book and a hardcover. Gave away hard copy as a gift and listened to it while walking. Entertaining for a background listen. Glad I did not try to sit and read it.
 Perfect
 I thought enjoyed this book
 The ideas in this book aren't really new. I'm a clinical social worker and much of what is presented in the book is simply a reiteration of DBT and CBT but using different words. I was hoping this could be useful with clients. Ultimately not very helpful.
 Great
 Memento mori.
 Awesome read
 If you are sceptical of this book due to the language Don't Be. This book was a Great read, common sense approach to self help. I was surprised coming from the title but Mark makes sound philosophical arguments in each chapter that leave you saying "soo true!"
 Was a present for my bf and he loves it
 This book takes everything I've learned in the last ten years of my life and condensed it into a very short, very enjoyable read. There is some seriously powerful stuff in this book (such as taking 100% responsibility for everything in your life and being willing to stare in the face of your own death).<br/><br/>He takes the typical "feel good" self help structure and turns it on its end. And in its place, he gives you the solid, no frills, straight up truth. It's both a kick in the butt and a powerful reminder that we are in control of our lives. Definitely give this one a read, especially if you're new to personal development.
 profound, simple, actionable
 Great book
 You are not a heel for standing up to people who want you to take responsibility for problems in their lives.  Really well written and enjoyable to read it gave me a renewed sense of confidence in how I live my life and treat others.  Learn to live in the real world, if you haven't already done so.  Be kind, loving and open minded in life, but understand that it's not necessary to give a......you know what.....about everything and everybody.
 Well, I just finished the book. There were several instances throughout reading where I thought of how I would review it when I was finished, but having closed the back cover here is what I'll offer;<br/>For starters, this is the first book I've bought and read cover to cover in less than one week, in a long time. Not only that, but I was inspired to also read directly from the book to my family and my girlfriend. This book has a lot to offer. To anyone. For everyone. If you're a follower of Mark's blogs you're already familiar with the kind of no bulls*** sincerity he writes with. not only does this book deliver in the same likeness, Mark also put his mind and heart in between these pages.
 Amazing book by an amazing author!!!
 The Secret Of Happiness of Zen Buddhism boiled down into a simple easy to digest straightforward and Rated-R approach for anyone to easily understand.
 Good read and good points, but the book could have been half as long and still driven the points home.  Also, while far from a prude, the F word seemed to be forced at times, like a ten-year old who just learned the word.
 I read this book for a book club. I am about the same age as the author, but did not know anything about his blog/prior work. It is poorly/haphazardly put together and written. Just regurgitated stories/facts/light psychology with no substance. Most of his "examples" to illustrate his points, I've already read about in a much more nuanced/interesting way. Really found nothing of value in this book. I don't really have an issue with his points, but it could all be summed up in about 1 page.
 I rate this book four stars because 'We are always in the process of approaching truth and perfection without actually ever reaching truth or perfection.'  Giving it a five would would have meant perfection😊<br/>I liked this book because it was enlightening and informative without being tedious.  The examples were contextual and historical, not abstract.  It is engaging and hilarious.  It cuts across sociocultural barriers.<br/>Recommended for all who would rather not waste precious time sweating the small stuff.
 Anti self help, cynical, boring, uneventful, predictable, overrated, not worth even for free. Do not waste your time. Not worth it. Read classics or some exciting fiction or an enlightening non fiction. This one is garbage.
 AMAZING &amp; Hilarious!!
 This book is fantastic.  I first heard the audiobook and loved it so much I had to purchase a physical version.  The name may leave you under the impression that the book is frivolous, but it is honestly one of the best self-help books that I've read in a long time.  The author's style is engaging and relatable.<br/><br/>I now keep the hardcover copy on my coffee table and recommend it to anyone who visits my house!
 Absolutely love this book. Definitely worth the money and time. I think everyone should read it!!
 Absolutely great read.<br/><br/>I have trouble getting through books as I get bored or uninterested. I read this one right through in a couple of days.<br/><br/>I've read many business, self-development, and self-help books.<br/><br/>My two most highly recommended so far are the 4 Hour Work week by Tim Ferris, and the Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck by Mark Manson. Also, anything by Seth Godin!
 First I would greatly like to thank the author for writing a book that I actually gave a feck about reading.<br/>Cut through the bull turds and to the point. Finally someone gets it and put those words to paper. Thank you Mark Manson.
 The Audiobook version is excellent.  Gives a lot of food for thought.  If you're asking yourself questions about what and why you're prioritizing certain values, behaviors, and relationships - this helps gets you back to the root of the question of "What the heck am I doing", and even more importantly, "Why am I doing it?"<br/><br/>Highly recommended...
 Heard about this book on Elvis Duran in the Morning and figured I would purchase it after his reviews. I was pleasantly surprised. It was very enjoyable, easy read and definitely made for an interesting conversation piece on the airplane where I was reading it. Normally I'm not into the "motivational" type of books, but this was definitely an excellent read! I highly recommend it!
 This book is brain candy--you'll get a sugar high with little reading effort, but it won't provide any long-lasting or profound insights.  Yes, most people worry too much.  Yes, Madison Ave. advertising is manipulative.  Yes, everybody hurts.<br/><br/>I'll share the most interesting insights here:<br/><br/>1.  "It's worth remembering that for any change to happen in your life, you must be wrong about something. If you're sitting there, miserable day after day, then that means you're already wrong about something in your life."<br/><br/>2.  Russians value honesty and are blunt because being direct, even if impolite, increases trust.<br/><br/>3.  "True happiness occurs only when you find the problems you enjoy having and enjoy solving."
 Good read
 For those of us who are trying to live life to the best of our ability's Mark Manson gives us a toolbox to use. His way of explaining the benefits of being able to get through the BS to what really matters is like talking to an old friend. He is very honest about his own life which makes his writings funny, thought provoking and reflective. You have know choice but to look at yourself in a different way once you've finished.
 Loved it!
 Straight forward approach to life in general. If anything I loved the way he incorporated his personal experiences into the book, the ending was perfect and I almost got a teary eyed from the loss of his friend to the experience at Cape of good hope. Read it in 2 days.
 There are a handful of books that have changed my life and I can say that this book is within my top 5.  I would definitely and have recommended it to my family and friends; especially the audiobook version.  It is both informative and entertaining.
 I just finished reading this book. Yes, it's "self-help" and yes, it's foul (which I like). But it's really good. Like, I want to read it again now. I wrote down several memorable quotes and I want to go back in for more. What I love most is that it is contrary to the typical self-help book. It gives good life advice while being totally honest about the ups and downs of life. Thanks Mark for writing a meaningful and much-needed book.
 Having the science behind Mindfulness really made me want to try it truly and get rid of my earthy crunchy bashing judgments on such styles of life. After finishing this book I've started on a MBSR course and am getting really into awareness and mindfulness. I've recommended it to so many people. I can already notice myself getting a bit disenchanted with life sucking vices.
 I liked this book, but I wasn't wowed.  It reads like a fun, new take on old advice.  I won't delete it from my Kindle, but I probably won't want to read it again, either.
 First of all, I want to congratulate the author on the hard work I'm sure he put into writing and publishing this book.  Just because I didn't care for it, doesn't mean it's not for others.  Obviously, since it's a best seller.<br/><br/>That being said, it really was not for me.  I read the first few chapters before giving it up and deciding that I could not connect with the author's message the way that apparently many have.  I found the writing too simplistic, and often times felt like I was listening to a motivational speech from a frat boy (too little depth and too much profanity).  For many that will make the stories more relatable, but again, I just could not connect with the writing.
 This book was a very inspirational read, but not in regard to the typical "highs" you may get from reading self help books. It basically encourages you to embrace criticism and failure, face your own entitlements and insecurities, and even come to terms with one's own mortality. Having read a plethora of self help books myself, I'm happy to say that this is among my favorites. It definitely goes straight for the difficult questions and pulls no punches in the process, two things that a social life in America (where I live) these days severely seems to lack. I would recommend this book to anyone altogether.
 Not to bad of a book over all. Def tell the guy is a blogger because it started out great and slowly degraded over time to where it was just filling some pages it seemed.<br/><br/>Real good advice though, I'd recommend it
 I could not finish it. The first half was boring and common sense advice.
 Love it! A must read. The kind of book that make you think seriously about how you have conducted your life so far. Mark Manson is a no nonsense and sensitive writer.
 I enjoyed the book very much at the beginning but after page 100 it became stories and repetitive and frankly lost interest.  It started great but half way through not so great.
 Well, this book certainly challenges some of my beliefs. But that's why I read it. There's great wisdom to be gained in looking at the things we currently hold as wrong or incorrect or simply out of our mental grasp, while going within to meditate or ponder on them, just to see if we can see things maybe slightly different.
 Best book I've ever read. Really challenges your mind and helps you figure out what is important in life. Not to focus on the negative, but the good. It's the art of not giving a f*ck about dumb things that affect us. I loved this book. I recommend it to everyone!
 After eight pages of reading, I gave up. I am writing this review for those who value their time, and don't want to waste it on books that bring you down. I am a writer and my tales start with a hook to draw you in, knowing that it will end in something positive. Honestly, I gave up and so was unwilling to read until the end, in fact I was unwilling to read beyond eight pages. A writer grabs the reader with a hook of some sort. I was initially intrigued by the title. I thought it was funny and that it had a funny way of raising your spirits. Boy, I was wrong; that is, I was wrong after a few pages. It regardless of whether or not the book ends well, the author definitely did not draw me in. The lead character was an alcoholic, rude person who didn't have any interest in becoming any better. He was happy being a waste, someone who ate and died.<br/><br/>Perhaps that could be the reason for you actually getting better, but honestly, a writer shouldn't GRAB the reader with such a horrible person's life. Ugh. I understand the necessity to relax more and not be so strung out. In a library or bookstore, I might have initially grabbed the book because of the title, but I would have promptly put it back down. It taught me a lesson, though. Prior to purchasing, look at the reviews and look at the audience. For me, I say to buy another book that would immediately draw you in.
 It's ok but the language it's a bit of a turn off. Not a prude but I'm not a teenager either and have no need for the constant cursing to get the point.
 One of the best books I've ever read on finding happiness.  Especially written to appeal to the cynic.  Also hilarious on the outset. Perhaps it's not  saying much (because I rarely read fiction), but it's been at least a decade since I've gotten belly-laughs from reading.  I certainly didn't expect to laugh out loud reading non-fiction/personal development.  More than just the title is funny.  Definitely NOT for anyone offended by "foul" language.
 An engaging and Frank read. The title and adult language, although often enjoyable, came across a bit forced in places. Otherwise, this is a playful read that can help one to think about life in some very helpful black and whites.
 Listened to a section of this book on a free trial with Audible. After a few pages I knew I wanted to buy the book for all the highlighting and margin notes that I wanted to make. My wife and I use it for marriage communication support. A must read for people with FOMO, multiple calendars, or perceived expectations from others.
 Great book as long as you are not looking for some flowery smoke blown up you @@@.  Makes a lot of sense if you give it a chance.
 This book to me is based in reality. The great truths in life are both a kick in the rear as well as laughable. The author provided his own life experiences as well as logical examples. He definitely is more attuned to life and highly more intelligent then the title. The title is very FUNNY and REAL. I recommend this with a 5 star rating. I did the narration and book in sync. The narrator easily rapt my attention without my being even slightly bored or impatient.
 I like that this hard-cover was less expensive than other vendors; however, I am disappointed that the cover to the book isn't at all attached to it. It slides all over the place. I removed it, and will likely throw it out; but, it does have useful information on it (should I want to pass this along when I'm done). I see that this is likely one of the reasons it was less expensive, less time and resources put into finishing the product.
 I couldn't put it down. Mark has a way of simplifying life's problems and making you feel like a total idiot for not thinking of the solutions yourself.
 Awesome!<br/><br/>Although many of the ideas I had already learned from books and seminars, I really like the way he condenses and present his ideas. It's worth reading, I recommend it ! It's a good slapping on limiting mindsets. We consciously or unconsciously tend to give too much importance, attention, time and energy to things that at the end of the end don't matter and/or we can't control. Great message Mark!
 An essential book for the 21st century. Boy, did I need to sort things out! Without preaching, with great good humor, and with serious intent to be of help to others, Mark Manson hit it outta the park!
 Mark Manson's book is probably one of the best self improvement books out there today. It is one of those books that is truly impacting my life in meaningful way. It makes me comfortable with being uncomfortable and realize that life is not all sunshine and rainbows. You choose what struggles are going to be in your life and you may not be able to predict which ones will make you happy. The pleasure in life comes from finding what struggles you enjoy and pursue those. It made me realize what is truly important to me and my life.<br/><br/>This book caused me to analyze my life in a tough practical manner. I now question everything about myself and realize that my emotions may not dictate what is actually occurring. I have rid my life of some of the most common distractions out there, including porn, and cleaned up my diet. I have an easier time deciding what is truly important to me.<br/><br/>I am more often wrong than right and I am really not all that special of a person. That may sound harsh, but it is the truth. I think it is liberating to understand this and gives the freedom to live life how you truly want to live it. Not many self improvement books will tell you that and do it in a way that make you feel great about that fact.<br/><br/>Manson's title may be a bit vulgar (which is what drew me to it in the first place), but I think it is what people need to hear. I highly recommend picking up a copy and reading for yourself. It is a quick read but packs a punch in delightful jokingly serious manner
 Although there are a LOT of four-letter words used in this book, the philosophy behind what he writes is awesome! He is a great writer and uses humor to make some serious points about how we make ourselves miserable.
 I was initially a bit sceptical to read this book mainly because of the title but I was pleasantly surprised. The content is refreshingly direct and can really bring about a total mind shift if that is what you need. I found the book inspiring and actually apply some of the principles. Highly recommend this book - it will surprise you in a good way and makes sense of a lot of current issues facing people and society.<br/><br/>The book fizzles out a little bit right at the end, but by then the crucial points have been made.
 Once you get past the banal use of the 4- letter word, there is actually a lot of wisdom and humour in this book. Actually the gratuitous swearing seems to the point and drives it home. I will be reading it again.
 This is quite literally the best book I've read since 2013 when I read SO GOOD THEY CAN'T IGNORE YOU by Cal Newport. I was initially skeptical in picking the book up because I thought, based on the title, the book would just get the point across that you shouldn't care about other people's opinions, etc. But it doesn't really follow that thread at all. Pick it up.
 First half was good, then it just turned into a motivational book that says the F word every now and then.
 Reading Mark Manson is like hearing the truth over drinks with a friend who loves you enough to give it to you straight.
 I’m perplexed as to how this book could possibly have such a high rating. It’s terrible; don’t waste your money.
 Liked the subtle difference between fault n responsibility but everything else was anecdotal. Didn't get into necessary depths of certain key topics.
 this book is a cohesive culmination of his blog, the stories he uses are meaningful and impactful. well done mark!
 This book is exactly what I needed. I have read many self help books but never felt any of them addressed what my issues were. Then I read this book and I gained the proper perspective of how to deal with the various issues that were wearing me down. It's very counterintuitive to many self help books and that is what I loved about this book.<br/>If you have an issue with the four letter word in the title and are avoiding the book because of it, you are doing yourself a disservice. The first chapter has heavy usage of the word, but after that the book has the feel of speaking with a good friend and the use "the word" drops way off.
 Quick read, with some helpful insights but it wasn't great.
 Good for cynical young losers. Very simple, reflecting poor education of the author who seems thinking that he re-discovered America. You will find millions of crap like this in any newsagency or bookstore on "self help" shelves.
 Loved this book.  Listen to it on the way home after a long day, and it the perfect antidote. Almost as good as a beer.  Others have listened to it in the car and also loved it.
 Didn't care for this book, it seems to be written for people with low self esteem and I don't think that just reading this book will do them a whole of good.Usually they need to seek professional help. And just repeating the F word over and over doesn't really make a point.
 In life, you can't impact the world until you figure out who you are and who you want to be.  If you are open to an honest examination of your life, this book can help you figure out who you want to be and how to get there.
 Probably one of the most helpful, realistic and humorous books I've ever read. This book doesn't beat around the bush or candy-coat it for ya. This is the real truth and it smacks you in the face whether or not you like it. I love this book and I will read it again and again and again.
 Really insightful book. I've been a fan of Mark's writing ever since I came across his website earlier this year. The book feels like a tough love father-to-son talk about life and what it takes to live survive it. Many of the topics Mark talks about are enlightening and have provided me with multiple paradigm shifts. The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*** is really eye-opening and I'm definitely going to read it again. I hope this guy puts out even more books - I enjoy the way he thinks.
 Gave this book to my brother to hopefully realize he's being a selfish lazy turd. Guess what? He started turning his life around. AND he cut his long ass dreadlocks off. AND he started reading more books. He's been coming over to my house and borrowing all of my Stephen King books. Lol
 A must read for everyone.  A refreshing wake up call aka reality check.  Mark is down to Earth and the mind nor heart can deny the reality his words.<br/>He could be the President as far as I'm concerned.
 This is a great read because you will see that Mark has effectively laid out a few strategies that will ultimately lead to less stress. I've unknowingly done a lot of these things, but felt guilty and then would over-committ to everyone but myself. I see now that I need not. Great read.
 Read and ponder. Reflect on the message you are receiving, the emotion that seeps through you as you grasp a concept, nod your head in agreement and move eagerly to the next section to find out more to understand what you are learning. Read deliberately, pausing to understand, over days not hours, pacing<br/><br/>This is one book I will read more than once as I learn more. Well worth you
 Lately I've been down in a rut since my father passed and was beginning to take things too seriously, seen this book on my recommends list and figured id give it a shot....completely worth it XD
 AWESOME BOOK! He tells it like it is! As a millennial, I also hate the way the millennial generation thinks and acts and sooo many of my peers need to listen to this book and get off their high-horses.  When will people learn to stop worrying over things beyond their control??
 Great book that has helped me w/ my issues of caring too much what others think.
 So! a friend suggested this book to me because  she knows how I allow people to take advantage of me among some other things. I started reading it and it seemed cool there is just a lot of profanity which can be a little  distracting.  I have not finished the book I have moved to others but I plan to pick it up again at some point. The little I did get helped somewhat just choosing what you care about very carefully like what people think of you.......I guess....I'll  follow up once I'm done
 This book is very entertaining. I read it in about 4 hours. I just couldn't put it down. It isn't life changing or anything but it can open up your mind to different ways of thinking.
 The truth is always hard to hear, and even harder to apply. I enjoyed the deep and "in the face" images in this book. I found it refreshing and relatable. Fear is always the thing that holds us back and is the thief of joy. Stripping away all of our self made exteriors and self image leaves us humble and naked and ready for change. If you have ever felt you are living a life that is not right for you, READ this book and feel free to change it. You have choices and you alone travel your own path- so YOU make it the one you feel good about, and a life of fulfillment and joy.
 Well written, easy quick read. Great modern day self help book. I felt great after reading this; ready to take on my own life and stop comparing myself to others.
 One of my favorite anti-self help, relationship, and overall philosophy books I've ever read, I've recommended it to many people already
 Absolutely amazing book! As someone who has struggled their entire adult life with anxiety and depression, this was a very refreshing book which touched on serious issues in wonderful ways without ever feeling like the author is talking down to you. I highly recommend it, especially if you're looking for a few good laughs!
 This author is a young guy who details a lot of stories but not really fact base.  Ehhhh - a so so book.  Kind of interesting at the beginning but gets much more boring and thoughtless the second half of a book.
 Despite the title which will inevitably turn away some potential readers, this is one of the best books I've read lately and I read several books a week. Clear. Fresh. Concise. Manson nails important concepts and delivers them with clarity and wit. Highly recommended.
 Great for a Melinial about 20 years old. Good first 45 minutes and the. The wisdom of a 30 year old will be bestowed upon you.
 BEST BOOK I've read in a long time. Bought extra copies for gifts
 I like the title of this book first of all . I would say that this is a book everyone needs to read. I agree with Mark that the self-help, life coach gurus are pretty meaningless esp if they've never lived. And that's what this book is about. How to live and face your own mortality and that we have a limited time on Earth. I like that Mark gets down to the substance of how we are to deal with our own broken and messed up lives and how best to bring change in that. I love his whole thing on motivation... even if you are not motivated at first it's better to do something even if you don't feel like it to meet your goals. A great book for anyone going through life's trials or regular folks that just need some guidance and advice for regular day living.
 There's only one thing I'd like to say. Read it. I've read a lot of books in my life but this one touched a special chord. By for now, I'm about to start reading it one more time. Cheers, George Tyler.
 One of the best books I've read in this space!! ! Most books in the self help section are really dry and just boring to read. Mark's writing style is super casual and reads very easily. It's always infused with humor and is super engaging! Highly recommend for anyone open to life advice.
 I enjoyed reading "The Subtle Art" in between reps at the gym- I don't mean to make this about me, but about the time and place to read this book (anywhere and anytime).<br/><br/>The best part for me was focusing on taking responsibility for everything that happens in ones life. We don't choose for stuff to happen to us, but we certainly can decide how we are going to respond and own the situation we are in.<br/><br/>A great read for anyone looking to motivate themselves or tweak how they perceive the crazy world we live in!
 Pretty much common sense regarding boundaries, respect, integrity and commitment. Nothing earth shaking here. I'm still giving it stars because the ideas are needed in the world. Shrugs. Being an old lady who has already learned these things, I was a little bit bored.
 I read this on a whim, but was pleasantly surprised at the good points he made. I don't know that they haven't been said before in other books in other ways, but I'm tempted to read it again because some of those points bear repeating. It was a quick read.
 Pretty crappy and stupid overall. The title sold the book... not the content. Don't know if I can finish reading it.  I will likely throw it away.
 This book was a great reminder to prioritize my life and invest appropriately. Would highly recommend it to anyone allowing themselves to be pulled in too many directions.
 By far one of the best books I've ever read, thank you, Mark Manson, for his genius writing!!  It's truly an insightful and straight-forward book full of applicable life-long wisdom. Very highly recommend!!! Refreshing outlook on life and navigating it.
 Nothing new but a provocative reframe on focus.  Having recommended the book to others and compared notes, we all agree....the message doesn't leave one's thoughts.  Mark has skillfully navigated to the depths of the mind and supplanted a life changing mantra.  If you welcome change, give this a try.  You won't regret the outcome.
 This author definitely helped put things back into perspective and get me out of my rut. I would recommend it to anyone looking for help getting out of their own way.
 Excellent compelling read that I frankly found astounding coming from an author I hadn't heard about!  He communicates deeply personal and important ideas to the reader in a crystal-clear, nonconformist way; ideas that I find myself thinking about throughout the day.  Of all the books in my kindle library,  I've returned to this book again and again.
 This book has tons of great thoughts to help so many types of people let go and start over on what to care about. Super entertaining and full of great nuggets, I couldn't put it down. Went to bed late, got up early, just to keep going. Dyslexia and ADHD was just about the only thing that made it takes four days to read instead of one. So worth it.
 Mark's blog is amazing, and his first book (based on his blog) is a reflection of some of his best thoughts/essays/life advice. Highly recommend for every human, especially those interested in personal growth, self awareness, or those struggling with any kind of emotional/creative/interpersonal/professional roadblock (ie, you). One of those people whose words provide new and profound meaning every time you revisit them. He's smart, he's blunt, and he's quite funny. Like a slap in the face, followed by a hug and a self-deprecating joke. Read this book, then give it to everyone you know. The world will be a better place.
 A far deeper and more interesting read than the title implies. How the acceptance of your own death makes life sweeter and fear less impactful. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and intend to reread it every time I feel the slightest bit entitled or self-pitying. You may wish to as well.
 I have been reading Marks blogs for awhile now and he is "the self help guy" after my own heart. It is such a practical and effective way to take a look at s*** and he is profoundly witty too! Someone that can make you laugh while taking a serious look at your life/habits/views  is not someone/thing to miss out on! I promise you won't regret it!!!
 I have just finished this book. It took about a week for me to read it because I put it down a lot to let the point sink in. Some reviewers note the author's youth, but I feel that it was a real asset to the subject, and I feel grateful on Mark's behalf that his journey has been so fruitful, and more importantly, that he is so attentive. Because honestly, at 59 years old, I am just now realizing all of these things, but have not appreciated them in the way that Mark's analysis has succinctly fitted them on pages that I can read five times in a row. To say this book helped me would be an understatement. This book validates that little voice in your head, and having been validated, empowers it. My thoughts now wander among memories and the present, hunting down the values that underly all situations. Its like having been given a key at once both strange and familiar. This book has helped me stop beating myself up about a lot of stuff, hiw life turned out, and look anew at things, especially through the lense of values. So, thank you Mark for all you wne through that enabled you to write it. God bless you. Write another.
 The concepts are good, but the writing style is meh. Both my wife and I listened to the first 1/3 of it on a car ride and realized it wasn't for us after giving Mark ample time to prove himself. The concepts are there and real, but he is pretty harsh to listen to.<br/><br/>I honestly could use about 10000 less F bombs - we got the point, you are a super edgy blogger - awesome.
 Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down. I know that sounds trite but there are very few books that are this compelling a read for me. What I want to know is how did someone so young get so wise? I feel like in the few hours I spent reading it, I've gotten the gift of many years of psychotherapy. Wow. I'm going to let this all settle for a few weeks and read it again. It is that good.
 Should have read this one a long time ago. Will make you think about your life. If you are looking to change your thinking and your ways this book presents itself in  such a way you are bound  to set new boundaries and priorities.
 Read it.  Mark  Manson gets down to the basics of why we're here.  While it's stuff we all know we should be doing, for sure, but he puts it in a way that helps understand what to give a f*** about.  I totally enjoyed it, and actually read it twice.  He offers some very good examples and weaves a good story while teaching at the same time.
 At 67 I thought I had life figured out.  After many life mistakes and a failed marriage you helped me to realize more about my life and the poor values that I was adhering to.  This book help me reevaluate my life and enjoy its twist and turns and its failures and successes.  I recommend this book to young and old.
 Originally I bought this book for myself, took my time reading it and really enojoyed it. Soon after i bought a copy for my mother who has read it roughly twice by now, (picking out her favorite parts and rereading them). I've lent my copy out to at least 5 or 6 other family members who also really enjoyed it.<br/><br/>I don't read often, but when I do, it was this book and I loved it.
 Garbage, uninspiring, incoherent dribble. If you like these things, then this book is for you. How Mark Manson was able to produce 210 pages of garbage, I'm not sure. But kudos to you sir, this was obviously a money grab.
 good if you are eraly 20's and looking for a pick me up.
 "The. Most subtle thought was about negative entitlement something I have never thought about before. His expressive verb of luck this and that could turn some readers off but get past it.This a very good and insightful. book.
 Great book! I rarely write reviews but really enjoyed the authors viewpoints. Very refreshing in a culture today full of fluff.  I love the straight to the point speaking the truth as he has experienced
 Unremarkable book. Let me summarize for you: sometimes you gotta look out for yourself. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure Mr Manson is a solid dude, but you could spend the time you would reading this book doing something else. TBH I didnt finish it, but w/e.
 Great book I highly recommend that everyone should read it. It will open you mind to seeing what is really important in life.
 This was a book chosen for a book club meeting. It was hard to read through all the cus words and his personal drama. It could have just been a couple paragraphs of interesting things he learned in life.
 Fast read, layman's terms, enjoyable. Here are some more words to round out the review.  Thank you for writing this book.  Cheers!
 I have recommended and purchased this book for friends and colleagues. Mark Manson cuts through the BS and provides a practical approach to getting the most out of your life by removing most of the nonsensical thoughts and activities that cloud your days. Once you embrace this approach you will have more time to give attention to those few things that matter most and can make a difference.
 Wow, thanks Mark for dedicating so much of your soul and energy into writing a masterpiece. Seems like he could have easily added more chapters or maybe I just didn't want the book to end. I've learned about the importance of measuring your values through the correct metrics this has easily poured into areas of life that needed some introspection this is a book is must read!
 No big deal. Do not really care. I am indifferent to the causal nature of my happiness on relation to this book. So I guess it works.
 This book made me laugh out loud thought, while it also gave me a lot of ideas which are immediately applicable to my life. I have heard some of the advice given by the author from friends and family, but never in such a blunt, hilarious, and concise manner. I would recommend this as a good read to everyone who can handle a bit of profanity and is interested in a better way of life.
 Not your normal self help mumbo jumbo. A different way of looking at life. Smart. Funny. Deep. A must read.
 good book.
 A MUST READ! hysterical, funny, and refreshing read. Puts the world into perspective.. as someone in their late 20's who feels the pressure of the world today.........i recommend you take the time to read this book.
 This book really opens your eyes to how you've been living your life and helps you getting started on changing it. Mark shows that many of us have been living in some sort of entitlement in the modern world because of the need to feel great. Mark says that it's okay to be who you are. We are all going to die eventually, so are you going to live a life full of regrets? Or are you going to face your fears and do what you've always wanted to do?
 This is a book that I'm definitely going to read again to absorb even more of the thoughts within. Mark has a solid way of reminding us that our actions are our responsibility no matter what happens to us, and that choice is what gives us freedom. Filled with raw and honest examples from his own life, he makes his story relatable and shows the struggles he went though, as we all do.
 It was the title that caught my eye - but after reading it - I didn't find anything that jumped out - so perhaps I should have given a @&amp;$/
 The only good thing about this book is its sensationalist title, which was to be expected since its author has a blog, it does not say anything useful that you have not noticed before about society.
 The work is brilliant, well-written (in a colloquial way), and deeply informed by reading, expetience and insight. The lamentable title will keep this book out of the hands of many who could benefit by it, though.
 Love this book! It's an easy read and addictive too.<br/><br/>A must read for anyone with a restless monkey mind.
 This is a paradigm shifting book, that is perfect to shake the usual self help crowd out of its coma.<br/><br/>This book has many new idea. It's most powerful message is that life will involve some pain, and that we shouldn't deny it or be victimized by it, but instead solve the source of pain. And that is what makes us happy.<br/><br/>I read too many books in this genre, and this is the first in a while that I couldn't put down.
 Great read. Challenged the premises and assumptions of my beliefs. The book changed the course of my life.
 I like this book, I have sampled the slimmed down version of this book and compared I would recommend the full version everyday. This version gives full detailed examples of what the author is talking about.
 I have given this to my family members as my loving XMAS gift.<br/><br/>The youth receives the message directly but the book is for the mature adult in you.  Impressive and perhaps life changing for many!
 I was listening to the Brilliant Idiots podcast with Charlamagne the God and Andrew Shultz​ including the infamous Mark Manson. They said the book was good so guess who is now reading the book? This guy! Great buy and the package came on time.
 The title caught my attention. There's a lot to learn in this book moreso about Values and how we see ourselves.
 Thought it was a great book and took a lot from it. Moral is to only care about the things that matter in your life and block out the meaningless events.
 Wow...this book is DEEP! It is an excellent read. Makes you rethink what really matters to you in this life.
 Great book more people should read it people are so caught up in keeping up with the jones' and now with Facebook it's even worse..... the book makes you feel ok to be the way you are if that makes any sense
 The book started out interesting but then the content changed into typical self help stuff. Kind of disappointing.
 Decent book if your needed a little push to stand up for what you believe in and making more time for yourself.
 Great insight, and the author is great at using "everyday" language to communicate "don't sweat the small stuff." I enjoyed the slang he used because it's a serious topic.
 Mark Manson is an excellent writer, and I really enjoyed his book.  It's not your typical self-improvement book, and I found that refreshing.  I would recommend this book to others.
 This is a must-read, especially for those that need an alternative view on things. This was humorous to listen to, and I’m already loooking forward to listening to it again. Really appreciated this book and it’s message.
 Great book. Legitimately bought it 3 times. Once on Audible then I bought two physical copies to give as gifts. May buy another one because it's my favorite book that I've read in years and I just need a copy on my shelf.
 This book is not about telling you how to live life and improve yourself. It is more about enlightenment and helping you become aware. It will not teach you a skill you don't know or a secret formula for a perfect life, but it will show you the flaws in certain thought processes.
 Thank you Mark Manson for sharing your unique thoughts and experiences - a great success in my opinion. I rarely devour a book in one sitting. If honesty and truthful bluntness is something you value, this book will likely hit it out of the park for you as it did for me.
 It took me a few sittings to finish, but it was an easy read.  The ideas sound rather counterintuitive first.  There are certainly a lot of entitlement mentality to go around these days.  While a lot of examples are hinted at the genY, the philosophy is broadly useful for all ages.  I truly hope the ideas in this book can help a few more of us to get more serious s*** done
 As usual, good quasi-spiritual content in a highly non-spritual language from Mark. Although a bit philosophic in nature, the book manages not to fly too far away in the land of abstraction and is well-grounded in the daily life by excellent (and interesting!) real-life examples, anecdotes and stories, sometimes supported by actual scientific research.
 For the past three months I've been in a slump. I was having a concoction of negative emotions rushing over at any given moment. I didn't know if I was coming or going. I was all over the place in my personal life. This book was a right and exact, ram in the bush type of book for me. I heard that we don't choose the books we read, the books choose us! Great Book!!! I'm glad it found me!!!
 Good information throughout. The writer is talented with the ability to give simple information in a fashion that sill surprises you.  I have no complaints. Worth the purchase.
 Truly counterintuitive to the current popular approaches for ”attaining” happiness.  He brings readers back to basic concepts, touching on essentials such as honesty, trust, a new a new and an openness to failure.
 This is a magnificently insightful and entertaining book.<br/>I think this book will leave an impression in my life for some time.
 For what I consider a self help book, this book was very readable. Interspersed with anecdotes and comedic segments, I just couldn't stop reading it. Normally I have to force myself to finish this type of book.<br/><br/>Mr. Manson is an incredible author.  The book connected with me on a personal level and helped me be more self aware.  The book covers a wide range of topics but it transitions so smoothly between them that it reads like a novel. I recommend this book to everyone
 Great book. Can change your perspective on things. The writting style of the author is straight forward and not filtered just the way it should be.
 I've come a long way. From obnoxious to slightly less so. This book helps. Its about living life not becoming the best but seeing life as is and living it. Strong recommend.
 Wow!  This writer has such wisdom and insight into the nature of why we humans do the things we do. Very inspiring in his writing and looking forward to more books by this author.
 For me, the book started off interesting, then it became hilarious, then it just spun out of control, not really making much sense. The author incriminates himself with false humility and false forthrightness that instead of building credibility, only served to make me go “yuck”.
 I have read a lot of Mark's short stories before this book came out. Already being hugely surprised by Mark's approach to people life issues I have read this book in one sitting. Never thought the view on life can be from such an angle. This book makes other motivational and inspirational books look like infants going in the wrong direction.
 I don't totally know why this is "self help."  There are no real ah ha moments in this book.  It's basically the author saying hey learn from my mistakes.  It's entertaining though.
 If you take away one or two ideas from this book and apply them to your life it's worth the read. I plan to practice a couple for life not fearing when the end will be.
 I need to go sit on a cliff, too. Thank you for putting all of the BS we all go through on paper to read and think about. Thought process definitely changed.
 The author's language is a bit misogynistic for my taste, but he makes some great points about learning to let go.
 The author uses the F word a lot in the first couple of chapters but he gets over it. Some good suggestions in here. If you can handle the F word, read the book.
 Buddhism fused with Gen-X sensibilities, which in and of itself is a Gen-X sensibility.  Interesting, but not necessarily new or revelatory.
 The premise of this book is that people should not waste life by aspiring to unrealistic goals. We should examine our lives and find the joy in them and not waste ourselves trying to emulate others.<br/>However the subject is beaten to death. The author's repetitious examples detract from his message.<br/>Other readers may find this a worthwhile book, but I felt it missed the mark.<br/>Warning: If you are offended by the " F bomb" you may want to avoid this book.
 Good insight and diffiently a different way to view and look at life and situations. Good approaches to keep in mind as q guide during difficult times in your life.
 I finished reading it, but I learned nothing :-(
 About as good as it gets. This book nailed it in every respect.  This book breaks one's identity down to its most unpleasant and darkest realities before giving the deeper, true meanings of life that one can then internalize in order to build themselves up, and start anew.
 Good collection of thoughts and stories from life to death, oneness to noneness. The author questions how we make choices, whether it is always useful to avoid pain and reject negative emotions. Are we all biased towars positiveness and believe in general, superficial norms of what success and happiness is? Do we really know what we need and chose for it? Or do we forget to live in our own reality and make choices based on what we were thought and told was right.
 Poorly written. Contradicts himself constantly. A few good points. Over all not worth the effort of reading.
 I am by no means a bookworm, but I was drawn to this book from following Mark's blog. Truly enjoyed this read. It's honest, thought-provoking and funny. It also has a lot of non-bulls*t tools to improve your perspective and focus in life. Would highly recommend to anyone.
 Although the author seems to based most of his philosophy on the novel (movie) fight club the book does shows very interesting points. Leaving a side the sensationalist title this book is full with valuable content going throughout the author's life experiences and metallica's anecdotes.<br/><br/>If you want to have a good laugh but at the same time question your own existence in this world then this book is for you.
 I couldn’t finish this book.  After maybe 100 pages I felt like a teenager, who’s had nothing interesting or real ever happen to them, was spewing life lessons at me.  The language is juvenile and distracting from what might be some (very few) intriguing thoughts.  His “examples” and pretty much any reference to or stories about females are insulting and derogatory.
 Books should be good. Not all great books should be written by scholars, professors, doctors or gurus.<br/><br/>I bought this book for my 21 year old son stationed in Japan. When it came I decided to read it and I'm glad I did. I then thought it would also suit my 15 year old son as it fits him more closely than the older one though both will no doubt get some great insight from this book.<br/><br/>The information in here are the exact things I have thought myself- to be positive without being overly positive. To learn from your experiences and to learn what's most important to care about in life and let the rest fall away. Not giving an F about stupid stuff like how you appear to others that don't really matter, stop carrying around your parents baggage and to know when to move on. This subtle art is something we all need to relearn and will do a great justice for humanity if we did. I have never heard of this aurthor before but I'll certainly be looking up his futur works.<br/><br/>He gives great examples, quotes, studies etc. to make already valid, common sense points. It's easy and fun to read and I recommend every  15-60 year old read it. If you are someone who wants to understand the law of attraction, how a negative can be a positive get this book. You won't be able to put it down.
 I read Mark's blog for the longest time so when I saw this book I decided to give it a shot.  His writing style in the book is the same as the blog and the book doesn't disappoint.
 Awesome!!
 If you're looking for a spiritual/emotional book without the BS then look no further. Nothing in this book that I took objection to, except maybe that the author is from my least-favorite American town (kidding!) a great starter for anyone who's just getting back up after fall.
 An utter waste of time. If you've read any business book or attended an annual business conference in the last decade, you already know every illustrative "example" that Mr. Manson presents. In addition, he repeats his opening premise again, and again, to the point where you want to scream at him, "Do you think I'm stupid?? Get to the point, man!" I imagine that as blog posts, each piece could be valuable, coming back to a central theme of the blog. But as a book, it's rubbish.<br/>Then comes the arrogant moralism: "You are responsible for dealing with everything that has happened to you." Mr. Manson tries to split semantical hairs; e.g., others are "to blame," but you are "responsible." But as he gives no account at all of the massive psychological damage that childhood abuse does to rational decision-making, it ends up being just more "Dr. Laura/Phil-ultra-conservative-punditry-masquerading-as-therapy" claptrap. (One wonders what a licensed mental health medical professional might have suggested as edits.)<br/>Victims of abuse are not inherently capable of making the same rational decisions that others take for granted. That's kinda why it's called "abuse." It takes intensive therapy—and yes, significant effort on the abused—to get to a place where the abused can trust others, and make better decisions with long-term impacts.<br/>Also, there is the repeated insistence that the author "gives no f—," about what he's written, while ignoring the fact that purposefully completing the process of writing, editing, publishing and promoting an actual bound &amp; printed book is prima facie evidence of "giving a f—." Mr. Manson fatally wounds his only positive argument.<br/>Lastly: dude, you probably need to talk to someone about your obsession with sex. It's a little icky. Again: blog posts ≠ book.<br/>There are so many superior alternatives if you're looking for how to deal with OCD, anxiety (especially modern, tech-driven anxiety) or past abusive relationships. If you number among those unfortunate people (Hi, and welcome!), it is _not_ your fault, and things do get better, with work and qualified help. But this book will set you back several paces; you don't need the stress.
 This is a full-fledged book from M's most popular blog post--and it fully rocks!
 Very happy with the prompt delivery of the book! I was able to read a sample snipet of it and just had to order it. Excited to be able to take it all in
 In all honesty, I absolutely LOVE THIS BOOK! This book is as blunt as it gets. If you're ever feeling down and need a pick me up, definitely read this book. It really spoke to me a lot and had me thinking about how I can improve my lifestyle and look to make better choices for myself.
 Simply amazing. It's a mash up of all the concepts I've been trying to simplify and embrace.  I truly enjoyed this book and feel like I've learned alot.
 I really hated this book. I forced myself to read the entire book to make sure there wasn’t something I was missing. Perhaps, it just want the book for me. It seemed like a memoir and very self-serving (and it all made sense once he describes the death of his friend at the end of the book.) This is one time where the “hype” of a book got the best of me and I clicked buy.
 Once you get past the salty language, really is it necessary? The book is okay, just okay. I haven't even been able to finish it and I am one of those readers that can't seem to put a good book down til it's finished so what does that say?
 Mark does an excellent job of stripping away the superficial and frivolous layers that we unconsciously add on to ourselves, in a funny and witty way, through his own experience and from the lessons of many great people throughout history. Some of the realizations brought up in this book can be hard to swallow but once digested, it helps to bring about real change by changing your perspective. Short yet amazing read, highly recommended!
 Funny, refreshingly candid and irreverent, substantive and thought provoking-this is a wonderful read.  Started reading it because I was intrigued by the title, then couldn't put it down.  Have shared it with friends and clients and will continue to do so.  Hope to someday meet Mark Manson and continue the discussion as I feel as though, reading this book, we have started an important conversation.  Grateful!
 I've been looking into ideas from the Stoics, and Buddhism, and here is a great book that takes their ideas, and adds in a bit extra practicality and a lot of extra language, haha. I loved it, and I think everyone should read it.
 Maybe you caught the whiff of the understanding that you'll find has just been under your nose the whole time, but this time it is from the pages of this book (or your greasy phone screen?). What I lived about this book is just that, things I knew on a deeper level, or from those long silent moments by myself, but this time with Mark's eloquent and profane writing! Thanks Mark for this book that I know I'll be returning to several times in my life :)
 I used to think I was the type of person who did not give a f*** about things that weren't important. When I saw this book I thought I could learn some new ways to up my game. Boy, did I learn a lot about myself. I am an amateur at the sport. I worry about way too many things I have no control over. Reading this book is like sitting down with a good friend and he spills it out for you. This book is all meat and potatoes. There are some parts where he seems to ramble off subject, but it is still worth the read.
 I can easily see the attraction of this book. It lacks depth, depth from any new perspective that will honestly help anyone with their emotional advancement, or anything close to a good life. It touches on many half truths adopted by Buddhism and other sources of gum-drop metaphysics. It uses old outdated models such as Buddhism and current psychology to make points aligned with an adolescent viewpoint. A perspective where people should accept pain as a part of everyday life, relegates dreaming to fantasies not best indulged because it incites pain, forget about the future, (where the future is the source of all healing) diminish the values of emotion, create a set of “acceptable values”, rather than values based in one’s personal character. Like most self help books, it is filled with “half-truths” which can create more problems over a longer period for people. The author also states, Happiness as in unsolvable equation, (which it is easily solved when you know what it is). He also states, “suffering is a sign of growth”, when clearly suffering is the function of a lack of growth and change. Pain is something to release, not carry with you. He makes a multitude of sophomoric statements, “life is meant to be an”Iterative” process.” This is ridiculous. If you are repeating ANY patterns you are essentially living in the past. Patterns are there simply for one to gain understanding in where they are not evolving, they are meant to be released, the sooner the better.  “No man steps in the same river twice, for it’s not the same river and he is not the same man.” Heraclitus<br/>He made two positive points, commitment is the path to greater freedom, and values are something a person needs to operate from. Although he didn’t understand how to incorporate the values. Values are how an adult decides on what they will and will not do, they are the positive boundaries which we choose to operate from. They are individual and subjective and when wisely chosen will be ideals, so that they are never changed. If you change your values, how can you be trustworthy? If you deeply relate to this book, you are operating as an adolescent, regardless of your age. Adulthood is a conscious transformational choice from adolescence to adulthood. If you don’t understand that, and cannot make a choice like that, you can only operate from the past.  (Child or adolescent, not adult) This author’s greatest transformational moment was at 19 when his friend died, which could only be transformative, and not transformational. Our greatest challenge in society right now is the lack of adults on this planet. Look at the world, it seems high school all over again, just like this book. Most of the world is in adolescent, including the author. Sadly, I’m not surprised this is a best seller.
 Bought this book for my son, he loves the author's insight about life and the who, what, when, where and how on this world's misdirection.
 The message may be good and true, but I can't get myself past the writing style. It's probably my fault for a) not checking out the author in advance or b) paying more attention to the title of the book, but Mark has trouble writing an unobnoxious sentence.<br/><br/>Comes off like a frat boy rant - whatever value is in the message is lost in the umpteenth F bomb per page. Pass.
 Some pages look normal, some page were put in the book upside down. Sending back or another copy. Will update then.
 Very good read. Makes you rethink and reconsider a lot of things in life in a way that makes you wonder how you hadn't thought of it yourself. Well done, in my opinion.
 Hilarious to read and also uncomfortable. Disappointment Panda is worth the price of the book alone. Although the author rails against life coaching and self improvement, he reaches the same goals. Constant growth and therefore happiness.
 Clear and clearly written. Some statements could have sounded as platitudes, but the author takes care to properly unpack them. Would definitely recommend.
 The book starts out fresh with promise and humor, and tackles some interesting points about entitlement.  However, I felt that each chapter iterated the same point one too many times, and I was a little exhausted by the end.  There was also a lot more about relationships than I had expected, and I felt that Mark belabored that section too much.  The last chapter is potent and very well written, with a bit more emotion and conviction than the rest.
 Half way through and obsessed!
 Reading this book may open your eyes not to be so involved in the cattle of society and be at peace with your choices and your own path in life.
 Some funny bits, some annoying bits. I spend equal times wanting to thank the author and then wanting to punch him in the face. Still, an important read.
 Really? Obviously, from the title Mark Manson aims to shock but after page 3, the f-bomb is merely a nuisance. Add to that the unfortunate timing of his juvenile throw-ins regarding women and sex, and I am left thinking who is the audience for this book? I don't know too many eighteen year old males willing to read an entire book about ANYTHING and most any other reader probably would conclude as I did: WHY DID I WASTE MONEY BUYING THIS BOOK?<br/>I bought this book spontaneously - a mistake I'll do my best avoid next time.
 I don't have anything clever to say about this book. If you are looking to question yourself and grow as a person this may be the best book I've ever read in that regard.
 I usually hate vulgarity, but Mark Manson is hilarious and this is the kind of book you could read over and over again.  I feel everyone could enjoy it, from spiritual old-timers to teenagers with an 8-second attention span.  He's humble and thought-provoking in a refreshing laid back kind of way.  A true pleasure.
 When I first read the title I didn't know what to think or expect, I am not one to throw the f word around but this book is one that I couldn't put down. I hope everyone reads it and takes it in. I will be sending it to many as gifts. Great writing, stories and life lessons.
 Great book and read. Would definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for ways to de-stress from their daily lives and live more freely.
 This book is poorly written. There a few good points as from most self-help books, but it's really not anything special. Stopped reading as soon as the author started coming off as an addict undergoing existential crisis. It stood out to me that a lot of people in his life are either crazy(women) or cowardly(men). The author used a lot of philosophy from Buddhism to sustain his points, however he might have learned it from unreliable internet sources. I hope he thinks he is out of his existential crisis.
 I bought this book because it intrigued me - and who can't use more help learning what to care about or give an f about? I really bought it for my husband who is very stressed out at work right now, but I read it in two days. So, yeah it spoke to me.  I read it in two days. It gave me some insight into what plagues our society today and why - that was an unexpected bonus.
 Nirvana is above everything. Zen Meditation takes you there.
 I've been reading a few of 'these' books recently. I really appreciated "the Untethered Soul." I've been focusing on my journey inward -- why can't I seem to find satisfaction in the little things, why does it take a significant event to make me feel something. I feel overstimulated by the world and all the people and events I'm so arbitrarily 'connected' to. This book helped me understand that I'm too caught up in my head. Hopefully it pushes me to act, to inspire and motivate myself into more action. I loved the parts on victimhood chic (my entire news feed, all the time), romantic love, and taking responsibility for everything that happens to us: we aren't to blame, but we're still responsible for our choices, our reactions to events and how we allow them to affect us. The cursing in the beginning is definitely a bit cheesy, and sometimes he says thing you think you already know. Maybe it's just nice to hear them again from a guy who doesn't think he's more special than the next guy. It definitely showed me a practical definition of entitlement that gives me more to work with than some person in the comments section of some post online telling us we're all entitled. It made me realize that my values have been more than a little messed up in the past but that's aight, even good. Now I can choose and develop the values I really want. Maybe it won't change your life, but this book will make you think. Recommended to my friends.
 I agree with most of his views, it’s interesting and inspiring to read your thoughts out loud or to be introduced to many of the truths in this book if you haven’t learnt them on your own already<br/><br/>Not my favorite style of writing though
 So far the book is good . We'll packaged
 Highly recommend!  Makes you think about how you're living your life and the choices you make and everything going on in the world. Definite read.
 Can’t tell if it’s his voice but I just couldn’t get into the book at all. Sad disappointment.
 Worth the read! Practical and funny, really puts life in perspective. I will recommend this book to everyone I know.
 Every life lesson you wish you got growing up, but probably didn't, reinforced with a no-BS, in-your-face directness and real life stories. No beating around the bush or intellectualizing here - Mark cuts to the truths about what it takes to THRIVE vs. merely survive in the world we've created and busts our illusions about it all. This should be required reading for the human race!
 Being a Mark Manson fan for a few years now, I recognized parts of the book as being reiterated from the blog, but nonetheless it’s a great book.<br/>  If you expect advice on how to become an indifferent and insensitive person who feels good about themselves no matter what, prepare to be disappointed. The book is essentially the opposite - a wake-up call to be honest with yourself and live in accordance with healthy core values.<br/>  In today’s age of social media when we are constantly exposed to extremes and fake personas, we tend to forget our self-worth and pursue shallow ambitions in order to feel special in some way, we feel entitled to receive special treatment and get easily offended. In this sense, the book is a much needed slap in the face for the current social context.<br/>  Mark Manson offers practical advice to deal with life’s adversity in a way that few do anymore : by stating uncomfortable truths. He supports his philosophy with a neat mix of scientific studies and personal experience, not being afraid to show his own vulnerability, which is a rare thing nowadays.<br/>  I think if more of us would actually internalize these ideas and live by them, the world might just become a better place.
 great read, awesome perspective changer.
 It was okay......I did not learn anything new that I did not know....but he is a good writer, and I enjoyed reading it......
 After reading his blog post on this topic I knew I had to buy the book immediately! This book is easily in my top 5 of books read! You'll want to reread chapters to really understand his perspective on things. The slight bits of humor mixed into this book also makes it enjoyable to read. Absolute must read!
 A laugh or two is guaranteed. A lot of questioning and reflecting on your life a consequence. I found this book brilliant.
 I read this book  directly after ready Shonda Rhimes "Year of YES" . I highly recommend not only this book but the two together. This was the kick start I needed to take the power of my life back. You can too!
 It will be a while before I find another book as good as this one. I truly enjoyed reading it.
 The very end even drew a slight tear. Read it. It will make you reevaluate everything about your life and inspire you to look for better ways to live.
 Great book 👍🏼🔥
 Good book interesting view. Enjoyable read. I would recommend this book. Well priced too overall 5 stars. Very well put together.
 First half is very good. Second half is a bit preachy.
 This book was informative and insightful for anyone looking to change their perspective on how life works. I recommend this book for anyone struggling with their identity or how they should approach life.
 This is a book that was quickly written....after a long time of contemplation. It shows a great distilled wisdom of we are all in the same boat, quit worrying so much, because your worry is the burden.
 Not what i was expecting. Felt like it repeated itself a lot.
 Can get over a page without taking notes...The author really killed it this time!! Mr Manson...YOU ARE THE MAN!!!!
 I absolutely love this book! Manson is so insightful and he really doesn't care whether what he writes will make people mad or not. Which is good because what he writes is very honest and helpful.
 not gunna go into detail inthis one but it is a good reminder on what to focus on in life. Its a quick and easy read so get it and read it.
 Mark Manson is a very interesting writer.  I am going to read this book over for he provides a lot of insight living.
 Mark Manson wrote a compelling story that was underpinned with one important truth: better values = better life.<br/>Once you stop judging yourself and others based on unhelpful values, you can harness that to become a better person for yourself.<br/><br/>Finding and accepting those better values is the hard part, but Mark sets it up for you to think for yourself and go from there.
 Rather than not caring about anything, this book helped me realize the value and empowerment in choosing what to care about.  I will have to read it again and develop an action plan (about the only thing I feel is missing from the book) but it really helps develop a new view on life.  Will read again and would definitely recommend to self-help enthusiasts.
 I loved this book. Mark is direct and to-the-point and gives advice that resonates with anyone who struggles to prioritize life, find peace, and figure out their purpose.
 I felt that while this book was a great read, sometimes the meaning was lost by how many times he uses the "F" word. I gave it a high ranking because I felt there were a lot of great insights and concepts that I needed to hear. I love that it isn't the typical self-help book telling you that you are a snowflake deserving of happiness despite your inability to take action or responsibilities. It's OK to learn from pain.
 Great read!
 No, seriously..... go read it.
 Came highly recommended from son-in-law for my post spine surgery recovery.  Looking forward to digging in.
 I've followed Mark Manson for a few years and love everything he writes. This book is no exception to that. Mark boils a "happy" life down to the values we are willing to suffer for, not positivity or a sense of entitlement about being "happy." Manson correctly diagnosis's us as creatures in a perpetual state of suffering and pain, not beings that can obtain a state known as happiness.<br/><br/>Throughout the book Manson balances humor, tough love, and grounded insight to create the best "non-self help" book I've encountered.<br/><br/>Please read if you have trouble being happy, feel entitled to happiness, are terrible at boundaries in your relationship, or most importantly like the F word.
 Much of this book gave me new insight but much also validated the way I have already chosen to live. To pick my battles wisely. To refocus my perspective. To let go.
 If you need to reprogram the way you view the world, read this book and apply these points to your life. Everything resonates, and you will find the truth is impossible to deny.
 Pretty good liked the need to acknowledge the darker side of human nature. A balanced view of things surly means both pos and neg are taken into account. This the real world.
 I am a 32 year old working Mother in a high pressure sales job who is already anxious by nature.  Pile on all the duties of parenting, other familial/ social responsibilities, closing deals so I can put food on the table, keeping my romantic relationship "interesting", staying in good health, and trying to make it all look instagram ready nearly leveled me.<br/><br/>At first it was the title that got my attention and i though "what kind of A-hole writes a whole book about noy giving an F?". I read a sample and in 30 seconds I was hooked.  I downloaded it, the audio and the cliff notes and ate it up in a day or two.  In the first week I read it twice.  It's been a couple months now.  I still refer back to chapters 2-3 times a week.<br/><br/>I love this book.  I think it might have saved my life, not that I was going to harm myself, but I am pretty sure it saved me from high blood pressure and becoming shrewd and lonely.  And now things do seem easier.
 I really thought this was a good read. He made some very good points and helped to keep life in perspective.  Good job and worth the time.
 Loved the candidness of the book, take it a step further and listen to it on Audible, the narrator is excellent.
 Just excellent. Really liked this book and the way it is written. It is really straightforward and to the point.
 Written for an immature male.
 The story behind the book is inspiring. Some points don't "hit home" as hard as they could.  May be unnecessary clutter or distraction in certain areas. Overall a good story.
 I recommend this book to everyone questioning where they're going with their life and to everyone else as well. I stumbled upon this book when I was having quite a crisis and this book really opened my eyes and made me see my crisis in a whole different way.<br/>Really well written and easy to read.
 Humorous and helpful perspective on how to live your life. I gifted it to friends and family after I enjoyed reading it.
 Mark is a funny storyteller. This book is great. I would recommend to anyone that is soul searching
 very simple and effective advice, the author seems wiser beyond his years, this man has experienced a lot of self reflection, honestly and grace, we should all aspire to living our lives while honoring ourselves by using the advice in this book
 Great work from Mark Manson for who is used to read his blog/site for many years. It's a great compilation/work envolving plenty of critical topics to make us better persons. I use some of his advices in a daily basis since I came to work to Middle Est. Keep up the good work Mark and we are waiting for the next book already. Best Regards.
 This was a really good book, one I'll likely read from time to time in the future.  There's nothing earth shattering here, and there's not meant to be.  It's a quiet, entertaining and somewhat irreverent uncommon sense look at how we all try to cover everything, and really we just need to let a lot of thing fall by thereabouts and focus on what's really important.  That's the gist, but the book goes into good detail breaking things down and spelling it out.<br/>I've already recommended this to most of my friends.  I'm really glad I bought it for myself.
 The book is a little bro-tastic but still provides insights that have stayed with me in my daily life.
 This is the best book I've ever read. It has literally changed my life and I can't recommend it enough.
 Mark has created a wittingly presented, at  times humorous and quote thought provoking exploration of life and the challenges that we create for ourselves sometimes positive and often negative depending on our self awareness levels,  A great read!
 A helpful attitude adjustment. Pick what you are worried about very carefully. Most of the stuff we worry about does not really matter.
 Read this book if you are unsure about anything going on in your life at the moment. Answers can be found through asking the simplest of questions.
 Must read!
 It was a good book, had some nice nuggets of knowledge in it for sure. Overall, not an incredibly amazing book but well worth the read.
 Despite the frequent use of the f word this book touched me in several of my long held insecurities. For That I am grateful. Do yourself a favor and rad this book.
 At the beginning it takes time to grasp your attention but the author has many life points and lessons that should be considered in everyone’s life.
 Me gusta el acercamiento que autor hace al tema de los valores y nos lleva a meditar sobre lo que realmente queremos de la vida especialmente en un mundo actual descontextualizado y lleno de subvalores
 The F word is actually two things, worrying and caring. Once the author establishes his point on over obsessing, over thinking, and other psychological issues we have and don't realize it, how things can change once we gain perspective.<br/><br/>Book is really good. Give it a read.<br/><br/>Thank you Mark Manson!!!
 I was skeptical, because the title suggests it might be a mean and cynical book, but it actually explains some deep concepts of life in a welcoming, light hearted way. It made me change my attitude, and remember many of the lessons I've learned and forgotten.
 Bought this for the husband as a bathroom read. He hasn't complained, so I'm thinking he likes it.
 Great common sense guide to life. I'm recommending this  book to everyone and will be giving it as graduation gifts for the foreseeable future. I have a 13 year old and wish there was a version of this book for him. Maybe some day. Until then, I will do my best to teach him this way of life.
 BEST BOOK EVER! Don't miss the opportunity...read it!!! Told my husband he had to read it since I did...life is too short!
 Can't comment as the recipient who asked for this book hasn't said  anything about it.
 Perfect approach to life.  A little vulgar at times, but a cornucopia of life skills.  Teaches us what matters and what doesn't
 Started out great but fizzled with the last three chapters.
 I've read many, many self improvement books and it is a long time since I read one that provided so many useful new insights. While the language is (presumably deliberately) course, the messages and insights are excellent, and very relevant to today's media / instant gratification driven world. I recommend it to all ... both young and old.
 I wish I could buy 100 and hand out as party gifts. Stocking stuffers... graduation gifts... wedding gifts...
 Stylistic: i liked the various times he goes into rant mode or uses slangs; it makes it more alive and dynamic.<br/><br/>Story: I think I needed it at that time in my life to figure out a couple things. The whole book is peppered of useful reminders and actual advices. It sure seems easy when you read it but is a heck of a work to implement.
 Simply put, this is something you have to just read to experience.  It made me cringe with self reflection at times.  That is the real intention of this book.  Give it a go if you are brave enough.
 Interesting perspective on things and loved reading it. Tells things straight forward.
 Let me just save you a ton of money. No, Mark Manson is not Buddha nor is he Jesus Christ, but he DID accurately and succinctly sum up roughly 5 years of my much needed therapy sessions into this one small book. Feel like your life is a mess and you don't know where to turn? Start with this book first, THEN go get a therapist. There, I just saved you about $5K.<br/><br/>Yes, he says the f-word a lot, more so in the beginning of the book than near the end, probably to try and grab your attention. I don't care - it's what I hear in my workplace every day, it's what I hear from my friends all the time when we are sitting around in a bar having a beer. It's real. And so is his approach to life in this book. This is no "everyone can do anything and be incredibly happy for their entire lives" book; it's an honest look at what REAL life is, not the romanticized, happy, rainbows and unicorns drivel that we've been brought up with in the USA.<br/><br/>I've read this once; I'm going to now read it again and make a "Cliff's notes" version I can carry around with me and read - often. He seriously needs to sum up all the principals he talks about into a little cheat sheet that you can carry in your wallet and glance at whenever you are about to screw up your life again. Real talk - for real people. I loved it.<br/><br/>And if you think he's just spouting inanities that he made up, you can think again. The principals he outlines (again, succinctly) come from being widely read and internationally experienced. I don't know about you, but I don't really want to read Socrates, Freud, and Nietzsche - boring! But Mark uses humor to get some of their points across, and for me, the humor was what made it an interesting, quick read.<br/><br/>Mark's been blogging for years and I've always enjoyed his blogs; but for a first book, he did a great job of summing up a lot of his thoughts in one place.
 I would write a lengthy review, but I have other fcks to give. It's a good book, just read/listen to it.
 Staying true to his form, Mark Manson gives a metaphorical open hand slap to your self-awareness, expectations, and ideas on self and life in general.  Sprinkled throughout the anecdotes are Mark's fantasticly correlated comments on the backing sciences, making this book a great combination of relatable tales, sarcastic humor, educational content, and a much needed shake to one's perspectives.
 The book has virtually nothing to do with the title - very misleading.  One or two chapters were worth a read but the remainder was a waste.
 First ofall, I thought this book would be a philosophical book on how to not care. At all.  Its not exactly that. But thats totally not a bad thing. I found this to be a great book and most things made a lot of sense to me.
 An insightful, honest and empowering book that strips away a lot of nonsense we encounter in life. I intend to immediately re-read.
 Seriously... stop giving a F#*$ what people think &amp; start creating.<br/><br/>That's the big message &amp; takeaway from this. Be you, live your authentic self, &amp; share you voice with the world that the universe intended it to be.<br/><br/>Then when you do that, you'll attract the audience that you were meant to lead.<br/><br/>Mark's funny antics, stories, &amp; lessons are something that will leave you entertained, inspired, &amp; fired up to go give your own version of the middle finger to the world around you. I mean that in a good way too. ;)<br/><br/>Go grab a copy &amp; be sure to show it some love by leaving it an honest review too. If you hate it, be sure to tell Mark as I'm sure he'll appreciate the irony here...<br/><br/>- Kyle,<br/>Founder, ...]
 Lost interest
 This is an amazing provocative read. The insights it offers literally blew my mind! It is a MUST-READ book!
 What can say with a title like this. No you wouldn’ t go wrong with this book.
 Just started reading. Am already on same page as the writer. He's got a point.
 The only thing missing from this book is a maturity the author will gain as he ages beyond his current late youthful period.
 GREAT book!!  I feel like everyone should read this.  It could be a much better world out there.
 Everyone should be encouraged to read this book. Good life advice, and fun to read.
 Top notch.
 It starts with too many Fs, and it was kinda getting really annoying, but then it turn ok. I like it for a simple reason his approach was a non-charlatan way of thinking. Good read.
 This is a great book. This book was a good wake up call for me and at some points was very hard to read because I felt like I was being slapped in the face with reality. This book made me take a really hard look at my life and the way I see things, I think I have learned more about myself and my actions from this book than I have in my last 3 years of therapy sessions.
 Very funny, could have used some editing as use of F... became redundant.  Otherwise fun to read and think about how you get concerned over nothing very important.
 Not just another tedious f-word-fest, this is a genuinely useful tool for adjusting your personal screen.
 Jesus. My cat could write better.
 Simply profound! This book makes you reevaluate what's important in life to "You"! The title draws you in, but the content keeps you there.
 well written - everybody should read and follow the instruction - specially Trump
 Eye opening. Has definitely made my life easier after reading this book.
 Loved it!  Don't be thrown off by the title, read the book and you'll understand that its about being selective with what you want to care about.  Very liberating philosophy!
 Very much enjoyed this. Thought provoking, and insightful. Easy to comprehend and life changing if applied. Also, very entertaining and fun.
 Why should I care what you think of this book. I don't give a ......
 Good advice that will help you improve your life and relationships. Good concepts to follow in life, no BS or snake oil, mainly because it's all based on years of authors own experience and real life failures and learnings.
 LOVED IT. Must read.
 I laughed, I cried, and I gave up a few misguided f***s in the process. Thank you for sharing your story.
 Love this book. It’s one of the few I’ve paid for in recent years. 😝
 It's so obvious what we need to do, but no one has the balls to tell us. Well, this book has completely changed my views on how to live... or, more accurately , how to not to  love. Bravo Manson, bravo.
 First 7 chapters were ok, evident and at the same time kinda healing. The end seemed too pathetic and draggy
 As an avid reader of Mark Manson's blog, I couldn't wait to buy this book. It was exactly what I expected and a much needed wake-up call/affirmation on where to place priorities. Buy the book!
 Very useful!
 Didn't really think it would be so vulgar throughout the book.  He has some very good chapters that are thought provoking but the language is obnoxious and unnecessary.
 In the age of fear of missing out, reactive to everything and feeling exhausted. This book provides the framework of thinking on how and what to choose to care about. Saves a lot of brain power and focus to good use.
 Very interesting with understandable answers to many questions I have wondered about. Insights to the people I love and care about. I had many aha moments
 Oh my Goodness.....such a great read! I will read this book more than once.
 I have never written a review, but I just was blown away by this book. I cannot stop talking about it to my friends and family. It is the best book that I have ever read. It is a masterpiece!
 Amazing book. I've bought 3 copies for friends and family so far.
 I chose this book in an attempt to lessen the stress in my life or at least to learn how to deal with it . several things Mark wrote struck cords with me and I will use them
 Great viewpoint of life. Helps you to understand why the world is so crazy today.  I think adopting this view will make life more satisfying for most.
 Great book. Pretty easy read. Definitely an eye-opener for Western society who gets butt hurt on everything.<br/>I agreed with a majority of the content. The rest was well-written but easy to move on from. Everybody has their opinion.
 This book is grounded, practical, hopeful and plain funny at times despite it tackling very real and important subjects. Relationships, accountability, our ever important "purpose" and the concept of self are all dealt with, in a no bulls*** style, offering us all some much needed realness in this misty eyed, romantic and popularly postively psychologised world.
 Easy and straight forward book understand really what everyone and face and encounter in life. Words are easy to pick up as layman words are use. Excellent book and first book I finished reading within a week.
 Ok, I'll admit that I have read a few of these self help type books, but I never really enjoy them. This book was different--more of a while life philosophy that I will actually adopt, rather than a bunch of temporary fixes that will lead you to read (and buy) another book.
 What a great read.  Really made me change the way I look at life.
 Enjoyed it because it made you think differently than the norm.
 This is a good read.  Some of the pointers helped me with my workload and helped organize my day.
 Language designed for shock value is annoying.  Content is trivial.  Poorly constructed.  A complete waste of time!
 My friend loved this gift as her secret Santa present
 Best books that I ever read. It tells us how to be authentic, and be yourself. What mason’s share is about how to be honest to yourself. You do have less fcuk already. So choose it, not to giving a fcuk to everyone and everything.. ^_^
 This is such a funny and amazing book. I loved it so much that I bought it for my friends.
 Great read. Sounds stupid, even vulgar, but the book is a treasure trove of valuable information.
 I've read a lot of self help books and this one definitely gives a different perspective.  It's a good counterpoint to the norm and loaded with original thinking.
 Gave it as a birthday gift and received great treveiws.
 I believe the information is good, but the word happiness should be substituted with contentment.
 Entertaining and thought-provoking. Easily readable in one day.
 I enjoyed some of the book, and had some laugh out loud moments. However, it's definitely written for a population that is not oppressed or systematically disenfranchised. It's written from the perspective of privilege and choice.
 A modern take on Buddhist beliefs. He speaks the truth and explains everything unapologetically and without BS. A must read.
 Perfect way to gain some insight to your own existence.  Entertaining, but incredibly insightful.  Highly recommend that Antoine read it.
 Great read! Start to finish. Love books that give you examples of just how stupid you are haha
 Really valuable perspective. I think everyone should read/hear this. I am especially fond of Chapter 3. Buy it, read it, share it, recommend it....:)
 This book is really good. Its one of those book that make you look at life in a different way!!
 Excellent condition
 Really gives you a new &amp; different perspective on life situations. Can't wait to buy it for Xmas gifts!
 Outside of the racy title the book has nothing to offer
 First half of the book was kick ass.  It grabs your attention with witty jokes and relevant stories.  The second part blows—boring and kind of pointless
 This book made me laugh out loud within 5 pages, which obviously hooked me. This is a hilarious approach at teaching us possibly the simple most important thing you can control in your life. By the end of the book, I was sobbing. And laughing. I am already lookkng forward to reading it again. I can't recommend this enough.
 Some good overall suggestions for making changes in our lives, but writing a bit scattered. Worth the time.
 Such a great read , very insightful, great content amzing
 So well written. This book will make you re-evaluate things in your life you maybe thought were great accomplishments or goals but may in fact be manifestations of warped values causing you to stay stuck in the same patterns of fear, lack of truly connecting with others and bad relationships. I definitely recommend.
 Funny and addicting. A quick, easy to follow read.
 Very real for ordinary people. We don't have to be anything just ourselves.. Family and a few friends. Minimise your life to happiness.<br/>Good read for those who may have lost a bit of direction and meaning.
 A great, quick and easy but insightful read.
 Book arrived on time.  The book itself?...Repetitive, and was bored very quickly... passed it along to a coworker and they quickly had the same response.
 It all has to do with timing. And this book came into my life at an excellent time. The reader makes me laugh out loud, lament over my regrets, ponder over my own afflictions. Mark is an amazing writer that is able to turn complicated, serious dogmatic issues into layman and light-hearted dialogues. I have a huge crush on him.
 Not what you think. A good read
 So many good things to say about the book... It makes you look at life in a different perspective, specially when dealing with burnout. Find out for yourself, buy it i recommend it!
 A great book about life essentials. Concise, to the point and best of all very humorous while dealing with very serious matters. Invest a few hours to read it. You will not regret it!!!
 A self help book. Not even that funny but stilll entertaining. Really fast read.
 No matter where you are in life,  this book helps to show perspective in a light that is unexpected. The deep phiological aspects paired with the foul mouth quips makes this book a fun read!!
 fabulous book. My son recommended it and I am enjoying it
 Great read and looks nice as decor too ;)
 love this book. It taught me a lot. Short read and very informative. Life changing in a way that isn't the stereotypical positive sunshine rainbows b.s.
 AMAZING book. You will not be disappointed!
 Highly recommended. Nudges you towards better defining your values and metrics. Would have liked it to be more scientific - but still a great read
 Great book and as always, delivered on time
 One of the greatest self-help books of all time.  Period.
 This book is a easy, quick, and insightful read. It challenges the reader to take responsibility for self, take action, and live!
 Great Read and gives a new angle of thinking
 Pretty good book. I thought I'd enjoy this more than I did. Overall it was relatable and made some solid suggestions.
 Started slow, but turned out good.
 Fun read, full of useful information.
 This book was amazing and I preach it now consistently and maybe annoyingly to all of the people in my life. Such a good read. Gives me a different more powerful outlook on life.
 I started reading this book with a highlighter in hand, expecting to come across so many thought provoking statements...and didn’t use it once. Most of us are relatively confident but like that ‘in your face’ type motivation every now and then. This book does NOT have it. It’s actually quite slow and boring. I’m so disappointed.
 Exellent. Life altering perspective.
 Still reading today, am enjoying so far
 Absolutely one of the most helpful books I've ever read. Highly recommended.
 Great product and Awesome Seller!
 Are you ready for this book? I wasn't ready for it even three months ago. And three months before that. And all the time before that. This book needs the reader to be in a place where they are ready to accept the concepts - already letting go of some of the ego, some of the entitlement, and a lot of pride. I am lucky that it came out when it did, and that it was the right time for me to read it, and from now on it will be, I hope, the right time for me to re-read it and apply it, every day, every moment I make a choice to take responsibility for what happens to me and for what I do.<br/><br/>There is nothing new here - and yet there is SO MUCH NEW here. What spoke to me was the way Mark uses new words and new combinations of words to talk about the concepts we've heard from old sayings, philosophy, and basically everything your grandmother ever taught you. A cliche, no matter how essentially true, may lose its meaning after the n-th time you've heard it. Saying the same stuff in a different way made me look at the life lessons here differently, and resulted in the most a-ha moments of any book I read recently.<br/><br/>They key concept of the book for me was the new and very broad application of what it means to be ENTITLED. Mark broadens the definition, including some of the things I viewed completely differently before, and then slams it home (with very colorful use of the f word throughout) so that it hurts and that it sticks.<br/><br/>I began applying the concepts from this book as I read it. It's been less than a week, and I can already see the difference in my life, my family, my work, and my own peace of mind. No, not happiness - peace of mind. I am surprised that such a young person can have so much to say, and I'm  humbled by the realization of where I am and where I was. I hope I walk away changed forever - and I know it's not painless, and that it requires work, and that work never stops, and that it's worth it.<br/><br/>Thank you, Mark.
 Kinda juvenile,but very interesting.  I have sent copies to four (4) of my friend.
 Interesting and helpful book.
 This book struck me much more powerfully than any other "life lesson" book.  It feels real and honest, and a lot of books do not give off that kind of impression.
 Was okay, coming from a really young guy.
 This book is amazing! Mark Manson has truly given me a new perspective on life.
 Got two copies. One was fine the other was completely warped. Kinda the point of a hardcover book is for it to be protected right?? One was going to be a gift so looks like I’m going to get stuck with the crappy one. Not too happy.
 a good read for sure, puts things into perspective
 It is an okay read.
 I so wanted to like this book.  From everything I had heard, I was expecting a witty, thought-provoking page-turner.  Instead it was more like reading the rambling blog of a young adult with zero life experience.
 Ok book title says it all
 I wouldn't say this book changed my life, but it gave me some stuff to think about.  I now sometimes ask myself whether I give a **** when making a decision instead of just doing things the way I have always done them.
 This guy tells it like it is.
 Meaning of life and death and how to deal and the reason why to let go. I learned how to fail with grace and to be ok with being average.
 Real funny to much f words. Definently related.
 I am really enjoying this book -
 It was kind of slow at some points, but overall I enjoyed the book. I liked the ending. It definitely made me want to get up and start doing something.
 One of the better books I have read this year
 Lot's ofgraphic language, though not just gratuitous. Very funny, quite insightful-  on many levels. Also a fast read, with a little something in it for "everyone".
 Great read - funny and thought-provoking.
 Like one big no-bullshit pep talk you need to hear and be reminded of every once in a while so you can keep living life like a bawss.<br/><br/>Also that last Bukowski quote is money.
 Great book really enjoyed it.
 Funny but true
 Did not impress this little black duck.
 Very entertaining and good food for thought
 This is a great book. I am a fan of something different than the regular self help book. Those that are written by non experts in a very unorthodox way. For me this book helps me a lot. Just read it and don't give a f'#*"'~
 Awesome Read!
 The King of self-help books.  Very very deep insights, and a ton of legitimate psychological research poured into this masterpiece.  Don't let anyone tell you this book is a joke or not deep... it's one of the deepest and most practically helpful books I've ever read.  EVERYONE NEEDS TO READ THIS!!
 Best book I've read
 Well, definitely not for me.
 Really a great read and super insightful. Also it's funny as hell and really well written. Do yourself a favor and get this book.
 This is a good read. Better than many other self helps. It is meant for leisure reading: two to three pages per day is fine rather than gulping the whole book down in one go.
 I love this book!
 Easy Read.
 okay read
 a
 Basically useless.  I see nothing life impacting about it.  Overpriced for all the hype.
 Good read.
 Yes!
 Balanced and wise, with lots of common sense, honest and open, Mark Manson speaks to me and I understand. It makes me connect the dots, understand things about me and the others, helps me to figure out situations and emotions that I was struggling to figure out. Thank you, Mark Manson!
 Not a fan. Negative and unhelpful.
 Not a badly written book - but the theme is repetitive for similar reasons and stories; probably not enough material for a book as such.
 I bought this for my husband. He seems to like it!
 good read
 Great book.
 Best book I've read in a long time!
 Great advice.
 I think the best line of the entire book is "You too are going to die, and that’s because you too were fortunate enough to have lived"
 one of my favs
 The author speaks to his audiance casually with humor and offers practical applications to see many of lifes circumstancees from a different angle.
 Good book, but most of the book's concepts can already be found in Mark's blog.  The book just takes things a bit further.  Also, I was expecting a much longer book.<br/><br/>The book is for people who are really struggling in life and have entitlement problems.  It will give those people perspective.  Emotionally healthy people probably already get this book's concepts intuitively.
 Really nothing revolutionary in this book, and I found it a little underwhelming as a whole. It does, however, provide a fresh perspective on things. We live in the era of positive thinking and meditation and good energy and affirmations etc.<br/>All of these terms are so overused and have exhausted their meaning, and Manson flips the case on its head - what if you don't try to force a positive reaction to something you're just naturally designed to react negatively to? What if you adjust your sensitivity to things so that you can truly weed out what's important from what isn't? Simple, but compelling. I still recommend the book if you're tired of all the self-help, positive affirmation cha-cha that has flooded the market.
 Another great read from the author of Models. Smart, elegantly crude and thought provoking.<br/><br/>Highly recommended.
 I would say that you should read this book after reading other "primary" self help books like the 7 Habits or the Bible. This kinda of provides a concession for comparison and shouldn't be read as the primary source of self help. Great book though.
 Awesome book
 Cool book.
 The title says it all.  Every sentence is relevant. What should be a quick read took me weeks because I needed to digest it in pieces.  Simple, unadulterated truth.
 Kinda silly
 This is a great book that in a simple way explains what is really important in life. I highly recommend it for everyone, especially young people who are greatly influenced by media and social media this days. It helps to reevaluate life and goals.
 A great book that presents Reality Therapy, Buddhism, and Existentialism philosophies in down-to-earth everyday language. Do not let the title fool you, this book is really about caring about the right things.
 This book is a great book . His views challenged me , and made me reflect on some of my own ideas. The writing style is honest with a good mixtures of personal stories and references to keep you engaged.
 love this book!
 Not what I thought. A lot of psychobabble.
 Well, I don't know anything about the book!  I've bought maybe 7 copies of it and gave them all as gifts to extremely delighted friends!  Two of whom actually had it on their "Wish List"!  Yay!  Seemed to be an extremely well received gift!
 I've read a bunch of his articles and there was some overlap here...but goodness, so much wisdom. My life is better for reading this.
 You all need to read this book.
 good
 I like this book but I don't love it. I think it has a good message but the delivery trivializes the topics. I also think the author may oversimplify certain concepts and emotions.
 Just finished and I'm covered in goosebumps from head to toe. Incredible book. Will reread regularly to make sure I keep the main points top of mind daily
 Love the book!
 A very easy read. One of the best books I've read in the past few years. Mark provides some great examples on how to think through what's important.
 A book that will really challenge the way you approach your values and life in general. He keeps a very serious concept light with his humour, but does not fail to deliver an extremely powerful message to his audience.  I recommend this book for everyone.
 It was a pretty good read
 Easy read with some good concepts but I won't recommend a buy though. I downloaded the sample prior to buying but that few pages were possibly the best of the book - I was hoping for more but was disappointed (cues for disappointment panda)
 I found this at exactly the right time. It is excellent. Profound, funny, intelligent and interesting all in one. There are some practical lessons and insights that I've found have made a real difference. Well done Mark!
 Just read this book if you haven't already. Thank you Mark for inspiring me to better myself and truly understand the meaning of real happiness 😊
 I didn't read this. This was more of a gag/birthday gift.  It did get a lot of laughs.
 One of the hilarious and honest books I've read lately. Good stuff.
 This is one I will read over and over! Great teaching on what to and what not to care about in life so that we can better place energy where needed
 Fine. Basic Buddhist philosophy delivered in the voice of your obliviously cool cousin. Reads quick. Some redeeming moments. 2/5 pandas.
 The book help to cut threw the unnecessary things and ideas that constantly clutter out minds. It shows how to dig deep and find what you really want out of your life and to go for it
 Manson's use of language keeps you focused on the message. Fun to read, thought provoking, with plenty of guidance for understanding (and implementing) his philosophy.
 OK
 I really enjoyed this book. It touches on deeper philosophical subjects that have helped me see myself and the world around me more clearly. This is a book everyone should get the chance to read.
 The book itself is fine.  But the description says it is a paperback, and it most assuredly is not.
 This is a great and funny self-help book. Highly recommend to read
 I recommended this book to my book club &amp; will be getting their opinions if they loved hated it!  I enjoyed reading it &amp; found it reminding me to take comfort in the little things &amp; the importance of family, friends &amp; living a joyful life with honest values.
 The best book I've ever read
 awesome book!
 Don't question it. Just buy it. You will NOT regret it.
 It was an alright read. The second half of the book was much better than the first half.
 Great writing style. A real thought provoking book. You really can't care about everything thrown at you.  This books help you realize what is important to you.
 excellent book with an underlying hint of buddhist &amp; stoic philosophy.
 Excellent book.
 Delightfully Mark Manson-esque!
 Old truths are brought up with new language and expression that just might allow another<br/>generation to see some things realistically-
 too much swearing for me
 It wAs an excellent book. It really helped.
 Entertaining, but some is nonsensical and difficult to decipher.
 Great book!!!
 Dulling the pain is not the same as dealing with it.<br/>Funny! Hard hitting and practical.<br/>Combines the best of psychology, philosophy , and spirituality in a straight jacket of " life as it is"<br/>A book choice for the pragmatic.
 This is the most helpful self-help book ever! Definitely worth a read.
 Great read!
 Noticed this book and decided to give it a go based on existing reviews and the subject matter. It didn't deliver on claims like "A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life". Maybe a value at $3.99 as a Kindle purchase.
 I didn't like the over the top obvious statements. Parts insightful, I feel like it could have been 100 pages shorter .
 I have been a big fan of Mark's blog, so when he finally decided to put out a book I bought it without hesitation. Mark is a very talented writer and this book is no exception. There were some great points that gave me a lot of to think about. I do feel like the book could have tied in together more. I look forward to reading more books from Mark in the future.
 Good
 its okay.
 I really liked this book. It puts in  perspective the mental challenges  that the world of today gives us.  Great advice on  many of the important  things in life such as choosing values and taking responsibility. I will read it again.
 Its a good read, with several insights and realisations. I enjoyed reading. I recomend this book to anyone seeking inspiration.
 Just Ok
 Very well written, comprehensible, and on a certain profound level. I'd recommend it to anyone. It can change your life.
 one of the best books i've read, so many key takeaways!
 Pretty good, not life changing but good
 Gives great perspective on things which  are important.  Provides insight on key principles. Worth owning a copy to read frequently.
 ABSOLUTELY AMAZING BOOK! I love this so much.
 Outstanding.
 This is probably one of the best books I've read in a long time. I know this book will help me in the coming future. Anyone who plans on reading this book should read it. It will really help
 Too much profanity and too little substance. Using this much profanity doesn't make you cool or wise. He is a 30 something Texan who thinks he knows everything and doesn't really deliver much.  If you are an adult reader you will find his writing very adolescence in essence and style. waste of money.
 If only the author was aware of civil communicating language I would give it five stars. This would be a great candidate for required reading in middle to high school classes but the authors use of filthy, moronic language would nullify it from being considered......too bad.<br/>Mr Manson conveys a great awareness of what it takes in our society to either "do it" or get off the toilet. I just wish he would re-write the book using civil language so more people could enjoy his unusual wisdom without the inner city bar talk.
 Affirmed so many things that I have taken a lifetime to learn. Inspired me to reevaluate my direction and values
 I don't read often and decided to buy this book because of the funny title. I didn't expect for it to completely change my thought process the way it did. Yeah, officially my favorite!
 Liked how direct and candid he was as I related to his message.  Real stuff for real people looking for some guidance.  I laughed hard at the beginning as I was getting used to his foul language which I Loved! A must read....
 This book will change your life.
 This book is deeper than you'd expect, don't judge this book by its cover. It will teach you about yourself, life, careers and happiness.
 Enjoyed reading this book.  It has some great "learning" between the pages.  Would recommend this book for a good read.
 This author wrote based on his own experience. Lesson learned: Sometimes live is sucks, but thats okay!<br/>Thank you for writing this book :)
 I have read many books like this and this one has by far been the best and most influential. I highly recommend that, and I never write reviews.
 Very enjoyable read that presented ideas worth considering. Liked the discussion on toxic relationships and boundaries. Applicable to your personal and professional lives.
 A must read
 don't buy this book,  this author is getting richer by the minute.  you PAY YOUR MONEY FOR A FALSE PROPHET .  but you gain nothing from this.  you don't earn a cent.  the author makes a cent.  now what about you
 At a time in my life when I am the most confused, I read total clarity. Cant believe how young the author is. Very wise thinking. Going to read a second time.
 Nice, easy to read book that changes your commonly held perceptions about our society.
 If there was a book that should be a school assignment at some point, I would make it this one. People are too encumbered by life to think this deeply without some stimulus, and this is a great one
 A wonderful read that comes highly recommended. Mark equates challenges and problems faced by many adults today to the current cultural trends and adds a healthy amount of humor to keep things light. Don't be mistaken, this book will drive to the core in most folks, causing the readers to seriously question their own internal workings and responses to an ever-evolving society. I've read and re-read this book and continue to refer to the individual chapters when I'm facing a challenging problem or need to be reset in my thinking. This book drives home the point that problems in today's life are unavoidable, but HOW we choose to respond to the problems will serve as an internal feedback loop for personal growth through experience.
 AAAAA++++++++
 I saw an interview with this guy on Marie Forleo website and was very intrigued. I checked out his website and amazed at all the insightful yet funny information. The book is the same way. He tells you exactly what you need to be told without sugatcoating it in powdery fluff, but still manages to throw in some sarcastic humor.<br/><br/>He backs up all his points with books and other academia. I will tell you that if you dont like curse words you may have a hard time getting through the book. I do not care for cursing, but the foul language doesnt bother me in this book because its not in everyline, its used very purposefully actually.<br/><br/>If you dont want to commit to the book, check out his website. Its very similar.
 Very cynical approach. Wish I could get my money back.
 Im 25, and i can say i suffer from major anxiety and depression. This isnt a self help but it definitely gives you the proper additude to live.
 Entertaining to read and has some solid advice.
 I loved it! The book hit on some very important beliefs that can truly change your life if applied. I have recommended this book to many friends and relatives.
 He is right on the button! We all need to read this and get the message..!
 I would recommend this book to anyone who has found themselves worrying about trivial things, it helps put your attitude and priorities into perspective.
 Not the place for answers but this book will certainly help guide you on your journey to finding the right questions and your very own answers. Well done.
 Mark Manson, you sir are a comic genius. I loved this book so much and truly couldn't put it down. I really liked his point of view on how we can better ourselves and think it will really make a positive impact on my life. If you curse like a sailor and want people to keep it real with you, seriously buy this ish.
 Some good advice and the author's take on approaching choices by determining the pain you are willing is a novel approach. I will not recommend this book to friends because of the excessive profanity. I am not a total prude and am not put off by the occasion word, but the author sounded like an immature frat boy. Was so turned off I had to force myself to read past the first chapters. The language was better afterward, but I am not will not be recommending this book to anyone.
 great book!! I read this book in one sitting, very funny,insightful and realistic!
 Must read...insightful, engaging and a great way to remind us to check our values...focus on what's important, focus what really matters.
 Great book. Also very funny
 Not a fan, seems more like someones morning meditations brain dump than an actual self improvement book. Some pretty crude examples i didnt all agree with aswell.
 This was a great book. Something this industry or the genre truly needs.  I'm looking forward to your next book mark!
 I initially watched Brandon Carters video/interview about the book. The title was intriguing. This book was educationally amazing. Thank you
 Mark Manson does an outstanding job exposing the inner workings of our mind and behaviors that reveal how humans actual deal with their lives.
 Great book with a different insight on how to deal with life.
 Highly recommend
 Easy to read. Good review of current thinking on how to find more satisfaction out of life.  Recommended if you're in a funk.
 Loved the stories &amp; tone of the author. Welldone.
 This is definitely a different type of book than I normally read. Good insight, into how to view your life.
 Very sobering and humbling. Very practical advice supported by anecdotes and real evidence. I liked it a lot and enjoyed reading it.
 This was great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great yes and no wow.
 Great stuff! -but for the number of times the f- bomb was dropped
 Amazing book. Hilarious. Definitely a great read!
 The book is about the very fundamental issue of where you should use your time and energy. Also in your business life that is a crucial question. We all have 24 hours a day, seven days a week and 365 days at our disposal. Five minutes spent here cannot be spent there.<br/>If you lose a dollar you can potentially make another, but if you lose an hour....<br/>You can read my full review on LinkedIn
 Great!
 Even more opinionated than you'd expect.  Thought it would be a fun and inspiring read. Nope.
 Was excited to read this &amp; then largely disappointed by the overall angry/disillusioned tone. I guess I should have realized it from the title, but this just sounds like a 200 page rant. I would not recommend it. There is already so much negativity in the world, his perspective only adds to it.
 This is the best "self help" book I've ever read. Glad I didn't judge it by its cover! With just the right amount of humor..
 Wonderful
 Inspiring, truthful and very entertaining.
 Kindle Version was great and the book was very enjoyable.
 Great book!
 Just the book I needed at my point in life:)
 Seems as if the author Manson spends the entire book just repeating the same "not giving a f, ad nauseam.  I just got tired of hearing what seemed the same argument about everything, and coming to no real good conclusion.  Waste of my time.
 Dumb book
 Mark never disappoints me with his honesty and insight.
 Great book, just ordered as said prime and came 4 days later not 2 days as prime should be.
 I wish I could give less than one star. It’s a simple minded read. That would be ok, if it had a little humor, but unfortunately it lacks that as well. I feel bad that it’s wasted paper. Mine ended in the recycle bin after the first chapter. I rarely give up on a book but just couldn’t do it.
 Mark does a good job pairing his theory with real life examples and situations. It's a good check to see where your values stand, and how to make improvements.
 Awesome read. Thought it wasn't a serious book at first. However by time I started reading through it, it made a whole lot of sense!
 A great way to view how to prioritize the most important things in your life and take the things that happen in your life less seriously. :-)
 This was a great read! It was raw and honest to the core. An eye opener in the best way. Loved it!
 Good
 Great well written, articulate, deep, simple, humble language, thought provoking, interesting, very good,highly reccomemd, six more word and herd we go
 I liked this book because it gave strong arguments against living a materialistic world with humor and concepts that have deep meanings.
 Many ideas related to Buddhism /Taoism in American way of life. Bitter funny relaxing to read. Worth reading for me.
 Great book, really changed my perspective on life.
 It was good.  I got some important phrases Im going to apply to my own life.
 Did not keep my interest
 Made me reassess what is important to me at this point in my life.  Can relate to a lot of what was said.
 Very interesting, specially the excerise at the beginning, just couldn't grip the last part about death. Wish he would of spent more on that point.
 Great book. Highly recommend buying. Personally it helped a lot and I feel like anyone would benefit from reading it.
 Very insightful, honest and to the point. This book will challenge you to think outside the box, and question yourself &amp; your life as you know it.
 Mind shifting stuff!
 I read the reviews but was expecting a different book, so to speak.  It is not so much about letting go of what you think others think (e.g. to help a "people pleaser" not to care so much) as it is an overall philosophy of life.  He makes an argument for turning many adages on their heads.  If you want to learn to ignore your mean-spirited co-worker, this is not the book for you.  If you want to blaze a new trail and shake up your life, this book aims to help you do just that.
 Great read.
 This book is my new everything!  One minute into it, I knew I was in love!  SO MANY "YES!"'s!!
 Lots of stoic views and just general guidance for living a less-anxious life.  Absorbing these ideas will be tough, but definitely worthwhile.
 Love this book!
 Quick, easy read. Lots of good info. I would recommend this to someone else. I learned some things about myself.
 Pretty good.. I fell off for a second because I'm not a reader but I went right back because it's amazingly and bluntly honest
 Not even finished but already deserves a 5 star. Thanks for the bitch slap mark.
 Excellent!
 I like this one.  A lot of what Manson says seems obvious when you read it.  But this point is that it is not obvious, which is why the book is needed.
 This is now part of my top 10 books of all time. I have recommended it to many people. As a person who has studied Buddhism for about 2 decades, this book was a down to earth, no bulls*** way of looking at the world that aligned with all I have learned in buddhism and through just plain living. I want my daughter to read it.
 Very interesting book, simple to understand. It makes you think and analize more deeply important aspects of life, which we often forget
 First don't read the first 20 pages.. the title is good but that doesn't mean the F word had to be used million times in the first 20 pages. It was almost like rambling. I decided to read it till the end and found the author makes good points but for my taste I felt they were presented in a too detailed way and it didn't stick easy in my mind.. but that is a subjective comment.. and that's my feedback.. it could have been more succinct and well written. Did it improve me and make me change to what the title claims.. may be by 10% I will try out few things mentioned in the book and see how it goes.
 Best book I've read in a long time
 Good read.  Manson keeps the ball rolling til the ending with references to Siddhartha and Buddhism and personal anecdotes. Four stars.
 Great book, thought provoking.  Don't be dissuaded by the title..
 Good book; hard to swallow. Don't read this if you're a pussy with a sensitive ego, otherwise knock yourself out.
 This book is really worth reading. I finish this book in 4 days, while my average time for reading one book are 2 weeks
 While the title of this book can seem crude or funny, it has surprising depth - as does the manuscript. This book indirectly describes an Aristotelian notion of a "mean between extremes" that we seem to be unconsciously striving for as the central drive in our lives - a drive that we are constantly trying to clarify and attend to, but one that is under assault, by distraction ... some stuff matters but we tend to give a f*ck about too much that just doesn't matter and the important stuff gets lost. I appreciate the levity provided by Manson's use of language and candor throughout that brings light to what could be too dark to get through. He models his message. This was enjoyable yet serious. It was thought-provoking yet comprehensible. It was bold yet delicate. This is a valuable contribution to the good life. It finds the mean.
 This book reads like a teenage boy swearing and giggling about it.  Absolutely unreadable.
 Great read<br/>I like it alot. It hit home in many concerns and experiences that seem to relate with many people.
 This is an excellent read that will push you to question all that you thought you already knew.  Read it.
 Great read! I definitely recommend it!
 Very thought provoking and common sense approach to a better more productive way to live life.  Highly recommend reading it.
 Just an awesome book from the very first word to the very last. Anyone feeling down should give this read a try.
 Just makes you think about what is really important.  That even though there is pain it is not the only thing.
 This book starts great and ends great but has some drawn out boring parts in between defiantly worth the read!
 It's up there with some of my better books.
 Total waste of money.  I cut my losses by dumping it early on.
 Great and easy read. Does not beat around the bush tells you but most people refuse to say but know is true.
 Beyond amazing. A must read. I'm so happy this book was given to me. Simply put one of the best books I've read this year!
 I don't sweat the small stuff any more, thanks to Mark who wrote this book, loved every bit of philosophies in this great book!
 Fantastic read!
 At a loss for words to describe this book. Let's just say, it's beautiful. Read it, and you'll see :)
 Everyone should read this book!
 GREAT BOOK!
 loved it. so great. much wow. all of my yes....actually worth my time, everyone's time really, precious in this time.
 Good
 A little wordy.
 I recommend this book to anybody who's going through some issues, it will help you reflect a little more about life.
 I stumbled upon this book when I was looking for some inspiration. I had found various titles that promised to be inspiring and to motivate you on finding the meaning of life. I wanted none of those, and for one good reason: they felt forced and fake. I don't doubt that the people who wrote those books wrote them with good intentions for the most part, but I felt like they were too... 'cheesy'. I wanted something genuine that didn't try too hard at being deep and took itself too seriously and I can thankfully say that I found it in this book. As I said, don't be tricked by the title, it might sound too irreverent or childish even, but this book manages to be authentic, relatable and with deeper meaning, all by being funny at the same time. Can't recommend it enough.
 I really enjoyed this book!  The author does a great job discussing life while adding a good sense of humor.
 Feel in love just reading the first few pages. Brilliant, humorous. Gonna continue reading now.
 Crear and honest book. It becomes more interesting as long as you are reading it and forget about the title
 Life changing; incredible. I need to read this every 6 months!!
 A lot of good information.
 Hhhhgdduifdrjfddrr hukiibhgffddddn j j j j I cr I cr oh yo yo chi u job I. If he. great book
 First time I've felt like I'm reading a book for a person living in the real world! Inspiration without the BS
 Refreshing look at life and death. A b c d e g f j a l s e d d d d
 I’m confused. Why is this book a best seller? His qualifications is being a star blogger? I kept going hoping some morsel of usefulness might be hidden towards the end. It was nowhere to be found.
 I give a $#%^ about this book...great Buddhist philosophy
 This book was recommended by a friend of mine. I got the sample of it from Google and I should have just bought it on Google for an easier and faster refund.<br/><br/>This book frustrated me so much I was seeing red. The way the author went about writing this book basically felt like, "your life sucks, you won't amount to anything no matter how much hard work you do, but that's ok". To me, that makes no sense, absolutely none. I pushed through to page 72 and I had to call it quits. Maybe I'll try and read it again in the future, but for now I'm putting it down. I really wish I knew why people liked this book.<br/><br/>I really don't recommend it for people who are depressed and have anxiety, this book may make things worse (it did for me).
 Thought provoking and humorous all at the same time! A great read
 I bought this out of curiosity because of the title. It's just another self help book, which are all mostly just yak, yak, yak. This one is slightly better than most, but like all the others, largely a waste of time.
 Meh,you need to be impervious to the first word..,I thought I was, I wasnt
 Interesting and very diferent
 I did enjoy the book very much. However if I was still in my early Thirties like the Author I would have given the book 5 stars. I hope he writes another one when he is in his upper fifties like me. Now that would be something! Good work Mr Manson!
 Started off slow and monotonous, but once he got his point laid out nicely it became an interesting read. It does have an effective presentation and small stories to give you some time to soak in what he means. I'd recommend this as helpful or just a good general read.
 It was ok.
 Misconceived as audible
 Good book
 missing purchase
 The book's first impression (and first chapter) felt like it caters to a bit different audience.<br/><br/>I don't mind profanities, I use them often, but I don't revel in them. Which is why the first chapter felt a tad off putting — like written for a class full of teen rebels.<br/><br/>But I gotta admit, the whole book is thought provoking, decently written, and essentially well put together rehash of many useful philosophies (buddhism, stoicism, etc). And in the end, a celebration of life.<br/><br/>I would recommend it (especially) for people looking at a map thinking where to go next. The perspective might make your journey more interesting. And that's regardless if you are sixteen or sixty.
 great read
 I love this book!
 The style got a little boring. Didn't finish this one
 Great book!! Thanks Mr Mark Manson.
 It was good.
 Amazing book, definitely worth reading! I'd totally recommend it.
 I'm on page 71 and this is the stupidest, basic, with 60% filler of stories about people a nd situations that are snoozy and have a huge "duh" factor.<br/><br/>There are so many things that only people on another planet aren't aware of.  "We all have emotional blind spots."  Ya think?  "Choose your struggle."  My parents drilled that in my mind since I was four.<br/><br/>Sorry, this books headed for the recycle bin.<br/><br/>If some of you really got something out of it, I truly am happy for you.
 Book was delivered pretty new, still reading.
 Possibly s good read for an adolescent with a chip on their shoulder, but very “been there, read that,” and on much more thoughtful and literate level. Be careful what you choose to read.
 If you are still in high school and enjoy using the "F" word, then you may like this book. Not sure why the author felt the need to drop "F" bombs over and over. One would think he would have had a greater mastery of the English language. His message was lost in the rubble of his prose.
 Really good read
 Amazing book!!
 don't like this book much. it's all common sense that people already know. I don't see why this is a best seller with all the buzz.
 yaaaas
 Great read
 This book essentially reiterates what you already know....over and over again. Nothing new or transformation going on here.
 Nothing new.  Nothing special.
 Loved this book. No bulls***!! Refreshing.
 Great book, but then, I love Mark Manson in all his profane wisdom. This book is some real talk that a lot of people need to hear. I highly recommend Mark's blog too. A great writer, a basically good, flawed human like the rest of us who has flashes of awesome insight, and funny to boot. What's not to love? Oh, and I'm a good 10 years older than Mark, and supposedly wiser, but that's not the case. I've just had more experiences. Doesn't make me wiser. Get this book from this young-ish whippersnapper. You won't be disappointed. And if you are, well then, there's just no pleasing you, is there? ;)
 Great Read!
 Love him
 Must-read book!
 Boring.
 Utter waste of money.
 I thought the analogies given by the author was very entertaining. He is talented in that he can connect with his readers utilizing a humorous sarcasm I admire. I enjoyed reading his life lessons and how he applied them as his analogies. Excellent self help and self improvement read that is unique and might change your "metrics" that you live by in life.
 I understand the arguments Manson was making in the book, but some of the examples he gives are quite harsh. If you have suffered the loss of a loved one, this book may piss you off instead of inspiring you. Although it does help put things in perspective.
 While I didn't agree with everything in the book, he has some amazing points and I found myself making a lot of highlights and notes while I read.
 good read
 I found this an interesting approach to teaching people to have reasonable expectations for their lives without an excess of stressful drama, but the pointless use of the four letter wears thin in terms of shock value long before the end.
 pretty basic
 I was going to write a long review of this book, but frankly, after reading it, I just don't give a f*@k.
 This book unfortunately didn't give me any new insights. It is also fairly repetitive and only skims the surface of self improvement. I do recommend it however, to anyone who is trying to improve themselves for the first time (E.g. young adults). It is a good primer on self-accountability. It also offers the first steps to take if you want to become a better person.
 I can't put it down!!
 Very good
 Some of this book is common knowledge, but today's problem is common knowledge seems to have gone out the window!! Loved it, thoroughly enjoyed Marks' writing style.<br/>A great reminder for me; a great way to look over ones own value system.<br/>Highly recommended.
 This book quickly lost my attention.  The premise is good, but the author over-uses the f-bomb to the point that it's hard to even listen.  I would not recommend to others.
 As the title suggests, this is a vulgar book but is entertaining.  I learned a few things from it.  As a Christian, I found it entirely secular and missing the  importance of spirituality.
 While I read in reception rooms,as well as at home, people inquire about the name. I explain what the books about and still get blank stares as well as some "pc" commments from people with single digit IQ's. Too bad for them because I'm very sarcastic and don't hold back. Maybe there's a section on that. Oh ya, the book is excellent with great insights.
 Ok book - no real great insights though...don't think I would recommend.
 This author has practical guidance to the meaning of life; love, hate, rejection, etc. But I can get the same from my favorite philosophical authors on YouTube. Very superficial advice. Couldn't read the book, just skimmed through it. And why it is on Amazon's best seller list? I think the author hacked himself to first place!
 I ordered this book through my husband's amazon account and I just got this book yesterday afternoon and I am already over halfway done with it. I love it, it is exactly what I needed. - Melissa
 Did not like it at all.  Written from a very egotistical perspective
 I was expecting to like this and I knew there were a lot of bad words, but this was too much. A constant stream of swear words without enough humor or content to justify sticking with it. I've never been bothered by swearing in a book / audiobook before. I made it about 15 mins, just not for me.
 OUTSTANDING! However, if you are easily offended, do NOT buy.  It almost seems as if Manson has tapped directly into my brain in completing this book.  MANY laugh out loud moments, and an EXCELLENT philosophical basis.  It is easily understandable as to why this was an NYT Bestseller.
 First a disclaimer, I am an avid Mark Manson fan. I loved how stright forward this book is. Mark is never afraid to get to the point and confront you with the cold truth. Funny , insightful and serious, this is a great read. I encourage you to do just that, read this book.
 profound philosophy but a bit profane
 I just finished reading this stirring, insightful, book. It came at just the right time in life for me. It has caused me to sit up and seriously rethink my values and how I measured my life and what that did to me. Thank you Mark Manson. This book made me think about my purpose and about what I thought were my beliefs. Few books have done this much for me this year, and I read every day. Keep an open mind, read the book and dance people. You'll be better off for it.
 Didn’t keep my attention and couldn’t finish it. A lot of hype for someone that says the F word for no real reason. Same old same old just by a different author.
 Within the first few pages the title of the book is contradicted by the author saying "well, actually, you have to give a $#@&amp; about some things" Okay. He then goes on to bash other teachings that practice affirmations, selfishly explains why he tells his wife she doesn't look good after she spent an hour getting ready, and then regurgitates all conventual wisdom that is found all across the self-help realm. Somehow, people walk away truly thinking this book is about not giving a $&amp;@#. It's baffling.<br/><br/>Manson states emphatically, "Happy people don't need to stand in front of the mirror and tell themselves their happy." Let's think about that in regards to a different characteristic, like confidence. I'm sure everyone here has seen atleast one transformation from a timid, reserved, nervous person into a person of confidence and pride. For the majority, that does not just happen by deciding "okay. F it. I'm confident now." No, it's a process which may involve journaling, therapy, or maybe even *gasp* being in front of a mirror at some point (if that works for the individual), visualizing ways in which you can be confident.<br/><br/>"But confident people don't have to do that!" I can hear all 5 star reviewers of this book retorting. It's not about what Mark Manson believes is the way to an improved you. It's about respecting the differences from other approaches and contributing or practicing something unique for your personal life situation that may be helpful to you.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most powerful was his description of the experience he had when on the Cape of Good Hope in Southern Africa. That alone earned two stars. But other than that there is little left.
 If you've been reading or taking endless self help programs and wondering why your progress seems to have slowed or stalled, this book may have the answer. Personal improvement programs, no matter how good, often only give us a temporary high. It strokes our ego, makes us think we're special for having found and obtained some special knowledge. This can ultimately lead to a sense of entitlement: "I know these things that others don't, I must be special, I will be destined for great things!" This book made me realize that having these thoughts are actually counter productive! It is human nature to seek temporary highs, whether from self help advice or something more damaging like meaningless sex, drugs, or alchohol to satisfy our hunger, our insecurities. This book is a wake up call. It's the missing piece in the self help puzzle that can break you out of the thoughts and values that you didn't even realize were holding you back.
 First of all it took a month to come, second of all says “international version” and has misspellings and incorrect punctuation on the back cover. 🤔Can’t help but think this is a fraudulent overseas copy. If you can wait a month for a book and don’t care then buy through Newgistics eCom Orders
 Not worth the credit I used to get the thing. To sum up the 5 chapters I could stomach listening to; Life isn't fair so suck it up buttercup, no one gets to be happy but these things make you happy, some stories about failures who failed and some who succeeded yet were never happy, yadda, yadda, yadda. Zero f***s rating. I had hope for funny ways of looking at personal development and instead it's just a snarky douche bag airing his feelings and getting paid to do so. Good for him but not good for the person who wastes their money.  Those who can't, mock.
 How about Don't Worry, Be Happy.
 Great book title!  A couple of takeaways. A few averagely interesting stories. But a long read for what there is to get out of it.
 An excellent easy to read book and a welcome change from the usual self-help motivational books out there. More realistic than others in showing you how to pursue the path to success.
 I might actually throw this book in the trash. Awful. Why on earth is this a bestseller?!
 Needs a lot of editing. Could easily be just 50 pages and would be much more powerful if it was.
 not quite as interesting as you would think
 Good book
 It lost my interest. I didn't enjoy the way it was written.
 I don’t know why I bought this. No sense
 e, I'd just as soon read a chic book. Interesting enough to read, but cliche. Wish I had not purchased the full version and just the summary. Tried to like it.
 Save your money and time. I wish that I could get mine back. Just awful...not insightful. Very pedestrian and prescriptive.
 Subbenly, I am overwhelmed by health &amp;lifestyle issues.  A big help prioritizing.
 Seriously, such an amazing book! Making my whole family read it.
 Všechno je utrpení, ale můžeme si vybrat, jak nás baví trpět. Třeba javascriptem, zakládáním kapely nebo pobíháním po polích.  Tádydádydá.
 A humorous take on the self-help genre, flipping social norms and expected platitudes to deliver actual advice that helps! Worth a read.
 This book should be called "The completely obvious way to keep filling pages with nonsense." Mark Manson's writing style is akin to Trump just repeating the same five words over and over again and hoping someone will understand the point. I'll save the time...there is none.
 A lot of truth in this book!!
 Delivered as promised.
 I purchased both the kindle book and Audio Book. It becomes tiresome to hear the word F* over and over again. I listened  to first portion of Audio book and the reasoning for not giving a F*. Then the writer switch gears and tells us we should become selective with what we give a F about. I am sure there are lots of lessons in the book but  it is back in the library for now.
 Fantastic and insightful once you get through all the expletives in the first chapter.
 Some good advice for living a less stressful life. Got several copies for family members.
 Pretty good book. Nat bad pretty good<br/>I like a couple parts of the story pretty good Nat bad Nat bad at tall
 great read
 I really enjoyed this book, and found it to be both interesting and profound.  In an age where everyone is a special snowflake, and the world is populated by brave and beautiful victims, this book is a breath of fresh air, giving solid advice on developing an accurate self-image, choosing appropriate goals and fighting smart battles.  I would describe the overall philosophy as leaning toward the Stoic teachings, but it's not a re-hash of things I've seen before.  If you want to make progress towards meaningful change, try this book.
 I just can't get into it....
 I bought this book as I enjoyed reading his blog. However, I had difficulty relating to most of the supposed problems and internal struggles that the author purports we face. Overall I found the book very shallow and condescending, as if targeted audience had very low EQ and threshold for setbacks.
 This is a great book which gives you a perspective on life we all need to contemplate.  I highly recommend this book.
 Crap
 I gave up reading it after all the profanity in it.
 This book will add years to your life. If your future old and wise self could travel back in time to give advice to the present you on how to live a more fulfilling life, your future self would likely tell you about the very same concepts discussed in The Subtle Art of Not Giving a ___. Mark Manson just did us the huge favor of packaging these concepts into an enthralling 200 page read with a playful orange cover so that we don’t have to wait until we are 80 years old to say, “Yep, wish I figured this out sooner…”<br/>When I say this book will add years to your life what I mean is that it will encourage you to stop wasting time on empty pursuits, false beliefs and self-imposed limitations and will instead teach you how to focus on what really matters. This is what Mark refers to as being selective about the **cks we give and living life in line with the core values that we choose to hold dear, rather than those imposed on us by external sources (i.e., society, our peers, social media, etc.). To accomplish this Mark draws on the findings of history’s various thinkers as well as his own personal life experiences and observations in order to “tell it like it is”, whether we like to hear it or not.<br/>Don’t get me wrong, the art of cutting out distractions and focusing on what really matters to each individual person takes many years to master, if not a lifetime. Those looking for a quick fix 6 minute abs type of solution probably won’t get much out of this book. Neither will people who are stubbornly set in their ways. This book is for those who are serious about cutting out the bull, asking themselves the hard questions and examining their identity from a fresh perspective.<br/>Some of us are already far along on the never ending path of personal growth. Others are just getting started. No matter where you are I believe this book is worth reading. I would not be surprised if 20-50 years from now Mark Manson is considered to be one of the defining authors and thinkers of our generation.
 Just an ok read authors by a 30 something ding dong
 Though written in the voice of a 'Frat Boy', I did learn some good stuff from this book.  Unfortunately, the fluorescent orange cover broadcasts the title to anyone in the vicinity without broadcasting its irony.  So when I brought it to read while I was waiting for my dentist appointment, I took the jacket off, but unfortunately, the title is embossed on the spine in big gold letters.  It was uncomfortable reading it in front of moms, teens, and younger kids there.
 This should have been a one page blog post.  It's boring, repetitive and unimaginative. Oh yeah, and I don't give a F$&amp;K about it!
 Received item very fast. Wonderful book. Feel like it was written for me. Would recommend highly!
 I loved this book. Mark Manson's candid discourse about serious topics and hard to swallow truths is beautifully made lighthearted with the undertone of the tough love an older brother. Manson's nonchalant use of profanity and cockyfunny toilet humor enable him to do this well. Furthermore, this book takes a very different approach to self-help than other books. Rather than focusing on how to make more money, daye more women, etc., Mark Manson directs the reader towards being content with having less. He also focuses on the number one thing that probibit the reader from obtaining all of the things he/she wants from life: avoidance. If you want to know more, you will have to buy the book.
 Awesome!!!!Awesome!!!!
 :)
 This is an easy read and quite funny. But I have read more memorable and inspiring books.
 I had much higher expectations from this book. It is poorly written boon that even containa many typos - go figure. This a pop-phsyco book that is based on personal opinions of some dude with no relavant background or education. If you are an educaded reader you will find it a waist of time.
 Needs more ketchup.
 Great read! Worth every penny.
 A lot of books along this vein can be trite and hokey but beyond the title no overall concept there's more depth than I expected and captures a number of important subtleties.
 Meaningless drivel.
 The book looks fake. Misprinted pages and crooked. Says hard copy on the inside, but I purchased a paperback. Cover and pages are thinner and feels cheap.
 Yeah - so he has his short little life experience.  That does NOT qualify him to say the "only reasons emotions exist are for this....", among other like definitive statements.  Maybe if he said "IN MY OPINION, ....". This is complete garbage.
 One of the most profound books you will ever read. Enough said.
 I'm only halfway through the book but I had to make a review saying how much I love it already.  This book really makes you open your eyes and makes you realize why most people are so unhappy with their lives.  The points made in this book stick with me everyday and make me realize everything isn't as bad as I really think. It also makes me realize that I shouldn't keep stressing out and worrying.
 Couldnt finish it.<br/>Just kept rambling and was so boring with no actual content.<br/>This book was probably to subtle.
 Very good guide for adjusting your outlook on life to achieve true happiness!<br/>I appreciated the author's writing style...very straightforward and real!
 A friend gave me this with little introduction; I opened it without knowing anything of its author. The book opens with a discussion of Bukowski, who Manson appears to be praising amid calling him a "loser." After reading a bit more, suffice to say that, at least with respect to quality of prose, Manson isn't fit to carry Bukowski's jock.<br/><br/>So the guy on the back flap with perfect whitened teeth and fashionable haircut is the guy who's telling us not a to give a f---? The whole thing just reeks of phony Tai Lopez style hucksterism. For a guy who touts a mantra of "don't try," he seems to be trying awfully hard.
 Great book for millennials! Interesting, relatable, speaks to those who question life, love, the future and themselves. Just do it!
 Do you remember that kid in junior high who tried SO HARD to be cool? His mom bought him cool shoes and cool jeans and a cool jacket -- and it felt like an awkward kid was just trying too hard. He somehow missed the target even though he had all the right stuff. This book reminded me of that kid.<br/><br/>There are some good ideas here. There is original thought and cleverness. But there is an awful lot of awkward posturing. Everytime Mark drops the f-bomb it reminds me of that kid again. The kid who thinks if he cusses and spits and smokes he will be able to hang out with the cool kids. Unfortunately many of those cool kids will sense that he is actually really needy and insecure. They sense his inauthenticity.<br/><br/>I am not one of the cool kids, but I found the inauthenticity and profanity grating. Instead of confidence, I felt bluster. I would not want to be stuck on  plane with Mark, and would not spend money to hear him speak. I can't justify spending my money for a couple of hours of reading on this.
 This book was a great in explaining how are focus are in the wrong place, and great information on reprioritizing your life.
 This book has some interesting points that I would agree with.  However, the author's incessant use of profanity and even his defense of using profanity (see his blog on this subject) is distracting to his message.  The title of the book is intended to shock and appeal to the millennial generation.
 Nothing really new here. This focus on the important has been around many years. Plus he undermines his whole premise with the wife getting dressed story. The real response from your wife should be that she doesn't give a f what you think. Not should you be judging what your wife feels makes her look good. So for this book, I don't give a f  Just wish I hadn't spent my money on this one.
 This book is one for the intellectually honest individuals. Mark offers tremendous insights into the paradox of the different paradigms in which most self help addresses, but he focuses on the notion of seeing the world as it is and not so much about seeing the world in a way you'd like to see it. Yes the world is a beautiful place, but it also has its guts and horrors and if you choose to not accept that about life, it is only a matter of time until your throat will be slit. (Not literally.) But ultimately this book is a different approach to self help that I myself have fallen trap to in some areas, but it is one of those books that shows you the blind spots that you cannot see when you are so focused on attaining a certain goal of "success."
 Great humor.
 Piece of crap
 Good read
 Like yes, the title gives it away w the f word but there's nothing but f words in this book. Like, seriously... too many f's.
 It wasn't for me. I would rather listen to the David Goggins interview on youtube over and over again.
 Tried for an hour but quite poor and a not worth the effort.
 Cover on book was torn and damaged when received
 Lousy writing
 An excellent book.  Unlike many other self help books, the second half does not just rehash the original idea over and over.  I bought two copies for my adult son and daughter
 Hope the rating helps everyone.
 Worst book ever. I thought I rambled a lot but my gosh. Talk for a paragraph and then GET OVER IT! He goes on for like PAGES and it's mind-numbing. We picked this as our first book club read and it was a TERRIBLE mistake. We had one meeting about the book and then people just "happened" to always be busy and couldn't make meetings.
 This is the first book i've read in 50 years that i didn't finish..don't waste your money or time on this worthless read.
 amazing
 My friend gave me the audiobook version, hence why this isn't a verified purchase. I'm writing this review in hope that you would not waste your time like I have. This book sounds like a frat boy's version of zen for beginners. I use profanity myself, and have never had an issue in my life hearing the f-word, but the author abuses the f-word like he was trying to overcompensate for not being cool in school or something. And then there's all that talk about bedding women, and all these places he's seen. There's sharing, and then there's boasting.<br/><br/>I was feeling comfortable, loving, and inspired, but after reading this book, found myself irritated and annoyed at the world, and all its inhabitants. Terrible society, why should I give a f*** about them! Me, me, me! Yes, I believe in self-love and self-acceptance. I believe the world will be a better place when you are truthful to who you are and prioritize what you truly care about. But do you really want to learn that lesson with a book so crude and distasteful? Have some respect for yourself. You deserve better than this trashy "bestseller" written by an author who doesn't actually give a f*** about you either.
 This is the first and last self-help book I will ever read!
 I was disappointed with this book. Don't get all the fuss over it
 I returned this book after flipping through it (not quickly, I might add). Topics are trite and it appears the book relies on its snappy title mostly. Instead, I recommend reading something of substance by authors who offer substantive and thought-provoking content and reasoning. Also had some friends tell me that while the title was compelling, it is much less so in content.
 So, some of the advice is sound and logical but I have the hardest time trying to get past the blatant opinions made to sound as if they're facts and the unnecessary cussing. He uses the "F" word just to use it sometimes. It's hard to overlook. I'd like to focus on what advice he's giving but I have to eliminate too many "F" words to get to the point that it takes time and my full attention. I'm disappointed. I suppose I'm glad I didn't buy the physical book version which was more money.
 Although i can see the reasoning behind most of what he says, i wasn't thrilled with the amount of swearing he does. Just didn't think it was necessary to get the points across.
 It was a book club read that I just couldn't read. I hated it. I didn't get very far into it, but gathered it was a self-help book for the shallow and callous minded folks. A waste of money and time in my opinion.
 I was pleasantly suprised, having expected little more than shock-talk narrative, that the author has a valuable message for living well in these times. Despite the shock value of uncensored language, the content of this book is a clearly presented translation of Eastern wisdom, something that could benefit all of us today. I'm grateful that my daughter gave me this book for Father's Day and that the author has a unique ability to convey such useful information in plain language. If you can tolerate the crude language, you will benefit from reading this book. If you can't, you will miss out on valuable ideas for living well in these times. If you like my book, you will like this one.
 Misleading title. The Author suffered a depression in his past as he states in this book and thats exactly how the book feels, very depressive.
 Profanities may impress high school student, but can’t make up for author’s lack of experience, knowledge, and intelligence. Manson grabbed several not very original thoughts from web and glued them together with four letter words. This is NYT bestseller? Scary.
 Not worth reviewing.
 My father recommended this book and I bought it so we could have something to talk about. WHAT a POS.<br/>Cover title says all you need to know about the care Mark Manson &amp; editors (if there were any) gave to writing this book. I would not be surprised to hear Mr. Manson has never actually READ a book in his adult life.<br/>DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. Shame that any tree pulp was lost to this travesty.
 Mildly funny
 Regurgitated pieces of knowledge from other sources, but mixed in with a lot of unnecessary negative words and crude attitude. If one truly didn't give a f*, they wouldn't have tried so hard on seeming "cool" and "collected". If anything, I felt that this was hard to listen to even though I use f* as an adjective and a noun quite often. This felt more like an aimless rant than a useful guide. I'm not "old", but I felt that this would have probably appealed to me as a lost, confused teenager.
 If you dont mind a book that talks in circles and doesn't say much.
 Ordered 3 books - Got 2
 Too much of the information is common sense.
 Haven’t read yet, to be continued
 It's a blog in a book. He has no credentials and has gotten creative around how many different ways he can use the work f***. Very little value.
 Overly simplistic. Profanity does not equal insight. Mr. Manson may very well have thoughts and concepts worthy of being published, but this tome is no proof of that.
 When I received my book in the mail it was filled with a smelly oil inside the box, which also stained the back of the book. The sticky oil does not come off my hands and I have washed them multiple times with hot water and soap. Now I can not gift the book to my best friend for her graduation like I intended to.
 Fraud
 Not getting anything out of this.
 The book touts itself as a different look at how to be better with little more urban flare. This assimilation of thoughts is no better than the self-help gurus. It is the same thing he rails against, just in a different form.<br/><br/>It is standard fair here. Don't be a Richard. Give a "blank," but give the right one. You aren't special, but what about your legacy?<br/><br/>Cut and paste self-help, except "cooler," which it isn't. I bought this book with pretty low expectations and even invested in the hardcover format before reading it. After getting about half way, I was checked out and understood this was just savvy marketing at this point more than a book set to make a mark on my life.<br/><br/>Also, as a believer in pagan gods, I checked out at the "witty" comment in the bad behavior section.<br/><br/>If you've read other books like this before, you aren't getting anything new. If this is your first venture into this self-help world, then you can invest in it with the caveat that you read other books to get what I'm saying about the similarity of it all. Otherwise, skip the book.
 Horrible book, i do not know why its so popular.  Hes all over the place.  Writes as if hes drunk.  Save ur money.  U will not learn anything from this book.
 Didn't love it at all - couldn't get more than 20ish pages in.
 This book was lame.  I gave up on it after only a few chapters.<br/><br/>Felt like it was written by an eighth grader.  Save your money
 Meh. He never really gets to any point. When he does it's common sense. Maybe I already have life wired but this book seemed to lack any real substance. Lots of stories about other people , lots of fluff. Would not recommend. Prob good for people who get walked on and attend self help seminars.
 Found it full of cliches, maybe not the usual self help cliches, but not not very far from them either. The title promises more than the book delivers.
 Never got .<br/>I got a email read that it arrived no book here. Stopped payment until I receive.
 I dont like the book. Too many usage of the word “fu.k”.
 I did not intend to purchase this item. I am trying to buy the book. I do not read on Kindle. Can you please advise on how to resolve this problem?
 5 stars for delivery and the item, it came in perfect shape!!!<br/>But 1 star for the book... I only got 20 pages in. The author tried much too hard to be different and the F word was used excessively. The book felt very negative. I really did not enjoy it at all. Waste of money.
 There are some interesting anecdotes and observations here, such as the story about the Japanese soldier who waged WWII on a Phillipine island 30 years after the war ended. And it starts off well enough.<br/><br/>Soon after the promising opening chapters, however, Manson descends into sanctimony and condescension. He is particularly (and insultingly) dismissive of mental health conditions like depression or schizophrenia. If you've been diagnosed with, or think you suffer from, moderate or severe depression, this book is probably not for you. It could prompt you to feel worse about yourself. The author has no clue about how difficult it is to "pull yourself up" while in the throes of a nightmarish condition like major depression.<br/><br/>Manson also "peoples" far too much. By this I mean he lazily goes on about how "people do x" or "people think y," as though everyone but himself engages in these practices he sneers at. Since Manson rarely provides any evidence, these are strawman arguments, as far as I'm concerned. Just as bad is his obsession with "entitlement." He sounds a bit like an old man yelling at clouds. It seems every other paragraph includes a rant worthy of a right-wing talk show host about how entitled we entitled readers are to our entitlements. He may as well include the entire planet in his diatribes.<br/><br/>At the same time he excoriates greed and materialism, it looks like Manson's pandering to young alphas so that he can make a buck. Still, this book made me curious enough to check out his blog, so I guess I got hoodwinked as much as other "people" did.
 I don’t know why this is here, because I did not order it.
 Great book full of humor and straightforwardness. However, page 98 where the author was using an example of a baby ending upon your doorstep to describe the difference between fault &amp; responsibility, he chose to say"feeding it to a pit bull". Please stop perpetuating stereotypes. You could have said "feeding it to an alligator" as that would have been true and logical. Yes, stupid comment, but this is where I'm choosing to spend my energy and write a complaint about one page out of the book.
 Disappointed I didn't read more of the reviews and ended up wasting my money. Makes some good points in places but these are often points that have already been made by others who he references and you are much better off reading their work instead. Nothing new here. Lots of swearing that didn't particularly bother me in itself but the tone does come across as immature and self aggrandising and the whole thing is poorly put together (particularly the second half). Also comes across as chauvinistic e.g. when he describes a man in one of his stories potentially wishing bad of some other men this includes them wishing their wives are fat and/or ugly. When he talks of him and his wife using honesty to better each other he gives an example of him telling her 'the truth' when she asks him how she looks after getting dressed up for a night out so that she can go change and 'look better' *eye roll*.
 Poorly sourced, poorly written series of shallow frat-boy anecdotes fill out what should have been a 5 page pamphlet. This feels as though the spoiled dating advice blogger just assembled a series of his non-dating blogs and people actually bought it<br/><br/>If the premise of this book seems interesting to you, please read "The Antidote: Happiness For People Who Can't Stand Positive Thinking" by Oliver Burkeman instead. It covers much of the same philosophical ground (often referring to many of the same sources) but is written by an actual journalist who researched and thought about his subject, and who can write about it without making you feel as though you were cornered by a reformed MRA douche at a horrible party.
 Hard to read this guy... oh well
 Suggested by someone else...she says it was o.k.
 cynical!
 Didn't know anything about this author or his writing and picked this book up based on a friend's recommendation. The beginning of this book is good. He puts forth some useful and practical devices for spiritually navigating in 21st century America. He combines and synthesizes many different philosophies and schools of thought into one simple succinct message. However, this is only if you can get over the immature and dumbed-down writing style. His use of profanity, while at the beginning can be quirky and informal, quickly becomes gimmicky and cringe inducing.<br/><br/>By the middle and second half, the book really starts to go off the rails and the author's own issues really become glaringly obvious. He comes off quite self-absorbed and is constantly humble bragging about his promiscuous past, cushy middle class upbringing, and blessed life. During many passages, I would stop reading and ask myself, why is he writing about this right now? Why does anyone need this info? How does this further his goal here? Answer: I don't know.<br/><br/>The further and further along I went, the more his writing just started to grate on me. This book is really poorly written in many ways. I actually stopped reading at page 172 because I literally felt like the author had completely wasted my time. Under the subtitle, Boundaries, the author spends 2/3 of a page, in his best bro voice, paraphrasing the main plot to Romeo &amp; Juliet. I felt like a complete fool after reading it. Why, why, why would he do that? It's blatant padding.<br/><br/>It's sad to me that writing of this poor caliber can be a best seller. The ideas are good and he has some useful things to say, but he should really learn how to write first.
 Ok I get the idea.  I'm not a prude or deeply religious but I'm reasonably civilized and got tired of all the swearing so I stopped reading it.
 Complete waste of not only my time but my money.
 Book was bent.  Spine was cracked and pages falling out.
 I, too, regret wasting my money on this book. The constant use of profanity (how many times did he need to say "f***"....really?) was distracting and disturbing. Perhaps this is a book for generations younger than I who need potty humor, salacious references and the like to keep them interested. I tried to focus on the underlying message the author was attempting to convey, but it was weak. To be honest, I only made it one-third of the way through and gave up in frustration.
 Not impressed, author has a solid message but this is one of the worst books I've ever read. I should note I could only stomache about 3/4 of it before I gave up &amp; dumped this on a colleague. Maybe it would work better if I were a millennial? Fortunately the author doesn't give a f#%k what I think!
 As others have noted, great title. The book has one valuable thing to say: choose what you care about and don't waste your time caring about the rest. The rest is the author going on about his life, his complaints, his take on the world. I didn't care, so I stopped reading and returned the book to the library, happy I hadn't paid for it.
 Haven't listened to it yet but it's annoying that I can't listen to this in the car like other books I've purchased
 I expected so much more from this so called “best seller.”  It’s basically a modern day version of “Don’t sweat the small stuff.”  The author often mentions the entitlement mentality, so perhaps Millennials will be able to relate to this book and enjoy it more.  But if you are older than a Millennial, you may want to pass on this book – I wish I did.
 Although the concept in this book is good - caring about things that are worth caring about - it's not a deep book at all. I listened to the Audible version and returned it afterward for refund. The problem I had with it was the sense that Mark Manson conveys - that he has the world all figured out at 30-something. Now that I am older, what I know is that the more I age and the more I know, the more I realize what I don't yet know. It doesn't appear that Mark Manson has realized yet how much he doesn't yet know. His way of looking at the world comes across as a very "comfortable way to think" (as a friend says about people who delude themselves into thinking that they know more than they really do). Manson's words are those of the confident youth with much yet to know about life. While on the surface his words are entertaining, brash, and encouraging, they don't tell anywhere near the whole truth and very likely some years from now Manson will end up looking back on this book as a fairly naive period in his philosophy on life. To me this book is typical of the modern pop gurus of the blog world - more superficial pop psychology from oddly cynical yet overconfident world of the younger who think they have it all figured out - not great life advice.
 Terrible read
 Sent this book back, just read or listen to any of the older motivational speakers.
 Really disappointed in this book and ended up not reading it. I think the title was misleading to me and what I expected from the book. I found I couldn't relate to the author, and didn't think there was enough substance to the book.
 This book is a (very) long form blog entry by an egocentric man in his thirties who thinks he's got life pretty much figured out.  It has a Reader's Digest feel to it, and not in a good way -- he writes as though it is just assumed that you're on board with his values.  The book isn't completely devoid of good advice, but he makes even the good points laboriously to the point of tedium.  I see this book is very highly reviewed but I don't see the appeal.
 One of the worst books I've ever read.
 The info and ideas are interesting, however, I got halfway through the book and got so irritated that the only time women were mentioned were as objects I just couldn't continue reading. I guess one of my "Values" as he explains it is treating women as people.
 Meh
 Doesn’t say anything common sense doesn’t already imply.
 The message is very generic and lacks the depth. He repeats over and over again with little stories and his experience. I did enjoy some of the stories, but I call it fake on his personal stories and enlightenment stories. Many of them sound forced and even made up to fit his overall message of the enlightenment.<br/>Maybe he is the representation of the problems he’s describing and his experience represents the majority of readers, given such a high marks on reviews, yet I am having a hard time relating to the author. You can’t be that inexperienced and naïve. He grew up and stopped being a prick. Boo hoo. What an accomplishment.<br/><br/>The whole book is more about him bragging than about reflecting his inner self.
 Very disappointed. The first and second disk does not play on any device. Disk 3-5 works fine. However, clearly missing important information.
 There are 3,000 other reviews of this book, so I doubt anyone will read mine, but here goes... I liked the fresh take on the self-help genre and the potty mouthed motivation. I thought there were some interesting counter-intuitive points made in the book - don't be afraid of failure, rejection etc. I thought the author over-emphasized how his book was a different kind of self-help, one that focused on, well, being focused, for example. EXCEPT I have read these things in numerous other self-help books. It is not new stuff, but the author's innovative use of the F word makes it kind of funny and refreshing. Honestly, you don't have to read the whole book, the blog post that the first couple of chapters are taken from is the best part of the book, so you could just read that. Still, I am happy I have now read the book, just because it seems like a must read in self-help at the moment.
 This is the most worthless piece of crap I have ever read.  A pure con job.  A brilliant con job, but a con job nevertheless.  Don't waste your money on it.
 Stupid
 Save your money - this book struck me as:<br/> - Poorly written and edited<br/> - Shallow, poorly researched and unsubstantiated<br/> - Biased and alienating half of the readers (e.g., bashing "unique snowflakes", "entitled", "participation awards", etc. - i bet i could figure out the author's political leanings).
 Waste of money and time. Read the first few pages and threw it in the trash!
 I have no problem with the profanity within the book and did find some of the stories amusing. Listening to the Audio book was like listening to your young bro-ish friend who had figured out all of life in his late 20's and wanted to tell everyone about it over beers. I laughed a few times and thought the narrator was decent.<br/><br/>However, the reason this book gets two stars is because its a rehash of prior books in the same genre, such as Don't Sweat the Small stuff. However its written by a young 'bro' who wants to sell the idea as new and for the modern younger groups. I didn't hear anything new or really helpful, other then a reminder to focus your energy on the important things in life and where you want to go/or what you want. Its just told by a guy who really wants you to know that he traveled a bunch and "dated" a lot (he tells you this often in the last half of the book).<br/><br/>If you just want a laugh then pick up the book from the library, but I don't think its useful for most people after their mid-30s.
 Honestly, many people already understand the concept of this book, age old wisdoms of don't care what others think of you, be honest, learn to say no, blah, blah, blah. Using the eff word in the title is a gimmick meant to get your attention.<br/><br/>I'm aware that many people use social media mainly as a bragging platform, never revealing the crappy stuff in their lives. It is a fascade. But I see the crappy stuff in others' lives, even when they don't discuss it, because I have that kind of insight that comes from being around awhile. Because I'm in my 50s with lots of life experience, I easily see through the superficial.  So for me, this book doesn't reveal anything new. I'm not living my life in order to brag about it on social media. And, I have a lot of friends who don't even use social media. Lots of people walking around are living full lives without it being splashed on some internet pages.<br/><br/>Also, I found the repeated use of the eff word in the book to be an assault to my senses and could not read too far because of it. I went into reading it with an open mind, but it came across as someone who doesn't have a vocabulary big enough to explain the many nuanced feelings people have. "Use your words, Mark."
 The author has a lot of chutzpah thinking he is in a position to give advice.  He still has a lot of growing up to do, among other things he needs to learn how to write. He reminds me of his friend, Jimmy totally self absorbed, but he doesn't know it.  This book is so badly written it was painful.  Hugely overwritten - words that go on and on and say nothing.  Please don't waste your money on this piece of trash.
 Hint to anyone thinking of actually buying this book: Read chapter one. That is the book. Everything else is inconsistent self help drivel. I made the mistake of purchasing the book at my local independent bookstore. Manson came up with a whiz bang title and a good first chapter. The other chapters have little or no relationship to the first. Two stars for a clever title. Don't waste your time on Manson's incoherent ramblings.
 I’ve been prone to drop the F word here and there once and a while but this is rediculous. Do not buy and most importantly don’t waste your time. No really good practical advice here.
 Very offensive and obnoxoius. Highly NOT recommended!!! Must have been weitten by a 12 year old that didn't get their way when they tried to do something that would have hurt them. Don't waste your time or money.
 Unfortunately the product arrived damaged. Front cover is ripped and bent. Was very excited to start reading this book, but will need to exchange for a new one. :/
 Dumbest book I ever read. Don't waste your money on it.
 I picked this book up once and put it down after 10 minutes. Seems like every other word is profanity. The more I read the book, the more I hated the author. I immediately felt like the author wrote a book with a good title for the sole purpose of making money and not actually trying to relay any information.  Not a fan of the book or the author.
 I didn't get anything out of this book. The main message gets lost because of irrelevant stories and further discussions/ramblings of philosophy topics. If you already know what Buddhism is then you likely already get the key concept. It seems like the target audience for this book are young entitled millennials, which I am not.<br/><br/>The NYT review writes "backed by academic research," which is not true. There is nothing scientific nor academic about this book. It seems like a relatively young guy who is trying to figure out stuff on his own after messing up early in life. People over the age of 30 should already know concepts like choose your battles, relationships are important, and you cannot accomplish everything that you want to. If you are middle-age or older already, then I doubt you will get anything from this read.<br/><br/>The NYT reviewer also mentions the book contains jokes, which it does not. The book is written to be entertaining, but not funny.<br/><br/>I listened to the audio book. It was a relatively quick listen of around five hours.
 The book just keeps saying the say thing over and over again
 I had trouble picking how many stars to grant because I couldn't finish the audiobook and am not qualified to rate the content. I couldn't finish it because the narrator was AWFUL. When he reads a line that is supposed to be a woman talking, he does what I guess he thinks is a feminine voice, but it comes out sounded like he's mocking the woman supposedly speaking. It was terribly annoying but acceptable when they were imaginary women or women I'm unfamiliar with, especially as I don't believe it's intentional on the narrator's part.  But when he read the words of Malala Yousafzai in the voice of a lesser Kardashian, I couldn't take it anymore. She's a child who was shot in the face for daring to go to school, not a privileged faux celebrity trying to sell me detox tea. LOSE THE VOCAL FRY, BRO.
 The book is a litany of platitudes for the lazy and ignorant who would rather tolerate a world rife with social injustice than have to face it, and their own role in abetting it.  Disgusting trash.  My greatest regret in downloading it is that the author profited just that much more from writing this self-deluding garbage.
 When a book like this stays at the top of a best-seller list, there must be something which resonates in it for many people.  I read it to find out what that was.<br/><br/>What was the advice in here which you aren't getting elsewhere?  And why does not giving a F* help you live a better life?<br/><br/>I realized when I was about 45 years old that sometimes people who didn't care as much as I did were somehow successful.  What was the lesson in that?  Mark Manson, the author, offers up some ideas on that.<br/><br/>I also realized that when we set our hopes on a particular outcome such as hoping to meet Mr. Wonderful on a date, that every date is usually a failure and disappointing.  However, if we say to ourselves: I'm just going to go out with 50 people and figure out what I enjoy companioning with, every date is a success because the outcome you are hoping for is wisdom, or a learning experience. And you can cross one more number off of your list of people whom you went out with.  My professor said I should get t-shirts with numbers on them for them.<br/><br/>These are some of the lessons which author Mark Manson dispenses in this book which may save you some pain.  I also like his lesson on doing something even if you're unsure of a destination.  I've been waiting for an ideal destination to show up in my life on what I'm supposed to be doing.<br/>I have several directions I'd like to move in, but not sure which is right, if either of them.  Mark's advice is just to do something is wise.<br/><br/>He also suggests that if you're not motivated, get started anyway, as the action will usually produce some kind of positive result which will be motivating.  I've been putting off cleaning off the treadmill of stuff now that the weather in the northeast has turned cold. I just haven't been motivated enough. Tomorrow - whether motivated or not - am going to clear it off and plug it in and get on it.  Do something.<br/><br/>I was reading this book and Mark mentioned that he graduated from college in 2007.  Wait a minute - that's when my son graduated from college.  I'm taking life advice from my son basically?  I know way more about life than my son, or his friends, and could tell him a thing or two about life.  Am I crazy?<br/><br/>Actually, I'm impressed that Mark has learned these life lessons in his early 30's which took me years to learn, and some in this book I haven't learned yet.  I think the central one about not giving a flying f* is one you have to keep practicing at.  Depersonalizing your situation is another.  Mark makes the point that our problems aren't that original.  So, why take things so personally?<br/><br/>Mark also writes about what if we're wrong about something we hold dear?  Maybe we should consider that possibility.  I read an interview with Ray Dalio on his new book Principles and he brought that point up.  That's something to consider more deeply.  That maybe the opposite of what we think is actually true.  I recall I used to think it a sign of weakness to drop a class when I was in college.  Now that my kids have been in college, I'd tell them, if you're not enjoying a class or a professor, and it's not a requirement, drop it.  Life is too short to waste time with someone whose teaching doesn't inspire you, as there are others out there who will.  So, the opposite of what I thought back then I realize is now true.  Not sure why it took 30 years to figure that out, but if I'd used Mark and Ray's method of considering the opposite of my opinion, logic might have told me that.  I think back to a few great profs I had, and wish I'd taken MORE classes from them instead of wasting time on other teachers.  It makes you wonder what delusions you are operating under now.  Will have to consider that more deeply.<br/><br/>I found it fascinating Mark's experience in Russia where people don't sugar coat stuff.  And how bracingly, refreshing that is.  I recall Martha Beck saying she decided to tell the truth for a year, and her life blew up, but she got a better life more congruent with her values.  It has been tempting to try that for awhile.<br/><br/>So, takeaways from this book are to not care as much about stuff about what people think as in trying to please folks all of the time, do something on the projects which tantalize even if not sure where they may lead, just clean off the treadmill and get on it even if not motivated to start new winter exercise program, tell the truth more, keep reminding yourself to count success in learning experiences not their outcome.  And learn how to analyze an opposing point of view, just in case your opinion might be wrong.<br/><br/>This book was fun to read, and made me laugh.  I might read it again as some of the lessons need reinforcement.
 I wonder how much of the book would be left if someone crossed out all profanity and unnecessary obscene remarks. Listen, I get the premise of this book, but reading this book is a waste of time And neurons. Please revert to reading one of the classics of philosophy which can explore more profoundly the principles behind this ideology- this very flawed and poor ideology which is not a good way to live. Just another example of the idiocracy of modern civilization.<br/><br/> I actually recycled this book. I hope future generations who are trying to piece together history don’t find this garbage.<br/><br/> Complete trash.
 I can't believe so many people rated this book so high. It was a bunch of garbage. It makes assumptions that we're all self absorbed, walking through life worrying and questioning ourselves. Didn't appeal to me
 got a book with the cover of this book but inside was really a self help book for alcoholics??
 This was recommended to me by Audible after I finished Grant Cardone's latest book. Wow this is the polar opposite of anything motivational. He literally tells you to stop setting goals for the healthy body and income you want. He goes on to say it's OK to be a loser.<br/><br/>I agree with the whole "stop looking at Facebook and TV' part but who doesn't know that?<br/><br/>If you want and excuse to be lazy, read this book.
 I wanted to like it, but it just was not for me. The book takes basic ideas from several philosophies and skims the top of them, relating the ideas to modern fast-paced, wealth-driven society. I like that idea and wanted this to be so much better. The author attacks some other self-help strategies and techniques (derived from the same original philosophies), but his criticisms show a misunderstanding of them, or a willful misinterpretation. So, if you have tried and disliked other techniques, this book may be great for you!
 Ugh. Poorly written. Too bad he didn't give a "f___" enough to write it well or research it. It's the free-associations of a millenial who writes crassly and doesn't understand that what he is saying has been said far better by others before him (such as M. Scott Peck, The Road Less Traveled).
 First, lets address the absurdity of actually reading a "self-help" book, a genre that's typically an ill-begotten cross-breed between Slapstick Comedy &amp; Horror.  Second, Let Us Give Thanks that this is NOTHING like Sarah Knight's utterly idiotic book with a similar title, "The Life Changing Magic of Not Giving a F*ck."  Unlike Knight's narcissistic exercise in cynical marketing, this guy is intelligent, funny, unapologetic &amp; (mostly) real.<br/><br/>Here's the Likes:  You are going to die. Soon. You are not a magically unique snowflake. You are responsible for your own life.  Even though you didn't get to choose all aspects of your life, you are still responsible for how you play the cards you were dealt.  Good values lead to good choices lead to a better life.  Therefore be selective about what you choose to care about and devote your time to.  Accept the bitter with the sweet. (i.e, if you want the corner office, put an inflatable mattress under your desk). Feelings aren't commands. Not everyone is entitled to your Bad Mood, nor does it entitle you to behave like a hungry wombat to innocent bystanders.  Relentless "positive thinking" is a self-delusional avoidance mechanism (often exercised best in conjunction with passive aggression).  Pain is unavoidable &amp; All Wisdom comes from Suffering.  I could recite his little anecdote about Buddha, or I could pedantically point out that all this is in The Iliad, but without descending into Homeric Poetry or the convoluted depths of the Eight-Fold Path, The Dread Pirate Roberts in The Princess Bride captured it best: "Life is Pain, Highness. Anyone who tells you otherwise is trying to sell you something."<br/><br/>Okely Dokely. Since all this seems self-evident to me, I cannot say that I found it particularly "enlightening," but it is SO RARE to have anyone say anything real in this culture, that the mere fact Manson is calling a spade a spade is remarkable &amp; delightful.  If these truths are not self-evident to you, you should read this book &amp; reboot your brain.  If for no other reason than its a lot short than the Iliad ;)<br/><br/>The Dings:  First, it is not that easy to change your values, even if you tell yourself to in "your best Yoda voice."  If you happen to really, truly value education, and you can't get into a decent school, the fact that your wife makes good cookies is unlikely to help.  Likewise, if you worked your butt off to land a good job &amp; you can't, that is legitimately disappointing and advice to simply "change your values" from gainful employment to volunteering at the homeless shelter is (IMHO) glib and facile.  This portion of the book treads dangerously close to the empty-headed positive thinking that Manson claims to detest.<br/><br/>Second, there is still some disappointing bs in Manson's alleged "values" of "compassion; non-violence; and honesty."  While I am not advocating their opposite, these platitudes are not PERSONAL values that will help you lead a better life. "Non-violence," seriously? How often is that really a decision-point for prospective readers of this book (or "readers" at all)?  And as for "honesty," while whole treatises have been written about it, it is fairly self-evident to most rational adults that there are layers of "honesty," different modalities of expressing personal opinions (wherein choosing a weaker form is not necessarily "dishonest") and that it is emphatically NOT always "the best policy."  If you seriously doubt this, try telling your mother-in-law over Easter Brunch exactly WHY you don't wear her pink macrame sweater w/embroidered angels, and that perhaps you might find her political opinions more persuasive if she didn't drop out of school at 19 to have kids. Learning what to say (&amp; what NOT to say), how to say it, when to say it, and -- MOST importantly -- WHETHER to say something at all to your boss, spouse, child, parent, sibling, etc. is one of the hallmarks of maturity.  Of course this does not mean you should permanently repress all your feelings and "live a lie," but "Discretion is the better part of valor."  Therefore, rather than making a fetish out of "honesty" and "communication," it might be better to decide whether to stay with your spouse based on whether s/he is OVERALL a good parent, relatively tolerable, occasionally amusing, and doesn't ruin your life excessively, rather than on constant mutual psycho-analysis.  You can (&amp; should) choose which "truths" to tell.  It is NEVER a good idea to tell your husband that your ex-boyfriend was a better lover. It IS a good idea to tell him he's a great Dad. Even though both facts might be equally true. That is why you have that nifty neo-cortex, to filter out what NOT to say and do.<br/><br/>Even more deceptive than the honesty shtick is the common contemporary mantra that "money doesn't buy happiness."  I have yet to find a "self-help" book that "honestly" addresses this serious existential issue.  While I am not advocating the relentless pursuit of filthy lucre, dismissing material concerns as "irrelevant" -- as ALL these books try to do -- is DIS-honest &amp; misleading.  There is a reason why SO many people chase money, and it is NOT because all of them are stupid, superficial, or glued to the internet. It is because most people grasp that Time is Money, or more importantly, MONEY IS TIME.  In my experience, the GREATEST cause of serious unhappiness (including anxiety, depression, debilitating stress, and the resulting chemical and behavioral band-aids we use to self-medicate) is that so few people have the TIME to do things they WANT to do, as opposed to things they HAVE to do. Pretending that money doesn't help bridge that gap is ridiculous.  It is money, not "compassion" or "non-violence" that pays for a good house in a good neighborhood and a good education and good care for your kids and parents so you can chillax once in a while and don't have to waste years of your life changing diapers (on both ends of the life cycle) or other mindless drudgery. So while money is not the only condition independently sufficient for "happiness," it IS a necessary condition, and while money may not "buy" happiness, for most people poverty WILL "buy" misery.<br/><br/>Caveat: If you truly think you'd be happier living in poverty in a silent Tibetan monastery, Get Thee Yonder. But I suspect that is not the target audience of this book. So if you kinda like having access to cars, airplanes, sanitation, central heating, hot running water, 24 hour groceries, pharmacies, and hospitals, but could do with less traffic, congestion, and sensory overload, be honest about what it takes to actually achieve that comfort. As the Delphic Oracle noted even before Manson, "Know Yourself."  In other words: "Happiness is a choice.  Make it. And don't cry."
 I ordered two copies and received only one
 Copy from page 89, “This book is dedicated to five counterintuitive values. All follow the “backwards law”. All are negative. All require confronting deeper problems rather than avoiding them through highs. First. Taking responsibility for everything that occurs in your life, regardless of who’s at fault. Second. Uncertainty. The acknowledgement of your own ignorance and the cultivation of constant doubt in your own beliefs. Third. Failure. The willingness to discover your own flaws and mistakes so that they may be improved upon. Fourth. Rejection. The ability to both say and hear no, thus clearly defining what you will and will not accept in your life. The final value is the contemplation of one’s own mortality, the only thing capable of helping us keep our other values in proper perspective.” In case you feel for the above, you will be highly satisfied and enlightened, like I am. In short, highly recommended!<br/><br/>p.s. Below please find some favourite passages of mine for your reference.<br/>What determines your success isn’t, “What do you want to enjoy?” The relevant question is, ”What pain do you want to sustain?” The path to happiness is a path full of shit heaps and shame. You have to choose something. You can’t have a pain-free life. Pg38<br/>Self-improvement is really about prioritizing better values, choosing better things to give a fxxk about. Because when you give better fxxks, you get better problems. And when you get better problems, you get a better life. Pg89<br/>Growth is an endlessly iterative process. When we learn something new, we don’t go from wrong to right. Rather, we go from wrong to slightly less wrong… We are always in the process of approaching truth and perfection without actually ever reaching truth or perfection. Pg117<br/>If you lack the motivation to make an important change in your life, do something – anything, really – and then harness the reaction to that action as a way to begin motivating yourself. – Do Something Principle Pg161<br/>Commitment gives you freedom because you’re no longer distracted by the unimportant and frivolous. It hones your attention and focus, directing them toward what is most efficient at making you healthy and happy. It makes decision making easier and removes any fear of missing out; knowing that what you already have is good enough, why would you stress about chasing more, more, more again? Pg188
 Amazon rejected my first review because I repeated a word in the title ... so we'll see if this one works.<br/><br/>I only chose this book because it came highly recommended. I did not like the title. I also didn't care for the first chapter, that used the word I cannot write so often that the text became almost meaningless. However I made myself continue reading as I'd already invested money in the hardcover edition.<br/><br/>Once I got into the second chapter, the book became much better. The premise is that most of our life is pretty ordinary, yet we are comparing ourselves to people's online presence, celebrities and prodigies. This causes us to feel bad about ourselves and seek solutions , often in the form of buying things or addictions. The author recommends taking responsibility for our life and accepting that we will never be problem-free. He also recommends accepting that life is a journey and that we never reach the point of being "Done." (At least not until we die, which is the subject of the last chapter.)<br/><br/>I thought that Chapters 2 through 8 were well-written and insightful. Topics include happiness, suffering, making choices, and accepting that failing is part of success. Overall I think this book would be beneficial for people who are trying to make changes in their life (or business) and are finding that the "positive thinking" school of thought is not working for them. The book would not be enjoyed by anyone who doesn't like profanity.
 I didn't know anything about the author when I started. I haven't read his blog and, to be completely honest, I was just attracted by the title and the hoopla surrounding it, so wanted to check it out of sheer curiosity. At no point does Mark Manson states that he's a qualified psychologist (many reviewers who gave lower marks got appalled by this fact, apparently), so it is more of a collection of thoughts or a worldview of THIS PARTICULAR PERSON. You may not agree with it or you may agree with it absolutely, but I don't think he's trying to teach you how to live your life, I feel like he shares his personal observations and offers you a way of thinking, it's really up to you to take it, obviously.<br/><br/> I've also noticed that many people pointed out that his struggles are superficial compare to people who truly suffers out there, but if the only people who can express their opinions publicly would be those who survived Auschwitz, then we wouldn't have that many books or opinions ("out-pain each other" I believe the expression that Mark Manson used was). As the as the author repeatedly states, absolute majority of us are ordinary people with problems that most other people have. I'm not exactly sure how it matters whether the author came out from a decent family, hit a  moderately hard for middle class "rock bottom" and experienced a loss that affected him greatly, or lived in the box on the streets begging for food and worked on a mine to bring food to a starving family, when things he writes make sense. I'm younger then the author, yet if I start "out-paining" him right now, I would leave him 10 miles behind on a second sentence, and yet I found things he wrote interesting and though-provoking. I agree with most of it, and it takes a certain level of maturity to express that. Yes, there will probably be nothing ground-breaking for many people (although some would find it quite eye-opening, depending on where you are in life mentally), but it will most likely depend on the reason you'll pick up this book. I picked it up because I somewhat preemptively agreed with this philosophy, so I just wanted to see what particular things he had to say about something that I'm already interested in, not open new horizons, so it worked for me.<br/><br/>I feel like cuss words were keeping things light, preventing it from sliding into a overly-dramatic and/or pedantic tone. It didn't bother me, if anything, it gave me a few chuckles, but yes - the whole book written this way, which I hope you expect from looking at the title. The only thing that threw me off slightly was that some chapters felt a bit disjointed. Here we are reading about importance of pain in the emotional growth, then we're suddenly on a way of sustaining healthy romantic relationship, and the last chapter, while interesting in itself, was pretty out of the blue as far as the book overall flow goes. Also, I don't believe in the unconditional love. ;) However, since I grasped author's idea and where he was going with it, this disrupted flow didn't take away much from my reading, I still enjoyed it.<br/><br/>I would recommend it first and foremost to those who already familiar with ideas Mark Manson talks about (one way or another you've heard of them before, perhaps from different sources), so if you are just interested to see what someone who managed to get published and get on a New York Bestseller list with it (it does accounts for some merit I believe) has to say about it - go ahead and check it it out. As much I'd like to recommend this book for some people as an eye-opener, I highly doubt it will work by itself, a much stronger push is needed, but if you feel like something has to change, you just don't know what, and how, and where to begin - also check it out. Other than that, it's just a good, fast, entertaining collection of thoughts that surely doesn't teach you anything bad, so I don't see why not read it; however, if you're hesitant - library is your best bet, give it a try.<br/><br/>Happy Reading!
 I'm so confused by this book. It only talks about its title subject matter for a very short while; the author then begins to write incredibly generic self-help psycho babble for the remainder of the publication. I purchased the audio book; as I was listening to it, for the vast majority of it, I couldn't help but think: "what in the world does this have to do anything?" It's almost as if this work is an experiment that tests whether or not we'll notice it's nothing but a collection of random sentences gathered by a computer from across the internet.<br/><br/>Additionally, I myself am crass so I don't mind swear words; I just find most of them unnecessary here, he's trying too hard to be cool.<br/><br/>Pretty worthless book, I wish I could get my Audible credit back. Perplexed by it being a best seller and having mostly positive reviews.
 It's gets old fast only the beginning is good.<br/>Not worth reading after the 3rd chapter. Could have been better.
 I got this based on several trusted individuals' word that it's good and worth reading. Also, the title is definitely one that drew my attention. I don't think I'd have picked this up otherwise. Why? Because I hate self-help books. Like, truly hate them. I find them a waste of time, and think they are just an easy way out for average non-skilled writers, to publish books. I don't believe that you need a "book" to help you find happiness and positivity and peace in your life. Your whole life is a series of experiences, good and bad, you have to fail to experience success, and what one person experiences or gets out of a situation, is completely different than what another would. No two people will ever get the same result or outcome, so these books - they're a waste of time. That's another reason why I don't believe in life-coaching either. It's just another, cooler way, of calling yourself a therapist but without all the hard work and degrees that come with it - so really, you're a fraud. No offence to life coaches.<br/><br/>So what does Mark Manson bring to the table? Nothing new.<br/>Everything he writes is common sense, except he likes to add a bunch of curse words to make it sound more exciting and 'raw', you know? Nothing revolutionary presented. In fact, it really frustrated me when I read that he's some rich white privileged boy that comes from a very well-off family, because the whole book reeks of how he carelessly lived his twenties and how much he's learned from his really stupid experiences.<br/><br/>His book is based on a handful of good ideas that he's probably taken from a few self-help books that he's read himself and different philosophies and religions, mainly Buddhism. He makes one point, and then proceeds to be extremely repetitive telling us one example or story after another to justify this point he's trying to make. Most examples were ones I've heard or read about before, like the Metallica story followed by the Beatles story, and then of course, he has to end the chapter with a story from his own personal experience to wrap it up. What you end up getting is one paragraph to start out the chapter that actually fully discusses the point he's making, followed by 20+ pages of stories to back up this point.<br/><br/>A waste of time.<br/><br/>Problem is, I started out really liking the book. The introduction to the book was actually interesting and raised my expectations on how this book will unfold. Sadly, it ended up being another one of those self-help preachy books.<br/><br/>I would skip it.
 Once again I’m reminded that common knowledge is not that common.  I’m taken aback by all the fanboing going on with this book, it reminds me a bit of Fifty Shades of Grey… a lot of fuss about nothing.  I listened to a sample of it when it first started ranking and thought “Nah, I’ll pass.”  Over the last few months it feels like it’s been stalking me as a read suggestion so I finally decided to give in and read it.  Glad I didn’t pay for this book.  While I will say the book might be helpful to some overall I found it to be extremely common knowledge advice.  Most of the book is regurgitations from other self-help authors with expletives thrown in as attention grabbers.  Nothing profound here just move along people. If anything it seemed like repackaging of the “Don’t sweat the small stuff” books.  I think the difference is that author doesn't come across as a narcissist, this one does a bit.<br/>The author tries to convince the reader of how cool and suave he is (was?).  He mentions a high school incident where he was caught with pot and how he was a player with the ladies.  I find that hard to believe since…well…I  have eyes and have seen his picture.  It seems like the more he tries to convince us of his cool factor, I less I buy it.<br/>I would call him a snake oil salesman but apparently some people feel great after downing his spiel. Ironically these are the same people he mocks, the ones that stand in front of a mirror reminding themselves that they are happy, good enough or something they are not.  Throughout the book he brings up stories like the Buddha or the Japanese soldiers etc. which I had already heard about from other sources.  It got to the point where he would start one of these stories and I would fast forward to the end of it, thinking he needs to get some ORIGINAL material and stop pilfering others.  Another thing that bugged me was his bringing up “research shows” but never actually citing the research or authors of such research so that one could verify “research shows.”  Maybe I’m asking for too much here since we are living in a world where to some opinions have the same value as facts.  Overall this book was not for me and I stopped reading it 3/4th of the way since it was too predictable.<br/>One thing I will give him BIG KUDDOS for is pulling the proverbial rabbit out of this …well you know… a bestseller for basically spieling a string of regurgitated self-help advice, throwing in a few expletives to sound cool and making beaucoup bucks. Congrats.
 Summary:<br/>The book is a mixture of profane for shock value and some well thought out insights.  The first part of the book seems designed to shock the reader and then the author gets into more of the content.  Overall, the content in the book is not earth-shaking and presented in more of a conversational style rather than a textbook approach.  I would have preferred for him to present the concept up front for each chapter in a meaty manner and then present his illustrative stories.<br/><br/>The author is obviously in love with himself and his "insights".  Most of the "insights" should be obvious to anyone who has not been in a coma for a long time.  The issue here is that intelligent people understand these things but it is hard to put them into practice.<br/><br/>The author uses several concepts from Buddhism.  Yet, there is only one reference to Judeo-Christian moral/ethical systems, which I found odd considering he shows many issues stemming from lacking an internal moral compass.  A key point is that happiness comes from within (spiritual) metrics that a person measures themselves against -- I agree wholeheartedly with this.  If someone had been raised in a Judeo-Christian background then he or she should have a spiritually based moral compass already.<br/><br/>Summary points:<br/>1. You need to restrict what you care about to a key very important items which you have metrics to measure yourself against.  The metric must be inward facing not based on physical goals.  The modern focus on physical items (more money, a bigger house, a prettier wife/husband, ...) work to move a person away from an internal/spiritual focus.<br/><br/>2.  Your current definition of happiness is likely based on bad metrics / poorly chosen metrics.  You must be absolutely honest with yourself about the metrics to correct them.  If you do not have good metrics, you will always be unhappy.<br/><br/>3.  You are not special.  This should be obvious to anyone with critical thinking skills -- definitionally obvious.  The modern PC approach to self-esteem building is counterproductive and destructive on several levels.  People need to get over themselves to be able to focus on a small set of concepts/goals that you want to be good at.  It is not possible to be good at everything -- understand it, accept it and deal with it.<br/><br/>4.  Life is not fair.  Fairness is a delusion being pushed by the PC pushers.  The lesson here is fairness is not important but rather how you deal with adversity you encounter in life.  You can control your reaction to something which defines you as a person.  It is important to not just react but rather to think about how you want to react / should react based on the metrics that you care about.  The auto reaction does not go well most of the time.<br/><br/>5.  Suffering is a natural and critical part of Life.  The big question here is what are you willing to suffer for and why are you willing to do that?  Life is a constant source of problems.  Each person makes decisions all the time about what suffering will put up with and why.  Active decision making is critical to improving your happiness and attitude.<br/><br/>The values of self-reliance, honesty, having a moral internal compass and selected a few key metrics to focus on is what makes for a happier life.  The author's approach is interesting but the book could have been about 50% smaller if he just got to his points directly and left out the shock value material.
 Do realize this isn't going to be a normal review. There isn't anything good or bad about this book, simply because it's Mark Manson's own opinions, thoughts and stories. There are things I agree with, other things I can't find myself in at all and that's okay. What I am going to do, however, is share what stuck with me and what I'm going to try to put to use in my life from now on.<br/><br/>Will it be easy? No. But is it simple? Yes. That immediately describes one of the things Manson writes about.<br/>Happiness is measured through our accomplishments, our good experiences, the things we value. It's those values that should change. A lot of us measure happiness by looking at how much money we have, how many books we can buy, what kind of trips / holidays we can go on, what kind of job we have or want to have but those aren't the right ones. Changing our values has a huge impact on the way we see and measure happiness.<br/><br/>Another one? Fault versus responsibility. That one stuck with me in a giant way since it's so easy for people to blame others for things going wrong and, as such, not taking responsibility for their own feelings. Manson talks about how taking responsibility for things doesn't equal taking the blame. You can't help it that person X did that, but you can help how you react to it and what you do with it.<br/><br/>Except for the actual messages and lessons Manson tries talking about, I also liked the way he went about it. He gave examples from his own life, which made this book feel more personal and honest in a way, but also compared some of his convictions to historical events / stories. The combination of these things made for an interesting read and added a lighter touch, which was very much-needed when certain subjects were broached.<br/><br/>If you're stuck on a problem, don't sit there and think about it; just start working on it. Even if you don't know what you're doing, the simple act of working on it will eventually cause the right ideas to show up in your head.<br/><br/>Sure, I can see how some of you might be going "aren't all these things obvious?" and, sure, they are. But the way Manson talks about and describes them in his book, is a way that really got to me and made me realize that even though I already tried certain things, there are other or more ways to go about it.<br/><br/>4 / 5
 I'd give this zero stars if I could. I was skeptical about the book from the beginning based on its title, but I thought I'd give it a shot due to generally positive reviews...and because I often enjoy reading unconventional ideas. But the title is misleading and does not really reflect the book's message. And speaking of that message, while I'd say that at least some of the underlying principles presented by the author are legitimate and worth consideration, they are merely recycled and oversimplified ideas, cherry-picked from various sources, but primarily without credit or citations thereto. Unfortunately, the legitimate points are also surrounded by glittering generalities and unilateral proclamations that are opinions disguised as facts. Moreover, the author has chosen to deliver his message through crass and coarse language (picture an 18-year-old boy acting cool with his friends in gym class), poorly chosen (and, at times, completely sexist) metaphors, and an underlying arrogance that is absolutely off-putting to the reader. His repeated examples of self-excused bad behavior and cavalier attitude about all of it undermines any credibility that he could hope to establish. This book is clearly just a money grab, which is even more disappointing since the author effectively "calls out" hustlers in the text of the book.  Don't be the next fool to waste your time or money on this book!
 There seems to be a shift in these kinds of books (and in the people behind them gaining a cult like following) to the millennial demographic to where he who yells and / or cusses the most is seen as "edgy" or "telling it like it is," regardless of content or message quality. It's the kind of shift that makes you wonder if future self help books will devolve into just being eggplant emojis and play doh.<br/><br/>Through short sentences, sloppy / lazy writing, a repetitive point, and an excessive obsession with the "f" word (no, I'm not a prude, it's Amazon...), The Subtle Art beats the same message that you should accept your failings, care about what matters, and stand for what you believe in instead of worrying about what you can't change.<br/><br/>All of that being said, there clearly is a massive audience for whom which this kind of thing speaks to. One who both appreciates and benefits from everything that annoys me about the book. So if that's you and you need to hear the message, more power to you, but if you read a lot and aren't new to these kinds of books, you'll probably also find yourself wondering "how in the hell did this sell this many copies and get 4.8 stars??"
 Little did I know this was written by a millennial ... thank you disenchanted reader for that useful bit of information.  As a Gen-Xer,  I can finally say the Millennials do have some within their generation with a good knack for constructive communication and a golden perspective (happy to bridge the communication gap).  I bought this book at a time when my various issues were beginning to cave-in on my psyche.  It was a last ditch effort to maintain sanity in spite of my unhappiness with toxic extended family members, passive aggressive soccer moms, under-handed classmates of my kids, repeated traffic assaults, way too many slights and way too much under-appreciation from my world around me.  It worked smashingly!  I couldn’t put the book down!  Every adage, ill-humored joke and tactic seemed perfect for my plethora of woe!  I highlighted and book-marked so many pages that anytime I refer back to them for inspiration, I end up just reading the book over again.  While I was ready to get a lesson in not caring about anything, Subtle Art... actually shined a light upon what matters most!  I have shared quite a few screenshots with my kids for their reference as well! Seriously love this book - it’s humor, it’s lessons and it’s overall attitude!
 Ok I really wanted to not like this book because Mark Manson (whose blog I've read very occasionally) comes off, in my opinion, as this elitist privileged kid who used to teach guys how to pick-up and holler at women for the obvious purposes of having indiscriminate "you know what" - then he decided to travel around the world, live abroad, criticize all things USA on his blog and start dispensing life advice to his readers. Apparently he had decided that he had transcended his own issues and figured out enough of life from back-packing to start dishing out self-improvement advice. So pardon my skepticism.<br/>BUT, that being said, I was actually quite impressed with this book. He's not saying anything new here really. He's packaged age-old wisdom that has been around since the beginning of time, but he has put a really fresh package on it using the most versatile word of all time: FK (see Osho video on youtube to appreciate the versatility of the word FK)<br/>The central theme of the age old wisdom: surrender to what is.<br/>Religious people call it "surrendering to the will of God." Spiritual people call it "accepting what is."<br/>Trendy people like to say "it is what it is." Eckart Tolle calls it "being in the Now." Adya calls it "allowing everything to be just the way it is." Ram Dass said "Be Here Now." Mooji calls it "The Isness of things." In any case, Mark has taken that wisdom and packaged it with his own tag phrase of "F It." In honesty though, he does make some excellent points in the book and it is worth a read. I really appreciated what he had to say about acquiring the right values and always keeping one eye on your own mortality. Many parts of this book resonated with me, but I'd heard a lot of it before from my other teachers. It is a fresh point of view though with some new vernacular.
 I couldn't stomach the bro-speak / trite self-help presentation.<br/>I got the audio version.  The reader (author?) comes across unlikeable.<br/>It being in the best seller line up highlights either how dumb or desperate we've become.
 This book is a mixed bag, in my opinion. The author makes some very good points and has some interesting stories. For that reason alone, I highly recommend it. The second half resonated with me much more than the first half did. I especially enjoyed his description of "Victimhood Chic" that started on page 110. I agreed with his points and thought that he described the situation in a clear and concise way.<br/><br/>I appreciated the author's sentiment "You're wrong about everything (but so am I)" in Chapter 6, but it highlights one issue that I had with the book. The author seems a bit too sure of himself in some cases. His view on marriage, for one, was based on his own "mistakes" (which was great) but he seemed so sure that his marriage was solid and going to last. The irony to me is that he didn't see how this new situation that he was in (i.e., marriage) was fraught with peril. The question I didn't sense him asking himself was "How might I be wrong about this?"<br/><br/>I enjoyed the author's don't-give-a-sh*t attitude and the language didn't bother me at all. If you have a problem with profanity, though, this book is not for you!<br/><br/>The author's confidence is one of the things that made the book so outstanding to me, but it is also one of the things that made me take pause and wonder what he will "know" for certain in his next book. ;)

It’s the first place I’ve heard about the hedonic treadmill, where the constant chasing of pleasure increases the costs to achieve a similar amount/measure of pleasure. Think about tolerance for an alcoholic—we all can become more resistant to small pleasures &amp; need greater one for the similar serotonin release.<br/><br/>Or the disappointment panda, this nagging voice &amp; resistance that you always encounter—no matter how high your highs are. It’s there to pull you back below the earth, to stop you when you think you’re doing great.<br/><br/>Yes, the title is hyperbolic &amp; polarizing. It’s meant to be. As are the stories in this book, meant to polarize you from the convention that hasn’t led you to whatever result you seek. Or that have trapped you in a path too well worn for you to see is a rut. Like the story of LT Onoda, the penultimate soldier to surrender in the Pacific theater in 1974—decades after the bombs had fallen silent.<br/><br/>It’s a great book. Read it, and come back to it often.
 This book would prob be great had I received  it .
 Fluff
 The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F, (possibly ironically) is quite hard to review.<br/><br/>I jokingly said in an update that the phrase "giving a F" was somewhat overused in the first chapter/introduction - oddly that almost seemed like a bait and switch by Manson. Not necessarily a bad one, but the book would probably be a lot more accurately titled "The Subtle Art of Giving a F About the Right Things." Which is an absolutely fine thesis, and maybe I'm being a little pedantic, although I think my issue is that I'm a little anti books with flashy titles that end up just being generic life-advice regardless of the theme.<br/><br/>Nonetheless Manson's book is actually very good, he manages to dance across a line of easy-to-read accessible information that still delved quite deep. I particularly liked chapter 6 "You're Wrong About Everything" it seemed the most powerful, close to the original point and imparted the most wisdom.<br/><br/>At times the content seemed a little cliche, I've read far more complaints about these so called soft millennials then actually met any, and also many of the personal anecdotes started to feel like humble-brags rather than content that is actually useful. Ultimately though I think this is a GOOD book if anything Manson provides a few points for consideration, and I imagine for those who need a more irreverent self-help sort of book this is the perfect match.
 I would've been upset if I actually spent money on this book. I think the narrator's voice when he imitated people and made these random imitations annoyed me maybe if I actually read it myself I may have given it 3 stars.<br/>I would've been upset if I actually spent money on this book. I think the narrator's voice when he imitated people and made these random imitations annoyed me maybe if I actually read it myself I may have given it 3 stars.<br/>The book made some really good points, I found myself nodding in agreement for a lot of it. I get the point of the book I do, but I don't think I would classify it as a "self-help" or even inspirational. It came across as that guy who is so pretentious and will not shut up about how chill he is and how he has life figured out because he so chill and everyone else is so into themselves and cares too much and blah blah blah….This book was filled with what sounds like made up philosophies that is meant to sound smart and whitty, but falls so short. Be prepared to hear or read the word metrics like 75 times, and a couple F-bombs a few times.<br/>The whole book can be summarized as don’t care about everything but take control of your life.
 Do your self a favor and buy instead 'The happiness trap' written by true scientists in psychology. The concept is already known to people who read self-improvement books. There are plenty more well written books to read than this. There's no structure in this book. Also while he is prompting us to find and follow our values in life then he is trying to convince us that his new-found values are the best to follow. He is kind of rejecting his old lifestyle and at the same time he talks about it like someone who wants to brag about it,strange as it may sound. Don't bother to buy this book.
 This is be the worst book I have ever read. I usually avoid reviews because, well, just because.  But this book is beyond-belief terrible-- so replete with cheap, shop-worn ideas, so devastatingly unoriginal.  I saw someone on the subway reading this and I impulsively bought a copy.  I now want to give the book away as the pure stench of it is bad ju-ju in my home. It is fascistic to contemplate burning books but for this one time I say "burn baby burn."
 Mark Manson writes like some of the best comedians. His vulgarity and crass humor is a mere ploy to make you lower your guard. It's easy to view him as an egotistical child who really thinks he has something to say and so all the easier to dismiss him. But he's entertaining and so you keep reading because you want to see just how far he can go. That's the trick. With a little splash of wisdom and challenging notion here and there he tempers your sense of superiority. He does it so effectively that by the last two or three chapters you're no longer reading to laugh, you want to learn from him.<br/>My only concern is that, speaking from experience, I was only able to learn some of the lessons he presents through force. I had to fall and be forced to a point of deciding to either adapt the lessons he brings up, or die. I won't deny it may very well be possible to learn a good bit of the stuff without being forced to such an extreme but I haven't exactly seen too many examples to prove the case. In that regard I personally view the book as less of a lesson and more of an affirmation.<br/>I picked up the book because naturally the titled amused me. As I said, the title challenged my ego like a little kid. I wanted to get a laugh out of what it thought was wisdom. The joke was on me. While I certainly got a number of laughs they were only when the book wanted me to laugh. The title is schmuck bait which, if you bite, will drag you to another perspective which I found particularly refreshing. Despite not giving an F, Mark Manson went surprisingly deep.
 The first 10 pages are all you really need. After the first10 three author gets a little full of himself and beats the dead horse until even the glue factory wouldn't take it.
 The stars are just for the fact that the premise (that we get far too worked up about too many things in life) is valid. This has been said many times before (15 years ago I believe there was a book called "don't sweat the small stuff", and long before that books about "letting go").<br/>This book packages that same message in a Millennial writing style that involves using variations of the f-word 10 times per page. It is too crude and too opinionated for my taste. (in fact, if you repeat the title in full in the review, Amazon rejects it for containing profanity, that's ironic...)
 Actually this was a book more on what things are important to actually spend your efforts and attention on, more so than not caring. I'm not sure how this book came to be recommended to me, because the title certainly isn't in my wheelhouse... I'm not big on sensationalized titles using modern day vernacular words as an attention seeking device (there are other more appropriate noun, verb, adjective, descriptor words that can be used in place of these modifiers). But moving past that...this book took me quite a while to read due to needing 2 library checkouts to finish...oh, so close, only 14 pages....but zap - it was off my Kindle, making me wait until I my turn came up again. It is one of those books that seems to be in high demand and with a low library count, and it's not a quick read, so for all the 11 people in front of me it took almost 3 months to get it back. Sadly, that means I've forgotten much of my impression on what I read; I have the gist of what was said, but in that time I have read over 30 books, (means my mind has moved onto other things)... What I do remember is there were moments when it frustrated me about his sexist commentary... That still stands strongly in my mind. What else also still stands out in my mind?  I feel that he used an awful lot of information from other books which made this more I compilation of various books, and you could have obtained the information elsewhere. And most importantly I feel like he spends an awful lot of time caring about something that he's trying to claim he doesn't care about. Over and over he claims that you should not give a #(;$ yet, why write a book about something you don't give a$(@) about....except that you do. Some valid points are made, but they're lost in the middle of some of his ramblings...<br/><br/>choose to care about the important stuff and let the rest of the (#@/ go!
 This was a unique read for me because, on one hand, it was like reading a self-help book, but on the other, it had a sense of humor behind it and was true. The book really got me thinking about my day to day life. How I care about too much and end up stressing out. Hence I care about way too many things.<br/><br/>The author did amazing with this book and from now on I will take the majority of it as life advice. One point he made that I really enjoyed was that we are always striving to do better and be better when really we are already good enough. We are constantly beating our selves up for not being better and not making enough money. He talked about how most of us are living well above our means and end up stressing out because we can’t pay for it.<br/><br/>The most interesting narrative was about positive thinking. He mentioned how we went from thinking hey we are good enough to striving for more positivity making us more depressed because we thought maybe we weren’t happy enough, that we weren’t good enough. He mentioned how now in an age of social media we have so many choices and we are constantly doubting ourselves compared to if we only had two or three things to choose from instead.<br/><br/>He talked about a generation that feels they are entitled to every reward without having to work for it, even himself. The part about the stereotypes in relationships got me. He mentioned how when his wife asked him what he thought of her outfits or makeup he was honest. That that honesty provided them trust in their relationship, he also mentioned she called him out in his bullshit as well.<br/><br/>As I said before this was a unique read, it’s definitely a new favorite and I will probably reread this to get an even better understanding of everything said. I’ve never read a self-help book before, so it was really out of my comfort zone but I really enjoyed this book and highly recommend it.
 Worst book I’ve waited time reading 2 chapter of in my life.  Immature ranting from a shallow, self centered ‘frat guy’ kind of author.<br/>Kept looking for pearls of wisdom , none that havenet been articulated more eloquently by previous authors that deserve somethngs<br/>Gen. Are in a pathetic state if they think this guy has sound mentoring advice.
 As much as I wanted to believe this would be freeing, it’s clearly a male view, from someone boasting that leaving his day job worked. Sometimes it doesn’t. And sometimes the art of not giving a f isn’t about our jobs. Congrats that your life is great. Don’t really feel like reading about it page after page. Sorry I purchased this.
 All ideas stolen from the Buddha and Dr. Phil, and written in vulgar terms to sell copies. I expected vulgarity at the outset, based upon the title. But, the tiresome writing seemed to be from the point of view of an arrogant, entitled, 14-year old male. The message ultimately got lost in a mass of the author's sexual conquests and his wealthy upbringing. Thankfully, mine was a library copy, listened to while commuting. My advice is to practice meditation, read an actual book about Buddhism, and skip this one.
 Love the hell out of this audio book<br/><br/>I 1000% recommend this audio book (I'm a blonde so I don't read - LOL). I have listened to this at least 4 times and I'm currently listening to it again as I write this. This is an awesome approach to self help. Learn to give a f*** about the things that matter. And at times, not giving a f*** about a lot of things. This book is a nice, refreshing approach to life. It doesn't give you that "love everyone" and "think positive" all the time. It really helps you refocus yourself and your life. This is probably the BEST book I've read. And on a side note, I stumbled across this when I read his article called "F*** Yes or No". It is another eye-opening approach to dating. Ladies, start at this article. If you love it, you'll love this book. Mark Manson is a genius.
 I did not buy this book but received it as an online library check-out.<br/><br/>I work with a colleague who uses the F-word in every sentence.  At first I thought it was because of a limited vocabulary but then, with time, I realized that the real purpose behind it was to hyperventilate himself to be bigger than the message.  It was as if that by dropping F's left and right, he's the ultimate source and what he's telling me is more valid, authentic, or truthful than any alternative version.  But the inverse occurs.  Not only does it not work,  it makes me believe that it's total hyperbole, exaggeration stacked on top of more exaggeration.<br/><br/>Well, that's how I felt about this book.  Early in the book I wondered how the book's message would be affected by taking out the author's unnecessaries.  It's not to be prude, it's to make the message more concise and valid.  So out of the potential 5 stars, there goes 3 of them.<br/><br/>Secondly, I think his distilled message his message it would melt down to something along the lines of "chill out."  OK.  But discovering that the better route to take comes only through experiencing time and time again the other course.  I'm quite doubtful that a book with the suggestion of "not giving a F" will serve one well. Minus one more star.<br/><br/>But I do these a few nice points and thoughts scattered throughout.  OK, let's add a star.<br/><br/>Total = 2 stars.
 I purchased this at a strange time in my life.. I recently stopped talking to my now ex-girlfriend after she admitted to cheating on me multiple times..In one instance she had sex with her ex the same day she did with me.. She just graduated med school and left south Florida to Texas for her residency.. She use to ridicule me from how my life is worthless because I am a cop to how if I want to have a lasting relationship with her I need to have hair restoration.. She once told me I should date someone like a nurse who is as stupid as I am.. This went on for the better half of a year.. It caused some real doubt in my self however I don’t regret being positive and tying to fight for a healthy relationship.. I believe in positive relationships. And because I believed in something it gave me the ability to not walk away , even though I should of.. I became a pencil dot of who I am as man and an individual.. The fact I’m writing this review proves I am still recovering.. I’m trying to say this book helped me go back to where I was before that experience. It gave me a grasp on reality.. Great read!
 Bought this via mobile to listen to in the car and did not realize it was a typical self help book.
 Any word loses its impact when it is used too often!  I was bored throughout the first half of the book with the adolescent over-usage of the f* word.  Still, what a great message.  I listened to it as an Audible book and then my husband listened to it, and we both agreed that it made sense to take oneself "off the hook" from a certain mindset that would make every injustice in the world one’s personal burden to bear.  This guy has incredible insight.  We both loved the way he promoted taking responsibility for one's self and one's own choices, accepting the fact that life isn’t fair, and not everyone can be exceptional.  We also appreciated the fact that he discussed death and mortality and how important it is that we get over our fear of death and learn to accept that this is part and parcel of the human experience.  There is a lot going on in this book - even though some of the stories made us laugh and the narrator has a humorous tone, this is a serious book with important messages.  Thank you, Mr. Manson.
 I wanted to like this.<br/><br/>But I got halfway through the first chapter, threw it on the floor, and said "See ya." The whole point of the book merely seemed to be "pick your battles."<br/><br/>Um, yeah...we know that.<br/><br/>I'm over the whole self-help genre anyway, and this was the last gasp for me. (I'm over the endless "inspirational" quotes on social media, too, like "Surround yourself only with positive people." I wish. Or "Love yourself!" Actually, I do already. Thanks anyway.)<br/><br/>I'm going to spend the time I would've spent on this book doing practical, constructive things, like practicing guitar and learning songwriting, developing software skills, and working out. Not reading a book that tries to tell me what to care about. I'm going to simply get on with it. That's my key to a good life.<br/><br/>And Manson's writing style is more boring than watching toilet paper being made would be.
 I have mixed emotions about this book. I was totally into reading it not because of the title but because of its selling success. It seemed great at first, down to earth with a message of looking at ourselves from a different perspective, but truthfully, for me, the best chapters were the last three. It does offer an interesting view of how to conduct your life based on what is really important to you, what you really care about. I did notice, of course, all the F-words, but I managed to get some good advice too and I enjoyed a lot all the little stories from author’s life or other people’s, famous or not. Lots of things mentioned in the book are logical and make immense sense, and then others are either intriguing or in total disagreement with me. The mixed feelings that I have are most probably due to certain different beliefs and also from different life experiences. As the author said when we look back at some things that we said or believed in the past we can see now that we were wrong, that our perception has changed, the same as he admits that he may think in the future about some things he wrote in this book. I do encourage freedom of speech, so I do admire him for being so straightforward and I am sure he doesn't expect everyone to agree with him. I bet he is actually having fun looking at the “boom” he created with his book.
 Terrible book. The author even admits in the middle of the book that he cannot teach you how to do what the book is named after. He uses a clever Yoda phrase (misquoted at that) to explain that to learn how to not give a **** is something that cannot be taught. I also found his description of a girl he met at a party weird where he decided to describe her with her race, "pretty asian girl" this would seem normal if he was naming the racial descriptions of his ex girlfriend, his stalker and wife, but he doesn't, just this one person. It's quite odd. Also, his part about we spend our lives being wrong, and as we age we get less wrong, seems... well... wrong to me. It is ageist and I know lots of children who are incredibly wise and I know lots of old people who are willfully ignorant. Furthermore for anyone who has survived trauma or abuse, learning to trust yourself is important, his emphasis on not trusting yourself and second guessing whether you are right doesn't seem helpful. The way he talks about sex and relationships seems kind of predatory and creepy to me, there is a level of objectifying women in his book that I don't really enjoy. If you've read his blog you may have come upon his article about "the effects of foreign women", honestly, after learning more about him and reading his book, this self help guru goes on my creepy list, and so does his book. Furthermore, there are some segments that feel as though he added just to fill space, where he starts to randomly describe how to deal with a relationship if one person cheats, his background is in relationship and dating advice, and so it seemed like he needed to fill an extra 100 pages, so he just plopped some excerpts from his relationship research into this book. Not very well written, and seems to be written for white middle to upperclass privileged heterosexual primarily male audience.
 A little too colorblind for reality, but other white men might benefit from it, or they could use it to rationalize their white supremacy because the author never comes out and says that white male entitlement is the actual issue he is trying to unpack, but without spelling it out as such, but by dancing around it. He ruins his points by singling out things that women say and do as examples of bad behaviors without ever taking into account the existing power imbalances in society, which amounts to a lot of punching down instead of up. He makes blanket comments about what "people" do because it is what he, an entitled, young, cis, heterosexual male did. He continues, like most young, white male writers, to write as if this is the default of what a "person" is, thereby erasing the identities and struggles of literally everyone else on earth that is affroced the privilege of behaving is such an entitled manner as he rails against. He writes as if the cultural and societal fields are level and blithely ignores the existing power imbalances that make the behaviors much less universal and coming most from his own demographic at the expense of the rest. If I was to title this book, I would call it "White Man Trying" and applaud his effort, but not his colorblind, tone-deaf presentation.
 So... I start reading this book and it talks about the life of author and poet Charles Bukoski.  I immediately recognized this author’s name.  As I read Mark Manson’s account of Bukowski’s life I was struck by the fact that I don’t recall Bukowski ever being down and out his entire life and unpublished until he was in his 50’s. Bukowski was a successful author when he was 24 years old.  Either Manson made the whole thing up, lied or he just doesn’t know.  Whatever... it convinced me that this book is a pile of crap and not worth the time to read it any further.
 This audiobook was very entertaining, and also enlightening. I learned a lot from listening to author Mark Manson's satirical look at most self-help ideas and how to just not care about things that are unimportant, or to essentially reprogram yourself to not care about things.<br/><br/>Manson summarizes his points well, and basically advises you to compartmentalize certain things, such as choosing what to care about while focusing on problems that are actually meaningful (= "giving a f*** about the right things"). He then states not to give a f*** about other things, by assigning them a lower priority in your daily life. Then, you must be okay with some bad things that occur; always trying to be positive isn't practical, and is stressful in itself. Just make up your mind not to give a F***, and it emotionally stabilizes you. Also, you must be responsible for your own life; it's good for your self-esteem not to keep blaming the circumstances for your problems. You also must understand the importance of being honest and to set boundaries, especially in relationships. This way, you're not set up for disappointment. Identity is another concept, who you are and what you possess--- because then any challenges will make you fear the potential loss of that identity you've clung to. Motivation; how to improve it by accepting failure and taking action.  Mortality is also a concept of his--- how learning to be more comfortable with one's own mortality can make it easier to live your life stress-free.<br/><br/>Lastly, the story of Dave Mustaine, the lead singer and guitar player of the heavy metal band Megadeth, really hit home for me. He was fired from Mettalica in 1983 and on the long bus ride home, decided how to cope. He decided to form his own metal band and created Megadeth. But, Metallica outsold Megadeth and was more successful. Dave considered his career to be a failure unless he was more successful than the band that fired him, which wasn't the case. No matter how good Megadeth was and how many records/CDs they sold, they (and he) was a failure unless they outdid Metallica.<br/><br/>Really an introspective book that will make you laugh and make you think hard and long about what really matters. Highly recommended.
 Worst, most stupid book ever read--  F  word used throughout....no real story!!!
 An absurd book.  He contradicts himself every step of the way.  The cursing is in every sentence and multiple cursing in one sentence. I don't mind curse words once in a while but , this much cursing is not normal.  The book reads as very aggressive and angry.
 A man struggling with his own identity and the ability to formulate sentences without cussing.
 I had never of Mark Manson but the title, The Subtle Art of Not Giving...intrigued me.  I'm pretty sure many others were also taken in by the title.  It turns out that Mr. Manson is an avid blogger &amp; this is a collection of his work.  I'm sorry to say that I didn't enjoy this book.  My expectations were not what the subject matter delivered.  Fans of Mr. Manson will, no doubt, enjoy re-reading his philosophy delivered in blog format.
 Just finished Mark Manson’s ‘The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F@ck: a Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life.’<br/>I can sum it up in a few statements - points he makes repeatedly using different real examples from his own experiences and those of notable people in history and present day.<br/>1. We cannot control what happens to us but we can control how we experience those things (we can control what we give a f@ck about)<br/>2. Entitlement is a tragic flaw - it encourages us to blame others for our own failures and robs us from taking responsibility for our own actions<br/>3. Get your values in check - defining your own accomplishments by comparing yourself to others will only lead to frustration and emptiness<br/>A lot of his points remind me of Buddhism - suffering is inevitable and good (we learn from failure).<br/>His points are nothing new but presented in a new way. I loved the real life examples and appreciated the reminder that we can take control of our experiences - not what happens to us but how we interpret, reflect on, and learn from them.
 Very easy read! I follow Mark Manson's online writings and always find his work enjoyable. For me, this book reiterates self-awareness tips in a modern/relatable tone; and helped me prioritize my personal values. Basically, the book told me that we have limited f's to give in our live. It acknowledges that the f's that we give life to are the ones that we value the most. To choose the best values to give an eff about is how to chose the best life to live. Manson elaborates on how to identify the areas in your life that are the root problem. Once we recognize the problem, we are able to choose how we respond and essentially choose to change for a better life. We will always run into problems throughout our life. Choose to resolve these problems by choosing to break the cycle of your perpetual unhappiness. Go after lifetime happiness and let go of chasing temporary "highs." His writing is every pleasant.
 When I saw that the first two words were Charles Bukowski, I cringed. This is the person we're supposed to emulate? This is the hero and example of not giving a F***? A drunken, drug using, man whore, whose sanity was questionable and who regularly woke up in his own vomit? Hmmm, not a life I want to create for myself, and definitely not an "art".<br/>But then Bukowski faded from the text, and I was encouraged so I read on, only to see him appear again at the end in the "you're gonna die" chapter. Though Manson's book is better than Bukowski's writing (and I've read everything Bukowski ever published looking for some merit...there is none), it seems that this book sold on it's shock factor and sensationalism (much like Bukowski's). Maybe since Bukowski's dead, Manson became his successor? Like they invented swearing.....boring!<br/>If you want to read a well-written, and research-supported book about surrendering all the things you can't control read: Letting Go, The Pathway Of Surrender by David R. Hawkins, M.D., Ph.D.  You will actually learn "how" it works, instead of just reading the rantings of a thirty-something wannabe.
 Over many years I've read quite a few books on the subject of what I call 'self analysis and improvement' and this book has provided more to think about than any other.<br/><br/>Maybe it's my age showing through but two aspects of the early passages were significant;<br/><br/>1. The first chapter was heavy going through the (in my opinion) excessive use of a particular word. It's all very well using the word in the title for emphasis but if I hadn't believed the book would overall be useful to me I would not have tolerated the first chapter. I'm pleased that in this case I chose to overcome my prejudice that over-use of that word is the refuge of the inarticulate but I did not enjoy realising that by the end of the chapter I had become somewhat desensitised to it.<br/><br/>2. The concept that the vast majority of us are not special (by definition) so we would do well to start behaving accordingly struck a chord with me. That concept was a strong validation of my own thoughts about myself and attitude towards those that think they are (so of course I welcomed it) but it made even stronger the effect of the descriptions of how to embrace that and what to do with it.<br/><br/>Overall, a good read and good food for thought.
 Unfortunately, best thing about the book is the title. I think that is where most of the sales come from. My impression is that a lot of the book is him trying to convince everyone (including himself) that he is now a better person than he was. To me, it comes across as self-righteous, condescending, arrogant, acting as though he is this wise sage of life at 30.
 I did not like this book at all. The first chapter was so negative that I nearly put it aside. I soldiered on, though, and can honestly say I shouldn't have. I thought this book would be much better since it has been popular for so long. The author repeats himself often, recites stories that start off interesting but seem to go nowhere, and then, in the end, dribbles on about you being great just by being alive - even if you're a homeless guy living in a ditch - and this is exactly opposite to what he says at the start of the book. The part where he proudly says he told his wife she looked like crap one time when she asked his opinion is the point I should have turned this off.<br/><br/>The narrator was really great and I added an extra star for his efforts. I just wish he'd said something else for the 4 hours I listened.
 This is my second attempt to submit this as Amazon rejected the first version because it used the title in the description and was flagged.  It is now changed to the f word.<br/><br/>I could only get through the first few chapters as it was exceptionally annoying. If you took out all the times F word is used in this book you would end up with a pamphlet that says don't be shallow. You still have to care about things you just don't have to care about what other people think. There you go, that is the book. I am more shocked this garbage was published. It quickly reminded me of the rash of comedians (or thought they were) that inserted the F bomb and other assorted 4 letter words to be shocking, but when you quickly tire of that and realize there is nothing funny left it gets old.<br/><br/>Save your money and get something that is not as depressing as this book. He must be targeting this to the current generation that will resonate with being shallow.
 The subtle art of not giving is a refreshing book that gives the reader an unconventional view of life and all of its problems. Whereas most self-help books tell you to focus on the positive, this book takes a different approach and is based on the premise that we learn so much more from failure and misery. Pain, failure, and problems are a necessity if we want to grow as a person.<br/><br/>The subtle art of not giving teaches you about priorities and values. It's so easy to get caught up in overvaluing trivial things that are superficial and don't give true value. In many respects, a capitalist consumerist society stimulates us to overvalue certain things that in the end don't contribute all that much to one's happiness. It's okay to not give a.f about certain things. This will only make the f's you DO give to the more important things in life, more meaningful.<br/><br/>Most non-fiction books are all about teaching a certain topic and in this sense can be a bit dry. Manson, however, mixes his philosophical and psychological lessons with excellent story-telling that makes this book easy and pleasant to read. The stories in the book make it more entertaining and also put the author's ideas in a real-life setting, inviting you to think about your own values in life.<br/><br/>In short, the subtle art of not giving is entertaining, eye-opening, refreshing, and inspiring. One of the best books I've read over the past year!
 I heard good things about this book and decided to listen to it on audible. To be honest, I could not make it through the first chapter. I really wanted it to be good, but to me, it just wasn't.
 I personally really enjoyed this book - hence the 4 star rating.<br/><br/>I always like a good self help book. I think that in today's society we care wayyyyy too much about what other people think and we tend to take on other people's emotions when we don't need to. This book covers all of that and more. We care so much about what other people think and feel that it's basically making us emotional wrecks.<br/><br/>I learned this lesson a bit ago but a main point of this book is that We always chose how we feel . Other people may do things that create an emotion in us however you are always responsible for how you feel and how you handle thing. Believe me, once I understood this my life changed significantly for the better.<br/><br/>Don't care so much about what other people think, be kind and choose to be happy. If you follow these principles you will be golden. If you need some more convincing, pick up The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life.
 Not usually a fan of this kind of genre, but I tried it at the insistence of a friend who I respect as extremely intelligent. LOL. I am kind of a book snob in that I have a masters in literature, and, IMO, there is a lot of complete shit published that gets rave reviews. I didn't want to waste my time on another one of those.  I started out not sure of this author who seemed too young to "get it". Generally, I'm not much for hearing other people's personal anecdotes, etc.  I ended up thinking he was brilliant.  This was such an entertaining read- or, rather, listen. The message, the stories, even the personal anecdotes were all on point. I liked it so much that I listened to it a second time with my husband. After a bad experience with what my husband called the most annoying voice ever, (we tried to listen to "The Power of Now" and couldn't handle it) he was ready to jump all over this book with criticism.  But, he loved it!  So that's saying something.  I don't know of a single book that we BOTH loved.
 WOW!  I am not even sure how to describe this book.  First off, the language is a little bit "in your face" as you can likely infer from the title.  And I am not a fan of profanity for shock value.  But the way the book was written, the language did not take away from the book.  Rather, it made me feel the raw emotion and passion of a person who had made numerous mistakes in his life.  And that is where the message comes in which I interpreted as this: stop for a moment and think about the things that dominate your thoughts, feelings, worries, etc.  Are these the things you will care about on your deathbed.  For most of us, the answer to this question is a resounding NO!  So forget about the things you don't truly care about and start to address the things you actually do give a #%$* about.<br/><br/>There are a million self-help/life improvement books with similar messages.  I have read most of them.  However, this book conveyed the message in a way that got through to me on more personal level.  I listened to the audiobook, which may provide a different experience than reading.  But I felt like I was listening to a friend who was giving me a personal cautionary tale.  The book had a lighthearted, yet serious tone throughout and then in the final chapter the author went full-on sober and philosophical.  The final chapter was deep and it perfectly wrapped up the book in a way that I have not experienced before.  The writing was brilliant.  Never before had I finished a book and just sat in silence thinking "holy #*%&amp;!"<br/><br/>Finally, the author leaves a bit of an Easter Egg in the final chapter by discussing a book by a different author and the message tied in seamlessly.  I immediately added this book to my reading list.<br/><br/>This is a book that I will go back to at least once a year.
 Pages of narrow minded and completely uniformed opinions. I can't see how this book could possibly add value to anyone
 When I started reading this book, I was quite annoyed with the liberal dosage of the f word and the s word. I am the kind of person who drops in these words during normal conversation quite often, but reading it in a book seemed annoying for some reason. But I carried on. And soon, I realized that besides the hype over his using the f-word and the s-word, the book has real substance and a refreshing honesty. It is a book for the generation that is hooked to technology, has abundance of opportunities and a general sense of purposeless-ness. What the author has to offer has been said many many times before in many different ages by scores of great men and women, but the way he says is quite unique and packs a punch. Perhaps, the f word is there to attract readers. It is a very competitive world and fortunes are made on the art of capturing user attention. Whatever be the reason, I am so glad I read this book and that it made a positive impression on me. As the author says, from your limited supply of ****s, spare a few for this book.
 I listened to the audible version of this book.  I found that the author does have some good insights in the book, as well as shares some interesting stories from history (ranging from Japanese soldiers fighting WW2 long after the war had ended, to Megadeath and Metallica, to the story of William James) to make some important points.  Had the entire book been comprised of these lessons, I would have rated the book 5 stars.  However, this unfortunately only made up a fraction of the overall read.<br/><br/>For the bulk of the book, the author seems to just engage in a monologue sharing his views of the world with the reader.  At many points, these views seem to be inherently contradictory.  In one part he claims that as humans, we know nothing, and so must be humble…yet shortly thereafter he sets forth some of his own rules for life, explaining with certainty why some people behave in the ways they do, etc.  If we as humans know nothing, how can he seem to know everything about human behavior?<br/><br/>In one part of the book he claims that none of us are special snowflakes, yet in another part he says we are all unique and special.<br/><br/>He espouses the need for humility – which is true.  Yet, at the same time, he repeatedly reminds the reader of all the women he slept with.<br/><br/>He espouses the virtue of living fearlessly, yet it was the absence of fear that had taken the life of his friend.<br/><br/>Also, while I realize the F-word is in the title, the first part of the book uses the F-word too many times.  It got really old, quite quickly.<br/><br/>With that said, he does have some good and valid points in his book, and there are some aspects of it which I’m sure I will carry with me.<br/><br/>With all the above taken into consideration, I would give the book 3 stars.  I’d probably give it a 3.5 if that were an option, but its not.  Typically I don’t spend my limited time reading through books unless they are rated over 4 or 4.5 stars.
 I listened to the Audible version, which was a good narration, no complaints.  There was a lot I didn't like about this book in the beginning and I almost shut it down for good.  I thought he tried too hard with the profanity shock value and I am not anti profanity if it fits.  Also the author's youth is very apparent in some of his stories (e.g., a breakup that felt like a thousand stomach punches or some such thing).  However, overall he wrote a really good book.  Actually the faults I had with the book (other than the profanity) were directly or indirectly discussed in the 'we are all flawed' narratives.  I really appreciated the discussions on entitlement and how it develops and how it messes people up.  Overall, it was an approachable and modernized translation of some Buddhist teachings and a good prompt to get you re-evaluating what you give your time to.  Everyone needs to do that at least from time to time.  I will probably listen to it again and will definitely recommend it.
 I bought this book in a bookstore, but I wish I had bought it from Amazon -- because I would have paid less for it. There are some useful and worthwhile ideas in this book, which is essentially a treatise on learning to choose carefully what you believe in, what you care about, what you will fight for -- and all the things you won't or don't, so they don't get in the way and clog up your life and your enjoyment of it. But Mr. Manson seems to think that his incessant and never-ending use of vulgar language and four letter words beginning with F and S helps him to make his points more strongly, and of course they don't. After awhile, I just felt like I had to swim through his constant vulgarity and his rather juvenile need to massage his ego publicly to uncover a pearl here and another pearl there. There ARE pearls, by all means -- but it's a lot of work to find them.
 Unlike other self-help gurus, Mark doesn't promise you a happily after life. Indeed, he admits upfront that life would always be painful no matter what. The genius of Mark lies in challenging you to re-examine your values and negative emotions with a healthy dose of skepticism, and take full responsibility of your life.  Good life = Success+Money+Fame? Negative emotions = Bad + Someone else's fault?  Mark turns the conventional widsom on what constitutes a good life on its head, and guide us towards building a more sustainable path towards happiness.<br/><br/>I grew up drinking a lot of cool aid thinking I'm special - destined to achieve great things and adored by family and friends. Yet over the years, I discovered that this type of mentality has cultivated an entitled mentality that made my life miserable. Mark instroduced a completely new perspective for me: I'm not special, life is full of pain, and I might be wrong most of the time. Yet by acknowledging that I'm not special, I'm liberated from my solitary confinement, and seek out others more readily; by acknowledging pain, I no longer need to bottle up my feelings until they inevitably explode, or feel demoralized. Rather, I have learned to view it from a neutral light, and use it as an opportunity to examine the situation, and think of ways to make it better; perhaps most importantly, by admiting that we're mostly wrong all the time, just less wrong over time, my self-worth is finally detached from having to be right all the time. This also alleviate my fear of rejection, and help me move faster in my job.<br/><br/>Mark shattered my childhood fairy tale vision, and I emerged as a more mature person. For that, he has my eternal gratitude.
 Truth be told, I didn't make it past chapter 2 before I couldn't take anymore. Whatever message the author has was lost in his over-the-top attempts at trying to be funny and to sound a-hole'ish. Besides, from what I gathered, this book could have been summed up in a single blog post. The overall message is/was that people care about entirely too much things, most of which are unimportant. Even further, there are things in life that matters and things that don't...and that we should care about those things that do matter.<br/><br/>That's it. The message is something that we all know deep down inside.
 I give this book 4 stars due to the fact that most of the personal appeal in the book started with the last chapter. Sure, there were some anecdotes in every chapter that described his life, connecting to the deeper philosophy of the book. But the majority of the emotion came at the end, with dry theories and hypotheticals in the foreground of the book. Manson however does a decent job at keeping us reading, even if it’s some here and there. I personally couldn’t leave the book for more than a few days at a time, even with a hefty schedule. Overall, the outline and flow of the book was easy to comprehend and understand, and the meaning behind it wasn’t deciphered. I give 4 stars because, even though I enjoyed the read, I couldn’t connect too deeply until the more I read.
 I do not recommend this book for people over 35, or pretty much anyone who has made any attempt at educating themselves in an effort towards personal growth.  As I read the book I was distracted by a sense that the author is well read, but young and inexperienced.  The straw man for his advice is too much of a caricature:  arrogant, self-absorbed, womanizing, shallow male trying to climb the corporate ladder.  It’s far too easy to give advice to these kinds of people.  Similarly, he compares his ‘self-help’ philosophy to others that require people to stand in front of a mirror and tell themselves they are happy.  I’ve been reading advice/personal growth/self-help books for years, and have yet to run across one that asks this of it’s reader.  This is like writing a diet and health book for people who stuff their face continuously with pizza and soda, and comparing other diet books that ask their readers to simply imagine themselves as slim; even the simplest advice would make a difference to this target group.  One other area I took issue with were his stories of taking ‘risks’ when he was in his early twenties to start his internet advice business, and the resulting life advice he offered from those experiences.  Many people with children or other dependents will likely agree that ‘risk’ when you’re single and in your twenties is vastly different than the risks one takes when you are middle or late aged with a family.  I commend Mark for being a successful professional writer and advice-giver.  And in all fairness he may not have intended his book for the average 40+ year old.  Regardless, I do believe this book was billed in a certain way that it did not live up to.  He used attention getting titles and descriptions that ultimately did not lead to any deeper, useful content for me.
 How do i return? I fell trap to a one click buy and i don’t have a kindle
 If you can get past all the "F" words, especially in the first chapter, there is a lot of good stuff here. For instance:<br/>Happiness comes from Problem Solving, Pain is Biology’s Change Agent, Suffering has Value, Emotions - I feel them, Why do I feel them? (What is the root cause), Persona Values - What are the metrics (standards) by which I measure<br/>Myself and my success? All belief is already wrong (flawed), some are just less wrong than others. Never find yourself, never know who you are. That will keep you always striving, discovering.<br/>There are other "F" words, like funny, fanciful, family, foolish, friends, etc.
 Initial Summary:<br/><br/>Thus far a very entertaining book. Still in the early chapters and albeit being very crude it is surprisingly enlightening. So far the chapters remind me of live stand up. I may change my opinion, but so far so good.<br/><br/>I will try to do a final update of this post once I complete reading it as an addendum below.<br/>-------------------------------------------------<br/>I love reading negative review comments ( because that is what everyone should do ) In light of them here are my initial impressions of the early chapters:<br/><br/>Are they crude and vulgar: Absolutely YES. The F word is sprinkled on through out, and very generously. Including immature references to drug use and various debaucheries.<br/><br/>Are the concepts obvious: Maybe. This would depend on who you are. Certain concepts are obvious to some and not so obvious to others, obviously right ?<br/><br/>Do the chapters talk in generalizations: YES. I feel that was the the whole point<br/><br/>The title is click bait. YES. It does deliver on the promise though .. :)<br/>----------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Final Thoughts after reading the book:<br/><br/>I do see why people would feel betrayed by the tittle. As the narrative changes pace in the later chapters. It is still a fun read and a reminder we have to work hard at things we want, and to balance out our perspective on life.<br/><br/>That's what I thought and gave enough F***s to write a post. Would be nice to hear what you thought!
 Even when I censored the title of the book as Amazon has, they refused to post my review.  I find this laughable, and I think it is stupid as it detracts from my ability to really focus my review on the content of the book, but I think people should know, and maybe choose to buy the book somewhere besides Amazon.<br/><br/>Mark Manson's book draws from Buddhism, existentialist philosophy, and his own musings on life--which are surprisingly profound given his youth--the only way to understand why is to read the book the entire way through, which I would strongly encourage anyone with any interest in personal growth to do.
 This would be One Star if it wasn’t for that I enjoyed the book about part way through.<br/><br/>Another reviewer mentioned ‘written by millennials, for millennials’ as a hard working millennial (by age only) I completely agree, the author seems to have no real life experience, citing nothing but anecdotes and BOY does he love to ramble on about the same point.<br/><br/>I hope this review can discourage at least one person from reading this book, if you’re looking for self help this will only poison your mind with a heavy dose of self entitlement and apathy. (This is coming from a nihilist mind you)<br/><br/>Look elsewhere, save your money
 There are some really useful insights here, and more than few adolescent ones. The chapter which involves the 'refreshingly rude' lack of social graces of the Russians, as opposed to the irritating fake politeness of Americans, for example, is pure university student nonsense. It's no secret that the Russians, are among the more duplicitous nations on the planet. Maybe someone told them Mark was in the neighborhood.  And the last chapter on Mark finding the meaning of life as he creeps to the edge of a cliff, is hilarious.I suspect that the poor Australian that bonded with him over a cheesy grin, knowing the Aussies, was secretly hoping he'd jump off. So I liked it - but I'd say that Mark, over dinner, might be a royal pain in the neck.
 This was a quick read.  I picked it up in an airport when I was stressed out on a business trip, and passed it along to someone at my destination.<br/><br/>That being said, I don't know how much of it really stuck with me, but that might've been more the frame of mind that I was in at the time.  If you're looking for humor, or a gag gift it might be what you want, but if you want to get more though provoking, something like "Basic Buddhism Through Comics" might be a better read.<br/><br/>If you're up for a not-so-light read, but more likely to be life-changing, I'd go with "Lost Connections: Uncovering the Real Causes of Depression – and the Unexpected Solutions"
 I found this book very entertaining, and found myself laughing out loud on many occasions. I also found that I could apply lot of the points made by the author to my entitled life.<br/>Without giving too much away, I am not a self help kind of person but I found Mark Manson's book helpful. I downloaded this audiobook because the title caught my attention.<br/>I wish there was a "clean" version of this book because I have family members who could benefit from its message, but might be turned off by the language.<br/>As an added bonus, I listened this book on Audible on a drive from Houston to New Orleans (Roughly about five and a half hours). The audio book was the perfect length for the trip, it ended when I was on the I-10/Carrolton Street off-ramp.
 I picked this book up in the Las Vegas airport last night at 11pm before my flight. Several people had been recommending it and I had been resisting. I’m not big on massively bestselling self-help books, but I liked it. I finished it in less than 24 hours, it reads laser fast. The word “energizing” comes to mind. Anecdotes and stories are sprinkled around in just the right amount to keep you going through the philosophizing. He mentions Tim Ferriss at some point, and I can see some overlap between these two guys. I liked it and underlined some parts. If you want something short and quick to get your mind working, this book does the job.
 waste of time
 When discussing why we shouldn't believe our own thoughts about ourselves, author brings up the case of woman who falsely accused her father of molestation. When describing what lead up to this, author described that the woman had recently become a feminist, and started having a lesbian relationship. So, basically, claims of sexual abuse might not be true, and claims will be more prone to happen if you're a lesbian feminist? Really? THIS had to be your example of a false belief?
 In 2011 I read Mark Manson's first book Models: Attract Women Through Honesty (a book for which I wrote a five star review on Amazon as well) and it effectively slammed the door and liberated me from a very painful and frustrating period in my life. A period I call the "The Pickup Years" and it was a time when I put my trust in a bunch of losers wearing feather boas and large top hats who I thought held all the answers to my problems with women. In that book Mark showed me that so called pick up techniques were a very poor way of approaching women and that it was used as a way to hide and protect yourself and to mask your shame. In that book Mark showed me that while much harder than using lame pick up techniques that expressing my vulnerability and being more direct were often the more successful route to take in the long run. Less than a year later I found an amazing woman and married her in many ways because of Mark's book. The only way to win "The Game" was to leave it.<br/><br/>Now he has (finally!) released his second book and I'm happy and amazed to say that it's actually a much better book than Models. While that books target demographic is men this book could and in my opinion should be read by everyone. One thing this book is not though is your typical self-help book. Walk into any book store and you'll find shelf after shelf of books with smiling toothy looking gurus on the cover looking like the perfect embodiment of human achievement. I don't know why but I always felt uneasy with books like this (It's the same feeling I get from being around used car salesmen). But when you look inside the covers its all the same generic b.s. advice. Be positive, fake it till you make it, visualize, find your power animal. After reading about a hundred of these books I can tell you that about 90% of what's in them doesn't work, or at least doesn't work very well. This book however is very, very different.<br/><br/>Turn to the contents page and you'll find chapters titled: Don't Try,  Happiness Is A Problem,  You Are Not Special, The Value of Suffering, You're Wrong About Everything (But So Am I), Failure Is The Way Forward, The Importance of Saying No, and lastly my favorite chapter, And Then You Die. A Tony Robbins book this is not and you know what? That's a great thing. Despite the depressing sounding chapters this book will give you one counterintuitive technique after another of ways to let your problems go (your problems aren't special either), truly improve your life and your correct your values. Give it a try and give those other self-help books the bird because I think Mark has really given us something special with this one. There truly is value in suffering and just try and not be motivated by meditating on your own mortality.<br/><br/>So like 2011 when Mark helped me out of my PUA phase I feel this book really has helped me out of my constant reading of superficial self-help books and truly helped me identifying and seek out things that I believe matter in life. In short this book absolutely deserves to be read and in my opinion it should be read way more than just once.
 Very thought provoking. Like thermodynamics, I am going to have to read it several times before I really get it. However, the jest of it is practical Buddhism in layman's terms. Essentially; we are masters of our own experience by choosing our values and what we care about and keeping those values in perspective with our inevitable demise (which actually, like good and evil) gives all meaning to life and experience. Some very interesting points made about living better by intentionally limiting experiences (values) and challenging ourselves. The point of life is in the struggles we chose for ourselves (values). One of the more comprehensive self help books I have read and it will likely have lasting effects on my own life. I plan to re-read. There was, what I perceived to be a contradiction in the end about the problem of "immortality projects" and then the most important question in life being what your legacy is, but otherwise the arguments in this book were fascinating.
 I enjoyed this book so very much. It’s a no nonsense, tell it to you how it is book. From the title you can presume that there are swear words in it and it makes it all that much more entertaining. I felt so at home while hearing this book. It was like I’d come across a kindred spirit.<br/><br/>The author comes to a few conclusions that really rang home with me. Most, if not all, conclusions are drawn from his life adventures/experiences. I loved that he didn't try to force feed me life decisions that ‘should be made’. He would explain what happened to him, how he came to that conclusion and why it would be beneficial to me to try and come to that same conclusion. At the end of the day, he says he’s no life coach. He’s just a guy who gave everything up to write and he’s lucky enough to have earned a living doing it.<br/><br/>I can safely say that I want to read more books by this author. I’ve read one book and I’m officially intrigued. The writing was very good and it was a very relaxing book to get into (please consider that I listened to the audio book).
 Unfortunately, the book did not make a big impression. Many concepts are distorted, information is submitted in the form of denial, although it affects the critical values ​​of life, it is not said what to do next, I already know what my problems are in life, I was waiting for a solution, but it is not there. Much water is the essence of the whole book can be placed on two pages. The book has a rebellious spirit, which is likely to be appreciated by people under 25, but what's next? Such a feeling that this is not a book about an article written by a good copywriter who immerses you your inner world and makes you feel the pain, and then nothing ... There is no solution, those who start the path to themselves are likely to get more confused than find a way out. Sent a request for a refund of my money.
 Manson is a mess of contradictions, and that's what's so great about this book. Like all of life, it contradicts itself. Constantly. Why should you read it? Because it tells you to get comfortable with those contradictions. They're not going away. In fact, the more you embrace them, the more fulfilled you'll feel. This isn't a book about how to make yourself happy. This is a book about how to stop making yourself miserable. And what is telling you is right– you'll feel better about yourself when you follow his advice. Even when it's dead wrong. Because life is full of contradictions.
 So, I gave into all the hype and decided to give this book a gander - and I was pleasantly surprised! I'm typically not a fan of self-help, but I found this particular book to be "different" than most self-help, and it seemingly had a lot of relevance to my life.<br/>As a person who overthinks most situations and worries about things that probably aren't worth worrying about, the logic of not caring rang true to me. While Manson states that a lot of the thought processes he is emphasizing is counter intuitive, I found the entire thing to actually be very intuitive and the logic sound.<br/>I recommend this read to anyone - while I don't think people can inherently change, they can certainly change how they approach situations, and this can lead to a happier being.
 I purchased the audio version and the reader  was annoying to say the least. At the end of the book I got this uneasy sense that what I had just listened to was missing something... it felt superficial??
 You probably don't know me, but if you did this book is exactly what you'd expect I'd produce during an all night drinking bender. The reason -- the ONLY one I can think of -- this book is as popular and well-reviewed as it is comes from its "click-bait" of a title. Clearly, the emphasis was put on marketing and turning a profit, not actually educating or enlightening anyone with any independent or original ideas.<br/>I mean, it's so lacking of substance and yet chock full of eye-rolling content I almost WANT you to read it. At least, a few pages so you'll see what I'm talking about. Then, feel free to toss into your neighbor's shredder, if they have one.
 I think the kid did a good job of maturing earlier than most of us did.  He traveled more than most do in a lifetime and my take is that he looked at it more as drifting than traveling for enlightenment.  That of course is just my opinion.  I was a young officer in Vietnam so I had to grow up fast as well.  I'm much older and I think he learned more quickly than most due his experiences that most don't get at such a young age.  Good reading for the younger generation I would think.  Most or at least many of us figure this out by the age of 40.  He was a quicker study due to his travels methinks.
 This book is pretty much worthless.  It is simply common sense rewound in a form that makes it catchy and marketable.  I haven't cared about things for a long time.  Does it take a book for me to figure out to make that decision?
 There are tiny nuggets of wisdom lost in a sea of blithering nonsense. The lack of any substantial education in psychology becomes apparent quickly. As if that is not bad enough, the author often presents issues as black and white. According to Manson in there are two kinds of people, those who think they are deserving and those who do not. That is it. No spectrum here.<br/><br/>He also gifts people with thoughts he could not possibly know, makes outrageous generalizations, inadvertently outs himself as a misogynist, and uses way too much profanity at the beginning of the book. Instead of seeing this overdose of profanity as cool, I began to see Manson as someone who is still suffering from a case of teenage rebellion.<br/><br/>Fortunately the overdose of profanity slows to an acceptable amount as the book goes on. Unfortunately he knowledge of psychology becomes more and more obvious.
 Perhaps I would have liked this book more at 25. Many of the insights feel obvious now as I’ve transitioned to adulthood. The book is heavy on personal anecdotes and uses historical examples or research sparingly. This, coupled with a loose and, at times overly vulgar righting style, undermines some of the self help tropes the author hopes to get across.
 The book started off excellent. Funny, fresh, full of great insights delivered with irreverence and wit. However, it started to turn sour around the time he implies that most women who remember sexual abuse were not really abused and maybe it's because of their militant feminism or because they "turned" lesbian. He says the statistic that 1 out of 3 women are sexually abused has been widely debunked (in fact it is still cited by many organizations, including the National Sexual Violence Resource Center) and that thousands of therapists were found to have implanted false memories of sexual abuse in their patients, without giving any evidence or citation.<br/><br/>I'm sure there have been such cases, but far, far more people have actually been and continue to suffer sexual assault and it is irresponsible to imply that this is not the case. He seems far more sympathetic to men who have been accused of sexual assault than the victims (a term he disparages). He could have used any number of other stories to prove his point about your memories not being 100% reliable. Why did he choose this story?<br/><br/>His repeated dismissal of people who may be offended by racists or other bigots as being "entitled" is also troubling. That's his blanket term for anyone with any problem. Maybe because he felt he was entitled as a young man, he assumes other people are entitled. No, some people are actually oppressed and some people are very empathetic to others' suffering and we don't want to condone or be blasé to oppression.<br/><br/>He gives out the tired advice of "do what you love." As a white male who grew up in a wealthy family, he could afford to quit his job/school and become a full-time blogger. He doesn't consider that many people, in our society of unprecedented wealth and income inequality, do not have the luxury to do this. He says he was poor and had to couchsurf for years; this sounded like hyperbole to me. I'm sure those were nice couches (or spare rooms) and he could have asked his parents for money if he wanted to.<br/><br/>Another sign of the author being blind to his own subconscious bias is when he refers to a woman at a party as "the Asian girl". He does not mention the race of anyone else in the whole book but he calls this woman "the Asian girl" twice, for absolutely no apparent reason. It is totally irrelevant to the story.<br/><br/>Overall, I was very disappointed by this book, which started off great. I suspect that 99% of people who gave this book 5 stars is white upper middle class and mostly male. If you have been sexually abused, if you are a person of color or from a disadvantaged background, you probably will not resonate with this author.
 Well, I've read just about every personal growth and self-help book around and while lots of this book is just plain common sense it's nice to hear a repetitive voice reminding you of what you already know in your heart but don't practice enough. Clearly this author has been through therapy to work through issues and shares his knowledge with the rest of us who need it as well.<br/><br/>"Outrage porn" I'm so glad it's got a name!!!!<br/><br/>There are times in the book that I feel like he minimizes child abuse and molestation but you know that they say: Take what you can and leave the rest. All in all it's worth the read.
 While my age and upbringing dictate that I be uncomfortable with the language in the book; I understand the novelty of it's use and how that novelty can be attractive to potential readers. But, this book has real substance hiding beneath the expletives. I almost gave up on it mid-way through, because I found the "offensive" language to be used so gratuitously that it seemed un-necessarily childish at times. But the philosophical insights came through in a big way for me as the ideas of the book coalesced.<br/><br/>The premise that spoke to me the most powerfully was; that everyone, no matter what the particulars of their life, has problems and will always have problems. And the key to a happier and more fulfilling life is not to attempt to create a problem free existence; but to orient your life in a way as to choose better problems; problems that you are capable of handling with less anxiety and stress. Sounds awfully simple, but I sure never thought of it !!!<br/><br/>Bottom line; If you can deal with the immature language, this book has solid wisdom for life purpose and direction.
 This is one of many books telling you how to think and decide your way to a better life. Where it differs is by using lots of foul language. I think that detracted from the main message which was to not care about unimportant things or stuff you can't control. Hardly groundbreaking and far from counterintuitive. Bottom line: there are lots of other better books which cover the same topics, albeit without an expletive in the title.
 I must say I entered this book with very high hopes.  I care about too much and needed some help learning to care about that right things and let the wrong things go. While I like some of the ideas and concepts, I felt like I, personally, was left with a long road to go to get there. That was probably more of a fault of mine than it was the book (probably unrealistic expectations on my part).<br/><br/>The book was pretty somber. I had hoped, along the way to letting go of crap, that I'd feel a tone change or even an emotional change. Neither occurred.<br/><br/>It didn't help that I was looking for this book to magically start healing years of issues, depression, anxiety, and instantly feel better.
 Having read many self help books, I would rank this one at the bottom of all. I find other books like the four agreements, the alchemist, you are a bad ass to be much better books. The book has author’s opinionated view of what success and happiness should be and recommend you to follow when in reality the definition of happiness and success may be different from one person to another. Also the book talks about the concept of death that makes some people to change for a better, which is similar to what other old selfhelps books have already talked about.
 I  really didn't take away any thing useful from this book.  A waste of $14.00 and my time.  The most interesting thing about this is the book cover.
 I listened to the Audible version of this book and, what the royal f$#@k.  I enjoyed it SO MUCH. Way too much to admit without jealousy that the author is younger than me yet so wise.  It really put some thing in perspective. My husband already doesn't give a bleep about much but this has helped me understand why I give so much bleeping bleeps about so much that I really shouldn't.  Glad I listened to it.
 I am rather selective about the books I read, and therefore, rarely give bad reviews. This book is ok. It has some good advice, and some bad. I call this book a "bible" for the masses, as it teaches you to be content of where you are. Perhaps, a good path to happiness, or perhaps not. I think being content of where you are equals stagnation. A person always needs something better to look forward to, and to be motivated for personal growth. This book also goes in circles and sometimes doesn't make sense. The author definitely has a skill of making everything seem a true even if one statement contradicts another.
 This book was recommended by a friend and I was pleasantly surprised. Based on the title alone, I thought the book would be amusing but trite -- and while it was quite entertaining,  the book is anything but trite. There is a depth and insight in it that sneak up on you, then wake you up with a hard slap. As I am always in the process of reading 3-4 books at time, it usually takes me weeks to complete a book, and there are many I simply skim and never truly complete, but in the week since I started this book, I abandoned all others until I finished it. It was a page turner that struck me at my core. It is a must read for anyone and everyone. And if you don't like curse words, and that's your reason for avoiding this book, you need to read it more than anyone else. Substitute whatever words you want and get through it. I guarantee what you will learn will be worth the effort.
 This guy’s voice and prose are so unendingly cringe inducing. It’s like having a college sophomore frat boy tell you how to be happy... and we all know how smart 20 year olds are. Not to mention their writing skills. Chock full of painfully predictable analogies and metaphors. This guy read “Fight Club”, had someone once drunkenly explain a bit of the misogynist Bukowski to him and thought, “These guys are awesome! And I can do that too!” To use his favorite word: f*** this guy and his terrible writing.
 If this is a "self-help" book, it's amateur.  It's more like a philosophical rant.  Don't expect to walk away from this a happier or better person.  That being said, it could be a useful philosophy for anyone who's under 25 or so.  But for any actual adjusted adult, it comes off more like chicken soup for the soul with lots of bad language thrown in to the anecdotes to make it stand out.  But as far as actual substance... meh.
 The book lost steam toward the end and probably could have been quite a bit shorter and still make its main points. Even so, the novelty and insightfulness of the book's main messages make this as easy 5-star rating for me. No matter where you are in life, I think this book could be meaningful for you...read it!
 Mark Manson's book will tell you not what you want to hear, but what you need to hear. This book will anger you, it will depress you, and it will inspire you. However, most importantly, it will make you think. It will make you think about things you've never thought about, and things you probably don't want to think about, and that's okay. In fact, it's not only okay, it's important. I will most likely reading this book again when I have the chance to take notes, as it is definitely worth paying more attention to the things said here.
 As someone who recently lost my beloved mother, I have been reading books that help me look at myself and at my life.  This book is amazing, Mark Manson is a modern time philosopher, who has written a truly insightful book.  I love the concept of values and metrics that he has incorporated into this book.  You choose what you the items of what to give a f-*k about, we have only one life to live and death is unfortunately inevitable, but its really about how you choose to live your life.
 This book is important because it tells us the hard truth that some of us don’t want to hear. It gives us practical ideas to filter the noise and focus our energy on people and things that truly matter.<br/><br/>One of my fav lines from the book:<br/><br/>‘Everything worthwhile in life is won through surmounting the associated negative experience. Any attempt to escape the negative, to avoid it or quash it or silence it, only backfires. The avoidance of suffering is a form of suffering.’ – Mark Manson<br/><br/>This year was tough for me but like Mark said, it is the difficult experiences that make you a better person. So in restrospect, this year was great for my values as a human being. It is okay to live in our discomfort! I’ve read many books this year and this one is my favorite, it was recommended to me by a friend. I’ve recommended to many of my friends.
 A great book, a must read for most every human being who wants to learn how to be happier and not get so worked up over everything.  A sadly lacking skill in this day and age!  My only complaint was that I ended up with a larger print version, and that was not mentioned on the page when I bought it.  I don't need a larger print (and it means I'm turning pages even faster, as I read rather fast), so it was more an annoyance than anything, but just check what version you are getting!!
 Reading Mark Manson's blog helped me through one of the darkest periods of my life. Now that I'm better, I did not immediately zip out to read his book, but got to it eventually and of course, it is full of Manson's usual unusual take on, well, everything. Well written, witty, clever, and insightful, I cannot think of anyone who would not benefit from reading this book. And rereading it. I'm going to let this first reading soak in for a few months and then I'm going to reread it.
 First of all the title gives you an idea of how the book will start off. If you are easily offended by use of fowl language you will not get past the first two chapters of this book.<br/><br/>Aside from that note. I have read over 30 self help books due to my previous employment in the Behavioral Health Field.<br/>This is one of the best books that I have read about mind setting. If you can get past the language their is a lot of helpful and useful information in each chapter. Although I do believe that some of the main points could have been made without the language, I did not write the book.<br/><br/>The main point however is made. You have a limited amount of time here on Earth. So stop getting so caught up in the little things that do not matter and focus your care and attention on those things that do.
 Audio version, which is well read.<br/>Mark's book resonates in reminding me of what I've learned through therapy, books and life experiences. If you've never journeyed into therapy then this will be new to you. If you've done therapy work this will be a good refresher in a cut-the-crap way. This is truth telling with no sugar on top that makes life's roller coaster a little less jerky. It is succinct, thought provoking and laugh inducing. He takes sound advice, wraps it in humor and serves up f***worthy information.<br/><br/>Mark, I enjoyed listening while hiking with my rescued dogs. As soon as it ended I started it over. I wish you well in your journey!
 This book is not relevant to women in their 30's, that's for sure. Jennifer Anniston boobs, really??? I had purchased the audible version because the sample seemed very nice, an account of life of William James, but the actual book is very crappy, to say the least. Reminded me of an angry man I met while waiting for the bus, the man kept ranting non-stop about life and about how the world is out to f@ck him. This guy must be his brother, hahaha. Save your audible credits, ladies!
 Great book!! Mark Manson has a clever and humorous tone throughout the book and gets a great message across to his readers.  He basically says that reading self-help books that tell you to do affirmations won't work.... it all comes down to what YOUR VALUES are.  I had this audiobook playing in my car and even my husband really liked it.  He then downloaded the book and has since told many of his employees to read it as well.  If you are looking for a no-b******* approach to reclaiming your happiness then buy this book!
 I found this book to be charmingly inept or deceptive (depending on the author's real intentions) at what it claims to be. It IS a self help book and DOES try convincing you that you can have a better life by doing certain things that have worked for DROP NAME HERE. From "don't try" it goes pretty effing fast to "try very very hard". There is some good stuff in there though. I appreciated the following chapters/ideas:<br/><br/>The responsibility/fault phallacy.<br/>The failure/success paradox<br/>The do something principle<br/><br/>though I couldn't help thinking I had read those already somewhere else. "Victimhood chic" is a shrewd term for a psychological phenomenon I've observed many times. Well coined. It's a page turner for sure: I read in about 3 hours. Being a generation older than the author, I must disappoint him on one of his assumptions: as you grow older, you don't really grow wiser. You mostly grow older.﻿ But I can take a lesson or two from him: how to get rich quickly. And that's by choosing an effing smart title for an an average book, catchin my eye while waiting for my delayed flight.
 Just, very well done.  I...like advice.  I gravitate towards it and have read a good deal of it.  This is the first book I’ve read where throughout I felt humbled by this author’s intellegence and profundity.  He combines writing skill and a very strong idea about what he wants to communicate; and what he wants to communicate is well digested by a very seasoned and powerful mind.  This is one of the most profound experiences I’ve had with a personal philosophy (self-help) book.  If you have any desire to read anything on this subject—I could not recommend this more highly.
 OK, so with this title, I was expecting something feisty that would grab me by the unmentionables. Unfortunately, it's all downhill after the headline. Clickbait in a binding? While I can subscribe to many of the author's points, I found the approach rather shallow and wishy-washy. I wanted a hot curry and got cold gruel instead. In fairness, some of the sections are amusingly constructed, but some of them are also nauseatingly sentimental. Three stars is about the best I can do on this one, I'm afraid.
 This book takes a much needed departure from the scores of other self-improvement books. Almost all the other books talk about how you (the reader) is unique /special / divine entity - one of a kind in the universe .. blah.. blah..<br/>This book instead brings the reader back to reality by bluntly stating that:<br/>* one is just another guy/girl<br/>* good and bad things will happen to you. What reveals your character is how you react to it<br/>* happiness comes from solving problems<br/>* stay away from victim hood cliches<br/>* it is ok to fail... as long as you learn something from it
 This book was full of f*** words. I was shocked that someone would want this as a Christmas gift. I got this on a wish list, for someone for secret santa gift, oh goodness, what was she thinking? I should have autographed my book and sent it to her inside.
 ...but absolutely hated it to the point that I couldn't finish it.  The information was highly conflicting, pretty much irrelevant and trite.  There was nothing in this book that resonated with me at all.  Anyone who has delved even slightly into the vast self improvement  arena of self help books will cringe at the odd examples offered to back up his point of view.  I get that this is supposed to be delivered in a "hip" and sardonic fashion, and the narrator was better suited for something completely different...like a family comedy or something similar.  Pass.
 Despite a ton of verbiage and simplistic message, this book is a must read for our entire generation of 30 year olds who expect that life will be great at all times and that positivity is a necessary component 24/7. These same people who get anxious and depressed when life isn't roses 100% of the time. Our entire generation is coddled and the minute things start to suck (as they always do), we go to self help guru or a shrink. Read this book instead and embrace your struggle. Nothing is wrong with you if you are anxious, you don't need meds every time you have a bad day. Embrace the shit life throws at you and deal with it.
 I have read many,many books in the self help genre but this one -this one- was as if it was written by someone looking right into my head and clearly enunciating the inner issues I didn't know how to define but which I knew were killing my ability to live a satisfying  life.<br/><br/>In reading many books trying to cure my fear of failure and persistent inaction I was heading in the exactly the right direction and the wrong direction at the same time.<br/><br/>It turns out I was looking all the time for validation and certainty. But uncertainty as I have learnt from this book has so much to offer - and I have a stack of it already!<br/><br/>I recommend this book for anyone who feels 'stuck' in life, overwhelmed to the point of inaction perpetually, and who feels like everyone else is succeeding, while they can't seem to get the hang of living and always 'stuff it up'.
 A prime example of the “ Dumbimg down of America “
 If I could rate this book a zero, I would. This book may have a catchy title, but the content does not live up to it. It is a bunch of nonsense, stupid stories and goes nowhere. The author is cocky and immature and has no place giving anyone advice. I couldn't finish to book as it was too painful to read. Don't purchase as you'll be wanting your money back,
 I listened to the adioversion and absolutely loved Mark Mansons voice.<br/><br/>Some takeaways I have from the books are:Problems never stop. We need to learn to face the problems we face. Life isn’t peachy.  We need to stop wasting time on things we can’t change. The only person we have control over is ourselves.<br/>He also talks about finding one purpose and going after that. Life will hand you pain and loss, but You get to choose how you handle all situations.<br/><br/>Lastly, stop wasting energy on things you can’t control. You only have one life to live.
 I would highly recommend this book and I wasn’t even looking for it. To cut a long story short, I ran into this book, noticing it’s amazons top #2 and seeing that someone in the reviews got a tattoo because of this book, I had to check it out.<br/><br/>I don’t want to say it was life changing, but it kind of was. I’m the type of person who likes to stay in his comfort-zone. I’m afraid of failure, thus, afraid to do anything without even noticing I’m doing it. This book has inspired me to just get up and do something, to face my fears and embrace them. Because that’s the only way to grow, to learn, and improve.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this book because even though I read it out of sheer interest, I learned a lot about my self that I never realized. And that’s the great thing about this book, I believe it has something for everyone (as long as you don’t mind some of the language used). It’s a great book, quick to read, lots to learn from.<br/><br/>Buy it!
 I’m forcing myself to finish it. Not impressed at all yet. I’ve been into personal development for a few years now and I feel like he means well in his writing but he seems to be contradicting a lot of important lessons I’ve learned from other amazing authors. Like when he says that seeking any way of developing yourself means that you must feel like you lack something, so don’t try. Or stop giving an eff about your goals because one day you’ll realize you won’t cure cancer and that’s okay... ?
 This book was written by a blogger so I really didn't know what I expected.  It is the most shallow scraping of the surface of complex emotional responses to any situation and a complete waste of time.  This is a self help book for people that really don't want to help themselves.<br/><br/>Buy and read Jordan Peterson's 12 Rules for Life instead and actually get into the depths of your mind.
 I thought this book was very poorly written. I would donate to the library but they probably wouldn't accept it due the title.
 I listened to the audiobook. The author makes some good points, and sometimes he's funny. But he draws on sources without giving credit. At times he's too self-congratulatory and tries too hard to be witty and clever. It comes across as a little desperate and contradicts the central argument of the book. He also tries to address psychology (treatment, diagnoses) and comes across as amateurish. There is something to be said for getting the proper education on a topic before trying to be an authority.
 He is an entertaining writer, but lacks perspective.  This isn't surprising, since he was maybe 30 years old when he wrote this book.  His "expertise" comes from blogging and traveling the world on his parents' dime.  If you look through his blog you can also see that he has had little experience in long-term relationships, and that he has a very immature view of India (which makes me suspect his perspective on travel to other places).<br/><br/>This is a child with a lot of skill in writing.  Read for entertainment, but he's not a credible source of advice in how to live one's life.
 I really wanted to like this book and was excited to read it. Unfortunately it was very dissapointing. The concepts don't really flow or make sense and are sticked together with F*** words...very annoying and hard to follow after a while. I read the whole book hoping to find some good nuggets, since saw all the raving reviews. Save yourself some time and find some better content. Waste of time.
 The author could have written this book as a one page blog article, except its filled with his personal examples and war stories to reinfoce the simple notion of not sweating the small stuff.<br/><br/>Pretty much a scam to get your money and then try to sell you on the subscription on his website
 The author describes his work as a "Self-Help book for people who hate Self Help books." This book articulates a value system to which I subscribe. Despite the title, the key is to figure out what is worth caring about. It is written like a conversation with a wise friend who is part smart ass, part great philosopher. The hard truths he walks readers through are self-evident but need to be said.<br/>1. Take responsibility for everything, regardless who is at fault.<br/>2. Recognize the existence of uncertainty and acknowledge one's ignorance.<br/>3. Be willing to discover mistakes in failure to improve.<br/>4. Embrace rejection, the ability both to say and hear no.<br/>5. Contemplate one's mortality.<br/>The author is somewhat of an enigma. He writes frequently and requires users to subscribe (pay) for his writings. He is brutally honest, has great ideas, and uses Wordpress (of course)!
 I didn’t just grab this book off a shelf. I am a big fan of Manson and his teachings. He seems to be better at telling men how to pick up women than he is at telling people how to live their life. The problem with this book is that there are no real solutions. Of course there are some things that we should care about and some we should not. We are not bound to material things and we’re all going to die. Manson tells a few interesting stories, but he fails to connect them to the points that he is trying to make. Telling someone to not give a f is not telling them HOW. There was not enough content to warrant a book. Manson does better with articles. He can present snippets of information in an entertaining way. The main point from his book that I enjoyed was that there will always be suffering and problems to solve. You have to find what you are willing to suffer for and what means enough to you to devote your focus to. This book strips away the trivialities of life and asks you to zero in on what is meaningful. You have to set values for yourself and take responsibility for what happens to you and how you react. Basically we know nothing, we’re all going to die, and none of it matters.
 Worst way to waste your money  ... what a pitty and depressing concept to discuss...
 This book was sort of life changing... SORT OF ... the concepts weren't really revelations but the whole "Snap Out Of It" delivery was very effective to getting me moving (rather than feeling a little indecisive or lacking confidence). The narrator's imitation of male and female people being quoted is a little hilarious in how bad it was, but it gave me something to laugh at.<br/><br/>Definitely recommend this book for people who can't get out of their own heads - #SnapOutOfIt
 I found this to be easy to read.  I see the use of the f-word as just an artifice of the author.  I found the author's point of view to be from a very mature perspective that he espouses as wise to consider.  Overall, I thought the author's viewpoints were oriented toward younger people than an old person like myself.  He discusses many things that I have found wise to adapt in my life.  I recommend this book for young people.  The title was, I thought, not very cogent.
 To all ;those who gave this book one star:  Yes, there's profanity, sometimes juvenile humor and the content is an eclectic mix of various teachings. But it covers a lot of ground in a short book. My favorite part was his analysis of the epidemic of entitlement in our culture, especially among the young who were subjected to programs to enhance self-esteem in schools and sports programs.  As could have easily been anticipated, the programs were failures that at worst created a large group of people unable to handle criticism and different points of view.  I believe they call them "snowflakes".
 This book completely changed my entire perspective. I bought it on a whim, thinking it might help me deal with my struggles at work. I did not expect it to change the way I look at every struggle I have ever faced. Everyone should read this book. They should teach this book as part of a mandatory course in colleges. It's a quick read and very straightforward, but it makes you think long after you turn the last page.
 This book has changed my life.  I now understand why I have never actually fulfilled anything in my life.  I was materialistic and self centered.  I never respected other people and could hardly care for myself.  This book will make you ask yourself some hard questions about yourself if you are going through a really tough time.<br/><br/>My darkest days that questioned the man I became this book got me through.  I understand it's a simple starting point and I have more work to do on myself.  But this has given me my ambition back, made me realize that I am to experience pain and I am not special.<br/><br/>I wrote these morals down after reading this book.  They are for me to now lead my new life by.  I will fail each and every one of them.  I now accept the failure and welcome it and will try again.  These values will help me.  Not money, status, or popularity.<br/><br/>Be a better uncle<br/>Be a better son<br/>Respect the boundaries of others<br/>Stop comparing yourself<br/>Stop talking... listen<br/>Find Yourself<br/>Give up your self entitlements<br/>Pain is needed for change
 Could have been a fun read when I was 20, but at 50, this immature, void of research, self-absorbed, self-aggrandizing ramblings packaged as a philosophy breakthrough is unbearable. Couldn't finish it.
 Happiness is not the absence of problems; it's the act of making progress on a problem (or several) you care about. Which is to say, pick your problems ("f***s given") wisely, cultivate beginners mind (accept that you're always at least a little bit wrong), and fail your forward (experiment, get feedback, and rinse and repeat).<br/><br/>The above themes, as you can already see are not novel. However, Mark Manson does an excellent job of packaging them into an entertaining (and yes, vulgar and funny) narrative.
 This book has a great start, it is counter-intuitive, and it's the Fight Club punch in the face I was looking for. Then I'm not sure what happens but the author decides to write the rest of the book in very familiar self-help territory. His original thesis falls apart as he discusses how failures are good, and that when people fail, it's because their values were bad, which is still good, because you are failing. But you need better values. His personal story emulates his hero Tim Ferriss but he lacks Ferriss' discipline and self-awareness.  He tells his life story to make some points about how he's settled down as his values have changed, but it really sounds more like he misses his old, awesome life.
 I love this book and it’s likely that the people who actually need to read this never well. I hope the people who do read it remember the takeaways and take note of their own actions and emotional intelligence to live a life of meaning. I love the last chapter, standing of the edge, staring into death. It’s those moments of looking into the beyond that help us see how beautiful life is.
 It’s kind of like someone yelling in your ear to wake the frack up.  If you feel stuck in life, reading this book might help inspire you to stop worrying about the little crap that doesn’t matter to us really, and pay attention to the crap in our lives that does matter.
 While it is true that Mark Manson does drop the F bomb more than your average self help book, I think you need to get past the first couple chapters before you really get down to the point of the book and past the gimicky title that made you purchase the book in the first place.<br/><br/>A friend of mine read the book before me (I’m not sure if she finished it) and mentioned that the book read like life advice from a privileged white male. I decided to read this book for myself, though I will say that this perspective lingered in my mind the whole time. I think Manson acknowledges his own privilege in the book and forces the reader to acknowledge their own privilege, if they have not already.<br/><br/>While Manson discusses entitlement in a variety of faucets I think that this book, if you can get past the first few chapters, offers a perspective on simplifying and identifying values that are worthwhile.<br/><br/>Definitely an entertaining read, but it wasn’t as though I couldn’t put the book down.
 After reading Robert Wright’s insightful “Why Buddhism is True” I thought this book would provide more about how evolutionary psychology can work against us as humans. This book rambled on with popular ideas about how to generally live a better life rather than cover the deep, intellectual  insights that Wright provided. I could have spent time better by reading Wright’s work again.
 Can't finish this book. Was highly recommended to me. Charles Bukowski is my favorite poet and I cannot get over the description of him that opens the book. Again someone misinterprets "Don't Try". If you look at his life you will see (as the book states) he tried and tried and tried. The meaning of Dont Try is based around art. Dont try to make art. Make art. It flows naturally. I dont see how Bukowski is the "loser" when he lived his life by his own terms. Sounds like a winner to me.
 This is basically an edgy self-help book. There's not much substance, and he doesn't really delve into any of the subtopics very deeply. Again, this book lacks substance and is more of a mental masturbation sort of book, the kind you read when you tell yourself on the New Year that you're going to change your life.<br/><br/>It's a fun read, don't get me wrong, but it's just sort of, kind of, lame.
 I listened to the audio version of this on Audible.  It's wonderfully read (with a few cringe-worthy voices), but more importantly, full of incredible self-revelations and ah-ha moments. It's funny, dark, and painfully honest about things. I am going to buy the hard copy so I can make notes and keep it forever!  I recommend this to anyone who needs/is ready for a wake-up call about how to live their life without the fear of others' opinions and with the ability to take responsibility and forgive the past.
 I like foul language as much as the next guy, haha, but the first chapter DOES get rather annoying. It's just too much...<br/><br/>After that, though, it was a fabulous book &amp; nothing like that first chapter. I like to listen to it every couple of months in the car, switching it out with a couple of other inspirational books after. Or Adam Carolla podcasts, haha. Overall, VERY good. Thanks!
 Don't sweat the Small Stuff with naughty words. Juvenile overuse of profanity for no other reason than in an attempt to be shocking.
 The Acknowledgements begin "This book began as a big, messy thing…".<br/>There it remains.<br/>If you're clever you might be taken in by its catchy title, like I was, or its seemingly endless mansplaining, sorry, prose, like I wasn't.<br/>If you're lucky, you might just be not clever enough to see through the ruse.<br/>Perhaps that's the point? Read the book until you stop giving a F*?<br/>Yeah… nah.<br/>But the cover is a really nice orange.
 How is he so smart? I'm a big fan of Tim Ferris' work, and I expected this to be 'Ferris lite' but it far surpassed anything that I found in the 4 Hour Work Week or any other similar book/podcast/blog article. I highly recommend.  The colorful language is strong in the beginning, but as the book goes on we go beyond shock value and into real philosophical meaning of life type stuff.  I highly recommend!
 This book seems to serve as a sole purpose of making an average thinker feel better about their self.
 I am a therapist and work with a lot of people in their late teens through early 30's. This book will be on the top of recommended reading list for so many in this age group. It sort of reminds me of an updated version of the Road Less Traveled but geared towards todays generation. It combines the right amount of hard hitting truths with interesting stories, and kept me engaged from start to finish. My only real gripe with book is that the title really doesn't do the book justice. It follows from the web blog but the book really offers much more. Yes, I agree with other reviewers that the book is somewhat of repackaging of various Buddhist and therapy concepts, but whats wrong with that? If it delivers the goods (and it does), so much the better.
 While the message is good, it is repetitive. It seems like it is meant for people who obsessively worry or are close to being depressed. This could have just been an article versus an entire book and it would have been just good enough.
 These are the words of the good friend who tells you some things you may not want to hear because, having been there, he knows. It may not be revolutionary, but it’s real. Not quite Stoic, not quite Buddhist, it’s more a fusion that makes for a compelling memoir. The overwhelming significance of the book for me is the honesty with which Manson shares his own experience ... that in itself is a powerful lesson.
 Love it so far! It’s a very realist view which I appreciate because I always want to stay grounded. It pulls the mask of fantasies and delusions of grandeur with an IN YOUR FACE real world point of view. Ima urbanite and a single parent, so I don’t subscribe to privileged thinking and neither does the author! Work, earn, eat! Flat out! And lose the woe is me along the way!
 This book certainly isn't like anything else I have read. The author presents a realistic, if not a dark look at cold reality, Example: Many people think they are special, but in reality most people are simply average. He then explains that if everyone were special, then being special would become the new average as the average would rise to the that level.<br/>The text is quite predictably full of profanity, which should not offend anybody who goes as far as to pick up the book with the obvious cover. If you would like to see a point of view on mankind what most other books never talk about, give this book a try.
 I like this book, and I like his reasoning, but some of the insight he offers seems to contradict itself.  I’ll highlight the three best points of this book, but also the contradictions associated with each.  I’ll also attempt to clarify each contradiction, based on what I think is the unstated point.<br/><br/>1.  You should not constantly care about making everything right, but should narrow in on the things that matter most.  Caring about everything constantly stems from a feeling of entitlement that you deserve to have everything right all the time, perhaps due to a glorified self-image or feelings that you deserve to be or need to be extraordinary.  Carrying oneself this way leads to feelings of inadequacy, and ultimately results in being upset about being inadequate, manifesting into a downward spiral of depression.  Alternately, one can and should avoid having a glorified self-image, but use the feeling of inferiority as the basis for improvement.  According to Manson, not only is this how you can become great at something, but it is also what leads to happiness, because happiness is based, in part, on feeling like you are solving your problems.  Contradiction: I find that he is coming down hard on feelings of inadequacy, but instead just advocating his own version of self-imposed inadequacy.  I guess he is saying that the feelings of inadequacy should come from yourself rather than from superficial comparisons.  This makes sense if he is saying that people should focus narrowly on the things they care about being inadequate about, rather than feeling inadequate about everything all the time.  However, acknowledging inadequacy is still an essential part of his equation.  He should clarify that taking ownership of the inadequacy, embracing it, and making sure it is properly focused, is what makes the difference.  Either way, I still appreciate his point.]<br/><br/>2.  Though you cannot do away with all your problems, and though you should not avoid confronting your problems, you can make choices that determine which types of problems you will be likely to deal with ("choosing your problems").  You should direct yourself to "choose the problems" which you are best fit to deal with (or even enjoy).   Contradiction: Choosing alternate problems seems like a way of avoiding bigger problems, and thus just another way of avoiding problems.  I think he is right that avoiding problems can lead to bigger problems down the road, and I think he also has a point about choosing the problems you want to deal with, but I’m not sure that always choosing a lesser or a different problem, like sucking it up as an alternative to confrontation, is constantly the best way to go, and seems like it might even perpetuate the types of denials and avoidance that he is warning about.]<br/><br/>3.  You can gauge your success at dealing with your problems by redefining what it means to be successful (“choosing your metric”).  At the same time, giving everything a positive spin is an improper way of dealing with adversity.   Contradiction: redefining your definition of success, per Manson’s recommendation, seems like a way of just giving things a positive spin.  Again, I see the value in what he is saying, but he needs to distinguish properly between these two points.  The warning against "positive spins" is probably against putting an unreasonably positive spin on something after the fact, and in turn, using this as a way to live in denial about adversity.  On the other hand, redefining one’s definition of success is something to be done before the fact, and to be used as a guiding principle, no matter whether the outcome is success or failure (though the proper guiding principle, should in theory lead to more instances of feeling successful).]
 I have been a proponent of the positive-thinking culture that has taken a stronghold in the recent years but this book flipped those ideas upside down.  Not to say I will disavow those ideas completely but this book gets to the heart of suffering which is inevitable for humanity.  The importance of being open and honest takes precedence over always trying to please others.  This book takes a humorous approach which makes it an easy and quick read.  It really made me reevaluate my life, as I try to take greater control of the decisions I make.
 You have never read a self-help book like this.  It is so funny, and good advice as well.  It is funny because the author writes in such a down to earth, crass style, with expletives saturating the book.  First quarter of the book made me laugh out loud quite a few times.  Then it starts to get more serious and redundant and a bit more tedious.  But generally very refreshing in it's originality.<br/><br/>I wish I knew why "The Disappointment Panda" has a "T" (instead of a "D") on his shirt  (p.27).  What is that supposed to stand for?  T-shirt?  Whatever.<br/><br/>The title of this book alone was genius-- when I saw it I knew I had to read it.  Mark Manson tells it like it is.
 Good message. Terrible book. It's cute for a couple pages but then goes on repeat. Mainly an exercise in writing "Not Giving A ..." as much as possible.
 The author is far from super successful, but felt he has something to share that could benefit others, and despite not having the fame attached, the book sold in surprising good numbers.<br/><br/>The advice is not original nor unique, young and privileged people who grow up in PC environment could benefit the most, but won't buy and read this book.<br/><br/>Although both preaching the need to embrace pain, I recommend this book over Angela Duckworth's Grit. If you are trying to mentor a Millennium, give her/him this book, much more approachable and less pretentious.
 Not inclined to take advice from anyone with more than a decade less life experience than myself, I was surprised to find Mr Manson's closet auto-biography-cum-life-manual both entertaining and insightful. If not exactly revelatory for those of us far from the millennial age bracket or who have read much of Mr Manson's source material along the way, his book - as the title conveys - still offers a pretty fresh, original slant on some sage life advice.
 Straw dogs and rants.  A trivialization of Buddhism.  I'm only in a few chapters but I'm irritated by this book.  Not sure I can make it through all the f---s.
 Awful title aside, this book has a great deal of value and merit. Because of its gross irreverence, it may reach an audience that would normally not be exposed to the messages of the great spiritual masters. I'm on my second listen and would highly recommend this book if you truly want to maintain peace and develop interior freedom.
 The only thing that I found intriguing about this book is its title. Beyond the cover this book is trash, a self-centered reflection of author's ignorance. I have a question for the author - Did your mother ever teach you how not to give up?
 This was given to me as a gift. I read this book very quickly, about a week. I really loved it. I will admit that I know a lot of what was in it. But, the way it was presented, the examples were given and the stories presented, it really hit home a bunch of times.  I really enjoyed this book and I really recommend it. You most likely will see yourself in the examples, which is nice to know there are other people out there like you. It really has taught me perspective and many lessons I hope to carry with me.
 I just finished (and thoroughly enjoyed) this surprisingly wise, insightful book. Instead of telling you not to care, this book emphasizes, along with other things, to pick just a few things to care about and let the rest just lie. Additionally, Manson whips together several other tangents on relationships, culture, and even death that are extremely funny and well-thought out. Overall, I highly recommend this read. Rating: A.
 This book is terrible. The advice is shallow, the writing is shallow, the use of expletives is gratuitous. There are some true arguments in the book, but nothing I haven't read in ten other self-help books -- at least those books didn't try to tell you they weren't better than the rest.
 This book was about as interesting as Tucker Max’s “I Hope They Serve Beer In Hell”, and in the same intellectual ballpark...both are face scrunching, guilty-pleasure obnoxiously funny in parts (one, because the author is truly clueless about human psychology, and the other, a disturbed dark savant of it that TRULY doesn’t give a f^€#), both make you want to toss them into the nearest wastebin most of the time, and both are certainly aimed at the closeted Type-B bro who had confidence issues when he was younger but now wants to kick serious Type-A @$$ in life. Carpe diem, bros. -Full stop-
 Contradicts his own premises consistently throughout the book. Low iQ self help for normies.<br/><br/>I would recommend something from Jung or a title like Meditations from Marcus Aurelius.<br/>Hard to sit through the entire book in audio format. If you are not very intelligent, self aware or are in high school this is probably a good book for you.
 Good advice for a middle-class American that is struggling to find happiness in the comfort of their white fenced homes, who are struggling to find happiness in what they have. The book talks about not caring about meaningless things, and focusing on the process. If you need to be reminded about taking responsibility for your life, understanding why uncertainty is better than trying to be right and how failure is important to succeed this is a good book to read. The biggest problem I had was with the hypocrisy of the author. Although the author talks about entitlement and how detrimental it can be, simultaneously he judges other cultures from an entitled position.<br/>As the book preaches, honesty is a great value to pursue, so honestly I would not read this book again, but if I was lost and confused in life it might be worth listening to instead of bad radio programs on the way to work.
 This book has a way better title than content. There isn't really anything new or interesting presented. It's easy to read and contains a few short stories from what you can tell the author believes is his super interesting life. There are a few reminders to center your life on your values and accept responsibility for your own life. Definitely wasn't worth my money and I was disappointed.
 Hey there,<br/><br/>I was plagued with codependency issues; brutal insomnia from anxiety and a bit of depression. I love how this book uses the right words and the right stories to let you in on the secret that nothing is really a big deal!  When I got to the end of the book I was sad that it was over. I use several of his lines as affirmations and the world has been a better place since.<br/><br/>This is a timeless vulgar masterpiece, Manson. I can’t wait for your next book!
 Typical self help fare. It starts off irreverent and edgy but looses its edge after a couple chapters and then falls into familiar self help and cognitive behavioral therapy concepts and even touches on Buddhist themes here and there. Nothing really new here. I was hoping for something different.
 I couldn't make it lol the way through. Waste of money. Waste of time. Recommend Tony Robbins over this.
 This book is crass and buries the stories in poorly written analogies. I guess if you DGAF, you will like it.
 What a wonderful find!  Mark introduced a new paradigm to me contrary to the way I viewed the life experiences &amp; how I understood what motivates behaviors.  He further gave explanations that felt right to me about life situations that I did not understand; myths I accepted as true.  I found validation for concepts that I intuitively felt to be true but needed someone to reinforce with a logical narrative.  I was so impressed with the teachings of the author that I had to keep looking at his picture &amp; marveling at his wisdom for such an apparently young man.  I will read again &amp; share with others.
 I have to agree with reviews that criticize this book for not really going into the depth. The book does lack that 'something' needed for a convincing argument. This isn't a self-help book, nor was I looking for one. I just picked up this book as a curiosity to find out what kind of angle the author would take with a relatively interesting title.<br/>The book has its moments. Some thoughts and statements are well stated in textually satisfying fashion. Also, the book does a good job of verifying things that many are already aware of. It organizes those thoughts for you and lays it down in words in a bold, punchy way. Therefore, I can see why some people would be moved by those emotions and end up liking the book so much.<br/>In summary, it feels more like a well written diary of a once troubled soul. However, if you are really looking to find out what the title of the book suggests, you will not be truly convinced.
 Purchased this as a gift for my mom as she had recently mentioned that she was getting worked up over small things.  She was thrilled with the book and found it rather funny and witty.  All in all I think the book went over well, but she did mention that it basically tells you things you already know, just with some slightly more colorful language.
 There were concepts that I hadn't given much thought to as well as some that were familiar. Although a few parts felt repetitive it wasn't overwhelming enough to keep me from finishing. As a 23-year old who felt pretty stuck, this book has been a great restart for me. It made me examine my current values and call myself out on my destructive ways, things I kept avoiding. Where a lot of self-help books focus on the positive, this one approaches problems in a somewhat opposite manner. Even with a forgetful mind like mine the lessons have stuck.
 I was lucky I did not have to buy the book, I thought let me borrow it from the library see if I like it first. Other than putty mouth and profanity, you get nothing, that is of course other than trash. I could not get though few pages, before almost puking from the vulgarity and the superficial nature of the contents. If you remove all the F bombs from the text, you probably get only 10 pages to read. If there was a possibility of giving this book less than 1 star or even below zero that would've been my choice<br/>No respect what so ever to the reader's mind, taste, sophistication or civility, in one word just obscene, and I have never said such thing about any book, period
 Somewhat life changing. It gave me so much freedom in my life! I made some great changes with one being not holding on to friendships that are adding to my life. I learned to prioritize my values and then not give a “care” about everything else. I wish there was an edited version of the audiobook haha. But I was able to take away great points. I feel like when he drops the F bomb he did it with more intensity than the rest of the words in the sentences lol
 Stop reading all self help books. And read this, I have read so many of them all just made me stop worrry for a awhile. When you start to not give F. Things automatically falls into place. And life is just so easy. I am not truly enjoying my life only caring about the things that are important in my life.
 A very quick read, but it actually could have been shorter. It has many of the hallmarks of popular self-help books: confidence, articulate but by no means a rigorous analysis (really makes some claims that should responsibility be cited or even supported), an expertise that's always taken as a given...so it's not really a book to recommend widely. Still, I'd say if you need a quick opinion piece that urges readers to look more deeply at what they value, then it might be a nice starter for those who don't want or need to put the effort into therapy. Maybe for a certain demographic or people with similar life circumstances it could be what they're looking for?
 The energy that Manson displays throughout the book kept me reading. Insightful, humorous and filled with plenty of details to make one think about their own set of values. While I get that he is trying to refute the notion behind positivity being healing and helpful, ironically this book is one that incites the reader to positively choose what to give a f*** about. Well played! A thought Manson shared that stuck out for me was his statement that we should not try to be special or unique. Of course not. We already are! Human beings are quite amazing! I have already given this book to my most important people and now have the perfect one-size-fits-all holiday gift! PS: Mark- what is the rest of the story about Erin?
 Read. This. Book. Manson drops a world of $*** right between your thinkholes and you've going left to do but think about it.<br/>I read it in one day and that's a lot. Normally I'm too lazy to even sit and follow words along a tablet screen on the weekend. This was a powerful and potent experience that you should sit back and force yourself to eat. (*Cue exploding man scene from Monty Python*) Besides, exploding afterwards is healthier than the cigarette you used to nail into your face.
 There is some decent information here, but the presentation is cringe inducing, and you can find the same information on free self help blogs.  I bought this as an audiobook, so the narration may have been part of what was off-putting.  It just sounded like it was written by a young fatboy or something, hardly the voice of wisdom.  It is like the author tried to combine a "how I got rich and you can too" book with a "stop worrying that you're not a millionaire" book.  When he gave "feeling Jennifer Aniston's t*ts" as an example of a life goal, I gave up entirely on the book.<br/><br/>It might be a good book for a 16-24 year old straight guy who wants to stop feeling self conscious and embarrassed at not being unrealistically perfect.  It reminded me of the content on the website Reddit.
 This book doesn’t promote absolute nihilism - not giving a crap about anything ever. Instead, it urges you to narrow down what you care about and stress over. To look to the things that really matter in life and save your f*s for that. It helped me deal with a lot of day to day issues and difficult personalities at work that were otherwise ginormous and anxiety provoking to me prior to finding this book. It reminded me to just let the small things go and even the big things are usually small too. It’s about perception. It’s an easy read as the author is a blog writer and it feels almost like you’re having a conversation with a friend as you go along. I encourage everyone to read this!
 The author has a wonderfully refreshing approach to self-help advice and does not harp on unrealistic concepts like "Anything is possible". Rather, if you do not mind the informal manner of narration and the mediocre, expletive filled language used, you may discover some wonderful concepts in the authors theory. More so, a lot of what is said is actually practically doable.<br/><br/>Also, the narrater for this book did a fantastic job! I loved his style of narration and the engagement he manages to bring in. The book wouldn't be half as interesting without his efforts.
 I want to echo some other reviewers' comments. The absence of a bibliography and footnotes did alarm me. The name drops must be his "research". But I would not call this book scientific. BTW  I picked this up at a bookstore when I had already read what I brought on vacation.<br/>BEcause I was off duty for my own clients, I found the book amusing. As a a person who likes evidence acknowledging the sources for his examples and stories would have been professional.
 Too profane for my test. This book is full of curse and profanity. The idea is great, may be the intended target is for ghetto, uneducated gang bangers.<br/>12/30/2018 - I rushed into writing comment after reading about 30 pages. This is a good book and don't get put off by the profane words which seems to be more around the first few pages. As you get deeper, it gets more mature and useful.  I just changed my review from 2 star to 5.
 Thins book speaks to you while you read it. I know that sounds cliche, but the book reads as if you’re listening to Mark speak. The message in the book is supported by stories, examples, and the barebones truth. It’s a message that seems weird to people, but it truly is a message that solves so many “first world problems” we find ourselves stuck in with today’s society and expectations
 Not a verified purchase as this was bought by a friend. I feel this book only gives a perspective from someone who's lived a life nothing like any normal/average human has lived; even though the whole premise is we are all average. He talks about how to not care about love, religion or dedication to things and to basically be a communist. He says he traveled 55 countries but isn't even 35. I'm not quite sure how that relates to people who can't afford to get an apartment or feed their kids. It's a severely extended chapter into 200 pages with a ton of common stories you can read free online with curse words spattered throughout and him gloating how cool he was till he got real happy by not trying anymore. Doesn't seem like anything other than one persons very unclear opinion. Just repeating "values and entitlement" every sentence. Read it and judge for yourself but I feel anyone who has any real problems in life would find this book counter intuitive to helping; as the title says.
 Very mediocre book. The only thing going for it is a clever title.  I like swearing as much as the next person (seriously I'm not a prude) but he definitely oversees the F word. He uses it so much it loses all meaning, and his messages make no sense. This book is the ramblings of a drunken frat boy.  I'm embarrassed I bought it.
 Loved it.  An American manual on Buddhism, which like most Americans gets the idea of pain and pleasure, happiness and suffering, but misses the real point, compassion and enlightment.  Instead, turning it into a sort of American anything goes existentialism of "Why bother" or "Who gives a f" which are cop outs.  None the less, an entertaining read.
 I divide this book into three parts: humor, self reflection, and letting go. Amidst all the humorous and well-placed f-bombs are undertones of Buddhism and deeper life lessons. A lot of this book is basically holding up a mirror and saying this is your problem, albeit in a refreshing delivery. A decent read and if you don't get anything out of it the title at least makes for a great conversation piece.
 I borrowed this book from a co-worker and the only thing I enjoyed about this book was reading all of the 1 Star reviews!! They seriously made all that wasted time worthwhile! They summarized everything I thought and felt so eloquently &amp; beautifully. I cannot believe the overall rating is so high. Shows you where our society is mentally &amp; emotionally, so sad... :(...
 What makes this guy an authority on views for which people would have to pay money for?  A better book would be titled "how do I make my youtube thoughts so popular that everybody jumps on the bandwagon to pay for them in written form".  You are all nothing but a bunch of self help junkies who are cheated by the colorful graphics of this book's cover.
 This book was awful. I dreaded reading it. It was a fast read. The beginning started out well and seemed interesting, but a few chapters in, you realize that this book isn't really going anywhere. It's superficial and sort of mindless. Just mindless drivel. The beginning part of the book was full of F-words, so many that they seemed over-the-top and out of place. The end of the book (the part about sitting near the cliff) was just cheesy. The author seems to lack any intellectual depth. The book might've had some good points but the author doesn't know how to convey them well or research them well; there was no depth. Seems like one of those pop-psychology books. This book might be appropriate for a teenager, but probably not an adult-level book. I'd skip it. Felt so lame reading it (lamer and lamer the more I read).
 I'm at a p!ace in life where what I'm doing isn't working.  I'm going to look at my values and how I measure them.  I'm going to question myself about everything.  I'm going to question what I give a f*ck about.  I feel a lot of this makers sense and is a reminder to takes hard look at yourself that's the only thing you can change.
 This is the brutal honesty that I respect, appreciate and needed. I think more people need this approach and reality check. I'm only half way through the book and I already feel a weight lifted off of my shoulders. I feel like it validates some of my already existing beliefs, provides me with new outlooks and insight and quite honestly is putting me back in my place. It's been humbling and I appreciate it. This is exactly what I needed and it's quite refreshing!
 When the author is already using foul language in the title, one can assume the content of the book is juvenile.  The *f* word is not a productive or meaningful word and certainly does not signify intelligence or wisdom.<br/><br/>(Read page 18 of the sample for a clear cut example.  Nothing with one *f* word is really worth reading, but this book clearly uses it to extreme excess, trying to grab a particular audience based on the inappropriate over use of this inane word. )
 This book has everyday wisdom about how to get past the obstacles we place in front of our own self to derail fulfilment.  This is an easy read which h is why I read it three times to really absorb the value of the words so artfully collected.  Whether you are in crisis or on the upswing this book has something which will enrich you and improve you.  Well worth the investment.
 This is an incredible book! It is truly a counter-intuitive approach to living a good life--but sometimes the counter-intuitive approach is the solution. Basically, embracing positivity can sometimes be negative, and embracing negativity can be positive. For example, "happiness comes from solving problems". He really strikes the fundamentals of living a good life by focusing on choosing the right values--ones that you can intrinsically control and that are good values to have, such as honesty. Manson distinguishes between "fault" and "responsibility", which makes taking responsibility seem easier and empowering. He includes personal anecdotes that would ordinarily seem embarrassing, but they are raw and transformative experiences that allow growth. I laughed and cried in this "self-help" book. It made me feel lighter. Incredible wisdom for a 33-year-old. Please read it.
 Mark Manson, star blogger and (from what I can tell from his list of previously published books) semi-reformed pickup artist, offers us this brief volume of profanity-ridden self-help advice, which can more or less be distilled into the axiom: Life is short and your emotional bandwith is limited, so spend both wisely.<br/><br/>As far as it goes, that's good - if obvious - advice. Manson expands in chapters on the value of failure and suffering, the importance of saying no and of realizing that you're not exceptional, and why happiness as an expectation is kind of a mindgame. (That last was my favorite, as it not only matches a deeply held personal belief of mine but came with the marvelous metaphor of the Disappointment Panda.) So basically Maron's offering Buddhism by way of Fight Club's "You are not a beautiful and unique snowflake" and Kirk from Star Trek V's "{Pain and guilt are} the things we carry with us, the things that make us who we are. If we lose them, we lose ourselves."<br/><br/>While the message itself is decent (if boilerplate), your enjoyment of this book will probably depend on how much you end up wanting to shoot the messenger. Manson, who's indubitably an entertaining writer, frequently comes off as privileged and smug, particularly in his semi-contrite humble-brags about the number of women he banged during his globe-trotting days, and I'm fairly certain the only psychology he really understands is of the pop variety. Still, the value of self-help books is in their beating you over the head with things you should already know but have either forgotten or chosen to ignore, and judged thusly Manson's Art is a wonderfully unsubtle reminder of why it's important to limit the f***s you give.
 “The desire to avoid rejection at all costs, to avoid confrontation and conflict, the desire to attempt to accept everything equally and to make everything cohere and harmonize, is a deep and subtle form of entitlement.”<br/><br/>This is just one of the gems this book is full of. I’ve had this on my list for a while and I should have read it earlier.
 "They say that a butterfly flapping its wings in Africa can cause a hurricane in Florida; well, what hurricanes will you leave in your wake?"<br/><br/>This is a book everyone should read.<br/><br/>An anti-self help novel, Mark Manson's book uses psychology, anthropology, philosophy, sociology, modern culture, Buddhism, and personal experience to bring to light how to live a good life. This novel is not for individuals looking for a quick dose of positivity, because Manson's book doesn't offer quick fixes. Instead, it showcases the depth of exploration, self-analysis, and world view changes needed to understand "there is nothing to be afraid of. Ever."
 Over entitled upper middle class guy reads a lot of Zen Buddhism/mindfulness and starts a blog so that he doesn’t have to find a 9 to 5 job. This book is the latest attempt at making money by just rewording wisdom we’ve known for centuries in a sarcastic and condescending way. Save yourself the headache/condescension and just look into mindfulness.
 I have been struggling with work and pleasing friends and family in certain ways. I can even say with fitting in with life’s norms throughout life. This book helped me to accept that I’m an individual. I don’t have to fit in with the norms, I don’t have to care about other people’s problems, pleasing my boss, and etc. The only negative is that he gave many story line examples that lost my attention at times but he dug in deep into self reflection and growth and I truly appreciated it.
 I loved it so much I'm reading it again!! His examples are relatable to everyone in some way, he speaks with a natural voice, and there's definitely no sugar-coating. You're forced to take a good hard look at yourself and really evaluate your life choices which, for me, there was a lot of palm-to-face moments...I'm a skeptic when it comes to self-help books because the uplifting unwavering optimism they give out is almost too fake for me to want to try their suggestions. This is the first one that actually stuck with me..I think it was the profanity..lol...definitely recommend!
 It’s definitely an anti-self help book.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this book.<br/><br/>The point is to focus on what really matters in your life and disregard the rest. It reminded me of “Don’t sweat the small stuff and it’s all small stuff.”<br/><br/>I think that this book would be very helpful to someone trying to figure out their meaning of life.
 This "masterful," "immensely thought-provoking" pamphlet is about as substantial as the orange orangutan. If you need vulgarisms to make it real for you, maybe you have gone down the wrong alley? Maybe you could set your electronic dildo aside for a few weeks and venture into the real world, where human apes have about as much cosmic relevance as avocados. Now maybe you're getting somewhere. My experience is hardly universal, but I humbly suggest that you do, in fact, give one. Because you only have one. And its transit is very brief. And when you are lying there on the slab, taking in your last glimpse around as you fade into the dark, you may find some small sweet consolation in understanding where your brief trajectory across the firmament fit into the story: what you did, what you left behind. It may not be much, but it will be more than this.
 It comes off like it was written by a kid who finished his first semester as a philosophy major and has it all figured out.  Skip this book and read the authors it references instead, like Alan Watts and Charles Bukowski.<br/><br/>I'm not above swearing, but an excess of it is just lazy writing.
 I couldn't put this book down.  I can't decide if it struck a nerve or sparked a fire in me.  The stories resonated and made you wonder how we get to this place of thinking happiness comes from external events and sources.  Since I read this book I have started asking myself why I measure myself against certain things.  I have started evaluating relationships and making better decisions on who I surround myself with and what is important to me.  The part of the book that struck me the most was talking about the Saver and the victim.  I am surrounded by so many people who need other people to meet their emotional needs and to be happy.  Thanks Mark Manson!
 Basically, this is like a Buddhism or stoicism repackages for today.<br/><br/>It is not bad. I took it up because I thought my self needed some help, but horrors, not self-help.<br/><br/>But it is not going to change my life. Makes you think. A bit. You too will die. And nothing matters.<br/><br/>But I already knew THAT. Convince the physiological process that drives my anxiety that, and we have a winner. Close, but so far away.
 This book is a disappointment. Leaving aside the obvious fact that the author randomly sprinkles swear words throughout the text in a misguided effort to somehow sound hip, the examples and lessons provided are obvious to anybody who made it past puberty. The author comes across as an extremely shallow and deeply annoying adolescent holding forth about his unique experiences.
 Starts out good, has some agreeable content, but ultimately devolves into rambling and repeated anecdotal stories, false presumptions, and page after page of using different words to say the same thing. This book doesn't really live up to its title. Towards the end it's like you're reading a relationship advise column. I was expecting something quite different when I bought this.
 Despite the humorous title this is a great modern philosophy book, the guy is a genius, brilliant thinker in the way he articulates what many feel and cannot express or turn into action. I have to say, and I read a lot, it's a MUST READ.
 This book is completely subjective and almost not at all objective. It does offer good points, but I would not say good advice because none of the points are valid.<br/><br/>To buy or not to buy? I do not know, it depends on how open one is to subjective work.
 The key message I took away was to focus on what matters most to you, step back and consider whether something you're agonising over is worth it. The book was very repetitive and could have easily been condensed. The tone of the book also had me cringing a lot.
 I related to a lot of the advice in this book because it was very similar to what my dad taught me. I liked the book but I felt it was too much of a blog and lacked examples and references. If these things don't matter to you, it would probably be a 5-star book. For me, I needed a little more.
 Thank you Thank you Mark!<br/>Awesome book for any adult to read.<br/>You hit it. Anyone that is stuck in today’s reality should read this book.<br/>Read it or listen to it, either way you will gain many life lessons that are priceless !<br/>Life lessons that can help you reach your next<br/>level and release all your old life baggage.
 A very honest and blunt way of looking at life. Not one of those positive, uplifting and cheerful self-help books but one that really wakes you up and makes you realize what things in your life are really important and what things you should examine more. Not for very sensitive types. Mark does a good job of using his own experiences to get his points across, some are more dramatic than others. It is the kind of book that you need to read slowly and reflect on each chapter to get the most out of it.
 This book is fantastic.  Throw out all your conventional self-help/personal development manuals, and just read this!  Not only is it not formulaic or boring, it's totally counterintuitive, irreverent, and cuts to the chase.  It makes sense of so many concepts, issues, and experiences that the conventional "wisdom" gets wrong.  It's honest, concise, and funny as hell!  At the same time, it's profound without being academic.  It made me really stop and rethink all my assumptions and conditioning.  If you're looking for a book that will actually help change your life, this is it.  If you're seeking a genuine, meaningful gift for a loved one, I recommend this book.
 I must say that although I haven't read the book, as I'm not sure if it's worth the money, I have been greatly entertained by the reviews! Both pro and con, they were well thought out and very informative, not to mention very well written. Still am not sure if I want to fork out the bread for this book though...
 I bought this book due to the cover/title as I'm sure most buyers did. The first few chapters were engaging, but as I read on, the examples that preceded the advice section became boring and predictable. By the last chapter, "...And then you die." was the worst. It had no connection to the rest of the book and very disappointing This is a true instance that the cover sells the book and the contents don't match up. If I could, I'd return it. It's a waste of money and don't judge what you think will be engaging, informative content. It's definitely not.
 This one written by Mr Manson is really good! It's the harsh truth that needs to be articulated. Yes there's a bit of curse words so it might not be everyone's cup of tea, but I thought the underlying message and context is great. I'd recommend this book!
 I got about 1/4 of the way through this one and put it down.<br/><br/>I've never read Mark before and the customer reviews were all stellar, so I bought.<br/><br/>I hate giving bad reviews on things people work really hard on, but there needs to be an honest review here.<br/><br/>It would've saved me $12 by accurately depicting what this book is.<br/><br/>This is not some new spin on how self-help has been written about in the past.<br/><br/>It's full of stories the author presents about others which I got tired of reading.<br/><br/>I found myself sifting through these anecdotes trying to find the point Mark was trying to make.<br/><br/>Usually it was something like 'don't care what people think' or 'you're average just accept it'.<br/><br/>Which is fine, but just say that.<br/><br/>I found this disappointing, I wanted to hear the authors ideas as he is a really successful blogger in a tough niche.<br/><br/>But all the stories took the air out of this book for me, as I finally got around to Mark and his thoughts on the subject.<br/><br/>And the ideas that were shared were underwhelming, or my expectations were too high.<br/><br/>Either way, I didn't get a lot out of this one.<br/><br/>The theme of accepting what is and embracing struggle is fine, but it's presented in a way that's mildly depressing to read.<br/><br/>As with any self-help book, it will affect everyone differently, this is only my opinion.
 I really liked Mark Manson's approach and view of life, death, and everything in between. I think I have fallen into the fixer of other people role in the past, and it was very eye-opening to have this view of entitlement (a word I generally dislike) as both victim and fixer.<br/><br/>The idea that we choose what problems we care about and that shapes our values was enlightening. Definitely a lot of food for thought here.
 Refreshing view of the world and the truly important things.  Good comments on modern life and how f***** it can be.
 Rambling.  His antidotes made no sense to the point he was trying to make.  I don't even know what point he was trying to make.  Basically - spoiler - the majority of us will only be mediocre, and that's OK.
 Recommend listening to or reading this book more than once to get all you can out of it. Wise words expressed with a sense of self-deprecating humor, just sharing his own fumbling journey and resilting insights to see if it might help us reclaim some peace of mind. Right on target for me. The audiobook rocks, great reader. But paperback book form is good too. Keep an open mind and get to it.
 The premise of this book is counterintuitive.  Everybody focuses on their goals - climbing Everest, making a million dollars, dating supermodels, whatever.  The author correctly points out that this is entirely the wrong way to look at your life.  Instead, you should be focusing on what tasks/challenges you enjoy doing.  Do you even enjoy climbing mountains?  Do you enjoy long business meetings? Do you enjoy spending time with supermodels?<br/><br/>You cannot become a great musician if you do not enjoy practicing.<br/><br/>Most self-help books tell you to identify your goal and them power through the obstacles.  The problem is that powering through the obstacles is what you spend your whole life doing.  The traditional answer is that nobody enjoys challenges, they just want the payoff at the end.  Maybe there is some truth to that, but this author looks at it from a different angle.  Besides, if you enjoy the obstacles and challenges then it won't matter too much if you fail to achieve your goal.
 Mark Manson’s book reads like a blog not a book. I found no literary value to this book. There are many funny one-liner jokes much like you would expect in a blog, not what I expect when I pay for book. Much like the title, the F word is the verb and noun of choice used to describe just about anything through the book. If you want to read a blog, I recommend searching the very free internet, not purchasing this book.
 I pre ordered this and I just got a notice saying it won't be out until 2020.  So what's with that? I have to look up and see if I was charged.  Maybe it is personal.  Now I see a September 18, 2018 review for the hardcover.
 Oh, darn it.…  and it really is a great book with excellent observations/advice.  It's just kind of interesting that the author chose this in-your-face title, after telling people to choose their battles wisely. This is a great read... and would've made great gifts… But you open the package, see the title, and wonder if any goodwill is intended....and it goes on the bottom of the pile. Good book, misleading title.
 This is the third item I have purchased that is not what it claims to be. Be cautious. There was a sticker covering another one. See ohoto
 Good premise of the book - pick your battles, choose your struggles, and embrace the journey of life and the problems that come along with it. I really enjoyed the first half of the book. The second half really dragged for me. The gratuitous language detracted from the book, the random (very long winded) stories that didn't seem to relate to anything else made my mind wander, and the premise being beaten into you over and over bored me. I think there was a good message, but it could have been written in a 3 part blog series, not an entire book.
 Yo, this book though. I mean holy cow, one of the few books I have completely devoured. And maybe, just maybe I read it with such urgency because I give way to many craps. It was super good. Super fulfilling and highly recommended if you wanna care less about others and focus more on YOU.
 If you feel that the details of life are gumming up and clouding your perception of life and purpose here, Manson opens the curtains to remind us that life is really simple. We make it far more complicated, difficult, and painful than it needs to be.  He offers an understandable way to reconnect with being alive at a very deep level.
 I listen to the audiobook over and over, and can't stress enough how accurate Mark not only interpreted but also demystified my behavior and my relationships with colleagues and friends. He's blunt honest with his readers, writes super interesting stuff you won't regret spending time reading. I was actually shocked to learn that the guy was only 32 when he published this piece.  I'm now all over his website, newsletters, twitter and facebook, which I rarely do, if ever.
 Best book to read if you feel you are not able to do anything or not living up to your expectations. Best self help guide that I read in a long time.<br/><br/>Will read it again...
 I think this book started out right but moved off topic pretty quickly.  I'm surprised that there were so many great ratings!  What are people reading these days that make this book look good?
 Lots and lots of great takeaways from this book.<br/><br/>Will you have heard some of it before? Sure, but the ideas are presented very clearly and concisely here, with lots of humor and memorable stories thrown into the mix.<br/><br/>To me, the most important message in the book is the idea that pursuing the negative is a positive, that life sometimes sucks, and that you need to embrace the suck. Our expectations that our lives be all happy and perfect all the time are what leads to disappointment and frustration.<br/><br/>Again, something most people have probably heard before, but Mark did a great job of driving it home.
 This book used the profanity in the title in abundance!!!! I found it hard to find the message because of it.. Really?? Can't you give the message without soooooo much profanity... get a different book...
 This is great for beginners, particularity if you're not a strong reader. Anyone out there ever have to write a "Life Philosophy" senior-year in high school? This is Mark Manson's. Overall it's not bad, and got some solid coping-concepts to consider if not adopt. Hefty dollop of Buddhism mixed in. Entertaining and illuminating at first, the text devolves into what you might get from a drunk/stoned, fiscally-conservative philosophy major at a party, particularly if he's trying to get in your pants. He started losing my trust with is his non-stop hammering of "entitlements." Sure, here, he's speaking to an entitled mind-frame when dealing with "life on life's terms," but Mark's use of it strongly resembles how Republicans vilify people in need. (I got the impression that Manson--an entrepreneur from a rich family--would also defund "Meals on Wheels.") If you're over 40, or have already done some solid digging in the garden of meaning, you're probably not going to get much more than a few laughs out of this. If you've just started on your quest for answers, this isn't a bad place to begin.
 Written in plain English with a very laid back tone. Kinda feels like your just chilling with an old friend at the bar and he's letting you know whats on his mind. The first half is solid advice that I 100% recommend. The second half is kinda the authors own personal opinion -its a good opinion, don't get me wrong: very solid arguments, but still just an opinion.<br/><br/>Anyway, go ahead and read it, it'll take very little time and the perspective is pretty fresh in relation to most the stuff out there.
 For a young guy - Mandon really is very intuitive. Been going through a very messy and painful personal issue and this book (audible really) hit me right between the eyes and allowed me to see things more clearly.  Going to listen to it again once I’m finished.
 Kind of had to roll my eyes reading about the harrowing journey of this handsome guy with a college education and loving family and friends travelling all around the world and bedding beautiful women just so he can tell us his epiphanies about what’s REALLY important in life.<br/><br/>Not to say he’s wrong; his advice is still meaningful and useful. Just.. not the most substantive book.
 It's very rare that I learn so much from one book.  Mark Manson gives really valuable mental frameworks to use in your own daily life with a strong focus on controlling how you perceive things, people, and circumstances.  One of the greatest thoughts in this book was "What are you willing to suffer for?"  I've read the most highly rated life design books out there and I've NEVER heard it so eloquently stated.  Mind was blown.  I've read innumerable books on happiness and purpose in life.  This book would rank right up there with the very best.  Highly recommended.
 Fantastic short read! I could not put it down. Finished it in an afternoon. Seriously one if not the best "self" help books I've ever read. I enjoy the easy flowing and very relatable material. I am so glad I stumbled upon it, and feel so empowered after reading this! Just amazing!
 Like all the other "enlightenment" books but with a lot more f*%$ in it. Was seriously expecting a lot more but it didn't quite get there. Not even close.
 I wish I read this as a young man. Solid philosophy with some humor on how to quit worrying so much and take the challenges as they come. Pick your battles because they are unavoidable in all walks of life.
 it’s a book that starts off making fun of the 2nd half of the book.
 Tell me I am missing the point - it was still annoying reading about this guy showing off how much sex he had. I got it...
 Premise is great, but to use F..,.ck every other word was such a detractor from a good topic . I was so excited to get this book, but it became so annoying and juvenile, I could not finish.
 I was expecting much more from this book. Something along the lines of removing importance by Vadim Zeland. Instead it was just another self-help book from which I haven't learned anything new.
 This was the best audio book I could have possibly listened to when I was dragging myself many miles through dusty canyons in the Grand Canyon. It helped me embrace the suffering I was experiencing and it made me laugh. It's just a really good book.
 I have been wanting this book for about a year and got it as a gift. Within the first day I got through 1/3 of it, and found it not only helpful in finding a new perspective but also funny and interesting. It didn't feel like reading other self-help books I've gone through. I felt more empowered to decide what gets my attention and how much, because my #1 problem is investing way, way too much effort into even the littlest of things that maybe don't need that much and cause me more anxiety. I'm excited to read the rest!
 My impression is some guy read a book about bhuddist philosophy and repackaged it in bro-speak vernacular. If the average American had a choice between reading a book about bhuddism or an orange book with f*** on the cover that was a best seller, they'd choose the orange book. Nothing in this book is earth shattering or new, it's just the idea life will involve suffering and not getting upset or overly focused on it. This concept has been around for a thousand years (or more ?). This book just repackages it using concepts and situations millennial Americans can understand.
 Simple straight message giving practical book<br/>Basically points to what to give F*** about and what not to, straightening priorities in life, living fully and not passively or superficially ; having deep meaningful relationships and being self aware all the time. Not wasting time giving F*** about irrelevant nonsense. Accepting death as the inevitable outcome but letting that realization make you live fuller rather than of fear and anxiety or insecurity
 I tried to listen to this book on Audible and had to give up because all of the curse words were very jarring to listen to.  I cuss like a sailor but couldn't stomach listening to every other word being the "F" bomb.  I also didn't get any tangible advice out of the book and eventually gave up on it.
 Not worth reading unless you are a nervous wreck of a person. This book is moronic. First part of the book is Mark using the eff word as much as possible about giving or caring an eff or not giving an eff. No benefit or insightful info here. Second part of the book is a bunch of garbage. No insight or good advice. It basically says care about what is worth your caring, and don't sweat the small stuff. Dumb book that I had high hopes for, a real waste of time.
 This is a great read! It is not exactly what I expected, but I like Mark Manson's view on how to approach life. My mom wanted to borrow it when I finished the copy I was gifted, but instead I ordered her her own copy as I intend to re-read mine!
 Decent take on how to get over what really bugs you about life.  Somewhat distracting is Mark's recurring focus on sex, or having sex, or thinking about sex, or pursing sex, talking about people who have sex, etc.  Mark, go meet someone special if you haven't by now, and then get back to good writing.
 One of the first times I've felt like tossing a book or donating it to charity after reading two chapters. But.....I had Kindled the book and couldn't.  In trying to think of a pearl of wisdom from the book to mention. All I' came up with was a visual of an empty oyster shell.
 I've read a lot of self help books that never get beyond "life is great &amp; be more positive" and then they share with you why their life is great.  This book helps you find or rediscover your values.  I'm only through the 4th chapter, but I will be completing it and purchasing it to read again and in audio form to listen to on the way to work.  Well written and well worth the time he took to write it.  It is not a get rich ($$) book, it is an introspective book, which is what I was looking for.
 This book is horribly cynical and condescending and was apparently written by a naive and bitter person who hates his life.<br/><br/>The author is sexist, arrogant and judgmental. The author whines on and on about millennials and describes people who smoke weed as losers who can't get their lives together.<br/><br/>I can only assume the author ate a big messy burger and then defecated on some paper and this book was the result: absolute drivel.
 Not that great of a book. Funny but not great. The book in no way offended me I just didn't enjoy reading it... Kind of boring
 Was disappointed in the book, couldn't finish it.  I could see this benefiting someone that has not grown up yet/matured and still transitioning to adulthood but if you have gotten past that point I would avoid this book as you are not getting anything new here.
 Quarter memoir, quarter half-remembered advice from a buddhism seminar, quarter convenient historical anecdote, quarter convenient personal anecdote.  I'm underwhelmed.
 I was skeptical of this book given the title<br/><br/>I had only intended to flip through it<br/><br/>But as I made my way through it I thought the author had a unique perspective<br/><br/>It really pulled me in<br/><br/>In the end it's a great discussion on what matters and doesn't matter in life<br/><br/>Well thought out<br/><br/>Well done
 Did not speak to me.  Seems more geared to men who have had rich, easy, bad-boy lives that other demographics.  Mildly anti- female.
 Overall this book is great but it started out as if the author was REALLY trying to make the reader feel like they’re reading a not-so-typical book. It’s not a huge deal but I felt it some-what distracting: I get it- you love burritos. But the proceeding 75% of the book was great.  Mark provides some great insight.
 Obvious that the author's original format was a blog. The message is a good one and overall, I enjoyed the book, but there were many pages in the book that weren't needed.
 I would seriously recommend this book to anyone and everyone because it deals with the most important existential issues with appropriately irreverent humor and yet still pierces the heart! A true masterpiece!
 If you are a woman or respect women, this book is not for you. The foul language was expected given the title of the book, but the level of misogyny and immature "locker room talk" I guess we call it now is just beyond the pale. First Audible book I've returned.
 One of the best books I've read lately. A great approach to thinking about honesty with yourself, and how you view the world around you. I continue to return to it, and re-read it, when I find things happening and need a subtle reminder to decide whether or not I should actually care and how I should respond based on that decision.
 I bought this on audible knowing that I had a lengthy road trip ahead of me. I have followed Mark on FB  and been reading his blog for quite a while. This is an EXCELLENT book - both humorous and serious. And the serious parts are alleviated with enough humor not to bog you down or make it feel like an emotional roller coaster ride. I'm already buying physical copies to give as Christmas gifts to my adult children. And I'm recommending it to everyone I know.
 Complete drivel. Don't bother. How did this book average 4.5 stars??? The author doesn't even bother to look up details of I am Malala and Romeo and Juliet when using them as examples.
 If you re looking for a book to give you straight talk - here it is. This is not a book for individuals who do not enjoy being challenged in their personal beliefs. If you allow the authors words to resonate with you, the material in this bo ok can have a profound effect, it did for me. I recommend this to everyone expect those who are sensitive to profanity.
 Mark Manson is a coarse vulgarian so it’s all the more unexpected to find the profundity here that he mines and maintains for this jaunt through modern Western psychology and the afflictions of the millennial mind.
 It required me to give up one more of my do not give a F!
 I've never been one to get into the introspective/self-help books, but I'd heard some good things about this book and decided to go out on a limb. It has been engaging, well planned, easy to read, and geared to the media-connected audience (everyone, not just millenials). I highly reccomend y'all read this! Even to those who usually crinkle their nose at these type of books (I am one too)
 Bought this for my wife who got halfway then left it on her bedside table. A couple of weeks ago we went to see Manson give a talk. It was brilliant, as is this book which I took from my wife and read in 3 days. I always thought I didn't 'give a' but it seems I did...to all the wrong things!
 This is the perfect book for the foul-mouthed twenty something who is trying to discover themselves in a world constantly telling them who to be. Honestly, I've never been interested in "self-help" books however, this is not that. This is a book that points out common mistakes all people make and gives you ample ways to correct them. It is not all roses and sunshine and if you are weary of the F word maybe stay away, but to anyone else I HIGHLY recommend this book.
 Mark makes it clear that he's NOT saying you should not care about anything. Not at all. What he is saying is that you should pick carefully WHICH things you care about: "This book will help you think a little bit more clearly about what you’re choosing to find important in life and what you’re choosing to find unimportant." He's not suggesting we should be indifferent; rather, carefully deciding where to place our concern.
 I couldn't finish this book because it had such a negative take on survival.  It won't assist with resilience, just create distaste.
 In line with Buddhist teachings, real life experience and youthful perspective.  I really enjoyed the book.  Felt the last 20% of the book trying to add a little night cap felt a bit amateur, and forced to conclude in rapidly succession trying to summarize, beyond this was fantastic.
 I would probably give this book 5 stars if would’ve gotten it and had a chance to read it.<br/>I never got  this item, so all I can say is I was ripped off.
 Just grab some intro to Buddhism or Stoicism. He just says the same old tired stoic tidbits over and over with the F-word every three words. Got tired of so many vulgar words.
 This book is a breath of fresh air for me. After reading countless self-development books I've become tired of hearing the same thing over and over again.  Mark tells it how it is and gives you a much needed dose of reality.  I honestly wasn't expecting much but enjoyed every bit of this book. I highly recommend this book.
 This is a prime book and Audible will not let me get the free audio book.  I also paid for a hardcover version and amazon says it’s free to listen.  What gives ?
 let's face it.  i picked it up because the title caught my eye.  i did think it was going to be obnoxious, but i was pleasantly surprised.  manson has some good things to say.  it was a quick read and i recommend.
 Interesting reminder of what life is made of.  I surprisingly preferred the first part punctuated with lots of f*cks, than when it gets a bit more serious and maybe back to should dos as I would find in other self-help books.<br/><br/>Really good read though.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone who needs a shift in perspective while they’re getting stuck too deep in their own mundane problems... as we all do...
 One of the best book for your if you want to realize what life is. This book lets you remove the need for reading multiple self help books. very precise and information, You life is short and does give fu__k for each and every thing, Live your life happy and get on track.
 One of the most honest and mind altering books, I have ever read. This book may have literally saved my life. I have always thought highly of myself but have been miserable all the same. This book tells me why I am miserable, and not how to get rid of the misery, but how to find/create happiness and purpose despite the misery.
 This book is more negative than funny. I didn't finish it.
 This book is like the Tao of Pooh or the Te of Piglet but with swearing for the sake of swearing or at an attempt at humor. Imagine if Al Swearengen wrote a Live, Laugh, Love book – this is the result. I took the author's advice and stopped spending my time on a thing that had no value to me. I tapped out at about 20% (40 pages). Listening to an Andrew WK record would be more entertaining and have more value. I hate self help books.
 I'm surprised this book gets good ratings.  While at times humorous, I did not find it very insightful.  Also, too much of the book revolves around his own life experience, including the many times he tells us of the multiple women he's been with.  Pretty self indulgent in my opinion.
 I did not expect to love this book. I agreed with the premise and thought it might be entertaining. But this book is a goldmine of life lessons presented in a delightfully irreverent fashion. Highly, highly recommended!
 I love listening to it as I drive. I think it is one of those books that is probably better to listen to. I love it and have shared it with a few friends who love it too.
 I read the book quickly and wasn't sure I agreed with everything.  After a few days thoughts, I found myself thinking about what Mark Manson said and realized it totally applied to me.  I am now picking my battles and conserving energy.  I am realizing that everything is not my fault, but yes, it is now my responsibility.  This book is a simple read with a lot of depth.
 Mark Manson is wise beyond his years!  I bought one for each of my 4 kids, ranging in age from 29-36.  This book probably speaks mostly to their generation but I got a big kick out of it as well!  Its a great read and pretty damn funny.  He just has a way of making important points that all young people should hear.<br/>Do yourself a favor and read it!
 If you love to read the "F word" over and over again, check out this book.  Obviously this author doesn't have the vocabulary skills to express himself with a wide variety of descriptive words.
 I have listened to this book twice now. It's not your average everyday self-help book.  This guy is great.  Stop giving a F@%K and buy this book.
 Wasn’t for me more for uptight or control freaks or type A guys who don’t understand these things already. If your a laid back person in general you know this. If your an A type person this is for you
 One of the easiest self help books I've ever attempted to read, I loved it, had a lot of laugh out loud moments .  Easy to digest, I highly recommend it!
 Book makes some excellent points.  One must accept or ignore the language.  This book is thought proving and worth reading
 This book is much deeper than I ever thought it would be. It taught me so much about myself and I have such great clarity on so many aspects of my life.
 This book is a must read for everyone. It provides a different approach to thinking about life and your choices.
 Well written, often funny and to the point book. Mark has embraced his Russian experience and I appreciate the no BS message the book delivers.<br/><br/>Most of this will come as obvious to most readers, the fact that you picked this book signals that you are aware of the messsage the book delivers. A good, quick read.
 This book is amazing, easy to read and relate to, and will guide you to a less stressful journey through life by not letting all the little things get to you.
 It might take some practice but I am going to fine tune the concept of this books title.  Thought provoking and true wisdom that everyone should embrace.
 The book outlines what its title says. It clearly shows how wrong one can be about what is needed to live happily. When you read it you feel like you knew it anyway but didn't commit to it. That's what would be next after putting this book down.<br/>Yes, I agree that at times a little non-vulgar language would have been better, but at many points it brings it to the point.
 While the idea that there are things we should worry about and things we shouldn't has been around for some time, I think the author has taken an approach that will appeal to millennials, who desperately need to hear this message.
 This book is just what I needed. It makes you take a good hard look in the mirror and resets your mind as how to view the world around you. When I finished the book I immediately started reading it again.
 Too vulgar for me without much substance ... it was ok though for what it was. Better books out there
 I was expecting more. I suppose I should not have from the title. I just never got the point of the book.
 Grabs you with it’s offensive language and brusk judgey no-bullshit candor. Clean out your ears. I think this is good stuff. Breaks thru entitlement. Refocuses. Not preachy, but strong stuff. Readable.
 I downloaded the audiobook, hoping for light hearted entertaining listening on the way to work.  But title aside, I thought it was really good!  I do wish there was a "pg" version of the book cause I would love to give it to my daughter to read.  I think she will get a lot out of it.
 A very long-winded, profanity-laden way of saying pick your battles.  ANYONE can start typing away and share crappy life experiences.  So what.
 I liked the easy to read style.  Some very useful advice to live by,but no ah-ha! moments for me.
 It was ok; good advice for living life, but it didn’t blow me away or anything. I liked his personal story near the end. I know loads of their people highly rate it, so this is probably just me.
 The best part was the story about the Japanese Soldier but it was just him retelling a well known story. The rest he basically rambles for a good 100 pages... no clue how it is so highly rated.
 I listened to the audio version and found it to be more entertaining than informative. Manson keeps things interesting with his personal stories and use of examples from the literary (Charles Bukowski) and pop culture world (Megadeath). The narrator Roger Wayne deserves credit as well for his engaging delivery. But if you asked me what sort of things I learned from the book that will help me with my daily life, I wouldn't be able to come up with a whole lot.
 Buy this book and buy a copy for everyone you know. Manson outdid himself on this one, you NEED this book!
 I wanted to like this book, but it was so stylistically childish and devoid of content that I couldn't even finish it.
 I enjoyed the down to earth conversations and every-day language.  It is amazing to discover what you are capable of once you stop worrying about what other people think about you.  I read this book while writing my book The Art of L.E.A.D.E.R.ship - Put Me In the Game Coach!  I too used simple conversation language.
 I think this is one of the most honest pieces of wisdom I have read ( listened audible) . A must read. Get over the F bomb ( if your a prude) I Love the word and all its meanings. Its used a lot in 1st chapters, but the deep life changing truth, is AWESOME.
 I needed this! As I sat and read this in one sitting, I felt a calm flow over me as I finished. Must read!
 My first review was too profane or something... &gt;_&gt; It's a really good book. Drops the F*Bomb a lot in the first 40 pages but gets better after that. If you want to see my full review, you can find it on facebook /theastralscribe
 Entertaining read, expounds on thoughts that mirror some basic buddhism-like tenets.  Stuff like, "The avoidance of suffering *is* a form of suffering" reads like it came straight from the mouth of the Dalai Lama, if not for all the f-bombs in every other sentence.  Nothing wrong with a new and entertaining way to sermonize some ancient and healthy ideals.  Probably best enjoyed by those who are a little more easy-going.
 Maybe I already let things go and am past the point of being concerned with "noise."  Wasn't my favorite, but could be beneficial to those who may need the push.
 The subtle art of question everything.<br/>Good book, I enjoy listening. I like the novelty of the author's approach to life.<br/>there is something in the style which annoyed me, although I am not sure if that is good or not.<br/>Probably The Author does not try to be liked by readers and he is very self-confident... which might be good as well
 Okay listen on Audible. Was not aware this was a trendy selection at first. Nothing too insightful. More of a misery loves company deal. I feel like it’s an overly drawn out version of the first experience watching “Office Space”. Skip to asking people if they have a ever had a case of the Monday’s and save people a few hours of their lives.
 This book is for rat race middle managers feeling unfulfilled about their chase for senior manager.  In short, accept that life sucks sometimes and use reference points to feel relative success/contentment.
 While the F word is rather prevalent, the multiple messages are great.  If there was a way to have every senior in high school read this it would be fantastic.  Parents coaches pastors counselors and individuals will all find value in this sometimes crude but very entertaining book.
 I bought a hard copy of this book and read it on a plane. I felt that it does not saying anything that has not been said before. It is full of generic platitudes. Statements like "honest self-questioning is difficult. It requires asking yourself simple questions that are uncomfortable to answer" are endemic in the text.  To its credit, the book does have some interesting stories.
 This is essentially the "every human" version of Carol Dweck's mindset research, with bonus insights on values and assessing your life. Obviously not for anyone who is offended by cussing, but underneath all that is some real thought provoking stuff.
 I, like many who pick up the book due to a compelling title, didn’t know what to expect at all.  Some of the best philosophy I have encountered much to be learned and a lot of laughs too!
 Funny, yet insightful. Manson tells it like it is and asks us to all stop caring about stupid sh*t and start giving our attention and energy to things that really matter. But he doesn't tell you what matters, he encourages everyone to figure that out for themselves with some helpful guideposts along the way. Refreshing read!
 This isn't about some good feeling, can't face the truth about life, or lie to oneself book.  This is bold, give it to me straight, take away the roses, uncover insights which many people really need to see inorder to better understand, not just themselves, but those around them!
 I get the feeling Mark Manson wrote this book simply to be able to call himself an author. I'm forcing myself to read it because it was a gift but 2/3rds of the way through and I feel like I'm wasting my time. Probably a good fit for a college student. Not a good fit for someone who does a lot of reading and/or is well experienced in life.
 I listened to the audio version read by Roger Wayne.  I enjoyed the content and most of the narration.  The exception is Wayne's narration of lines attributed to female characters, which sounded mocking and patronizing.
 Although I'm not into self help, this was a good reminder that I should pick my battles and it offered a refreshing perspective on daily struggles, internal and external. Give it a listen at least once!
 Well written. Author does an excellent job of tying in research with anecdotes from his life. Love this philosophy, I probably think this is an excellent book because I agree with this author on pretty much everything, but I think there is value in understanding the difference between Pursuing  pleasure and Pursuing a life worth living.
 this is a waste of your time. fast read but just kept turning pages hoping some substance would show up. worthy of an essay but a book is too much of the same message.
 This has to be one of the best "life" books ever written.  Yes, it's crude, but it is absolutely amazing.  I can't do the book justice.  Just read it.
 There is obviously a target market for this content based on the many positive reviews and sales - and I respect that.  But basically this is a book by a guy who used to have a lot of sex, travel and basically sh*t himself who settled down when her got older.  And now with all of 30+ years of life experience he thinks he has had such a revelation that he feels he needs to share (in such a way that he can remind you over and over and over again that he used to have a lot of sex) .  Save your time.  Save your money.
 Super disappointing. Only made it a few chapters in because I had to keep stopping and asking myself "what the f am I reading?" It seemed like one liners after one liners after one liners...anytime I thought he was about to say something interesting the author would make a joke that really made no sense and was weirdly distracting. I heard such great reviews of this book, but I must have missed the kool aid break everyone else went on for this one. Can't even motivate myself to finish reading it because honestly I don't give a "f" to. Hey guess the book worked.
 Waste of time.
 If you've read any self help books at all, don't waste your time on this. There's nothing new here you already know. ie, failure is good, the journey is the goal, choose what is important to you, take the first little step... etc. This book only got popular from the terse title. More a lesson in clever marketing than anything else.
 This book is amazing. I got the audio version and the narrator is awesome too. He made the book "doubly" awesome
 I just recieved it in the mail and I'm trying to read my book but it smells bad...lol...
 Lots of cussing that's not needed but solid advice if not for cussing its a good read for high school grads too.
 Superficial tripe, and self-aggrandizing to boot. It's sad when people like this can sell millions of books, and even sadder when they then interpret that popularity as a sign that they're talented. Bro, you're not talented, and not NEARLY as smart as you think you are. We live in an age of idiocy, and now more than ever being on the bestseller list (or at the helm in the White House), is merely a sign of the stupidity of the masses, not of that artifact or person's worthiness.
 Going into the new year, I've been looking for a book that would jolt me forward. The delivery is harsh but well intended. It's got me excited to resume projects I've put off!
 The first two chapters were basics most of us know if we're over the age of 30. The rest is drivel. Save your time and money: watch the Ted Ed on the Stoics, instead.
 It was okay. The author is pretty self-indulgent and lacking in life experience. I think that the concept is important...understanding that the only meaning in life is that which we apply to it. He's onto something. Just maybe should have waited a decade to write it.
 Everyone should read this book before they turn 20. Reading this book changed my life. I now recommend it to everyone I know and will continue to recommend it to everyone I meet.
 I found this to be an ok book, there is quiet a bit of curse words throughout the book so be warned.
 I really, really enjoyed this book. I started lending it to friends for them to start reading, too.
 This book is that drunken heart to heart conversation you have with your best friend at 3am after a party. It’s just like a normal informal conversation about life from a normal guy. It might not change your life but it give you guide lines to improve on. I really like this book and I find it to be entertaining. Just go in with an open mind and with a sense of humor then you will enjoy it too.
 Loved this book. It took a little time for me to get hooked, but it was well worth it! I recommend to everyone who’s looking to enrich their perspective.
 fun and easy. how hard could life be right?<br/>I enjoyed this book, sometimes thought it has nothing to teach seeing everything is so simple. when the book was done, i felt i learnt something, mainly about myself.<br/>maybe the fact i started the audio version on my evening runs...after 3 chapters i was running about 30 mins. the week before i was barely running 5 mins.<br/>Give it a go, you might even change some things in your life.
 By the title you might think that this is about being edgy and not caring about what others think about you- but its almost the complete opposite. He teaches about how in order to not care about the alot of things, we must care about some things. For example. If you care about the enviroment, then you must ignore the people who tell you to destroy it. Overall this is a must read book for anyone. Highly recommend it.
 Full of cliches, full of truisms and basically a repackaging of all the ideas found in most self help books.  Has absolutely nothing to do with its title. The title is just a catch. The book is geared toward naive teenagers, possibly even to children?
 I really thought I was going to like this book in the beginning, but at some point it turned to a lot of words about nothing.
 Oh wow.<br/><br/>Killer book. Sure there is 2% ramblings (what blogger doesn't ramble?), but it's 98% solid and thought-provoking prose.<br/><br/>I have not shut up about this book the past week, recommending it to every one I know. It will particularly resonate with those recovering from a self-development obsession.<br/><br/>Easily the best non-fiction book I've read in years!
 I’ve read a lot of these concepts before but not quite like this. This book has an honest take on psychological issues that face many Americans today.  I think it’ll force individuals to take a hard look at their values and re-examine some life choices. It’s a good read.
 I thought the book was okay, that it may be hard to put into practice what the book tells you to do.
 A pop culture snack of an intro to the choice limb of existentialism. Nothing original or mindblowing to see here. Kudos on the catchy title that is veered away from almost immediately.
 You know a book is powerful when you constantly think about many of the concepts described, weeks, months or even years later after reading. Highly recommended!!
 Humor + quality advice = 👍👍👍<br/>I've been following Manson's blog for a while now (the only blog update I get excited to see in my inbox) and I had very high expectations for this book. That being said, he surpassed them all.<br/>I died at "Disappointment Panda" 😂
 Mark Manson has a refreshing take on personal responsibility. He adds some valuable information to the "self-improvement, living a happy-fulfilled life" tool box.
 It's almost like this dude read Sarah Knight's Life Changing Magic of Not Giving a F*** and decided he could do it better by adding more misogyny. Genuinely not worth the paper it's printed on.
 Sort of vulgar vocabulary. A few meaningful chapters, but the author tends to brag about himself the further that the book goes on. I found a few good takeaways and would recommend since it is a short read.
 Sometimes it's really easy to have tunnel vision and lose sight of what important and how emotions rule you. Reading this was like taking a step back and reassessing what's important.
 This is now my absolute favorite book I have ever read, hands down.<br/><br/>It really dives deep into relationships and feelings and choices etc.<br/><br/>Your life is what you make of it and you choose what to give a crap about. Period. End of story.
 Interesting read, different than most other books like this that I've read.  I did like his chapters on Fear and Failing, very thought provoking.  I would suggest this book.
 This is not a book about apathy, it's about figuring out and focusing on what truly matters, not to your friends, to your colleagues, or to your parents, but what matters to YOU. Once you've found that organizing principal you can strip away the rest. Like any work of practical philosophy, the essence sounds simple in the abstract, but it's far more difficult to apply to your actual life. Manson's tongue-in-cheek style and unwavering realism in the anecdotes and ideas presented were pitched just right do to disarm my self-help gag reflex. This book is a quick, engaging read and an important reminder to focus on what matters, to reject the crowd and to design the good life for yourself as only you can.
 Book is funny and thought provoking. Author makes some great points with hilarious stories and irreverent passages. Worth the buy and the read!! I bought it for my brothers for Christmas and loaned my copy out.
 I've tried 3 times to finish reading this book. I find that I just don't give a f***.
 Insights similar to other spiritual teachings currently dispersed in India, specifically Sadhguru’s. I went to one of his meditation workshops and am pleasantly surprised the author has reiterated most of those teachings.
 Starts very vulgar to catch your attention and pull you in, but then levels out and has great insights about what you should focus on in life.
 Very well written. Love his thoughts on life. A profound book on life as it is, fastest book on self improvement that I've read.
 I got this book from the library.  It has nothing at all new to say.
 Decent book. No groundbreaking material, but serves as a good reminder.
 I really learned a lot from this book. I thought I knew what my values were, but this book has made me realize that a lot of them were not truly what I find to be important. I now have a new outlook on life.
 An absolutely great read! I bought a copy for my mom and my daughter.
 I have been a regular reader of Mark's Manson. If I have a problem in life, he's the guy I turn to. I didn't think he had anything more to say that wasn't on his website--oh boy, was I wrong! LOVELY little book, a great book for a bus ride or a subway, insightful enough that you'd want your own copy to underline and scribble in. Would make a great gift. 10/10 would recommend. His other book "Models" was great too, which I bought after. Mark isn't running out of steam anytime soon.
 A small dose of introspection for those of us raised in western society. If you're depressed, in suffering, or just willing to change, this book gives some helpful hints at where to start. All you need is an open mind.
 Awesome read and even better narrator.
 Pretentious and oh so boring.
 This book changed my life for the better, highly reccomend it.
 The title grabs your attention. The first couple chapters entertain you. The rest of the book drives home a series of really good points and great advice.
 I am not much for self-help books, but I wanted a book to listen to as I did chores around the house one Sunday. I started the book in the morning and didn't stop listening until it was done. I throughly enjoyed it. I hate to sound cliche, but it spoke volumes to me.
 Stop giving af and just buy it,  hahaa!!!
 So much better than I expected - It gave some Stoic ideas a 21st Century viewpoint
 It is a solid book with an interesting perspective about life.  I think anyone can take some of the advice and apply it to life.<br/><br/>PROS<br/>it is enjoyable to read and it is a book you can read on say a break at work<br/>the book does offer some great insightful advice<br/><br/>CONS<br/>at times I felt a little lost in the anecdotes
 Do you like it when people talk down to you like you're a child? If you do, then this book is for you!<br/>There are some truly frightening non-truths presented in this drivel, I suggest if you do read it, you proceed with caution. It is a pseudo-philosophy designed from a Caucasian male perspective that admits his life by and large was bent around self gratification (but surprise! he is different now, and condemns that sort of stuff.)<br/>The author casually refers to his life of drugs, partying and "sleeping around" (using women) as his "years of reflection" and until finally he decided to write a book on self help! He condemns everyone who is "entitled" yet exhibits the same faults. He goes on to say that "nobody is special". People that "are" special (Steve Jobs etc.) are only great because they were "psychopaths" that wanted immortality. Also, he says: "you shouldn't want to be rich" (save that for the "elite" who can use it better) instead just be happy being poor and don't worry about leaving a legacy behind. With such a sad outlook on life, I thought the author might be hedonistic... but alas, he is opposite (even though he himself ditched college, partied, used women and left them) he tells us we should all have "values" (like having one partner) this of course now that he is married and has a wife that he undoubtedly expects to be "virtuous" and "monogamous." This book is like some sort Orwellian informational pamphlet: "You must not challenge the system. You must not dream. You must not think too highly of yourself. You must not try hard at anything."<br/>There are better books out there. If you want a good book on this topic go to the source: Madonna, Andy Warhol, Salvador Dali... you know... people that actually don't/didn't care.
 great book, very funny and makes you think for sure highly recommend!
 Couldn’t finish it. I found it to be an extremely negative and emotionally immature perspective.
 I'm not sure what I expected, but I was still pleasantly surprised. I wish everyone in the world would read this book. Just a handbook on how to live a more fulfilling honest life. With lots of cursing :)
 Just as it is required that you have a social security number, so should it be that you have this book. Manson targets a part of you that many aren’t targeting in modern day. If you’re seeking self improvement or self, read it and read it again.
 It's a quick read, but like most of these types of books, it could be condensed into a pamphlet.
 I can't comment on the rest of the book because I couldn't force myself to read it.  This is one of 2 books I've ever started and been unable to finish.  Completely unimaginative, self-absorbed writing littered with personal anecdotes masquerading as pseudo-science.  Really, really awful.
 I listened to this book on audible and this might be one of the most interesting " Self- Help" books out there. If you are looking for an interesting and helpful book to read and enjoy look no further.
 A good read, definitely makes me reevaluate my values, but not the most well written book(I didn't like the anecdotes chosen and the Malcolm Gladwell style didn't work . Still pretty enjoyable and uplifting.
 If you’re not a total douchebag, you probably already understand most of the concepts in this book. The beginning was okay, but the more I read the more annoying the author becomes. If you like the kardashians, you will probably find this book super helpful, otherwise save your money...
 Chapter 1-3 solid and worth the price of the book,  the est felt like filler.
 This book helped me see my own life more clear than the words my therapist feeds to me (sorry to my therapist!). Relateable, and a much needed read for the generation of narcissists that are being breed, coddling kids who are more capable than they allow them to believe. Amazing read.
 I usually don't audiobook while driving (prefer podcasts) but I've had a few 4-5 hr trips recently, this kept me up &amp; helped time pass. Felt like a podcast series (each chapter) rather than a traditional "self-help book", &amp; I enjoyed the honesty &amp; realistic view on things. The book definitely builds, the F bombs simmer down a bit, and I found the second half to be my favorite. For a sorta anxious gal (understatement) with some recent road bumps in life, I definitely give less f**** post-book. Also: I enjoyed the take-away at the end, wasn't what I expected. I won't spoil it, but I recommend giving it a shot! My fav thing about audible through amazon is that if you're unhappy, return it with a simple click. Nothing to lose (except for the f**** you give)
 Awesome view of things and life. I discover and i get some reflections from my past and my present from this point of view. The comedy style of this book gives so much to keep reading and digging into some personal dirt, that each human has inside, and makes you realize that we can change and do more, in the right terms.
 Purchased for a road trip. Enjoyed
 I liked the book. I loved the references to Aristotle and others. Book definitely makes you think about things with a different lens.
 I absolutely loved his realist approach to life. He simplifies it down to the basics, which is what we all need in a world that's overcomplicated and dramatized.
 I'm not much of a reader but this book was definitely a great read
 Puts things, life and death into perspective. Enjoyed the book a lot. Definitely worth your time reading and re-reading (as a reminder).
 Had heard so many good things about this book but personally couldn’t read his vulgar language/writing style. Read 15% and couldn’t take it anymore. To each their own!
 Love this book. I finished it in 5 days.
 This is an extremely important book. I do not mean that simply by way of myself, but that every person could improve some part of their life with these perspectives. They are powerful and have helped me improve my inner and outer well-being ever since I finished the first few chapters. As tempting as it is to try and ween the larger points from the reviews you see here, you owe it to yourself to read this book in-full with a physical copy in hand.
 Some people don't want to hear the blunt truth...this would not be the book for you.  A great read that makes you face who you are and what you really value and don't.  Excellent perspective on understanding pain IS part of life and how to accept and deal.  Great balance of facing reality and learning that you can grow.  Understanding values in a real and less shallow way.
 Loved the book's zenith like message that to learn to care about something you need not to care about almost anything
 This book allows the reader to take a step back in their life. Its rethinking your own perspective of how you see the world. Everyone should have to read this book in High School.
 Wow. This book has opened my eyes to the way I think about my life and how my actions and thoughts determine my way of life and mental health. 10/10 would recommend for anyone struggling to find the source of their issues in life. Also Manson is absolutely hilarious, makes the book that much better.
 ...but I still really liked it a lot. (Twelve more words requires to submit my star review three more words)
 This was an excellent,  insightful book. There were many gems throughout this book that I could relate to and apply to my own life and to the lives of others.
 Liked it very much. Focused on what to care about and what not and was also funny and enjoyable to read.
 The first few times I read Mark Mansons blog, I enjoyed it. I laughed. His style and humor infused advice was a refreshing change. Then I found out he's a former PUA coach. And basically I saw it all in a different PUA style light and his writings all seemed more like a formulaic marketing scheme to me. The shallowness of his message showed through. His sweeping generalizations overshadowed what I once thought was clever. The book was not very impressive to me, but mostly I wanted to mention the PUA coach thing because not many people know that
 Just an all around great book. I've recommended to many friends and colleagues.
 What an amazing look at life, or should I say, My Life. Applying the talked about concepts in this book to my day to day living has been a wonderful and time allowing energy :)
 Great insight for people who are constantly worrying about how people perceived them. Also, this book is useful if you need a reality check. The author doesnt sugar coat his point of view as you can tell by the title is straight forward to the point of not giving a f*
 enjoy enjoy
 Great book, solid message.
 The first chapter is funny and helpful. After second chapter, it starts like putting some imaginary person down.
 Great read, humble and human. Thank you for writing this! Something I needed to read. Love the potty mouth, it was in a language that I can understand!
 This book has been one of the few books in my life that has had a dramatic impact on me, and which I find myself coming back to again and again. It's just so packed full of wisdom and practical philosophy that runs counter to so much of our cultural programming, and in my opinion should be required reading for anyone coming of age in today's society.
 Great book<br/>Inspiring
 a terrible book that says "go for it, and don't be afraid" see I just saved you the time and money you would have invested in this "book"
 I enjoyed this book from start to finish.
 Hated it
 Funny and serious at the same time, great stuff.
 Not worth the time not inspirational. Doesn’t really give any insight into any ideas that haven’t been said elsewhere. Easy read thou.
 The timing of me reading this book was right. I needed to read something honest about life and this book opened and changed my perspective in many things. It made me learn things about myself that I didn’t know. I will use what I’ve learned in my life. I know it’ll be helpful. Very amazing book.
 Great book. I could not 'put it down'. I have decided to buy a couple of copies of the paperback version to give as gifts to my friends.
 Has good info, it was just hard for me to get into his style of writing.
 I loved it!  I use quotes from this book often. I got it on audio for a trip I was taking and listened to it for 3 weeks straight.  Great points and tons of useful information.  I still listen to it occasionally.  Have listened to the book at least 9 times!  Money well spent!
 Great book just get through the first chapter of f* bombs
 Quick read, entertaining, worth it. This book is great for realigning perspectives and realizing what’s important, while giving tools to do so. Highly recommended to anyone!
 I had read Mark's blog before and really liked it. However, this book just isn't for me. Maybe I changed over the years but although I really like the realistic tough love that he writes with, there's just too much cynicism and pessimism for me. He does have some great points like you are always choosing and that there's power in choosing and victimhood in not choosing.<br/><br/>If you can't stomach typical personal development books, this might be for you.
 I love the style of writing: clear, sarcastic, and uncensored. Some of it is even hard to read, but so necessary. I highly recommend this book to everyone.
 This book is getting too many positive reviews. It's perhaps a 3.5/5, so I will err on the side of stern judgment.<br/><br/>Manson's earlier work, Models, was more effective because of its more obvious set of objectives and guiding principles. The Subtle Art is a hash of various self-improvement ideas that is wanting for a central thesis. This book feels scattered and would require the reader to carefully reread on a regular basis to really draw out the summary points.<br/><br/>I enjoy Manson's writing, so I would still recommend this book to anyone who liked Models, but this book doesn't have a lot of merit on its own. The other book regarding F* giving that arrived on the market this year, by Sarah Knight, makes better use of humor and has a more comprehensive set of behaviors to work with.<br/><br/>Also, I would caution anyone who reads this book to be wary about how Manson uses the concept of 'entitlement.' By the end of the book it's just a poorly-argued rhetorical bat-to-the-face. It becomes something like liberal discourses on 'privilege,' where it's as catch-all term for any mindset you want to abuse. -Ryan Mease
 Absolute garbage language used through out made this book impossible to read. The premise of the book interested me but it needs an explicit  warning. I was repulsed, grow up and clean your mouth dude you are not in the 7th grade. When the author uses language like this it makes it hard to take him seriously. It says he really doesn't command the language that well so he has to use profanity as a crutch.
 There are much better books out there. I finished reading it in about an hour due to the large font size and the fact that the author fails to say much of substance. This book feels like some drunk guy at a bar just rambling on about his opinion of how things are, little evidence is given to back up his opinions. Some of what the book says is right, a lot of it is completely BS. Don't waste your money on this one.
 I've always been a fan of Mark. Now he's out with a really deep book. Its ideas are so powerful is it actually impossible to be fully absorbed and understood with just a first read. The book requires a lot of contemplation and rereading. I will definitely revisit it again every once in a while.
 By helping me reprioritize the things worth giving a f*** about, I learned what things I should not waste any valuable energy on. This book honestly helped me through the most difficult time of my life.
 I was curious about this book from the high rating and charts ranking. To be honest, I'm not sure what this book is really about. I do like the advice that one should not feeling entitled; and that one should take responsibility for what happens to one's life, but that's basically it.
 And I bought the hard copy!
 One of the best books I've ever read. So many things hit home to me. The last chapter especially. Thanks Mark........for everything.....especially for letting us know that it is ok to know life is not always a bed of roses.....and because of that it makes the bouquet that much sweeter. You are a brilliant writer.
 I was impressed by the author’s original blog that inspired this book, however the book did not live up to my expectations. I found myself setting it down more often than not. Had to stop. Not for me.
 Great book! Wish I had it years ago!
 Great bluntly honest self betterment book backed up by layman’s logic. A great read.
 Manson's not-so-small contribution to self-help genre is taking really, really deep universal concepts and making them simple and self evident and non-intimidating (while not diluting the core). Which makes this almost the perfect book for the average "new" genre audience.
 It's ok.  Honestly I think it's more about lowering your standards than it is about achieving what you want.  Don't expect much out of yourself and you will feel like a success.  Not really impressed.  I think this book would have made a bigger impact on me if the author had more credentials.  Not really seeing why he would be credible on the topic except that he has a lot of followers on his blog. It was entertaining in a quick read sort of way.  But that's all. Nothing thought provoking or life changing if this is what you are looking for.
 Started off with Bukowski, then addressed Alan Watts' Law of Reverse Effort, and already had me by then. This guy is one of my kind, whatever that kind is.
 As much as i hate to admit it, this book encourages me to check myself a bit and my values.
 My boyfriend and I enjoyed every minute! The narration was easy on the ears and the writer kept our attention throughout the entire book.
 I guess I liked it. Like, in the sense that a millennial figured out that life is what you make it, and decided to tell people about it.  I should have just downloaded the torrent, since this gentleman has more important values than money.<br/>All that said, it made me laugh a few times.
 Great listening too. Awesome book, never listened to one like it.
 Very entertaining listen without being preachy!
 A quick, easy listen on audio. I definitely wouldn't call it a "generation-defining self-help guide," as it's described, but it was enjoyable enough. There were some interesting insights, particularly centered on the author's own journey — he credits his success, in some ways, to reaching a low point and only then feeling free (not giving an F) to make his own path toward success and happiness. It was about what I expected from the title and from what I knew of the author, who is a famous blogger: entertaining, occasionally thought-provoking, but not penetratingly deep.
 I am 75% through the book and had to go to the reviews to see if I was crazy. This is the worst self-help book I’ve ever read. I am wondering how it ever got on any bestsellers list ! Perhaps it relates to 20-year-olds that like the frankness of the Vulgarity. What credentials Does this man have To be a behavioral expert? What life experiences that are so different from any of us?
 I don't know why i thought this would be good.
 An incredibly introspective read. Loved it! I would recommend it to members of my family except they wouldn't appreciate the f-bombs. I think that's what made it so real and raw. It's also very wise. You can tell Mark is well-read and knows his Stoics, his Buddhists, and a dash of Brené Brown. Mark adds his life experience which is pretty incredible considering the amount of world-traveling he's done.
 Seems like this book wasn't written for my demographic (I'm in my 40's).  I'm quite well read on the topics/techniques/thoughts within the book I just find the writing REALLY lacking in intelligence.  Probably intentionally which is fine but not a writing style I enjoy.
 Such a great read.  So good in fact I read it again.
 Not my cup of tea .
 Well written, good self help book.
 good
 Terrible, borderline damaging advice. I get it is tongue in cheek at parts, but the core storyline is basic, uninspired, and weak.
 The book certainly provides a novel perspective at approaching life. However, much of it can be gleamed from commonly witnessed facebook memes. There is a lot of filler, which I understand is made to be for the reader's enjoyment. However, this book could have been condensed to a third of its length into allll killer and no filler.
 This is my first review, so Mark should be pleased (or not), but I have to say that it had been a while since I was actually engaged enough to read an entire book, cover to cover. Whatever $ the author made from my purchase was well deserved...
 Excellent read regarding perception. Certainly something to consider in regard to what may be holding one back from fulfilling life's goals.
 I'm just glad for people who liked it !
 This book has so much to offer, it really helped me peel my own self awareness onion. One of the best thought provoking book that I have read.
 Very interesting
 One of the best books I have read (audible is best!) Certainly a 'reset' in how you might think about what is important.
 Just read it. I'm 65 and found it very funny. But, more than that, it is very insightful. Next I'm going to read Dostyevski's "The Idiot" inspired by Donald J. Trump.
 I swear as good as the next guy but this book is so saturated with the F-bomb that it I stopped reading it. After so many F’s it started to stress me out and wasn’t enjoyable.  Form what I did read it seems easier said than done.
 The book is a aggregation of experience based values. The author goes to great length to elaborate on the non productive dealings in life which add up to nothing but remorse. Live a life where everything is earned rather than entitled/bestowed upon and being responsible for our decisions.
 A worthwhile read. Witty, engaging, helpful, authentic and perceptive. Will be putting good advice into practice. Thanks for this Mark.
 This book will teach you that nearly ever bit of societal peer pressure you get from your peers and media is counter-intuitive to your well being and life satisfaction.  Which is good, especially in becoming an adult.
 LOVE
 Must read/listen! So inspirational! Ended up buying the book for highlighting purposes.
 Great book. Reinforced a lot of what I'm already doing and encouraged me to strive to be more insightful about myself (and also more true to myself).
 This book is raw, brutally honest and at times make you say, {was that necessary?} ... Yep! it was. But not disrespectful, and that's what I like about it.
 A book that helps you put focus on whats important and not worry so much about whats not important...very good book i would highly recommend it to any and all...but most of all to the people that worry easily and stress over everything...this book will help you look at things differently.
 NO WORDS TO DESCRIBE THIS BOOK.  JUST READ IT!!@
 This book is amazing! I went through a personal crisis and picked this up at the bookstore and read it within 2 days. I couldn't put it down and I couldn't stop highlighting my favorite paragraphs. Mark is super insightful and this book helped me a ton.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend!
 Probably one of the best books I have ever read. I'm afraid the title may push some people away, but the book has so much to learn from. Mark is a very straight-forward and comical guy, which makes it very fun to read.
 Does a great job of summarizing ways to prioritize what is most important in your life. And... it does so without all the fluff that many other self improvement writers do.
 Good read, at times  diverts from the subject.  Unnecessary cursing. Took to long to get to the meat and potatoes of the topic but did get his point across.
 Such an insightful book! Love how its not a typical self help book. Awesome stuff!
 It’s a breath of fresh air. I needed to hear this advice when I was going through a rough patch in life. Gets repetitive at the end though.
 Pretty amazing insight from such a young person.  I have red his blog for a few years and his book did not disappoint.
 After adjusting to the f@#! bombs, I found myself quite engaged with the book.  It has a "zen" like quality for one's perspective on life.  Thanks, Mark, for writing this book.
 Mark is an excellent writer with experience and insight that a lot of people lack. Loved this book and would highly recommend any of my friends and family (who aren't easily offended by curse words) to read it!!
 A very touching close to reality book ,discusses life in a realistic sarcastic way ,gives you shocking real fact about how is people think about them self and how they expect the others to treat them .
 Get out of here with this nonsense.
 Only read one page. no Fs given
 I started off really enjoying this book, but towards the end there were some things that I didn't fully agree with. However, I am going to read it a 2nd time to give it another shot.
 This book is a must read.  I'm almost 60 years old and I believe it is one of, if not the best books I've ever read.  Don't let the title put you off, very valuable insight!  I'm going to read it again next week.
 I cant see how this book can help anyone to achieve anything.<br/>Besides some good philosophical opinions and some ideas its total boring and with a negative frame. The worst thing is that there is nothing really to apply or to really "learn" . I hate "over-complicated new social conditioning  ideas, where you realize what is really going on, you see the matrix and really improve yourself." (The previous sentence its according to the style of this book. It had to be vague.)<br/><br/>Honestly i believe that the best and maybe only thing to read about Mark Manson is : The Life Purpose Guide" which you can find on internet.Its totally applicable , WITH TOTAL CLARITY, short , straightforward  to the point about what you want to do.
 Really great book, the storytelling was fantastic.  This book was a real wake up call for me.  I highly recommend it.
 I read the reviews, then read the book. Just as a note- some of us ACTUALLY cuss this much in real life. This is a great read, it helps you remember not everything is as complicated as humans make it out to be.
 He's direct. He isn't trying to sell you anything. He isn't siloing any knowledge. It is a genuine no-bullshit approach, and you should MAKE time to read it.
 If I could, I would broadcast every damn word in this book into the minds of every young person there is today especially those who constantly log into Tumblr because it's obvious they need to hear it more than anyone else.
 Mark hits the nail on the head with this one and I appreciate him sharing his impactful story about losing his friend and how that created momentum for change.
 Great book with amazing narration.
 Loved it! Will definitely make you think about things in a different way.
 Too much hype for a mediocrely-written book. Don't waste your time.
 Uses the f word a lot. Not for listening to with kids around. Good stories
 I am not a avid reader but I quickly read through it and with highlighter in hand found myself looking in the mirror so to speak at things I do and how the change that behavior!
 Great book! Funny and helpful!
 Too many sexual references to be considered intelligent and mature.
 This book has made me really happy.  He's funny and makes really great points.
 Fantastic read - solid perspective and realistic approach. I’m just fine with the potty mouth, as I have one myself...
 He must have an uncle Charlie!
 No-bullshit approach to self help. Nothing about your connection to the universe, or you are unique and special. The approach is very real-world and comes from a perspective my brain "gets" moreso than other books that try to talk you up rather than addressing root issues. Blunt with love.
 I liked the writing style; it was an easy read. Examples provided were very relatable.  I found the book very helpful.
 Very well written and love the narrator! I've listened to it 2 times and ready to listen again!
 Reading this book really puts things in perspective and it shows you how to filter through the non essential parts of life and focus on what’s important.
 I dunno what to say. Felt like a topical westernized treatment of Buddhism.
 Oh, I want more of this realistic and honest approach to life. If you are truly happy, you don't need to tell yourself in the mirror. You'd just go out and be happy.
 It's the kinda book you have to read more than once. I already read it but now I'm gonna buy it. It changes the way u look at your life
 there was one slight glitch that eliminated one of his words in chapter 8. other than that, really good.
 I thought about writing a review... but then was like....
 Really enjoyed the audiobook. Manson mixes Buddhism philosophy with modern life. I listened a few times and it is very enjoyable and funny.
 waste of time
 Nothing astounding here. Repetitive ramblings of a man that boasts how much he sucks.
 Loved the book. I was a little confused about the message at time, but some of the concepts Mark made were incredible and opened my mind to thinking differently.
 Learning what is important in life and how to let go of all the small stuff that flies at us each day is an important survival tool that is presented in this book
 Damn good book
 AWESOME BOOK!!!!
 A coming of age story with far more reality than any movie could capture. This is a fantastic read for anyone struggling with the paradox of pleasing others or living the life based on your own values.
 Hilarious. Direct. Full of substance. A great read. I feel the previous words sum it up and need more words.
 Amazing book<br/>Narrator is awesome<br/>Highly recommend 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
 author doesn't have open mind.
 I read this with two of my adult ESL students at the recommendation of my employer. While we found some idioms, words and phrases to discuss, the "philosophy" was rehashed and lacking imagination. After one chapter, they were both bored, and I couldn't blame them. Not worth the price or your time.
 I am typically not a lover of self help books but this is amazing. It put a lot of things into perspective. If you worry about the future or anything at all, this is the only book you will need to read.
 Internal values is my takeaway - have goals that I can control such as honesty rather then popularity for example.
 "Look at me. I can swear, and that makes me worth listening to."  I have nothing against profanity, but everything against someone who writes something so devoid of substance as this.  It doesn't take a genius to create a straw man (the big bad stupid self-help industry in his case) and set it ablaze.  It seems like Manson is happy to think that ALL of those who've made a vocation of trying to help other folks find their way are just as self-interested, materialistic, and pessimistic as he is.
 Great read
 Loved it. Made certain though processes about life seem so mich simpler. Also let's you know that everyone struggles with similar things in their mind. Great book.
 Great book buy and read it, actually read the thing.
 This is book is rather awesome, I have one copy and I had to get one for my boyfriend..
 Should be required reading for everyone, as everyone can learn something from this text. I look forward to reading more of his work!
 Absolutely loved this book! I think it’s a perfect reminder to what’s important in life and very logical!
 I agree with the premise, but the cocky, profanity-laden rantings turned me off. Does the author own a thesaurus? I highly doubt it. I have heard it said that the constant use of profanity shows a lack of imagination. Surely Manson could have substituted the F-word, and all its many permutations, with something more original, from time to time. I’m not protesting the use of the F-word (obviously it was in the title and I bought the book on audible) it was the grating repition of it that made it impossible for me to continue listening. Perhaps, had I been reading it, I would have been able to continue with the book.
 Love this book!
 I liked this book very blunt and straight to the point.
 Excellent read. Found out about Mark Manson on Chris Ryan's podcast (Tangentially Speaking). A fine example of using critical thinking.
 Never received it.
 Great book. Mark Monsons knows how to tell a story in a way that keeps you reading.
 Just finished it. About to read it again.
 I'm not going to waste time writing a review - this book is not worth the hype. Muscled through the first 20 minutes of the audiobook, and just "Nope."
 Perfect book, lots of (somewhat obvious) realizations that are relatable in so many levels.
 Easy read. It’s like having a wise cool friend telling you what you know but need to hear.
 Sense of humour and nice stories to help you get the idea.
 Disappointed because of all of the great reviews, but It was just okay... Didn’t really get anything out of it.
 Great book, lots of cussing but the lessons are valuable.
 I listened to this book during a 13 hour drive. Five hours well spent. The audiobook version on Audible is narrated exceptionaly well. After listening to it I vowed to buy the paper edition so I can reference (throw it at people and tell them to read) it for the rest of my life.
 This book actually helped me get my life together and stop playing the entitled little BRAT. Lets just say I used to be Jimmy.
 I learn something about myself every time I listen to this book. Mark knows how to blend in f-bombs without over doing and keeping the tone light hearted. This is an excellent book and not at all what I thought it would be.
 This book sucked. I couldn’t even bring myself to finish it.
 I absolutely love this book. The order, the details, to content itself is just amazing. I bought the book from barnes and noble but it was totally worth it
 Very glad I got a chance to read this. Nice addition to my collection
 Couldn’t finish it, seems too boring
 At least he is honest enough to say he is completely wrong...but that's ok (he's just slightly less wrong than he use to be and in the future he will be slightly less wrong than he was when he wrote this book).  When an author tells you he's wrong then what is the point of continuing to listen?<br/><br/>I was listening to the audiobook and realized 1/2 way through that it is just fluff to make a buck (or a lot of bucks) from his blog. And it is what he cares about...great, sadly it is not what I care about.  I think most 1 &amp; 2 star reviews are correct that this book is for young adults and that's great but again sadly I'm not a young adult either.  Lots of good dime store psychology points but it really could be done in 1/2 the time with an actual workable plan instead of: Change the way you think &amp; good luck.
 Can't say enough good things about this book! Truly an eye opener.
 Wow! I needed a good laugh, and this one really delivers! It opens by analyzing Charles Bukowski and his approach to life!! I can see why it was a best seller!!
 Must read for practical commentary rather than holier than thou self help books around nowadays. Liked the flow of ideas
 Loved this book, definitely suggest picking it up!
 I recommend this book ALL the time. It is so good.
 An easy read that had very thoughtful well woven stories and concepts on about how to approach life. Profound stories on entitlement, legacy and death
 Book really puts things into perspective. Wish I had found it earlier.
 Only giving 1 star because I couldn't give 0.<br/>There are only a handful of books I've given up on over the years, but when I realized I was cringing at the thought of picking this up again.... Perhaps my boyfriend was most succint in his review; "Tell them it's shitty, there's nothing else to say."
 Mr. Madson gets it. He drops the b.s. platitudes and ego-soothing narratives and tells the truth. Refreshing and honest, life-affirming.
 Surprisingly deep and philosophical. Useful contrarian thinking. Concise and clear.
 This was a fun and surprisingly insightful book that was well thought out, with great stories and interesting historical research.
 Mark Manson does a great job of conveying his message; in fact, even my dog had no issue digesting the information presented!
 Good book, delivered on time.
 Amazing book. As soon as I finished the first couple of chapters I was hooked. Changed mine and my girlfriends perspective on a lot of things.
 Really good read, I enjoyed the book and learned a few things.
 Great book - Really
 Practical perspective on managing emotions and growing personally. A little redundant but generally worth the read.
 The writing was very repetitive. The first 2/3 of the book were meaningless. Save your money or buy something else
 An unqualified, ignorant charlatan spews a bunch of garbage that excites the masses by offering a radical, unproven view on everyday life. Completes ignores basic psychology in order to sell books and get pageviews.
 Abslutely Worth reading book , it helps you opening yourself to your beliefs and mindset and questioning them kind a like your  nearest friends therapy ; Very useful to people who need a slap on the face to be aware of his circumstances and try to overcome the struggles that surround them It definitely reminds you the unpleasant truth ; that life is a gift and  you have to embrace joy and happines as much as you can in this uncertain existence , but is also bitch and your have to learn and be able to deal with it over your lifetime
 A great dovetail of witty, fun writing with a serious message. Several moments throughout when I had to pause, sometimes for a while, to absorb it. I've followed Mark's blog for a while, and this is everything you've come to expect from him.
 Insightful and humorous, an honest approach to dealing with life. If you enjoy Mark's blog, you'll love his book.
 Alot of time reading the book I find myself drifting off. Book was a gift so I will try to finish for that reason only.
 This book helps me relieve my anger from my job and my life. Everything is not as good as you think but we all have to accept its imperfection! This is how life goes. Thank u Mark!
 This book is incredible. It’s blunt and real and tells you like it is. I recommend EVERYONE read this book.
 Give this book a chance - read it until the end. Get past the swearing and your preconceived ideas of what you think it's about and you'll discover something amazing.
 Genuinely my praise for this book cannot be overstated. Give it a try.
 Damn good book. I liked the stories and the authors point of view of life due to his experiences. BBC sure knows how to pick em. I truly hope the writer create a part 2 of some sorts to build on this new fountadtion mindset he's created. That's how much I like this book.
 There were SO MANY "Aha moments" in here!  It really makes you reevaluate things!  Loved it!!!
 Excellent
 This book is just a rehashing of tons of other books and blog postings out there. He just uses harsh langauge in every sentence as a gimmick.<br/><br/>His view on current American culture is also nothing new.  The impact of social media on our mental health, etc. is not news.  His calling out of the white middle class is also just to provoke and has no relevance to the point he is making.<br/><br/>This entire book could be replaced with phrases like "just roll with it" or "go with the flow" or "focus less on the trivial many and focus more on the vital few".<br/><br/>I'd recommend the book on Essentialisim which delivers these messages in a much more possitive way.
 A Buddhist perspective written by a frat bro who's favorite adjective is an expletive.
 I picked it up because of the hilarious title but found the information inside enlightening and at times slightly profound.
 The second half of the book sucked. But, the first half was brilliant.<br/><br/>Manson turned psychological science into layman's terms. Really good.
 This book is the truth you need to hear but might not want to. The world pushes you to continue to want more and more but the happiest people don't fall into this trap. I recommend this book to anyone who feels like they aren't good enough or want to find how to become more confident in who they are. Manson won't let you lie to yourself anymore and he pushes you to take the action needed in your life. I can't recommend it enough!
 First chapter was amazing.<br/><br/>Slowed down after that, but still plenty of useful information. It's geared towards millennials and has a lot of good research cited.
 Clever title and clever start. Then a regurgitation of other similar self improvement books.
 Enjoyable
 This book is amazing really puts things in perspective helps you to clear your thoughts and helps you find the right track by not giving a f***
 This books is great. I've been reading a lot of self-help books and this is so down to earth. Simple and real.
 This one is straight off the Amazon best sellers list. Otherwise, I can't imagine searching for the book by its name. In fact, even Amazon search can't deal with the asterisk censorship and so the best you can get is "The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fck". However, those disappointed by the censorship would be glad to know that the 4-letter word (and its extensions) appears in full glory throughout the book. I often question myself about the creative impact of using expletives but in this case, it is just a literary device, so you might as well replace it with whatever word stirs up your guts.<br/><br/>The theme of the book is pretty much summed up by its title. It is about focus, choosing what you care about, just doing it and not giving a damn about things that do little more than drain away life's sap. To that end, the message in the book is repetitive and contains tidbit of knowledge that I find myself sharing with acquaintances. Unfortunately, that doesn't quite make me a life guru for I admittedly fail to put my money where my mouth is, dissemination being much easier than treading the path by yourself. The book also doesn't consistently hit the witticism gong but its forthrightness is bound to strike a chord. <br/><br/>Inevitably, preaching is true of any self-help book since it is all about self-realization and how one chooses to act up on it. To that effect, the book gets in to the stride right away with the story of Bukowski and his epitaph "don't try". The final part about immortality projects, conceptual self and the need to leave a legacy is particularly poignant but then that would be a recommendation for another book than this one. Such anecdotes littered throughout the book add substance to what may otherwise be construed as preaching. Also, most of the words of wisdom are borne out of experience and hence easy to appreciate for their relevance.<br/><br/>I would recommend this book to a lot of people whom I feel are far too obsessed with life's vagaries. However, it is only out of the altruistic (certainly not buying the book for them) hope that it will help them take a much more positive outlook towards life. At the same time, I wouldn't say that the book has flipped a switch in my mind for I see much of what is mentioned in this book as common knowledge but for the fact that application of the same is an altogether different beast. Ultimately, the book is of utility to those who want to find some use of it.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, one should understand that the book isn't a gospel and simply a person's take on life based on his experiences. It leaves a lot to disagree with since it seems a lot of the metaphors were shoehorned in this book to fill up the pages. For instance, a section of the book can be equated to the oft-used phrase "money doesn't bring happiness". This is easy to appreciate but at the same time a bit difficult to fathom when the entire world revolves around it and is undoubtedly a driving force behind the author's choice of career. Another instance is about failure bringing you back to where you started which is as true as you wish it to be for life doesn't remain in stasis while you fail. Similarly, despite the author's life struggles, his experiences are built up on his journey across countries which has been feasible on the strength of him being in the United States and having access to "cheaper" countries. Would these perspectives be true for someone struggling through life in a developing country and having lesser forms of escapism? Again, I believe not. The author chooses to harp on transient moments in life to put through a message. I often have thoughts running through my mind as I stare at the setting sun on the beach with the wind running through my hair and the waves receding after gracing my feet. While these picturesque moments fit well in to books and movies, the accompanying narrative doesn't translate much in to changing the humdrum of life. Of course, I could be as wrong about my take on life as much as the author is right, but such pessimism wouldn't find its way in to a book.  <br/><br/>This is not to say that there isn't much to take away from this book and find some positivity from it to apply to your life. The self-help industry wouldn't have been such a lucrative one if everyone knew what's best for them. At the same time, unless you have been living under a rock, you would have your own experiences and lessons from life that ought to have taught you a lot more, only if you chose to pay attention.
 Too bad for such a catchy headline. I found its lack of substance unbearable.
 Truly a great book. Made me re-think many things about my life and it is clear Mark put a lot of effort into making the reader take responsibility for their lives. I feel like a changed man after reading this, and that's not an easy thing to do as a writer.
 I've bought several copies of this book and have given them away to family and friends
 This book provides so much truth!
 LOVED IT!  Great read for anyone looking for spiritual insight in the nontraditional sense.
 Great book! Everyone should read as it give a different take on your views and what you actually value in your life.
 Mostly great. A good antidote to treacly self-help. Doesn't pull punches. At times funny as hell and almost always relevant.
 I like this book. It is fun and hilarious to read, not like other self-help books.
 Best book ever! Helped me in more ways than one!!
 It's the kind of book you could finish in one sitting. Fun and awkward ride.
 Incredibly well written, both in style and content. I've read every blog post by Mark and his last book and this all still felt very novel and meaningful. I would recommend this book to everyone.
 I really enjoyed the first half of this book. He made some really interesting points and provided a new perspective on life. I found many of his concepts thought-provoking and insightful. However, it went off the rails for me in the second half. I don't mind swear words but the tone in general came across more aggressive than necessary. And then he spent a lot of time talking abut himself. It just seemed odd, like he was trying to justify to himself why he chose to settle down. I would've purchased the summary if I had seen that first!
 One of the more entertaining, enjoyable and enlightened books I've read.
 This book is one of the more useless of the self-development book bunch. I've read/listened to a lot of books in that genre at this point and this one was so ineffective that I literally forgot what its content was after a while.  I thought that was odd, so after revisiting it, it became clear that the reason it's so easy to forget is because the book's message could easily be told in just a couple of paragraphs.
 Exceeded expectations.
 I couldn't get through the first chapter: Anyone who uses Charles Bukowski as a role model of any kind has questionable judgment. The overall message of this book may be right on target but I'll never know. The writing style is very flippant as well. I couldn't take it seriously. After a few pages of torture I took it back to the library.
 very well articulated
 You will love this book. So honest and just down right entertaining way to really self reflect.
 Highly recommended
 I really wish I had discovered this book and this perspective in my 20's. (But it's better late than never ☺)
 on second chapter my book stopped and not worked no more , very dissapoited
 An easy read that applies to anyone who wants to re-think their priorities and values to lead a happier, more productive life.
 Mark's book is not your average self-help book and it's a breath of fresh air for anyone going through tough times or just needed a little push in life. I've been following Mark for years and can honestly say that I have spent hours reading his articles on his blog site whenever I find myself in a rut. This book was exactly what I needed and hits all points right on the head. It's everything I needed to hear. Love it, Mark. Well worth the wait.
 Defiantly a different and fresh way to look at things, really enjoyed it.
 was great!
 Neither a masterpiece nor trash. Useful and self absorbed. Casual and judgmental. Fun, though. I await the revised edition once the author has lived a fuller life.
 By far....one of the greatest books I've ever read...well done.
 Take the book with a grain of salt, but it really helped me think differently about my life.
 Quite a few things I disagree with but defiantly kept me flipping pages. And this is coming from someone who does not read often.
 Had to get through the beginning, but really liked this book.  Not for people offended by profanity.
 Straight forward and not cheesy.
 Good book. Humorous insight. Profanity, obvioisly
 Amazing book. Complete game changer in how I look at everyday interactions
 Great book! A little unrealistic though.
 I don't mind ranting."F-bombs" don't bother me.However, this book don't have structure.I couldn't grasp anything out of this book.
 A great reminder to question why you do what you do, why you care about what you care about and why you waste time on crap that doesn't matter.
 Good book
 One of the best self development books out there. Deserving of the 5 star reviews.
 Great book
 Loved every single second of the book!
 This book is the work of an immature, narcissistic and egotistical twit. It is a boring and not woth reading.
 Great book. Hilarious and blunt with so many different topics used to get the message across. I loved it and will read it again.
 you are not special. prioritize whats important to you.<br/><br/>Thats all is the summary of this book. First half is pretty good and funny. Second half gets boring and kind of buddhist ideology forced. Pretty long book for what it offers..very little.
 Different! Fun and new perspective to the same old same old! Loved it
 Wow. What a mess.  It's nothing more than thinking out loud in a completely unorganized fashion.  He makes sure to literally cover every angle of whatever he is trying to get to, in order for people to pick out the parts they relate to.  I'll save you hours.... don't sweat the small stuff.  There you go. Now you take away the message he was "probably" trying to get it.  Its endless dribble of F-bombs for edginess and shock value, along with stories that don't really relate or go anywhere.  If you go to a psychic and are like, OMG SHE TOTALLY KNOWS EVERYTHING ABOUT ME, well, then you'll love this.  How this got published or has a following is beyond me. But I guess those looking for self help books will latch on to anything even remotely relate-able to their situation.  I received this as a gift thinking I would be into it, but it reads like a bunch of high school sophomores all wrote parts separately, dropped all the pages when they were turning it in, and just stacked them back together and stapled them together.<br/><br/>But if I learned anything from this book, it's that I'm a loser for giving a f*ck about this book and that doesn't make me a loser, not giving a f*ck is important, but you shouldn't give a f*ck cause that's what loser do, unless that is what you give a f*ck about, then you're a winner.... see how ridiculous that is. Well, that's the book.
 One of the best books I have read in years.  Literally changed my life.  I have re-read it twice already.
 Just finished this one, I enjoyed it. I wish I could make everyone read this book.
 It was good book, unfortunately, the narrator was annoying.
 Easy read. Some chapters were interesting, but I thought that it repeated the same ideas a lot. I personally think that his blog post entries are better.
 This book will help you get a grip on life and it will stick with you! The money you spend on this book will be the best money ever spent this year.
 I thought a lot of the messages came from the Stoic philosophy
 Useful book for anyone who tends to be ungrateful or egotistic through life!
 Amazing book! It helped me so much
 Very good. Deserves the second reading that I will give it. Should help the nature of the book to sink in better
 Loved this Audible so much. Helpful book.
 The message is shallow and unclear, the delivery is mediocre. Cool title though.
 Crude and lacking in nuance.
 Great book. It gives a good framework to put things in perspective and prioritize them.
 Must read for everyone. Truly a book that can reset you to do the things you truly want to do.
 Five stars!
 A fantastic read.  Think of this as having the same health benefits of an ice bath.
 boring and uninspiring
 Very good read, honest and straight forward.  Easy quick read as well.
 Love this book! Easy to read. Useful self help motivation advice.
 Absolutely life changing!
 Excellent read! Loved his humor throughout the book.
 Best of the best!!!
 WOW, What a book!! I was not expecting something so good!! Best book of the year among the "self help" books category!!
 This book was ridiculously powerful and makes anyone reimagine themselves in a new way. I highly advise someone to pick it up.
 Good product..Fast shipping!!
 Loved it!!!
 I've followed Mark's blog for several years. I feared this book would be childish. However, it was a great read and well researched. Well done!
 I was gonna write a similar self help book, but I didn't give enough of a fk to do it.
 love it so much
 So sad that it's finished.. love this guy and book. Don't know what to pick up and read next!
 entitles sensitive people to choose wisely what is a priority and a few other excellent points. I appreciate his writing style too on most of the blog posts as well.
 Perfect gift for anyone.
 5 stars!
 thankfully, I obtained a copy of this book on Kindle via Inter-library loan.  Otherwise I would be miffed at having wasted not just time, but also money.  the central theme is valuable, i.e. choosing what to concern oneself with, but the trudging and disjointed litany of anecdotal evidence reminded me of grading middle school 5-paragraph essays.
 You don't need to read the book. The whole story is on the orange dust cover. That's it, just a grabby title and boring long hardly related stories inside that sounds like someone babbling in-front of you and you want to get away.
 Great read that was a breath of fresh air.
 Read it. You'll live longer.
 Great read, with plenty of snippets to keep in your pocket for later. Also worth re-reading to see what you've missed.
 Amazing. I suffer from crippling anxiety and depression. This book has helped me look on a better side of things.
 Hated this book
 I'm a big fan of Mark's blog. And I was really looking forward to enjoying this book. I didn't. It felt clunky and piecemeal. The uncouth contrarian trope grated after the first 40 pages. The chapters on values read like a collection of book reviews on more influential works. And the personal stories struggled to reach a meaningful emotional apex. There's no doubt in my mind Mark Manson is great writer with a razor keen intellect and a talent for crafting a persuasive argument. Unfortunately, none of those attributes show up strongly in this book. Hopefully his sophomore effort hits closer to the mark.
 I'm on page 18 and I'm already losing interest. The book is poorly written and childish. Thank goodness I did not buy this book from amazon, but instead borrowed it from a friend.
 Useful, fun and deep. Amazing book, the first "personal growth" book that I really like.
 The profanities are just a strategy to get the reader to think deeply about their values and outlook on life.
 Mark Manson presents another  great book with his unique and authentic view of life. No bullshot,  no hippie-be happy crap.
 "The Subtle Art" is full of advice and ideas I found valuable and want to remind myself about daily.
 Good Read!
 Shallow
 haven't​ started yet, next on my list. the sample was good
 Excellent!  Especially the end. Very thought provoking.
 Outstanding book.  One of the best I have ever read on the topic of managing life
 Ok.  Not great.
 I enjoyed this book. It gives some causes for reflection. The style is very informal, but it is full of interesting concepts.
 Absolutely incredible
 It sounds crazy if you take it at face value however the explanations and stories explain a complex idea for ensuring you're devoting what little time you have in the most benificial way for your own logic. Purchased the audiobook through iTunes and I'm buying the paper back as well for a different way to absorb the message of the book.
 Necessary reading for life.
 The book is great
 boring
 Excellent! Thank You!
 Really good book
 Loved this book! Refreshing, motivating, real and honest! Perfection!
 Greatest Self Help book ever
 great easy read.
 Life changing!! A must read!
 I can't put into words how fantastic this book has been. From the insights to the opinons and the advices this book delivers... A Must-have to anyone struggling to find the pain they enjoy.<br/>Great piece from Mark Manson, very recommended. Oh, and incredible delivery time even for internacional.
 A funny, well-written, important and truly inspirational book.
 Good stuff but was proof read by a fourth grader because a fifth grader knows that the Japanese didn't fight the Philistine government.
 Extremely relatable and a really good read!
 Its sound like a great book
 Loved it.
 Good
 Love this book. Especially the part of pain and struggle. Love it. Thank You Mr. Manson.
 A really pathetic book, very poorly written, no message - other than be skeptical of reviews and throwing away hard earned money.
 Had the audiobook version. Loved it!
 Killed myself over this
 I personally thought the first 135-140 pages or so, were absolutely terrible.  But, I wanted to finish the book, and it actually 'decent' towards the end.  I did enjoy the last 1/3 of this book.<br/><br/>The transition of thoughts and ideas were all over the place.
 Excellent book! I'm going to read it again.
 Gimmicky and trite.
 Awesome
 Just another self help book
 A must read!
 This book is a great reminder to live life to the fullest and not worry about trivial issues in your life.
 I just finished the book! This is one of the best, if not the best self help style book I've ever read! It's raw and pure, and cuts right to the chase!
 Typical stuff if you have ever been in the real world...
 Loved it!
 A waste of time and not worth reading. Author has zero perspective, with little life experience to gain wisdom from. He is a privileged young white male with limited life experience and perspective. Those of his culture may think this book is worth the time, anyone else will be left wanting...
 This book was simply incredible. Mark you are a man of wisdom and what you wrote here was a masterpiece.<br/><br/>I downloaded the audio format and listened on my long commute to work every day. This book has changed my thinking
 This is not a review of the author's efforts which speak loudly for themselves, but a review of his audience, which will probably get what history dictates: extermination. But Hey, guys, what's wrong with that?<br/><br/>Good luck,<br/><br/>Jack (age 78).
 I keep going back to when he said on page 22, "This book will teach you to close your eyes and trust that you can fall backwards and still be okay." What is SO scary to me about that sentence (and ultimately the whole book) is that this guy, Mark Manson, has no real authority. Has he been on the other side? What is after death? How can I simply take HIS WORD FOR IT that it'll "be okay"? How can he possibly know that? He has no way of knowing that. Absolutely none. He doesn't source any power higher than himself. I'm supposed to trust this guy??? Show me someone who has risen from the dead! Then we'll talk.
 Too much attempted comedy whipped into this self help brownie mix
 Here is a thing not worth reading. The best advice I can give to those interested in buying it--after throwing away time I can never get back--is to apply the "subtle art" of N.G.F. to the book itself and ignore it.
 Seriously, it's the ADULTS that need would STOP awarding the "participation" awards... the kids have nothing to do with it!!
 hhuuuuuuuuhhhhuvcgghhvggjughhjjooohhuuuuuuuuhhhhuvcgghhvggjughhjjoooohhuuuuuuuuhhhhuvcgghhvggjughhjjoooooojjjjdh
 It's a mystery. This book has clearly been published, so why hasn't an Audible 'sample' been made available for it now? Did someone forget? Me, I don't buy *any* audio book unless I can sample the narration (and of course, a bit of the content). No Sample - No Sale.<br/><br/>Please fix it Amazon, so that I may relish in my becoming a tactful-yet-somehow-still-rude detractor of this particular collection of drivel, or perhaps become an Gratuitous optimist-come-life coach, tripping over my own fingers writing this books praises. Please? And m***** f****** thank you.
 Great Read!
 Truly intelligent people do not have to use the vulger language chosen by this author. It leads one to wonder if ANY of his comments have any worthwhile value. Please Mr. Manson (and others like him), get a decent vocabulaly. I have but a GED and mine is superlative compared to yours. It can be done. We call one of our freedoms "Free Speech", but any freedom can be abused and, when it does, takes freedom away from the freedom of others (as in, many wish to have the freedom NOT to see and deal with vulgarity, quite the conundrum...). NEVER even like seeing the cover of this book. Kids see it too.......i am sure  will be attacked as immature on this, but really, who is immature if this is the language they use?
 Excellent Excellent Excellent! A book that will change your life!
 This book is very good.  Also, It had some key points that made sense.  This book is a great read.
 This was so stupid. I regret getting this.
 Could not get through this audiobook with Manson's entitled Male POV.  I got it for a book club and all the ladies agreed it's good for 18 to 20-year-old guys who need some guidance in life. Not appealing to Women in their 30s and 40s.
 If he understood his own concept, he wouldn't have written a book.
 Didn't mind the language but the casual sexism in this book was pretty offensive.
 Unbelievably p'd off that I paid for this thinking it was a paperback! And of course I can't get a refund. Not happy
 Rich kid grows up.<br/>Kevin
 Extremely poorly written, and was a massive waste of  my time.
 The story line and advise is good but the vulgar w
 Decent advice and information. Gratuitous use of f-bombs (way overdone, we "get it") muddles the message.
 I don't give a F
 Hey Fellow Kids! This is my first time cringing at a book.. The overuse of stupid internet slang like 'you need to run out of F***Ks to give!' and every corny slang ever, reads like someone read an issue of men's health and maxim and a random 4chan thread and decided they were edgy enough to write a self help book presumably written for a juvenile audience. Go somewhere else for this sort of advice. Anyone under 30 will think this book is embarrassingly written.
 Meh
 A few dispersed curse words are tolerable if it pertains to the subject and enhances the information being delivered.  But this was way out of line.  It was a punk trying to see if he could enrage the populace by using the "F" word ad nauseam; to see if anyone would object to this.  And by actually publishing this tommy rot, it is unfortunately showing to the younger generations that such language is acceptable in daily usage.  And it is not!<br/>I tried but finally got tired of this degenerative use of language..which served no point/purpose.  It is so sad that this book has landed on the top seller list.  Come on world! Let's try to maintain some decorum and respect in our society.  Sad comment on today's society.  Soap Box concluded.
 Are you kidding me? This is relationship wisdom from a blogger / digital person who isn't yet 35 yrs old? If you're looking for a poorly-written, profane, disposable self-help read by a blogger who doesn't have enough experience to know any better, this is the download for you.
 I wish I had not bought this book.
 Save your money, it's short and to the point of exactly the title. I really think you can find a better read for free.
 This book is horrible. It is so cynical, negative and the amount of swearing was obnoxious. The author seems like a total bro with no real wisdom. I had to put it down after a few chapters. Can not believe this is a best seller.
 the title is intriguing.  and it previews a turgid little read full of the filthiest language the author could conjure up.  all Manson really has to say is "don't sweat the small stuff".<br/><br/>but that doesn't sell books.
 lame
 It’s ok.
 Had to stop after a chapter.
 some books don't need to be written. this is one of them.
 So far the book is excellent and thought provoking. However I got charged twice for the Audible version and twice for the Kindle readable version, its a good read/listen but not for $54.04....pretty aggravating to be honest.
 Too much chauvinistic language and Millennial cleverness.
 Vulgar
 Horrible.  But, in all fairness, there was one good piece in this book.  On page 210, the period after the word peak gave me a joy I will never forget.  Just kidding, I didn't make it that far.
 Who is this jerk and what makes him think he has any wisdom to impart? No, I am not offended by the title or the premise; hell, it was the title and the premise that made me buy the book. I am always so annoyed with self-help types who think they have unlocked the mysteries of life, based on their own existence. He has no foundation for his advice, just a hook. I'm also annoyed that I fell for it and made the purchase. Luckily, Audible let me return it. There's a couple of hours of listening I'll never get back.
 Summarized<br/>To thine own self be true<br/>Reassess priorities<br/>Too many F words, derogatory to women<br/><br/>Very secular, no mention of prayer as a way of life<br/>Finally , the answer to your wife’s question of “how do I look?” Is ALWAYS fine, beautiful!
 Are you kidding? The sample for this book is all of seven kindle pages long. How could I possibly tell if it's worth purchasing?!
 How disgusting.  The ongoing coarsening of our society.
 I absolutely hated this book. It is written for an audience of mediocre to low intellect, written in a very offensive, clearly sexist, vulgar and racist  language. There are no new ideas to take away - unless you have been a complete failure all your life. Not giving a F*? What he implies by that is simply prioritize what is important and what is not and do not waste your energy on things you cannot change. Duh.<br/><br/>If you have successfully finished 5th grade, you do not need this book.
 red flag
 Goes against every self-help or motivational book you've ever read.  This book is nothing more than a pat-on-the-back to every loser and stoner.
 I really liked the book but I didn't like that the story about the Japanese guy was not exactly correct. He moved back to Japan to open a school for decades. I dont know how Mark could miss that out. So it had some misinformation.
 This book irritated me.  It has a lot of interesting ideas in it, but it's written by a bro, for bros.  There's a lot of unnecessary vulgarity and dudery.  For instance, when talking about how most of your dreams will probably never come true, he says something about how "you'll never feel Jennifer Aniston's tits."  Dude... seriously?  He also shares a lot of "findings" and refers to some "studies" but doesn't back them up with any sources.  Also, his hypothetical examples are often based on gender stereotypes-- a man trying to get a promotion, a woman trying to find a life partner.  Yawn!
 First of all; the truth: I haven't read this book. The reviews submitted by all of you were extremely educational. As a youth, I read my share of "self-help" books. I don't bother anymore. Not because I have all the answers or lead a perfect, carefree life. None of us ever will.<br/>It would be easy to say (as one reviewer suggested) that all millennials should read this book. But, let's be honest, those who might really benefit from a book like this (at least the helpful parts as many of you have described them) would never dream it might be helpful to them. Our president for example. However, I doubt he has the attention span to make it through the first sentence. Personal responsibility, ethics, and choosing your battles wisely are such foreign concepts to him (and his idiot followers), It would be a waste of time.<br/> I learned the truly important concepts in my life from my parents. I didn't always listen, and far too often had to learn by trial and error. Granted, far too many people haven't had the benefit of a stable, loving family like I did.<br/>It's a shame you can't teach common sense or basic human kindness. Simply combine the two and you won't have to read a book to tell you how to prioritize what to get pissed off over.
 I did not purchase the book. I can't believe that people actually order it given that the F word is right there in the title. I am quite frankly surprised that anyone would expect anything but filth from reading it. The negative reviews of those who read it only confirm my impression of it.
 This book is s***.
 I didnt order this book
 Manson takes a HARD left turn from giving advice to thinly-veiled racism. Here is the progression:<br/><br/>(1) Manson argues that younger generations have been coddled, told that they are special, and they therefore are weak and bad.<br/>  --Note that people in every generation since the beginning of time have argued that the subsequent generations are weak and bad! And every new generation thinks they are being clever and original, when they are neither. Note that Plato quoted Socrates as saying, "Children are now tyrants.... They no longer rise when elders enter the room."<br/><br/>(2) Manson decries the removal of books from school curricula because they "they made someone feel bad."<br/>  --This phrasing should cause your ears to prick up. Should people who have used a racial slur used against them violently be forced to read texts that use the slur? Do you think that a good professor is one who keeps a book in the curriculum that contains graphic, disturbing violence that causes many of his students to be and feel unsafe and unwell? If you think yes, then Manson is your man. If you have compassion, recognize that Manson truly lacks empathy and emotional intelligence.<br/><br/>(3) Manson states that there are speakers being "banned from campuses for infractions as simple as suggesting that maybe some Halloween costumes really aren't that offensive."<br/>  --Here is the unforgivable, blatant racism that makes this book and its author trash. "Halloween costumes" that Manson argues "aren't that offensive" can be safely assumed to include costumes that require the wearer to masquerade as a different race. That is, white people like Manson putting makeup on their skin to assume a darker complexion, or wearing their hair in dreadlocks, or using makeup to change the appearance of their eyes. Blackface, brownface, and minstrels went out of fashion a long time ago (and they were never OK). Manson is an adult who should know better.<br/><br/>Manson defends cultural appropriation and racism. Any work of his is not worth the paper it is printed on.
 although i never read the book, the title suggests it is horrible. just before you judge me of jugding a book by its cover, i read from the reviews that it was full of profanity, so just bin it. and from the reviews, i also know that most of it is copied. so throw it in the bin.
 The title is obscene
 No, I did NOT read the book. I don't even want to read the entire title. My reaction is similar to those who see the word God, Jesus or Bible and immediately find offense. Obviously, I will be ridiculed for finding offense in the profane word which occurs in this title, while at the same time, idiots don't ridicule themselves for finding offense in Christian words. Even Greg Gutfeld, in one of his books, said that he likes to debate, but if you use a quote out of the Bible, then SHUT UP.  So, I then decided to use a quote out of his book, and then, SHUT THE BOOK.  THE POINT: It works both ways.
 What a waste of time and money! In a field populated by great books, this treatment is just a travesty. Shallow and half baked, full of "f" word, just for effect. Stopped after two hours of listening to this nonsense.
 Kindle sample is just the table of contents?
 i don't read anything without a sample. the Kindle sample consists of ... the table of contents. after receiving email after email from this guy tooting his own horn, i hoped to at least read an intelligent excerpt, but nope. not impressed.
 First of all... I hate books which gives you ideas about how to great, how to earn millions in 10 days etc... I even avoid the shelves in the bookstores where those are in endless queues. This one is totally different... gives you great ideas about how to look at things, how to prioritize your to do items and also about how to accept other people better. It does it on a really entertaining way... sometimes the style is harsh, but it fits to the contents well. You should read it if you feel overwhelmed, burned out, or if you just want to have a look at our world and things from an other/new angle.
 
 This book is one of the best I've read in a long long time!  I highly recommend it to everyone,  especially the worriers of the world. It decreased a lot of my anxiety lot because it clears the cluttered cob webs out of your mind so you can focus on what really matters and stop worrying about stuff I call "nonsensical."  Do not let the name of the book throw you.  Its a fantastic, no nonsense book. When a friend of mine first read the name of the book it threw her off.  "Oh we'll keep away from that" so I explained that it's not a book full of nasty words and comments that the cover actually is designed to draw attention to the fact that we live once, focus on what matters to you and not the small stuff and what people think.  It cleared my head of the cob webby anxiety that I had zero control over.<br/>In fact my husband started to read it n really likes it.<br/>Buy the book and enjoy.  You'll see.
 Love this book. Tells it like it is but be prepared for the title language to be used a lot. I saw a very famous rock musician at an airport carrying it so I had to look for it. I knew him years ago because his pilot then was a good friend of mine. As I’m reading it, I am wondering if he wrote it as I doubt it tells him anything he doesn’t know. I’ve traveled and lived all over the world and not much surprises me except what is happening in the U.S. and this is a great stress release as it just tells it like it is. No government manipulation just truths. An old friend called democracy allows for this type of excellent writing.
 Most articles are found on his blog, writing style is very amateurish and only picks up in the last few chapters. Felt a bit disappointed as the book was supposed to be a best seller
 This is a good book and would have been a good book without the F-bomb. As in most cases the word was used to draw attention. The writing was good and the ideas insightful, so didn't really need the flash bang, but ok I get the idea.  All this aside, some really grounded ideas on ditching stress and living well by accepting your real priorities and focusing attention on the things that really matter to you. Overall a good read.
 One of the best books I've ever read on changing your life.  Told with a great sense of humor, personal stories, relevant examples of what he is espousing, and easy for a layman to read.  My only advice?  If you feel that brutal honesty will offend your sense this isn't the book for you.  It is a no-holds barred book and doesn't apologize for it.  I have recommended this book to all my friends.
 Gives you perspective.  Funny, open and honest
 Light on art.  Half the title is the essence of the advice.<br/><br/>It is a lesson most people need to master.<br/><br/>If you can tolerate the "style" it might be worth reading.
 When your daughter says “this is what I want for Christmas” do you take a chance and get it? I did. And since she’s an adult, I thought she knew why better than I did.
 I found this book helpful when faced with a problem out of my control.  It’s all about perspective.  The author’s wisdom has echoes of Seneca, Marcus Aurelius, and the great Albert Ellis.  I bought it first on Audible, then in print.  Recommend!
 I got this book while going through a tough period in my life and loved the message and honest truths. I would whole-heartedly recommend this mood to anyone, and have already recommended it to friends and family.
 I really enjoyed this book! I listen to the audio book on audible.com and then I bought this book for a few of my clients for I am a life coach. A few okay maybe a lot of people say I sound just like him LOL lifepath advisor. Net
 This is a really great book. It gives you insight into what you should worry about and what you should just let go of. It’s a very nice book with causes you to pause and think. Good gift for someone who needs it too.
 I picked up a couple of copies for my younger cousins who are in their 20’s and we’re both received so well. Such a valuable message in shifting priorities to what matters.
 The book turns your guts inside out. There are lots of points that make you feel indignant, yet you can't help but agree. The name of the book is a little bit "misleading". Before reading it I was expecting like to find some advices of how to stop stressing out and hoping to find excuses for why I did not do some things in my life. On the contrary, the book gives you a cold shower explaining why you should take control and responsibility. Everyone will find something important in this book.
 Great read<br/>Very insightful despite the colourful langauge.
 My wife just started reading it.  She suffers from anxiety and depression.  This book has really lifted<br/>her spirits.  Do not be offended by its title!!
 The title got my attention of course and there were some early gut punches you have to survive to get through this book.  But it is definitely worth it to get to the final chapter.  I’m recommending this book to as many people as I can.  I’m amazed to discover that many people are as intrigued by the title as I am.  This book goes into my pantheon of books that are game changers for me!
 Bought this as a present and she can not stop telling me how amazing the book was.
 Awesome book!!! I did a lot of self-reflecting while reading it. I'll probably read it again. I highly recommend it!! Lots of use of the F word so buyer beware.
 Mark Manson is a great communicator/writer. I loved this book and found the tips easy to apply and helpful!
 To be honest, I’m not a book reader. I saw this book on a friends Instagram story and it caught my eye. Seemed pretty realistic so I gave it a go because F it right? LITERALLY. I couldn’t be more impressed with the book to relate to. The author of this book really gave myself an different outlook on life but in a positive way. I highly recommend it!
 I enjoyed this book. Very unique way of approaching self help. Mark described how instead of thinking of our feelings we should not care about them. Thinking about our negative feelings is a reinforcing process. We have to disassociate.😀
 reading it is one thing, but applying it is a little different.  I'm still working on the concepts.  interesting book for sure
 I thought this book would be very relatable and it is - but not because I fall into the expected tropes but instead because I find myself giving the same advice. Would recommend to a friend.
 Very enjoyable. I have gifted several copies of this book to other people and they all liked it.
 The no nonsense approach discussed in this book will definitely set you on a path of awareness. An awareness that many books attempt to deliver but fail. This book delivers quite a jolt punch to the ego. Well worth the purchase.
 This book is completely the honest truth, about life and everything in it. Every person, young and old should read this book. There is something to take away for everyone. This book has opened my eyes in so many different ways, and answered a lot of puzzling questions about my life.
 This is probably the best book I’ve read so far and I’m only 40 pages in!!  That’s saying a lot since I’ve read all of Melody Beattie’s books!
 This book changed my life when I was in a rut. Positivity is a pyramid scheme. Buy this book and see things from a new light.
 Well written. Informative and a book that makes you really think about your actions without being to "self help book".
 i'm currently listening to it for the d3rd time.  Interesting perspective and def helps you think differently about some issues.
 I LOVE this book and could not give it enough stars! A good book for ANYONE.
 Great book to read for self help. Really opens your eyes to a lot of new things.
 This is a wonderful read, it keeps your attention throughout the book. Reccomend to anyone interested.
 A detailed explanation of how to stop caring about useless things
 Better than I anticipated, really makes you think about hats going on in your own life and what’s worth giving a f...k over
 One of the best books you will ever read in your life!!
 This is a great book. Funny, but aso teaches you something
 Great gift ! Sometimes you just need a physical book !
 Was looking for a book to fill in some time on a plane ride - the piece where I wasn't sleeping.  Read the whole book, some of it twice.  No sleep.  Well Written and interesting.
 Love!
 Great advice. A ridiculous amount of unneeded profanity.
 Another one of those books that should be life's little handbook.
 Title is misleading. This book changed my life!
 quick shipping great product as stated
 It’s a book
 Absolutely love this book. It’s raw and edgy. Must read.!
 great read
 Great book.
 A++++++++++
 Helps me get through some days!
 Came as expected and the price was good to. Thanks Amazon.
 Perfect gift
 Item as described.
 love it still reading it. so far so good most of the think he said are really true.
 Great great book!!!
 Good book, practical and funny. Quick read, start/finished over the weekend
 great read
 I recommend reading this book
 Any human beings can benefit from reading it.<br/>Simple, deep, concrete and priceless to help you sort things out in your life.<br/>And hilarious, rude while poetic.
 Interesting, helpful book.
 Thank you for this awesome piece, Mark. This marks a very wonderful start of my reading habit.<br/><br/>- Points very clear<br/>- Language, matured and<br/>- Attitude, impeccable<br/><br/>I will most definitely circle back to read this again.
 Fun and easy read. The opposite of the typical self help book :)
 One of the best books I ever read!
 Item as described.
 great read
 Delivered on time. Good read.
 Kinda like AA for those of us who don't need it.
 great book. great advice.
 A great read for those who call it like they see it.
 I’m happy to have come across this book and am thankful to understand the different lights that have been shed on the common trivialities of life that seem difficult to overcome. Mark Manson doesn’t sugarcoat and allows the reader to perceive his blunt and truthfully words with meaning. Read it!
 fast shipper, great product
 Some good advice under slightly forced humor at times.  Definitely recommend reading.
 I was pleasantly surprised by this book. While perhaps appearing to be an arrogant, suck it up type motivational read, it actually was a bit more deep and really describes what I consider "Minduflness" from a different angle. Mark Manson has no certifications to speak of, but he just seems to get it. The book can come off as unsympathetic, but definitely much more well-thought out than I would have thought. Overall, compared to other books around this theme I have read, Manson does a great job at creatively hitting on some unique points and facets of the human experience.
 great book!
 As advertised
 Great read!
 The author presents an different very interesting perspective! Thought provoking, entertaining and funny! Would recommend the book and be open to a new New viewpoint.
 Interesting perspective.
 it was just ok
 life changer
 great book.
 The name of the book will attract younger people which is good. Will repel older people which is bad. I highly recommend it to all. It isn’t about not caring about anything. Only what is important. I have never found another book that does this so well.<br/>I just wish he would have learned a new word. Especially in the first part where the symbols are used overmuch.<br/>You might want to hide the title of the book from others who won’t know the real meaning of the book!
 Great!
 It a good book
 Good
 Great Read!!
 Perfectly real with humorous tone!
 So nice, I bought it twice!
 product was exactly how I wanted it
 Perfect
 Funny funny funny! Oh and really real. Of course there are plenty of “f” bombs that you will need to indulge if you want to be able to see the whole point.
 Just what I was looking for! Great value, shipped quickly and arrived as described!
 Great book! Helped me back off!
 The greatest book i've ever read. a life changing book with easy language everyone can catch up with it.
 Love love love this book!!
 I have shared this book with several other people and all have found it very insightful and helpful
 Rather comedic, yet very factual! Great read
 It’s a very great read, for those struggling with HEAVY inquisitions.<br/><br/>Sometimes as humans we NEED aro care about something, but what is that something? And will that something even care about us?<br/><br/>These questions we never ask ourselves, we just blindly care about anything and everything.<br/>However, we FAIL to realize that once we care about something we put our own emotions and personal attatching feeling to it.<br/><br/>So if you care about something, or someone, and they do something you dislike, you get mad, sad, or emotional.<br/><br/>THIS BOOK, will tell you in a counter intuitive way, to NOT care, do NOT Try.<br/><br/>And why?<br/><br/>Long story short, in my definition of the book.<br/><br/>Because once you accept that things are out of control, suffering is everywhere whether you’re poor or rich.<br/>We will ALWAYS have problems but you need to find the problems you like to have.<br/><br/>Sounds crazy right?<br/><br/>But get this book, this is a great read, humorous, enlightening, and entertaining.<br/><br/>Not too serious, and not at all boring.<br/>So no stress about having to remember everything this book says, give it a buy, it’s worth it I promise!<br/><br/>Stressed out life?<br/>Stressed out job?<br/>Stressed out anything?<br/>Read this book,
 Excellent.
 Funny Read
 xmas gift
 It took a while for it to arrive! But it was worth the wait, hell of a book!!! Everyone should read this book!!
 Definitely a good read.
 Great book!  Highly recommended!
 I liked this book a lot. It was both intertwining and useful. It helped to think about what matters. I think everyone should read it at some point.
 Very good book.. Must read for a happier life.<br/>I read page by page.. It is very interesting book thank you
 Love it
 Great
 Fantastic perspective (and sense of humour) that inspires you to review your values and action your ideas. Being a huge fan of Mark's blog, it was great to finally read his book.
 halfway done.  good read!
 I understand why this book was a New York Times bestseller and sold millions of copies and every entrepreneur should buy it and read it to understand themselves and to make sure they are not blocking their own success. Yes, you hear that well, in most of the case, your failure is your fault because you are entitled.<br/><br/>Success depends on how w are conditioned to measure success, it depends on our metrics.<br/>This book confirmed me that I was using the wrong metrics to measure my happiness and my success. I changed many things, but still, I have a serious way to go<br/><br/>Using the wrong metrics make sure we stagnate at some point in our life. personally or business wise. Creating anxiety &amp; self-doubt. Everyone has it.<br/><br/>Do you know friends, or maybe yourself, who love to become an entrepreneur or launch a new product and they keep talking about it and you have the impression they/ you don’t do anything about it? Lacking motivation?<br/><br/>It all comes down to our mind which is wired to go the easiest route. The choice of Status Quo is easier than trying. The choice of not starting (and not having failures) is easier than a possibility to have success.<br/><br/>This book explains more in details and gave great, unconventional, examples. The book is probably one of the most interesting books to read if you want real success and happiness
 I highly recommend you taking the time to read. It explains a lot about relationships, trust, and happiness. It’s truly enlightening.
 Very eye opening, and straight to the point. No sugar coating, somethings hits hard but you'll feel better afterwards.
 Great read.
 i really like this book, it is easy to follow and i can see myself reading this agin
 While several things that Mark says should be intuitively obvious to a reasonably smart person, the way he phrases them and breaks them down resonated very clearly with me. I was at a point in my life where I was second guessing a life-changing decision when I realized that what I had actually done was a step in the right direction. I had stopped giving a %# about things that did not matter. I also realized that several of the people who had held me back had not held me back...I had allowed them to hold me back thanks to my own insecurities. A realization is better late than never!
 Very inspiring. I have and will continue to recommend this book to anyone who needs the kick in the face as I did and still do.
 Must read. It gave me a different point of view and thinking about things happening to me. My fav book so far
 Just read it and have an open mind while doing so. It’s worth to take breaks and think some stuff through
 Amazing book. Really eye-opening in how failure and embracing the struggle is so vital in our lives -- yet rarely emphasized. A must-read for everyone.
 Great book and fast read
 Eye opening -  - challenging some of the deepest ‘truths’ - confronting yet so hard to put down ... Awesome!
 It’s perfect. New
 Great read highly recommend!
 Interesting point of view
 Good book for all ages.
 Love this book
 This book... I like this book. So, clearly, if you are offended by the f-word (will Amazon even allow it to be written out in full in a review? I'm not sure...) then you probably shouldn't read this book. However, it is more like a refreshingly blunt letting-go philosophy. It isn't really what the title might lead one to think it is. Some very good tips. One that I got a lot from is toward the front. I won't give a spoiler but it's good info. Very glad I ordered it and would pay full price again.
 Awesome book!!
 well written ..good points
 Amazing book. Speachless.
 You can’t NOT laugh while reading this. Mark Manson does an excellent job at making light of anything and everything. This is the necessary kick in the pants every reader needs at least once. I’m going to send a copy to my dad and brother for sure. Recommended for all
 This is probably the best book i have ever read! I’m buying this book for each of my adult boys for Christmas. At the end—the very end of this book—I cried! Just tears came out of nowhere. So strange. This is a life-changing, mind-blowing book. Completely wholeheartedly recommend.
 easy read. down to earth. simple. to the point.
 this sounds corny as heck but this book literally revamped my whole approach to my marriage, social anxiety, difficult things that have happened in my life, and just life in general. will recommend to anyone who stands still long enough, and i plan to reread it often. A++
 A read a blog post of the author's and really enjoyed it. The book is okay, reminds me to care about what is important and forget the rest. Seemed a little all over the map though. Would recommend but I don't think the full book was for me. Had some great points about social media and the changing social landscape we live in though. There were other little nuggets that made the book overall worth the read.
 This is a fun read, but the author carries the title a bit too far, metaphorically, and beyond a point, there's only so much mileage to get out of the "f" word. Still, it's worth a read because of its confidence-boosting, what-the-hell attitude. Well enough done.
 I read 54 books in 2016 and this perhaps was my favorite.  Funny and straight-forward with amazing life lessons, the author's general message is simple:  Stop comparing yourself to other people.  What are the standards you have for yourself?  Who do you want to be isolated from everyone else and why?  Chasing dreams of others will never truly make you happy and will be a never-ending feedback loop.  Stop caring so much about what other people think about you and care more about what you think of yourself.  Highly recommended for anyone.
 I enjoyed listening to the author’s personal experience. Some of his advice helped me to resolve a few issues I have been mulling over, and also to shift my focus on some trivial things in my life; but I didn’t love the entire book.
 Hard read, couldnt get past first chapter talked in circles.
 Amazing book! Mark brings up great points that make you think and really get to know yourself and figure out how many excuses you have for everything. Highly recommend.
 Simply put and helps eliminate all the clutter in our minds that life can bring on...life happens and this book is a sifter back to what matters &amp; simplicity.
 pretty good read !
 Bought it for my wife.  She likes it.  Finds it to be funny and inquisitive.  Great price.  Beats Barnes and Noble
 Cant wait to read.  Heard nothing but great reviews
 Gift for my son as the title reflects his attitude.
 Just started reading and so far I'm loving it.
 What not to love about this?!
 great fucken book
 I've had trouble getting reviews discussing the book and its premise approved. Suffice to say I did not gain anything from reading, and quit about a quarter of the way through.
 I think it is a bit too short though. I love reading more of these things. He gave examples where I always did put myself into his shoes into his stories and try to reconcile with my own. It was a fun journey.
 I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday - he said it's a very good book, i will read it after
 This book has already helped me drop the concern for so many things in my life I was wasting attention towards.<br/><br/>Thank you
 There are 2-3 interesting points I got from this book in total, but otherwise, the writing is quite shallow. The long intro story in each chapter does not necessarily support the point that the author tries to make afterward. Many of the stories he told are purposely over exaggerated at the superficial level just to make them sound more interesting (looking back at the title, yup, this is his favorite writing style). According to his anecdote, as a blogger, he didn't give a F* about the accuracy of what he writes (coolness is what he gives a F* about, not accuracy). He said he has grown, but looking at this book, he hasn't quite gotten over that irresponsible writing habit yet.<br/><br/>In addition, the author's life story is so annoying. He tells us how he was a privilege spoiled kid who ruined his own life with his irresponsibilities and self obsession. Then he talks about how he got over his spoiled behavior and habits. Ugh, I had to stop reading at the part where he whines about his past relationship problem for the third time. I feel this book is more suitable for younger readers. I feel that the author has yet to face the real challenges in life. His writing style makes it obvious that he has not grown over that self-obsession stage. In an early chapter, he claims that this book is completely different from the other self-help books, and that other self-help books are basically useless. Yet, in depth, lots of ideas presented in this book have already been written about in various many other books.
 I kept listening to the (audio)book figuring there had to be some worthwhile content coming because, after all, this was a published book by Harper, a reputable company .....As Disappointment Panda would say "you are TSOL, loser."  This "book" and I use that word generously as it has so many flaws that is hard to know where to start.  An early tip-off to how inane, self-absorbed, sophmoric, and at times just plain stupidly silly this book is the repeated mention that self-help books are a waste of time and effort from a...wait for it....self-help book on finding your true self/inner values/deep meaning.  I struggled with all of the following at different times:  wandering arguments full of pseudo deep thoughts and ying-yang comparisons; the sheer absence of anything approaching science or fact (other than a couple of shallow genuflections to the most obvious findings from psychology and behavioral economics); gratuitous obscenities; and hyper generalizations of the "this happened to me so it is guaranteed to work for you" variety.  Perhaps most galling is this slap-dash pile of crap masquerading as wisdom comes from a 30-something author whose actual accomplishments are  - by all appearances - rather modest.  Perhaps this is the nature of our times and the level of performance to be expected from a professional "blogger" - which I will now interpret as someone who writes and publishes despite having nothing interesting to say.  Here is my worldly advice - SKIP this book and read Gratitude by Oliver Sachs - a beautifully written book by someone looking back on a life well-lived and deeply thought over.  It is the difference between filet de mignon and beef bouillon.
 This was painful. Painful to listen to. I was so excited to hear this book (got it on Audible) and while there were a few nuggets of  good information, that I have learned elsewhere (and by nuggets, i mean maybe 3 sentences), the rest was really just some guy that seemed like he wanted to hear himself talk. I have read and listened to teachers of all disciplines on personal development, introspection, etc. I was hoping this would be a great combination of insight and dogma. It really felt like I was going to lose my sanity listening to this but wanted to give the whole thing a chance.<br/>This felt like a guy just sharing some stuff he learned from his big brother and putting it into a book. I had seen one quote from this book, and really liked it, but found it to be stuff I already knew (which I would happily listen to again, as we all need reminding) and the rest as a real waste of time.<br/><br/>Sadly disappointed.
 HANDS DOWN BEST BOOK EVER!! Literally everyone should read this book. It’s entertaining and well formatted, fun voice acting, engaging chapters, spiritual aspect was nice and very down to earth. Plus, bonus, it says the F-word like a million times. My husband and I read and reread this book. It helped us to let go and stop giving way too many foxes about things that just don’t matter (or if they DO matter, to chill the fox out and just be happy anyway)<br/><br/>BUY this book READ it REREAD it and give it to EVERYONE you know as a gift!
 Listened to this on a long ass trip from Minneapolis to Fargo and back. I loved the perspective. So many 'self help' books focus on building you up and making you feel good about yourself and/or telling you to change your mindset by believing what you want to be true, to be true. Mark takes a different approach by stating that our lives are really just a never ending cycle of problems, and that if we don't take responsibility for our reactions to said problems, we'll never really stand a chance at happiness. Also being happy 100% of the time isn't a thing. I especially loved the chapter on becoming 'less wrong'.  All in all a great read,  and made the drive through 10 hours of corn fields much more bearable.
 This book explains how you can practice stoicism in your daily life. It is a handbook on finding fulfillment, accepting pain, overcoming failure, and facing death.<br/><br/>Unfortunately it is written in a flippant style meant to appeal to edgy 20 somethings. Please don't let that stop you from reading this book. This book is filled with wisdom on living life well. Every page, every paragraph, every sentence is filled with practical and useful advice. This book distills the best out of several topics: Meditations by Marcus Aurelius, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, The Seven Habits, Ego is the Enemy, to name a few.<br/><br/>This is a must read if you are looking for valuable life advice.
 I was skeptical about this book at first. I've always been a positive mentality type of guy. Look at the brighter side of all things, even dark. I enjoy Tony Robbins and his energy, and countless others who preach and breathe gratefulness and jubilation. So to no surprise, I actually did not enjoy the book at first. Manson goes on a rant on how being happy is a facade, that it's not a problem to dwell on the bad. I first I was taken aback and thought of not reading the rest, but I pushed on, and glad I did. He ends up detailing how we must accept the bad, and use it to make us stronger, not just ignore it. Appreciate the struggle, it breeds determination for better. This book, without a doubt, is on my top 5 recommendations to anyone. It teaches you to become grateful, accept the bad, but learn from it. Focus on the things that make you happy, but don't shut out the crap in our lives, learn how to turn it into less crap, because there will always be crap, just matters on how we deal with it.
 This book will offend many, but mainly because of three things: 1) the profanity, 2) close-mindedness, and 3) fear of vulnerability.  The title is the biggest indication that "foul" language is used, but if you focus on that you completely miss the important gems in the book.  Everyone has their own philosophy on life and Mark Manson is spot-on in my opinion.  Basically, it is okay to be yourself, so focus on what is important and forget the rest.  We all make mistakes and get hit with curveballs.  How you handle it is determines your next step...good or bad.
 I was enjoying this book until “child dying of throat cancer? At least you won’t have to pay for a college fund anymore”. Satire or not, that is so inappropriate and offensive to anyone who has a terminally ill child. Respect lost.
 Looks like Mr. Manson has all the answers in this book?!  It's always good to look on the positive side people! Plain &amp; simple! You don't need the advice of this guy who's just trying to sell books with "catchy" titles. Ridiculous.
 He knows what he's talking ABOUT..it seems like science to me!<br/><br/>Five stars because the guy having a hilarious heart and also for the too much explaining!<br/><br/>To be a grounded human is also important as the book emphasizes
 very easy to understand. i enjoyed learning the basics.
 This book was hard to miss.  The cover and title intriguing.  Was not something I would usually buy, I did.  I did not put this book down.  Read it in a sitting.  I am a senior so beyond buying self help books.  However, can’t say I have enjoyed reading something this much in years.  I read several books a month.  Kudos to Mark Manson....you are a very wise guy...you nailed it with this book!
 I don’t really give a F*** about this review or what you people think. Good to listen to while drive, doing chores or encouraging forced laborers to continue working beyond exhaustion.
 This book is a good introduction or reminder, that life is short and we waste a lot of time on frivolous and self-absorbed things. That we let fear inhibit our potential. That choosing want not to give a f*** about forces us to focus on a few things to really value and pursue.
 I read this book too late in life, I’ve already learned to live my own life and not care one whit about keeping up with the Jones.
