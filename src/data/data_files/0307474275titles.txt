Enjoyable
Secret Societies RULE and Make for a Breezy, Fun Read

The movie is good but the book is so much better
Entertaining, Interesting Summer Read
A good page-turner
Well worth reading.
Bubble-gum history
Awesome story. The writing is not first class
A wonderful book that will keep you guessing with each page turn

Lovely.
Not Bad... Not Great
Great original thriller for Brown
A Classic In Pop Fiction
Good fiction, bad history
good book, but too much hype
History buffs of the world, unite and read!
Good Read
I wanted a Kindle version in addition to the hardback (illustrated) edition I already own
Suspenseful, educational, and just plain awesome!!
Fabulously capitvating intellectual thriller
A response to some reviews I find unfair here
Interesting and fast-paced
A bit of a disappointment
A great book
Not as good as the first book
Interesting, but vastly over-rated
GREAT Book
Very Captivating
Robert Langdon is a better read than a Tom Hanks movie
Everything Good is Bad and Everything Bad is Good
Interesting enough yet predictable and redundant
Not really the books fault
Great Read
Sentimental Purchase
Entertaining, Informative,  and Thought-Provoking
Great read if you keep an open mind
The Beloved Disciple
An exciting fast paced and interesting read, but not a history book.
Captivating
Breakthrough Novel
The DaVinci Code novel
Meh... somewhat fun, but mostly boring and formulaic.
this is an excellent read. Lots of history and symbolism
I'm probably super biased, but I love Dan Brown's books
Page Turning
Good Read
Love It!!!
A "Gotta" Read

Better than the Movie
Collection item for the bookshelf, not for reading pleasure
FANTASTIC!
Doesn't disappoint
Awkward Book
why mona lisa smiles
Deeply Thought Provoking
As great story as the movie
Fascinating book, though not for the deeply religious
Interesting concepts, poor characterization
Love Robert Langdon!

Dan Brown is a master
B: Very enjoyable. I am a slow reader,would assume if this book was read in a hurry you would miss a lot.

You'll need to read sitting at your computer for this one!
I am not really sure I liked this book
The novel provides oat of interesting theories intricately woven into what we know as historical fact.
Angels and Demons was better between the two but eventful
Well written pseudo-historical novel by cynical author
Adventure abounds.
Really holds interest!

What a Disappointment!
Made me the Dan Brown fan I am today

‘The Da Vinci Code’ Review/ Brady Schofield
Great book, but keep some things in mind
A Good Thriller With A Few Shortcomings
Gripping Tale!
A STUNNING AND INTRICATELY PLOTTED THRILLER...
Loved this.
The plot centers around Robert Langdon and his French accomplice Sophie Neveu and how they both use their underappreciated skill
Fascinating page-turning mystery, but is it historical?
A fun read!
Love it and get confused by it at the same time
Between the conception and the creation...falls the Shadow
Adds another layer to the reading!
(Three and a half stars) Provocative, but . . .
A fast-paced thriller that makes you think
Dedicated to female form
Terrific buildup with a disappointing ending
Fast-Paced Murder Mystery/Historical Thriller
A hard-to-put-down, thrilling read, for those who enjoy puzzles
"So Dark the Con of Man..."
Action-packed thriller, true to the hype
Not another review of this book

Good but not worthy of all this hype...
Momentary divertissement
This is fiction, people!
Average...
Page-turner with a clever foundation, but . . . . . .
Okay, okay . . .
Interesting Premise....Cardboard Characters...
Too much Hype No substance

Good execution of a routine formula
Great Story...And That's What It Is, A Great STORY!
Pretty marginal work- 2 1/2 stars

A fantastic addition to an already stunning thriller...
A FASCINATING AND INTRICATELY PLOTTED THRILLER...
A must read for those with an open mind...
Staggeringly mediocre----why has this sold 1 copy for every 100 people on Earth?
Exciting, A Few Twists, Mildly Predictable, Interesting Settings, Good, Not Great
Forget religious implications,  poorly written book fails to intrigue
Entertaining read
A good diversion for a long trip
Fine for people who aren't bothered about writing quality
5 stars for illustrations, 3 for novel, but a good buy
have an art book near by
Fun, but put your brain on hold for the duration
Decent Summer Read
A Conspiracy In Decrypting Fiction
Highly entertaining FICTION.  Just don't let the author convince you it's anything more than that
Over hyped thriller.
Intelligent writing
A good page-turner
Is there any point?
Flawed Facts, But An Enjoyable Work Of Fiction.
A FASCINATING AND INTRICATELY PLOTTED THRILLER...
The Da Vinci Scam... no code except for the barcode
Not a masterpiece
The Da Vinci Code is good--but there's something better.
NOT a "Novel”, But a Doctor's Thesis with No Factual Basis: Witty, Engaging, Fun—But Poorly Researched and Confusing
"My FIrst Mystery" makes a good introduction to the genre
Trite and Formulaic
A fun read but ...
THE DA VINCI CODE
OK, but not mind-blowing
A great book inspite of the masses
Better then the movie
A real farce!
Despite what you might think, a good read none of the less
Great Thriller
Much Better Books on this Subject Out There
Engaging but Simplistic Plot
The Da Vinci Code: Special Illustrated Edition
If you Take You Religion Seriously...
Da Vinci Code - Nonstop Action; Enjoy It, Don't Overanalyze It
Poor writing + worse history = lame conspiracy theory novel
Truly Masterful, and INCREDIBLY Addicting!
Incredibly fun read!
Doesn't live up to the hype
A page turner, but not a masterpiece
Giving clues to solve puzzles was a good way to engage readers throughout the book
Distorted history ruins book
Highly provocative
Engrossing story
Worthy of the hype...as a work of fiction
Re-read... and that is rare for me...

Intelligent, Stimulating, Implausible, Overanalytical
Help, I've Started and I Can't Stop...
So what is all the fuss about?

It's a great yarn
Imaginative and Entertaining
The Ultimate 3P

Very Rich in Plot And Interesting Research!
Short Review
Page turning.
Great blend of Religious History and Adventure
The race is on...
In the end, which side of the story you believe becomes a matter of faith
Another Page-Turner by Dan Brown
3 ½ stars.  Good plot, action, ideas, and characters.  It's a fun escape, but it has an unsatisfying incomplete ending.
I hate this book!  Caveat lector!
Intriguing Tale
Learning while you read.
well... at least it goes by fast...
Exciting and believable combination of fact and fiction
What on Earth is all the fuss!
Just Wrong
Brown seems to use a formula, but it's a good one
Best book I've read in a long time !!
One of the BEST fiction books ever!
A Wonderful Masterpiece... Dan Brown deserved every penny this book brought in!
Better than I hoped...
Fascinating plot, pedestrian writing
A good story
This book reminds me of the cautionary tale of "Foucault's Pendulum" By Umberto Eco
Riveting and thought provoking!
Good idea--amateurish writing
It's FICTION, kids.

Predictable, and the "research" at times is laughable
A day spent with Wikipedia
An irresponsible book
Only reason I kept this book....
Overrated

A witch's brew (Cackle, Cackle)
Finally, a picture book for adults!
Wait... What's the big deal again?

What's all the fuss about?
Read 'Holy Blood, Holy Grail' Instead.......
Suspenseful and well-told, but too anti-Christian for me
A general reader's march into the estoteric and the arcane.
Dan Brown's THE DA VINCI CODE ...
Extremely interesting, but a cookie cutter plot
Awesome
Even better read after seeing the movie!
