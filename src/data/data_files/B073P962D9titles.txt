The worst HP fanfiction ever...
Childhood dissapointment
NOT the eighth story, very disappointing, not going to read this again
Yuk! If your looking for great storytelling, look somewhere else.
Not the 8th Harry Potter book.
Incendio!
This book is not HP canon to me...
Opportunism at its finest.
Huge disappointment
A dud.
D for Dreadful
Reads like hastily written fan fiction
Money Grab
JK Rowling was apart of this? Really? I have a tough time believing this is her work. SPOILERS AHEAD!!!
Seriously disappointing.
It's not the Harry that we know or love.
Very disappointed. Save your money
Can someone perform a memory charm on me please?
Waste of money
This is NOT a HP Book
A Waste of Time and Money
Epic Fail!
Alas
Like bad fan fiction - so disappointed
Disappointing
I loved the original Harry Potter books
Mediocre
Clearly from a different author, it's like one of those flashback shows.
I've actually read better fan-fiction.

Not your typical Harry Potter or anything like it..
Should've never been written
Cursed Continuation
Words cannot describe my disappointment
I feel duped

Please!  Somebody do an  Obliviate!  memory charm and remove this book from my memory

An unbelievable mess.
It is BS, the play book still can be good if they written thoughtfully!

Lazy writing
Hmmm,did I just read a faux HP book?
Literary Vomit.
Heartbreaking for true Potter fans
LOVED IT
Read it.... But be prepared for the format and lack of satisfying writing
One word: OBLIVIATE!
I've loved Harry Potter since the 3rd grade
Interesting plot, some mannerisms were missed
Just know this book is NOT written b j.k. Rowling. Do not expect the same style.
Complete Rubbish. Don't waste your time or money.
Continuing the story
Giant plot holes
Couldn't finish. Really tried, but couldn't do it
Well marketed but disappointing
It's been said better in other reviews
HP books are a billion times better than HP movies which are a billion times better than the Cursed Child
Be advised: J.K. Rowling did not write this play

An okay sequel, but lacking in the kind of emotional conflict that Rowling excels at
Crappy fan fiction

SPOILER ALERT!
Ugghh!
Tragically Awful
Mistakes, caricatures, and plot issues
Disservice to the amazing Harry Potter series-none of JK's wit, humor, skillful story telling.
I Don't Understand
A Puzzling Story
Terribly Disappointing
A lengthy review from a life-long Harry Potter fan
... play is a betrayal and a departure of the beautiful world Rowling built
I guess it could be worse....
Disappointment Managed
This is fan fiction, not canon - can I pretend I never read it?
What a disappointment ... tempered by one single line in the whole book
NOT Harry Potter 8 !
3.5/5
Ug!
I'd rather be hit with the Crucio curse.
Like visiting an old friend who's changed over the years...and doesn't have a lot to say.
Odd addendum to the beloved series
Not the Potter you know but
Avoid this book if you like Harry Potter.
I believe it will look great as a play on the stage
it was bad. Me and my wife are avid potter heads
Okay but somewhat disappointing Harry Potter fan fic...
OK, but Had Hoped for More

It simply isn't a good story and it reads unfortunately like bad fan fiction
Spoiler-Free Opinion: Legacy-affecting, unnecessary addition to HP Universe

Cash-grab awful fanfiction
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times... oops wrong story - but oddly the same feeling.

This reads like the worst example of angst-y fan fiction I've ever ...
Wait for the movie, or go to a library if you must
Childish.  Oh well...
mediocre fan fic.  Not impressed at all.
A bit of a letdown
can't believe people are still buying this
A story better told in a novel or on a movie screen, not as a theater script
Great disappointment
Truly Terrible!
Not the Harry Potter I have grown to love - Interesting storyline but poorly executed - Limited character development.
... rating is for the simple fact that it was good to read old characters you know and love again
SO PREDICTABLE AND SADLY WRITTEN
Cursed Child was ok....
Don't bother!
Lacks all storyteller magic
Pleased with the story, as long as you think of it as a stand alone story NOT the 8th Harry Potter book
WORST BOOK EVER!
You'll be shocked JK Rowling approved this script
Pretty good, not ground breaking
Major Disappointment
Hated it.
Fan Fiction at best...
Interesting but not the same
I absolutely LOVE IT!
Disappointing
Don't have high expectations...
I enjoyed it but it was a little weird too
Don't hold your breath....
Potter had lost the magic
It was ok
If You Love Harry Potter, Don't Read This
OK, but not all by Rowling.
I was hoping the reviews were wrong, they are not.
Dumpster Fire
Check it out from the library instead
May be great to watch, but not great to read
Guaranteed to Be Polarizing

Disappointing
See it on stage, skip the "book"
So I am biased to really love this book
Adventure, heart and a testament to the power of friendship & family, a must-read for HP fans
Review from a theatre grad
This book is a curse on Potter fans!
I wanted to like it, even a little. But no.
Shockingly awful.
If you are curious about the script then read it, your want and opinion is what matters.
This story killed me...it was that horrible.
Nope
A disappointment
Great read, worth the money and time. Goes fast.
Clumsy, heavy-handed and sloppily crafted
Disappointed
This was not Harry Potter.
Uninspired play that does not add much to the Harry Potter World
Read the reviews post-release, the rest are publisher driven.

Good Harry Potter Story, Less Than Satisfying Play
True to the Books
Who wrote this, a dementor?üò°
Now that I've read it, the only reason to keep this book is to use the pages to mop up my tears of disappointment
If only JK Rowling had written this as a book
It didn't happen...
The play is probably better than reading it....
This is good as long you are clear what you're getting
Not your typical HP‚ö°Ô∏è
Probably not the best genre for a story this size
Who wrote this mess?
Probably better on the stage
Left me feeling 'Hallow'...
Definitely Not Up To JK Rowling's Usual Standard
A Monumental Disappointment!
Harry Potter and the Cursed Child - whens the movie going to be produced?
Everyone's saying it because it's true - bad fanfic

Oh so dissapointed.
It's Not That Bad
Be prepared for a very different kind of Harry Potter story
Welcome to the script of a bad fanfic high school play
which was fine. There was
All in all, a big let down.  Not worth the price buying new.
Wish I had skipped it
Disappointed
I did enjoy reading about the "adult" version of our hero
Not as good as I had hoped
So disappointed.
Sorry to say, don't waste your time on this book
Great Story, Good script.  BUT IT IS A SCRIPT. keep that in mind.
An obvious Cash grab
A pity it is not about Albus and Scorpius. This series I would like to read.
So this is what's it like when J.K. Rowling writes fan fiction.
It's a screen play.
Ridiculum!
Jo Write Fan-Fiction
Interesting Diaspora
Somewhat of a let-down
Play the Play
While I liked the story somewhat
It's a play not a novel, enjoy it for what it is
Aspies get confused when names are repeated
If you're a Harry Potter fan you'll love it, If you've not read them before, don't start here
Teased with anticipation, joyful for the memory, but saddened by the rushed story line and painful dictation
the screenplay kind of writing makes it very dull and somehow hard to follow
A quick read that is sure to disappoint most
Not worth it.
Time travel fail
Almost ruined the original stories for me.
I could have done with this poor attempt to undermind the character of a beloved icon ...
Huge disappointment......
Reads a bit more like hopeful fanfic than Harry Potter
Shouldn't a script be in some sort of loose leaf binder?
Nothing like the original series.
A quick and satisfying read.

It is copy of 'Back to the future' movie.
Horrible!

I feel like I wasted my money
Very disappointed
Travesty.
Not a Harry Potter book
Didn't love it.
Good story, but not great.

Not the greatest of Harry Potter story's, but an enjoyable read none the less.

A Difficult Read
Why I would not recommend buying this book....
Pathetic
Waste of money and time

So, SO bad.
Nostalgia: Yes. Sequel: No.
"Fan fiction" writing level, oversimplified and shallow.
Don't waste your time or money
Go in with an open mind . . .
J.K. I'm Dissapointed
Pleasant quick read with almost the Harry Potter feel.
... just took me that long to acclimate to my favorite HP characters being 20+ years older than I'm used ...
Meh...
Nothing special, but entertaining all the same.
The First Seven Books FTW!
Oh my God
Not really Harry Potter, but an ok read...
A Good Book
Don't expect the standards of the original books
Interesting premise and story, but not quite as good as the HP series.
If only...
but to me it reads like a bad fan fiction
he looked very disappointed. He is not an Avid Reader
A hit or miss- But a must read for original HP fans
Utter disappointment
Worthwhile, But What's With All the Hugging?
If this were an O.W.L. exam, it would rate a D (dreadful).
Emo wizard kid who is mad that his dad is famous
Know what you're getting into!
Great story BUT.......
Returning it as "damaged or defective" because it is.
I've also seen all the movies repeatedly and accepted the disappointment over them not mirroring the books enough
Interesting But Not Great
Okay script, as long as you temper your expectations
I didn't hate it, but I don't think I'll be re-reading it like I do the original series
Wish I hadn't read this
Not what I hoped it would be.
Like so many others
booooooooooo
I've come to really like it and appreciate it for what it was
Redemption!!
very different from original series, but read it anyway
Back in the World I Loved. Sort Of.
Not my cup of tea
What a disappointment!
Love you amazon
A good and entertain play
Two thumbs up.
you're disappointed at the things they had to leave out
She should have stopped at the planned 7 books.
Just okay, and that's NOT okay.
I'm a big fan of Harry Potter...this left me disappointed
The Cursed Child is to Harry Potter what the Phantom Menace is to Star Wars.
A Decent Read but.... These Aren't The Potters Your'e Looking For....
so I feel like I'm almost betraying J
What a hot mess!  Ugh!
It's Awful!
This format stinks
Must read for Harry Potter fans
Pretty goof fanfic here.
it's a play
I Refuse To Acknowledge This As Part of the Series
Different... Insteresting... Not what I expected...
Disappointing
Decent enough, didn't hate it as much as others have.
Obviously not JK Rowling material but still a great read and a great adaptation for life after the original books.
I'm glad I didn't purchase the expensive book!
I liked it mostly
Disappointing
No growth in characters.
fast, nice read
Terrible. Disappointing. Not true to the main series.
The book is such a disappointment. This is clearly not J
Good, but not Amazing
Borrow it from the library if you really need to read it
Awful plot, just awful
Good, Could Be Better
A STAGE PLAY?!?!?!?!
but it's not a masterpiece like the other books
Remember, it is a play...
It was nice to have my favorite characters back again
Meh
For some, possibly better borrowed than bought.
I was utterly disappointed in this story line
Did Not Deliver
J.K. Rowling should have written a magical novel not a play for theater.
Meh
Feeds your need for HP
I was very disappointed, bored even
So sad
Still Worth Reading
A little disappointed!
Read It
Hard to swallow storyline
Horrible!
I liked the movies
Missing the magic
The Magic is lost! Leave the writing of Harry Potter to J.K. Rowling!!!!!!!!
This isn't Harry Potter
it does not contain the usual quirky prose we've come to know and love from Rowlings
Don't Make This Your First Impression of Harry Potter!
The Author Was Wandless
Garbage
Not a bad first draft, but needs some sirius (HAH) rewrites
Don't contaminate your memories
I feel cheated
Total Disappointment
Can never get enough Harry Potter
It's... Not Bad
Not the same, but how could it be?
Interesting turn in the wizarding world.
Disappointed in Connecticut
Very Different From Original Seven
Harry, this is The Doctor and his TARDIS...

So disappointed...
Substandard

Good play, disappointing as a book
I just push it off as a spin off not meant to happen in my head to make myself feel better..
It's a fast read
It's more Potter, What could be better?
Kind of disappointed

Worse than most fanfiction
Just OK
Not all I hoped for
Don't read.
Interesting, but meh.
Heartbroken
This book is utter crap. It is a case of someone writing their ...
I disagree with one reviewer who felt the play did not feel like a Harry Potter story
I believe this might be her story but the play itself doesn't sound entirely like it's in her voice (in my opinion)
Not good. This was NOT written by JK Rowling
Not great
OK for nostalgia, little else to add
A little more
We were all excited to go back to Hogwarts with Harry, but we actually went back with Albus, and he doesn't much like Hogwarts.
you have to read it like you're watching people perform it
... to be able to read a play to really like this story
I am pretty heartbroken like everyone else
If you're interested in pleasant nostalgia, nothing more
Not your Usual Harry Potter
Harry potter and the cursed child
Don't waste your money
I recommend it for ages 12 and up
I was very disappointed in this book
The story was flimsy at best. It was ridiculous and unnecessary
Mediocre fanfiction with no J.K. Rowling to be found
I did nor love it but some of the plot theories were fun to consider...
A Disappointment
It starts out fine, then it sucks.
I cannot imagine how much joy and happiness I would lose without reading the books
Totally disappointed
Definitely not of J. K. Rowling standard more like fanfiction
I read a review that said this sounded like poorly written Harry Potter fan fiction
Not J.K. Rowling material
Disappointing

Great Book. Has Flaws.
Harry Potter going forward

I thought the story was good. But I agree with a previous reviewer
No. Just no.
Not as good as it could have been, a disappointment
Major Disappointment
Beware: Bad Fan Fiction (Not Canon)
Interesting Story Line
Not all that I hoped for, but still worth a read
Missed the boat
A Happy Surprise
Nostalgic but a bit forced
the book is written in a play format which is horrible for reading
An ok fanfiction
üôçüèΩ
Awful, just awful.
A waste of paper
NOT Written by J.K. Rowling!
Eh
Disappointing false advertising
Decent book, but with unrealistic character motivations
VERY DISAPPOINTING
Kind of depressing.
Waste of time, money and hope of a good story
Ugh
Just ok
so-so
BOOOOOOOO
Not worth it. Novels are much better than the play format.
It's aight
Disappointing.
Just Wish the Play wasn't a Play!
Disappointment!
It's fun, but it's not Rowling and it doesn't feel like canon to me...
But Act Four contains some excellent, dramatic scenes
Was this really a Harry Potter story?
Ugh.  Just, no.
Not your typical Harry Potter Book
Unoriginal, but I'd still recommend reading.
Tinme Travel
Left Wanting
Don't Buy This One
HP fans will regret reading this play
an insult to Harry potter
Just not fulfilling
If you loved the original, you'll enjoy the finale.

The new book isn't really a book; it's a conversation in a shadow location dependent on your own imagination
So incredibly disappointing
The Curse of the fan fiction
and expect us to be happy. Now
*Sigh*
But the overall work reads like poorly written fan fiction
Just not what I thought I was buying
Happy to be back with Harry
Harry Potter all grown up (book written as a play)
I actually thought I'd been tricked into buying the wrong book
good enough for me, but probably below average for fan fiction
Disappointing
Magical, but definitely in a different strand, does not feel like JK Rowlings writing style...
Conflicts are solved by randomness and characters aren't true to themselves
Loved being with the wizards game world again!
Script vs. Book Form
While I'm sorry it's not a novel, it's still well worth the read!
Interesting, but falls flat.
and second I should state I really do not enjoy reading scripts
I wish I hadn't read it!
One Star
Dont buy this
Not quite what I expected
Since when does Star Trek Voyager serve as a template for Harry Potter stories?
Save yourself the trouble and skip "Harry Potter and the Cursed Child."
Will probably play out better on stage

Kids didn't like it at all.
A fantastic trip..
I wanted to like it
Not my favorite
I wanted to love it, but...
I have to say that I don't think it the story makes for a very good book. It is about going back and forth ...

Harry Potter and the Cursed Child-Parts One and Two Playscript.  by J.K. Rowling, John Tiffany,Jack Thorne
not worth it
Thank goodness that's over with!

Eh. *shrugs*
Mediocre fan fiction
Adequate
If you truly love Harry Potter don't read this book. If you merely like it, go ahead
Snooze fest
Predictable, Childish, and Cheesy
Pretty good
Way too difficult to read.
A bit odd reading a screen play...
Can't put it down

Oof! I felt this one right in the childhood.
Would have preferred prose over a script, but an excellent story still.
HP and the Cursed Child
A let down
Yeesh
Not as good as her other books
A fun read but not the same as the original series
Don't bother buying this when there is better fan fiction for free!
Terrible. Just terrible.
Not epic but satisfies my HP itch (for now)

Must have for Potter fans
Confusing
Regrettable Read After Harry's Adventures
Not what I expected...
I really wanted to love this....
Disappointing....
If it ain't broken don't fix it!
It was good but I was a little disappointed
Hated the script format, loved the story!
Good read
If this was a fanfic, I would have thought ...
and enjoy then each time
Interesting
Happy to have a new one.
Throughly enjoyed this!
Boring. GIve it a miss
Stick with the originals
Good book overall
Not like the original series :-(
A rousing "meh"
As a fan good, but it needed something.
Skip it
Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.  Parts One etc.
Honestly terrible writing but my inner child just had to have it
Good follow up
Don't like this type of writing
I was delightfully surprised with how much I enjoyed it. My one complaint
I think the play is probably a lot of fun to watch
A good way to stay connected to the HP world and ...
Disappointed actually! I expected more character build for Harry's ...
It was good
Good enough
As a screen play it's pretty good! It felt obvious to me that JK ...
Absolutely brilliant!
I thoroughly enjoyed this book
Depressing canon
Definition of Cringe
I love harry potter so much but this book was terrible
JK, What Were You THINKING?!
Let me start off by saying I love Harry Potter
What a whirlwind of action! Good read! Should become a movie.
If she would have taken this story and weaved it into a novel it would have been better than many of her later books in the HP .
Don't Buy This
It is probably a good story, but after reading the 7 books
Another disappointed fan
Regret reading this book
All Harry Potter fans have to read this!
Loved it!
Good Story, difficult format to read.
Script not Book!
I almost feel like this shouldn't have been written
Few Redeemable Qualities
Sellout?
I thoroughly enjoyed this book
If you can't see the show, you can read the script
Fun story.
Good Read to a classic
Let down...
Too Short
The Cursed Child was a fun read
Don't read it
Since I read all the other HP books....
The story is like something out of a bad Harry Potter fanfiction.
It is written like a play book so it might be hard for ...
Excellent for what it is!
Not Rowling level of complexity
The character and the locations may all be Rowling but the rest is just a bad script of fan fiction
Wonderful to get back into the Harry Potter world
not.worth the read, maybe worth a watch.
Not Bad
Script more suitable for a comic book
Different than what i thought
Not bad
Was a struggle to NOT finish in one sitting
Should never have been released to the public
Disappointing and lacking in charm
Potter re-hashed.
Meh...
Not the original HP books, but great overall!
Not my beloved characters
üö® WARNING: NOT A real Harry Potter book!  NOT BY JK ROWLING
Reading a play again was like being back in school
I did enjoy this book/play
No. Just, no.
Complete garbage.
My son heard from his friends and said it is very poor story. I've not ask why
Probably good play, but book lacking
Great story
For the Love of HP!
It's just a script of the play
This is fanfic, not Rowling
What a let down.
Harry Potter and the cursed child---
This would have been better if it was written in the same style and ...

Harry I MISSED YOU so much
Disappointed
Solid 3 stars
I give it 3 stars
After waiting so long...disappointing
Quite honestly the play reads like a poorly developed time travel fan fic
This is time wasted that I will never get back in my life
A complete disappointment
Great addon to the other books.
Sorry Harry...
Silly.
Great Book - but don't pre-order
Not typical HP, but still a good read
Not sorry I skipped to the end. . .
Feels like fan fiction
Good, but not J.K. Rowling good
Yay! More Harry Potter!
Klunky storyline, characters acting out of character
Riddikulus!
Not amazing, but still worhwhile.
What the crap?
Sorry, I don't know what happened to J. ...
SO Disappointed
Not good!
Ok
If only I had a time turner, I could have saved myself $17...
I am happy to have read this
fun trip back to Rowling's world
Such a disappointment!!!
Expect to be disappointed
For Harry Potter fans
It's ok
Not quite on par with Harry Potter books
JK Rowling took a dive on this one
Absorbing story, not really a sequel
no no no
Not thrilled HP fan
Plot holes
Love Harry
I love Harry Potter
Where's Monty Python's Eric Idle?
Very disappointed.
Yay! More Harry Potter!
Three Stars
A unique way to present our heros as adults. Truly the "magic" never dies .
Waste of money
Why do people dislike this so much?
Disappointing sequel to the HP series.
Not a narrative story, it is a script
Really?
what a shame
disappointed like many others
What a disappointment.

Avada Kadavra would look super cheap without CGI on stage
Great book - even if you don't like plays!
Ships fast, perfect for fans.
The band is back together!
The books were better - Looking forward to seeing the play though!
Good enough for us die-hard Potterheads
It was just okay.
Print is hard to read
Nothing special
You may want to pass on purchasing and borrow it from your local library
I thought I'd like it more
It's a script - feels like fan fic

Great Read!  Fast Moving with Suprising ywists
Good Story - Quick Read
Sooooo dissapointed
A fun but ultimately unnecessary trip to Harry Potter world
Very Happy
This was nothing like the original series and ruins the world originally created
Three Stars
Forget It
A script in play version of the continuing Harry Potter story
Too Much Hype
Horrible
I've read better fanfics than this one.
Dissapointing
I was bamboozled! Same time travel plot used 100x. Characters are poor imposters of the ones HP fans know and love.
Great
A fun trip down Harry Potter nostalgia lane
Do not waste your money.
PANJU
I wanted to love it.
Not great. Skipped over a lot
Steaming Pile of Garbage
The story continues and it is wonderful!

Not worth the time and money.

Flashes of Rowling
Good, but would make an even better full-length book

It isn't the HP I grew up with....
SEE SCB AND/OR SEAMUS VIDEOS
A great addition to the HP universe
it is actually a very fun read. I quite enjoyed it
Good if you like disappointment
I'll stick with the 7 originals
You either like it or hate it
That was terrible
Giving it 4 stars for two simple reasons.
Loved all the Harry Potters to death and read them ...
Disappointing at best
Book-length story crammed into a Play-length format
Better than expected.
If only JK Rolling had written this herself!!!
I didn't like the book
Unsure
The book was not written like a story
It was okay!
Not the same, but fills a small part of the void
Are you laughing 'cause it's funny or...?
Not quite......
AKA "Angsty Teen Clich√© and the Tarnishing of Everything You Loved About The Series"
Watch out, this is a theatre play, not a novel  (but it is worth reading any way)
What a disappointment!
4 stars because I miss the descriptive narration.
Dont bother.
The story could have been great
Childhood Nostalgia
Another HOGWARTS Classic!
Not worth the powder to blow it up
Recommended book for any Harry Potter fan

Fan Fiction
Not what I expected.....
A poor read

Better than no more HP at all...
It's Missing the Magic
Captivating
I love everything about this series
"A little voice inside my head said dont look back you can never look back."  I should have listened.
Good to Catch up with our Hogwarts Friends.
Hard to read.
given as a gift so can't comment on the story ...
An average but entertaining adventure

Great read. I enjoyed it for what it was
Harry Potter and the cursed child

Why?
First time I have read a playwright but it is a great story.

Good Read

It was good to be back in the Potter universe

Hard to read
OK, but not like the other Harry Potter books
JKR could've done better, but in screenplay version

Just never catches the voice and feel of the characters ...
Emersed back into the world of magic in ways we never thought possible!! Absolutely spellbinding!!
