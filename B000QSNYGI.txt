 My message is the same as quite a few others but I wanted to share my experience in hopes that more people become aware.<br/><br/>I have been using Optimum Nutrition protein for 10 years now. In my eyes it has always been the industry standard. Good ingredients, great taste, no BS.<br/><br/>I received my last 5lb tub of Vanilla creme yesterday and made a shake. It was absolutely disgusting. The shake was so sweet I gagged but reluctantly finished it. This was at night. The morning after I had diarrhea. Browsing through the comments it seems other people are having the same experience too.<br/><br/>Surely this is due to the recent change to the formula where they added sucralose, an artifical sweetener.<br/><br/>I'm now stuck with 5lb of inedible powder and left with the task of finding a new company to purchase my protein powder from.<br/><br/>Well done, ON.<br/>Oh, and thanks for the diarrhea.
 Best protein on the market. For everyone saying the formula has changed... as far as the Double Rich Chocolate I've been getting for YEARS, there is no change as of a week ago (Jan-2018). No Sucralose. Just avoid flavors like Cake Batter, Ice Cream and Banana.
 I ordered the double rich chocolate (DBC), thanks to reviews indicating it did not use sucralose (and it does not as of 06/12/18).<br/><br/>I've never used ON before, I do not know if it "used to" taste better. As of 06/12/18 the DBC flavor tastes roughly like burnt brownie flavored cardboard. Thing is, I understand without a SUPER sweetener, it can be difficult to achieve flavor, but be forewarned, it is AWFUL tasting. Consistency remains almost the same as whatever liquid you have mixed it into (adds no extra thickness). I tried both water and milk.<br/><br/>On the positive front, it is jam packed with goodies with every scoop. It mixes extremely well (I use milk mainly) and when mixed with other powders, it continued to mix well (I add extra probiotics and stuff for my joints).<br/><br/>I let it sit for a few hours on the counter, everything settled and needed a slight jostle, but (aside from being warm) mixed right back up and tasted exactly the same with the same consistency, which is great as I have had powders that turn to sludge if you let it sit for too long.<br/><br/>For the price @5lbs and 30g scoops, you can't beat it. There are better tasting powders and better powders overall, but you can expect to pay $50-$60 for 2lb for those, I find this powder to be an excellent middle ground if you can stomach it, especially with the prevalence of sucralose finding its way everywhere.<br/><br/>For those not in the know, please Google sucralose, it won't bother everyone, but if you're like me, it did affect my digestive system negatively and since removing it from my diet I have been doing much better.
 I've used this protein for some time. I ordered my last tub through Amazon. Amazon did great as always with timely shipping and delivery. However I noticed about 2/3rds of the way through the tub that it developed a pretty gnarly chemical smell to it. It still mixed fine but after drinking it, I would feel nauseous. I contacted optimum nutrition about this issue and have not received any response as of this time. The product was not expired and stored in a cool dry place. First time this protein has ever done this to me.<br/><br/>After further research I found that the I gradient list has been changed drastically from before. So much more has been added to it. I expect some additives in flavored protein but not the extent to which this company has done.
 Why ON why?? Why change a great thing. This one star review is for the new formula Optimum Nutrition is using. I've been using this product for 5 years and will never again purchase it unless they change it back to the original formula. Checking the ingredients it looks like they have added sucralose, among other things, which tastes absolutely disgusting. Honestly I'm sad because this was my go to protein powder, it had the best flavor, was easy to drink, and I recommended it to everyone. But tryingbthis new formula triggered my gag reflex, made me wash out my mouth and is still making me feel sick. ON - your target audience are health and fitness people, why on earth would you give us something so artificial and useless nutrition wise as sucralose??? Why?? Good job losing a life long customer.
 Vanilla Ice Cream<br/><br/>Please listen, ❗️DO NOT BUY IT❗️I have in the past spoken and reviewed this product as the best among the lot but that was before Optimum Nutrition changed the ingredients.<br/><br/>The old one had Aminogen, a blend of digestive  proteases (enzymes) which helps absorption and helps the process of digestion. They took this out and instead added Cellulose Gum, Xanthan Gum, SALT &amp; SUCRALOSE. The total number of servings was also reduced from 77 to 73 which is no big deal. Now, who in the world needs Salt added to their protein powder, as though we are not already consuming excess salt? Of what benefit is the addition of salt to the consumer? Likewise, how does the addition of Sucralose, an artificial sweetener and chlorinated sugar help the consumer? Will you rather have an ARTIFICIAL SWEETENER in your food or not? Did I mention that it already has Acesulfame which is also a sugar substitute? The addition of Sucralose has made the product so intolerably sweet and tastes so artificial. I never take it just with water alone since it's first use. I make sure to add raw old fashioned oats and increase the water to numb the sweetness but to no avail. The sweetness is absolutely overbearing and leaves a HORRIBLE aftertaste.<br/><br/>Besides the bad taste, there's a divided opinion in the scientific world about the detrimental health effects of Sucralose. Just do a google search and draw your own conclusions.<br/><br/>Optimum Nutrition ruined what IMHO WAS ONCE the best protein powder. PLEASE DO NOT BUY IT.
 I'm not a protein shake guru but I know what I like and this is not it. A little history, I tried this brand at a local market that sells protein shakes. The shake was so good I asked the employee which brand and they used ONG so I decided to buy my own pack. Big mistake, so I've been reading the company changed the formula and now the taste is yucky. What a waste of money. I've been told that BSN SYNTHA-6 is great and taste really good. If anyone has recommendations on a good protein shake that will give loads of energy for pre-workout let me know.
 <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Optimum-Nutrition-Gold-Standard-100-Whey-Double-Rich-Chocolate-1-Pound/dp/B00G4MA4B8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Whey, Double Rich Chocolate, 1 Pound</a><br/>Some background. I'm 55 years old and have not worked out since my army days in the 80s. Two years ago I had an attack of acute pancreatitis brought on by gall stones, which was fun. After spending a month in the hospital and gall bladder removal I recovered just fine. Except for the fact that any time I ate more than 6 to 10 ounces of very bland food I'd start feeling pain around my stomach and often would get very nauseous. This led me to eating lots of small meals throughout the day and way to much snacking. Over the two years I ballooned up from 185 lbs to 225 lbs. My doctor has not been able to figure out why the pain and nausea happens. They've poked. prodded, scoped every orifice, taken more blood than I honestly believe was necessary, and done every scan that they have a machine for. After finding no solution my doctor recommend I might try working out. It might help, it was very unlikely to make anything worse, and he's been wanting me to go the gym anyway.<br/><br/>I've only been working out for 5 weeks now and taking this product for 3 weeks. And I feel great.<br/><br/>First. The Gold Standard 100% Whey Double Chocolate tastes delicious. In milk it's just about as good as a chocolate milkshake. I have to resist the urge to drink more just for the enjoyment. In water it's not quite that good but still very tasty.<br/><br/>Second. I only take it right after workouts which are usually 8 pm - 10 pm after work. I'm up for another 2 to 3 hours afterward and I am getting no cravings where in the past late night was my worst time for eating snacks.<br/><br/>Third. After the first five weeks I've lost 12 lbs, feel great and look forward to the gym each day. I also so far, knock on wood, have not suffered from stomach pain or nausea in that time. I've felt the pain coming on twice at work after eating too much but after working out I've felt fine by the time I got home. In fact both times the feeling just faded unnoticed at some point during the workout. I'm still careful about what I eat but I have cautiously begun to allow myself more variety at lunch knowing I'd be heading to the gym later.<br/><br/>I don't know how much the Gold Standard Whey is contributing to all the positive things I've listed here but I'll keep taking it. In fact I just ordered the 5lb tub. I like the flavor and look forward to having it after my workout. It has definitely cut back my late night cravings. And if it is feeding my muscles on top of that I simply don't know what more I could ask for. Simply put, I love this product and want to have it's babies.
 Horrible product.  I've purchased the "Double Chocolate" 5LB, every few months for over a year, and loved it.  For some reason this time around I got the "Extreme Milk Chocolate", so I figured I would give it a shot.  It tastes not that great, but more then that it clumps up really bad.  I can shake it in my blender bottle for 5 minutes, and still get those nasty balls of powder.  I've tried 5 other flavors of ON products, and this by far is the worst.  If you like clumpy, not that great tasting protein shakes, this is for you... if not take a look at other products, or flavors.
 It tasted like vomit! My husband and I try different flavors every time we order .. this by far is the worst I have ever tried! I feel like I am on Fear Factor every time I drink it but there is no prize at the end! 🤢 This is a review on the flavor Double Rich Chocolate and there is nothing rich about it! 😝
 This review is for both the Double Rich Chocolate 5lb Whey and the Cookies and Cream Whey in the same size. This 5lb tub contains about 70 scoops of whey with about 25 grams of protein per scoop. In my opinion this is the best whey to buy in terms of price, taste, and amount of protein per serving and total servings per container (again 70 scoops). This whey contains little else in terms of sugar or carbohydrates so you know there are no fillers. Be careful of getting cheaper Whey because they often do not actually contain the amount of protein advertised which has resulted in several lawsuits for some companies. But, Optimum Nutrition is a reliable company and, as far as I know, do not put fillers in their products to cheat you. The Double Rich Chocolate is my favorite flavor and taste exactly like chocolate milk if you mix it with milk. In regards to mixing it does not clump up too much like some other wheys or pre workout powders.<br/><br/>Now, in regards to the Cookies and Cream flavor, I have to say that I hated it. It does not taste like cookies and cream and has a bad after taste. I would not recommend that flavor and I would never buy it again. Be wary of trying wild new flavors of whey. In my opinion it is always best to stick with the basics of Vanilla or Chocolate flavor.<br/><br/>Other than that, if you are looking for whey I highly recommend Optimum Nutrition. Each tub comes with a scoop, of course. If you do not see it right away it probably has settled at the bottom, so do not worry.<br/><br/>Double Rich Chocolate 5/5<br/>Cookies and Cream 0/5
 I have been buying ON for a few years now. I started lifting again and I bought a tub of double rich chocolate a few days ago and I am regretting my decision. The taste is disgusting and it gets all foamy when you mix it up.<br/><br/>Trust the other reviews. The formula has indeed changed and until ON changes their formula, I will not be purchasing this product again.
 Update: Rich Double Chocolate does not contain sucralose - much better. Also, sucralose does not always give me an upset stomach. Something about this mixture did however.<br/><br/>Sucralose in the Extreme Milk Chocolate &amp; many other flavors have degraded this product greatly. Love this protein powder, but the sucralose has given me an upset stomach when I drink it. Absolutely horrible, have to run straight to the bathroom. Not sure why this was added as the product was totally fine before. Ordered Double Chocolate as pictures show it doesn't contain sucralose. If it does it will be returned and I'll be searching for a new brand.
 On. Gold Standard 100% Whey. Strawberry.  As of October 2018.<br/><br/>Ingredients off the jug: Protein Blend (Whey Protein Isolates, Whey Protein Concentrate, Whey Peptides), Lecithin, Natural and Artificial Flavors, Citric Acid, Sucralose, FD&amp;C Red#40, Aminogen, Lactase<br/>- Saw some reviews saying they changed the ingredients. Thought this would help.<br/>- Ingredients on jug (above) are slightly different than listed on AMZN site.<br/>- One review (Jan2017) said they removed Aminogen (helps absorption).  Contrarily, you can see that it's still listed in these ingredients.<br/>- Some reviews referenced the addition of Sucralose as being not good.  That is indeed here.<br/><br/>Taste:<br/>- Good. No complaints.  I'm a chocoholic.  Recently realized that other flavors can be good too.  In fact, sometimes forcing everything into chocolate doesn't work.<br/><br/>Effectiveness:<br/>- Seems to be working :)<br/><br/>Other<br/>- 1 serving = 1 "rounded" scoop = 24 g protein.  73 servings / container.  = 1,752 g protein in a 5lb jug for ~$51.<br/>- 1 scoop dissolves easily in 8 oz of water (1/2 a water bottle)<br/><br/>Why not 5 stars?  Just b/c I'm not a professional nutritionist, chemist, body builder, etc.  I'd want my 5 star to mean more.
 i have been using this product for almost 10 yrs. it is a great product I have never had any problems with ON whey protein, love it!. It has helped me maintain muscle and grow aswell. The price is high compared to its competitors. I am currently trying a 10 pound bag by universal  that i got for 75 bucks, and another 10 pound bag i am ordering today by another company for 68 bucks., GREAT PRODUCT BUT THE COST IS TOO HIGH SO I AM MOVING ON.
 I love ON double chocolate protein powder; drink it everyday.  Decide to change flavor to the chocolate coconut and big mistake. First, there was a white powder in the container (thought it was coconut powder) so mixed it all together plus the scoop was at the very bottom so had to find it.  It had a awful taste which 20 mins late I started to vomit; messed up my stomach for hours.  Will never purchase this flavor again..  .  Exp date is 2018,
 This is the best Protein powder you can get, no uncertainty and let me clarify you why. On the off chance that you need a decent tasting thing and that is your first need at that point get one of those Wendy's or McDonalds' shakes. That is to say, is that basic. Try not to be so meticulous about the taste when you are expending a Protein Shake. The business has propelled a ton throughout the years and the powders show signs of improvement and better with the time, so quit crying.<br/>Presently, on the off chance that regardless you are into that taste and everything else comes next, at that point search for another item that has more immersed fat, more sugar, more straightforward carbs, less protein per scoop (not exactly the great .79 oz of Protein for every oz of powder, a hollering 79%) and that isn't 100% whey.<br/>Try not to misunderstand me, despite everything I think this powder tastes extraordinary, it's simply not THE best taste out there (but rather who knows, possibly for you it is) yet the advantages beat that. I have attempted the twofold rich chocolate, the vanilla flavor, the strawberry season and the treats and cream. They all taste great to me, particularly on the off chance that you know how to set them up.<br/>The measure of calories marginally from flavor to season (close to 10 calories for each scoop) however we should take for instance, the twofold rich chocolate. 1 scoop has 120 calories, 10 from fat, a base measure of carbs and 24 grams of Whey protein. In the event that you don't have the foggiest idea, Whey protein is the most regarded sort of protein there is (with the white egg protein) since your body utilizes it altogether, dissimilar to different kinds of protein that may move toward becoming muscle versus fat if there's insufficient physical action.<br/>The cost is amazing as well. Regardless of whether you are a weight lifter, jock, some individual that needs to develop muscles or possibly some person on an eating routine to kill that midsection, you know how costly sustenance can be amid the month. A Shake after exercise there, a bar over yonder, entire wheat bread, natural products, and so forth. In the event that spending additional cash doesn't influence that is fine yet in the event that you once in a while need to deal with your own spending then the value gives you another motivation to pick 100% Whey.
 Product arrived smashed, but the box was in perfect condition, which tells me it was damaged before it was placed in the box. We love the product and have been ordering the chocolate mint for years, but I’ll be searching for a new brand after this.
 Bought this and the double chocolate one specifically because they did NOT have sucralose on the ingredients list, but when I got it, sure enough the vanilla ice cream does indeed have Sucralose! So this is more an AMAZON picture error!<br/><br/>That aside:<br/>Taste was good, very sweet, but blended up with water well, I then added frozen strawberries and that cut the sweetness perfectly.<br/><br/>As per the instructions I did mix in room temp water first then added ice &amp; the frozen berries to make a smoothie &amp; again it was very good. So the powder as a whole is fine (only been using it for one day so we will see how it plays out for the next few weeks) but I wouldnt have ordered it if the label had been correct on the site. Luckily I got the small bag!!<br/><br/>That being said, I believe next time I will try the Natural Flavor that Optimum offers since they use natural sugar instead of synthetic stuff which is what we're trying to get away from as much as possible!
 My review is just in regards to the taste, and not in regards to the quality. I buy this product pretty often, but I usually get Vanilla or Chocolate.  This time I accidentally ordered strawberry.  I figured it wouldn't be a big deal but....REGRETS!  It tastes very artificial and leaves a bitter aftertaste.  While I would recommend the protein powder overall, I definitely would steer others away from this particular flavor.
 i gave this one three stars because it has the ingredient acesulfame potassium. it is an artificial sweetener, with some unwanted side effects on health.<br/>Pros: tastes good, mix well<br/>Cons: contains acesulfame potassium
 I've been using ON for a while and the very reason I liked it out of so many protein shakes is that it actually tasted mild without being abnormally sweet and thick. It simply tasted like protein. This batch I got has ruined my impression of the product. It is so sweet I don't know how any fitness folk could ever stand this. A lot other reviews mentioned the change in formula so I guess that's it. I have some skin conditions for which I would run away from sugar and artificial additives 2 miles away and this batch absolutely made my condition worse right upon digestion (I used to take up to 4 scoops before without problem). I tried to take it for a few days but really couldn't stand it and ended up selling the rest to my friend. Great job ruining a wonderful product and losing a faithful customer.
 Amazon did great with a timely shipping, but the new formula tastes very odd and doesnt mix well. I thought I got a knockoff version of it, but after reading more reviews I realized they changed something. I wouldnt recommend anymore. try something that you at least enjoy to drink.
 So much that is positive has been said about this product that I thought I'd mention that it tastes good.  I tend to be sensitive to artificial sweeteners, but my gut is okay with this one.<br/><br/>AARP just (Oct.'18) published an article on the diet that is essential to seniors.  We're to eat protein with every meal and  with our snacks.  This protein, along with physical activity, will help to stave off muscle loss.  Their article made good sense, so I am following their advice: eat lightly and eat protein along with enough fiber.  I therefore doff my proverbial hat to a whey protein powder that tastes like a chocolate milk shake.  Yes, it's yummy.  I suspect that you'll like it, too.
 This was the fourth time that I purchased the chocolate malt Gold Standard protein powder, and I could not be more satisfied. The ideal user for this product in my mind is someone who wishes to take control of their protein intake, whether it be for nutritional purposes or to achieve maximum benefits after a demanding lift in the gym. I have decided to rate this protein powder based off three criteria: flavor, nutritional content per scoop, and blend-ability.<br/><br/>FLAVOR<br/>When buying any type of protein supplement the main thing people tend to criticize is the flavor. After tasting this chocolate malt protein powder, I can honestly say it is the best tasting protein supplement I have ever consumed. The taste is comparable to the smooth, velvety, sweet chocolate malt you got as a child at your local ice cream shop. If you really want to take the flavor and calories to the next level, try enhancing your protein shake. Take one scoop of this protein powder, one ripe banana, one cup of milk, a hefty scoop of peanut butter, and 5-10 ice cubs, then blend for one minute.<br/><br/>NUTRITIONAL CONTENT PER SCOOP<br/>The most important part of a protein supplement is how much protein you are ingesting per serving. This is one reason why I like the Gold Standard brand because they have achieved a high level of efficacy by packing 24 grams of protein into one scoop. The 5-lb. tub contains 73 scoops of protein which last me (an intermediate/advanced lifter) about one month, as I take one shake between each main meal throughout the day, and one after my night workout.<br/><br/>BLEND-ABILITY<br/>Blend-ability is how well the protein can mix with various liquids and create a homogenous, or even mixture. I have found this can be an issue with some protein powders, but not with Gold Standard protein powder. I have mixed this protein powder with a variety of liquids such as water, milk, and even beer. It has never failed to mix thoroughly or leave a chunky solution as the final product, which to most consumers is ideal.<br/><br/>SUMMARY<br/>Overall, I would give the Gold Standard 100% whey protein powder 5 out of 5 stars. It has great flavor, optimal nutrition content, and great blend-ability. If you have been disappointed with protein powder in the past, give up on the “just okay stuff” and try something that won’t disappoint your needs, for me that is Gold Standard protein.
 I'm not a chemist so I can't verify the nutritional contents of this stuff.  All I know is that it tastes great.  I take one or two servings a day with skim milk, and it tastes like chocolate ice cream.  I've had it with just water and it kind of tastes like watery Yoohoo.  Its not the greatest taste, but it is completely passable for people who want a low calorie shake.<br/><br/>The problem I have with it is that it has a pretty strong artificial sweetener aftertaste to it that stays with me for a couple of hours.  Its not awful, but its annoying enough that I consider trying other products at times.
 I've used this product and its predecessor 'Pro complex' for over 20 years.  I have easily spent over $20,000 on this product over the course of time. It is the very best. I go through a 5 lb tub every 2 weeks.  Double rich chocolate is my favorite because it's chocolatey but not too sweet. No aftertaste. Many of my clients prefer the exotic flavors. Product mixes extremely well.  You can easily mix 2  scoops in 6-8 oz of water and the consistency will still be thin. This is a high-quality blend which is what you want. Why? Because blends digest at different rates much like a time released vitamin or time released medication would. It is also glutamine enhanced. I could go on and on but do your own research, read the label, read the ingredients, and you will still find this is the very best protein especially considering the price. Just a few side notes: for people who complain their protein gives them digestive issues: digestive issues with protein usually come due to being mixed with milk and / or being put into a blender creating air bubbles and swallowing cups of air. Never mix your protein with milk unless you know you can tolerate milk and you are okay with the added sugar. If you're going to mix protein in a blender try doing so for only a couple seconds (unless you've added ice). I usually mix my protein with instant oats, essential fatty oils, and water. In that case I mix longer and then I drink it fast before it thickens. Product can be easily mixed by stirring I prefer using a butter knife as it sticks less. Or you can mix in a shaker with just a couple shakes.  Add some ice before shaking for better mixing, plus the ice helps it last longer.  I've referred so many people (hundreds) to Optimum Nutrition and this product that Optimum Nutrition should be sending me this product for free. I wish!
 ON is: 5lb. Tub/73 scoops. Other proteins are: 5lb./45+ scoops. I like the delicious strawberry flavor. I actually look forward to my post workout drink unlike other bad tasting whey proteins(ex:Flexatarian Whey). This protein mixes very easily with milk or water. I try other proteins, ex: Animal Whey, Mutant Pro 100, BSN Syntha-6, but I always come back to ON whey protein. I take this protein(1scoop) w/water immediately after working out. Then at night I take 1 serving(scoop) of BSN syntax-6 whey protein w/10 oz. milk, 1 banana, 2 spoonfuls of peanut butter, and 1/2 cup of oats as a last meal/mass gainer before bed. I recommend ON protein to anyone looking for a quality protein at an affordable price. That's all.
 I'm not a big fan of chocolate so I decided to go with the Delicious Strawberry. It works for what it is. I wouldn't call it "delicious" but it's a protein powder: man up and drink it. I was expecting a much worse taste but either other protein powders taste godlike or other consumers are picky eaters. Mixed with water it sorta tastes like watered down juice. I'm lactose intolerant so I'm not throwing milk in there anytime soon. I'm happy with my purchase and will most likely continue to buy more.
 Good quality protein, but the flavor was so horrible, I had to take it so I just added a tiny bit of water and swallow it at once. Also my fault, I should had got it without flavor.<br/><br/>I got the same product but organic for a tiny fraction of the price I paid for this one at a local discount store in my town, flavorless protein, that is why the 3 stars.<br/><br/>If you are not used to the artificial flavoring and you are used to taste real food you will find this protein like powder candy.<br/><br/>However if you are used to artificial flavoring and coloring you will love this protein :)
 I haven't taken this for a long period of time to decide wheter it works or not but I've already but different products from ON (mass gainer, casein protein) and they all taste the same to me. Peanut butter, vanilla, doble rich chocolate same standar chemical flavor. Is still better than other brands flavor? - Yeah although they flavors taste the same still are better than most of their competitors. Would I buy it again eventhough is more expensive than other brands? I don't know if it doens't work maybe not, again if you ask only based on the flavor then yeah maybe I wil purchase it.
 I have been buying ON Double Rich Chocolate whey for many months now, but this is the first time I decided to buy the 10lb bag instead of buying the smaller 2lb container from the store every few weeks. While I'm sure the benefits are the same and the macro-nutrients / blend of proteins haven't changed, something is very bizarre and off putting about this.<br/><br/>Simply put, the flavor is off. I'm comparing it to the same flavor of the same brand in other sizes and this size has a particularly bland flavor to it for whatever reason. The chocolate isn't as rich, the smell isn't as pleasant, and the powder can be described as more bitter than the exact same flavor in a smaller sized tub. My guess would be that the container doesn't hold freshness as well as other containers, but that's just conjecture.<br/><br/>Going forward, I'll spend the extra few dollars to continue buying ON double rich chocolate in smaller sizes from other sources.
 I’ve never tried ON’s protein powder before. The other two powders in my rotation seem a bit thicker than this one. I mix with milk though so it’s not too thin.<br/><br/>Mocha Cappuccino definitely doesn’t taste like coffee in any way but more like sweetened milk or caramel (again, I mix with milk) but it’s not bad by any means.<br/><br/>It’s hard to tell what one protein powder does that the other doesn’t in terms of physiology but I can say that it does seem to help me recover quicker than not taking any, and progress hasn’t been slowed or reversed. So I think it’s safe to say that it works, tastes great, and is an incredible value for the quality.
 Ive been happily using ON whey protein for 2+ years. However, for whatever reason, the most recent container I bought is giving me gastric distress every single time, without fail. Has something changed in the product? Im disappointed that I have a nearly full container that I dont want to use and that I need to find a new protein powder.
 Just got it today. Bought other stuff from Costco, and it was okay, but it did not have a rich taste and required using a lot more powder.  The Gold Standard is a bit more than Costco Isolate, but worth it.  I mixed it with some fruit, super food green powder and water. I usually make a shake every day with fruit, half of a protein shake and superfood green powder.  I am usually hungry after making the shake so I know never to have it when I am hungry, it will not fill me up.  I was concerned only using the protein powder and water that it would lack flavor. The shake was a lot thicker, smoother and creamier. Just like a chocolate shake from your favorite burger joint.  Most protein supplements cause gas or bloating and this one does not, during or after ingesting it.  Taste is a heavier richer chocolate taste than cheaper brands. ALSO the amount (scoop) recommended is not as much as other brands require so you use less and it lasts longer.  Oh and one last thing. I was starving when I made my smoothie, which usually means I will need something else with it, but I was not half way through my shake and I was content and satisfied.
 I got french vanilla creme flavor; unless you like french vanilla, I wouldn't get this flavor I think. After one scoop mix with water, I already could feel I was getting sick of this taste already lol probably in another 5-7 scoops with water mixing and I'll be really sick of it. Trying to find some recipes to make a smoothie blend out of this so I don't get sick of the flavor.<br/><br/>The free scoop was about halfway inside the bottle. I used a spoon to poke inside and hit a hard spot, then reach in with my hand so it was a little messy.<br/><br/>I should've stuck to chocolate lol 72 out of 73 vanilla scoops to go.<br/><br/>@@@EDIT 12/5/2015: Stirred, not shaken. I dislike creaminess, so when I shake and not stir my protein mixer bottle, it creates a lot of foam/bubbles that is almost equal to the amount I add in to mix with water (1 scoop + 7oz). But once I stir it instead, it was a smooth foamless/bubbleless drink that I can enjoy instead. I realize this on my 3rd attempt that shaking creates too much air into the drink (not a problem I had with Serious Mass Chocolate protein powder). An easy jump from 4 stars to 5 stars now =]<br/><br/>p.s. I also learn to review after trying at least 3-5 times or for a few weeks before reviewing a product.
 Used to drink Muscle Milk for years, but they changed their formula and now it tastes absolutely terrible. I was recommended ON Gold Standard instead. And I gotta say, this stuff is amazing. Flavor is great - no artificial or chemical taste, and no sucralose (I'm talking about the Double Rich Chocolate flavor). I've never liked the idea of my shake being too sweet or having unneeded sweetener, and this is perfect for me. I'm not even a big fan of chocolate, but the flavor is very mellow and smooth. So glad I found this.<br/><br/>I put one and a half scoops in a shaker bottle with 16oz of milk, to give you an idea of the flavor I'm getting. This gives about 52g of protein. There's zero chalky flavor and I don't notice an aftertaste.<br/><br/>Oh, by the way - when you open this for the first time, use a fork to dig up the plastic scoop at the bottom of the container. Some people miss it.
 Review based on taste only. 5 stars. I bought the Cake Batter flavor. I mixed with water on the first day and I was pretty impressed. I used a little less water to give it a bit more body and it still mixed out very easily. There was only a very slight after taste and that hint of concentrated protein, but not much at all. The next day I mixed it with milk and I could hardly believe that I was drinking a protein supplement. This is like a treat after working out. Its like a reward. I feel like I need to work out so I get a chance to make my protein shake. That's how good I think this thing is. Right now I'm building from scratch. Im 5'11, 175lbs and pretty lean. I'm trying to put on a little muscle mass. I work out once a day. This is the same workout routine that gave me minimal results before without a protein supplement. I started back after buying this 5lb bottle. When this is done, I will review my results. I only hope it is as effective as it is tasty!
 I've tried three or four protein powders thinking I could find something just as good as ON only cheaper.  You get what you pay for.  The others had a chemical after taste that usually made me throw the whole thing in the garbage.  I can't speak to all flavors of ON Gold, but I love both the Chocolate and the Strawberry.  During hypertrophy lifting days it's 2 shakes a day, each with 2 scoops of ON, a few frozen berries, 5g creatine powder, and a cup of almond milk.
 Optimum is the go-to protein for me over the years.  I am fickle with my proteins and I switch them up because I get bored with them.  I will keep coming back to this flavor.  It's a nice coffee/chocolate flavor you'd expect Mocha to be.  Also, if you look at the nutrition facts on some of the other flavors of Optimum protein, they will have sunflower oil, maltodextrin, starch, high fructose corn syrup, etc.  Not all, but some.  This one has less of that junk.  I'm not saying it's natural or anything, it just has less of the fake stuff.  Do the comparisons.<br/><br/>Good taste, mixes easy and most importantly, feeds your muscles like it should.
 I have been a customer  2 years now. But this is my first time trying anything other then vanilla ice cream. It isn't bad, just a couple small issues. I can't say whether or not the formula has been changed since this is my first purchase. But first impression of the smell was almost like a coffee flavor. I thought they sent that one instead for a second. The taste is mild, one full scoop and I did not really taste more then the milk. What I could taste was not sweet, it just right. I did notice that it did not mix all that well. It left clumps on the side of my blendtec bottle and I did the same as I have done for the last 2 years. (Maybe 1 time did I experience clumping with the vanilla). AND MOST IMPORTANLY, IT DID NOT COME WITH A SCOOP, I mean come on now. Luckily I still had my scoop from the vanilla. Overall, it wasn't bad but wasn't great. I don't think it will be a long 68 servings tho.
 I've had really good success with ON's protein powders, but I ventured to try Cake Batter, and was quite disappointed.  I don't know what type of cake it's supposed to taste like, but nothing like I ever tasted.  I think they tried to aim more towards like a frosting type taste or something, way too rich and strange tasting, the powder consistency is quite different than the other ON flavors I've tried as well.  The only powder that's been a chore for me to down.
 I really like this product.  It provides a good amount of protein for a low amount of calories; Amazon had the best price I could find.  The taste is good and the powder dissolves in water very well.  I typically shake or use a blender - stirring does not work as well and it does leave some small clumps.  Also, if I use the blender it seems to foam up pretty good but not to a point that it's a showstopper.  Almost immediately, when using this product, I noticed that I'm not as sore the next day after a really good workout.  I would purchase this again but after trying some of their other flavors.
 I ordered the mocha cappuccino flavor and it tastes really good mixed with soy milk or skim milk.  It's not at all gritty or chalky tasting in my opinion.  I have not tried it yet with water.  It blends pretty smoothly when used with a Blender Bottle.  The trick is to pour the milk first and put the powder on top, otherwise, it can form clumps.  I use this immediately after a workout or as a meal replacement for breakfast and it definitely helps keep me full for a while.  It's pretty low in sugar and low calorie (120/serving), which is impressive given the rich flavor.  It's a really good value if you think about how many meals you can get out of one package.  I will definitely buy this again.
 This once was the best product on the market. Now, i think it is one of the worst. They added at least an ingredient, which made taste awful. The ingredients posted on Amazon are different than the actual ones. I would never recommend buying this product again.
 All I can say is this - I don't know when or how ON just started messing with the formula but as a 15 year veteran of ON P-shakes, something has definitely changed. It went from tasting bad to "just not able to swallow".<br/>This is horrible. I am going to give the cookies and cream or mocha ones one more go and if that's been tampered with - it's curtains for ON.<br/><br/>I've never understood how companies that have a loyal customer base can tamper with what is proven to work, in the pursuit of more money. #ifitaintbroke ...
 It tastes OK, especially when mixed with low calorie almond milk.  However, after an hour or two I have a very strong aftertaste from the artificial sweetner that's in this.  I wish I hadn't bought such a big (expensive!) container, because I'm practical and feel that I need to use it.  Ugh.  I have tried other protein powders that don't have the aftertaste.
 I recently purchased a 10 pound bag of the double chocolate. I have previously used ON Whey for a long time, but decided to try another company for a few months. When my new bag of ON Whey showed up it did not taste like the original formula... After some research I discovered that ON has changed the ingredients and now I can hardly choke down this protein. It is the worst tasting protein to ever touch my lips.
 I should actually give this 5 stars but I'm taking one off because I can no longer use this product. WThe warning about containing milk is no joke.  I am usually not lactose intolerant, but this makes my stomach upset.  I wish it worked because it is like drinking strawberry nesquick and has an extremely good composition of proteins and bcaas.  I am switching to a plant based protein, but for those that can handle it kudos.
 I'm very familiar with the consistency of a wide variety of whey products - both flavored and unflavored, plain and fortified.  This product is noticeably more watery than any of the others I have tried including all of the various plain, unfortified whey products I have used.  I would like to see the results of an independent nutrition review.  I will be surprised if that review says this product contains the amount of protein and other nutrients it claims to contain.
 New review:<br/>Changing my review fro 5 star to 1 star because they have removed Aminogen (protein digesting enzyme) and replaced it with some stupid junk. Before it was the best product ever but now its just a garbage. They also have false old images of the ingredients list which shows Aminogen but when you look at the Product information and check the list it shows : Protein Blend (Whey Protein Isolates, Whey Protein Concentrate, Whey Peptides), Cocoa, Lecithin, Natural and Artificial Flavour, Acesulfame Potassium.<br/>Some reviewers also claimed that they have added sucralose in it.<br/><br/>Old review:<br/>Taking this product for many months and have to say it is the best. The price and quality of protein is very good. I like when I mix it either with Banana or Pineapple. It tastes delicious. Mainly it will provide you your daily protein intake.
 This is my go to protein. It taste good and mixes easily. I tend to put 2 scoops to give me almost 50 g of protein. I refuse to get any other brand at this point. Does not upset my stomach like other can. I mix with water or, if I want to add more calories, I mix with milk. Mixing with milk will also help keep a fuller belly your using as a meal replacement. There is a reason why this is one of the best on the market.
 My husband and I have used Optimum Nutrition for years as a low carb, low fat way to hit our protein macros. Over time we've tried several different flavors and all of them taste great, though of course we have preferences. I also noticed that the sodium level went up on newer batches of the protein, but it only went from 115 to 130 - that's a difference of 15, which we consider negligible, and neither of us can tell a taste difference. If you want a good protein with low carb and fat that still tastes fairly good without breaking the bank, this is a great choice.<br/><br/>PROTIP: If you are cutting and you don't have the calories to mix your protein with nut/soy/dairy/etc milk, do yourself a favor, purchase a $5-$9 water TDS meter, and make sure that the water you're mixing your protein with is as pure as possible. Within the last year we became very water conscious and did just that - we use ZeroWater filters now and we have noticed a definite taste difference with our protein. The same holds true for coffee. This simple change has ensured that we don't dread drinking our protein shakes any longer.<br/><br/>Our favorite flavors are:<br/><br/>1) Extreme Milk Chocolate - Our favorite ON chocolate flavor. (My husband actually hates all of the chocolate flavors except for this one and double rich chocolate.) This actually tastes like you've made a glass of chocolate milk from Nesquick or something, even if you mix it with just water (which is what we do). If you blend it with ice or use it to make protein fluff it tastes like a chocolate shake.<br/><br/>2) Vanilla Ice Cream - I love this flavor, which is controversial because a lot of people hate it. It tastes exactly like the description - it tastes like melted vanilla ice cream, with all of the sweetness that accompanies that. If you like that flavor (and I do), then you'll like this shake. If you prefer a more traditional vanilla flavor, stick with French Vanilla.<br/><br/>3) Double Rich Chocolate - My husband's favorite chocolate flavor until we tried Extreme Milk Chocolate. I'm not a fan of this, however - it has a dry, chalky, almost malty taste in your mouth and is more reminiscent of dark chocolate. If you like malt and dark chocolate (which hubs does), you'll probably like this a lot.<br/><br/>Thoughts on other flavors we have tried that were fine but not quite our favorites:<br/><br/>&gt;Birthday Cake - Great for making homemade protein bars and adding a little pizzazz to your shakes with the sprinkles floating around. Definitely high on the artificially sweetened taste, though, so keep that in mind.<br/><br/>&gt;Rocky Road - Wasn't bad! Wasn't great. Hubs absolutely hated it.
 BEST FLAVOUR (banana) ok first of all I'm not going to express if this supplement works or not. IT'S PROTEIN! WHAT CAN I SAY, whether it comes from a cow or powder form,  ur taking in the same "protein" per say,  ITS GOING TO DO ITS JOB REGARDLESS (granted saving u the hassle of eating n obviously at the cost of less calories aswell) my review simply is going to be about the flavour and my GOD this is the best flavour out there (banana creme) , this is coming from a guy who has tried, chocolate, vanilla, the infamous Rocky road, and cookies and cream (which by the way taste like s***),  so I'd like to think my opinion holds some value, I'm currently on the hunt for the best flavour so I'm working my way to try everything, so bare with me, but as we speak BANANA CREAM is my personal favorite and if you enjoy banana ice cream or yogurt this will fit in right at home with ur taste buds
 WITHOUT QUESTION not the same product I’ve had before. Watery, flavorless product. I don’t even know what’s in here
 I've been using this protein for years now. By far I find it to be the best protein for anyone who wants to stay lean or is trying to cut.<br/>I just take 2 scoops every day after my work out (5 days a week).<br/>For those concerned about flavor, this protein is one of the best tasting proteins I've ever had.<br/>I use to take serious mass and dreaded taking my protein because of the awful taste.<br/>This protein has great flavor and is very smooth.<br/>I HIGHLY recommend this protein to people who regularly hit the gym, and people looking for meal replacements to lose weight!
 I've never tried protein shakes before so I was a little concerned about the taste.  After much research, I decided to try this brand.  It is delicious!  I don't get that strong "protein" shake flavor.  A shake for breakfast keeps me full until lunch.  I'm not looking at the clock wondering if 10:30 is too soon for lunch :)  My favorite combo uses the Double chocolate flavor, some PB2, sugar free butterscotch pudding mix, and almond milk.  Tastes like a butterfinger!
 Disclaimer:  I love LOVE Optimum Nutrition products. Been using them for years. I must have gone through 1000 tubs of Glod Standard Whey in the vanilla flavor.<br/><br/>But I got a little to adventurous and opted for chocolate mint this time. Ugh. Mistake. This stuff tastes a lot like that nasty bile taste you get when you throw up a little in your mouth. You know that taste? Really not good. Oh I’ll choke it down because after all $50 is $50 but I’m going to go back to good old vanilla next time.
 Satisfied with the flavor, the contents, and the results I’m seeing from using this product. Although there is one minor issue. The specific flavor I bought claimed to not have sucralose, the “vanilla ice cream” flavor. But as the product arrived, I saw the ingredient was actually in the product and I was disappointed to see that. I would rather a product not have an artificial sweetener, but it’s hard to find a good quality protein with glutamine and amino acids at a reasonable price. So this is the best of a bad situation, being completely honest. Would much rather have a product with natural sugar, but I can’t complain too much. I’m seeing results and have had no other problems as far as consumption with this product. It’s easily mixed and tastes phenomenal while giving me results in the weight room I need within a month of using. Would reccomend. 8.5/10 (would be 10/10 without sucralose)
 Been on a 1200 calorie, high protein, low carb diet. This is my go to breakfast after my morning workout. I’ve tried other protein shakes and this is by far my favorite. No grit, no chalky taste. Kept me full throughout the day. Bought the 1lb bag of double chocolate to make sure I liked it before committing to the giant tub. I just mix with water in a shaker cup and I’m done! Will be purchasing again!
 I purchased this on a whim to see if i would like it. it was my first protein product and was happy with it. the flavor is great and mixes well in my nutribullet. i typically mix with fruit so i'm not sure if that makes a difference but i really like it. last night i mixed with almond milk and peanut butter only and it tasted just like a reese's peanut butter cup. Delicious. not chalky or any funny after flavor. the only thing i noticed, when i drank it on an empty stomach, i had a slight stomach pain so i'd prefer if it was gluten free but other than that, it's delicious and i'd recommend to anyone.
 I think ON Gold Standard protein is a pretty solid protein.  Reasonable protein grams to scoop grams percentage, mixes well, and has decent amount of aminos.  I mix with NOW unflavored whey isolate protein to increase protein to grams ratio with minimal affect on taste.  I was not a fan of the white chocolate flavor.  I am almost through every flavor ON protein and white chocolate got a 5 of 10 on my excel sheet.  I did not reduce my star rating since flavor can largely be a personal preference and not necessarily a black mark to the brand.  And I have never tried another brand with white chocolate flavoring to compare it to.
 This a great protein supplement, the taste is good, it mixes well and is not too heavy on digestion. The price is a little steep, however you get quality powder that you can feel confident consuming. I have bought this powder many times and use it often for post workouts or a breakfast drink. I do not recommend this for meal replacement, if you want something that will fill you up and help gain mass I suggest the "serious mass" as that will work much better and have a much lower price per pound. I do recommend this as a way to get extra protein in a light, quick, easy and low calorie format.
 I purchased this on a recommendation from a body builder friend that did research on it and said that it was one of the few that didn't have any fillers.  I never even thought about protein powders having fillers!  So I've been using this for about two months now.  It tastes like most protein powders, nothing really special there.  I noticed that it "foams" up a bit when used with my Vitamix so I mix up my fruits/veggies first then gently fold this in so it doesn't create a lot of air bubbles.  It does mix in very well and I've never had any clumps.  The size of this is HUGE!  I wasn't expecting that but that is okay and fine with me!  I will definitely be buying more when I run out.
 The first wasn’t sealed and the second was expired and made me really sick!
 If you are looking for a pretty clean protein shake that tastes amazing, this is for you. It is not the powder that I regularly use, but I really dig it, its contents and the quality are really great. It helps control cravings and if used well with a good diet and exercise it will definitively help you grow those muscles. I use it right after my workouts and it helps with that next day soreness, but I also use it for cooking pancakes, muffins, and other recipes that include the extra protein.
 I've been reordering this protein powder for years because of how much better it is than every other one I"ve ever tried. Seriously, this stuff blends really well and tastes alright as well. I make mine for the morning the night before, so I'll put two scoops into a small jar of tea, stir instantly for a few seconds until it's mixed, cap the jar and put in the fridge till morning. When I get up it's a perfect consistency and tastes fruity. No disgusting blobs or anything like that. I love this stuff.
 My sister and I live for the banana flavor. We liked it so much that we bought 5 LBS of it hahahahhahaha help! It tastes like artificial banana but in a good way. It tastes like the little banana runts candy. If you liked that as a kid, you will love this. We mix it with a lil milk, a lil water. HEHEHE BANANAAAASSS!
 This product is 100% whey from isolates so if you're trying to hit a protein goal while keeping your daily caloric intake down, this is for you.  Nothing is better for building lean muscle mass.  If you're trying to gain weight or just get bigger you might want to pass on this one.  I would suggest a concentrate or maybe even casein.  They have more of the natural fats and carbs from milk.  The tub does come with a scoop but I had to dig it out from the bottom with a steak knife.<br/>In regards to taste, I was moderately satisfied.  It is very chocolaty but it does have a slight artificial flavor. DO NOT mix with water because it tastes terrible.  Mix with milk for the best flavor; the more fat the yummier.<br/>In regards to solubility, it doesn't do too bad.  6-8 oz of milk yielded few, but noticeable, tiny clumps.  The 10-12 oz range is perfect for getting those clumps broken up especially if you put it in an actual blender.  A word of advice: if you use a blender, don't leave it for more than 10-15 seconds.  The tub says 30 seconds but the mix becomes whipped and frothy which I personally don't enjoy.<br/>Overall I'm happy with this purchase but I might go with vanilla next time because of the slightly artificial chocolate flavor.<br/>Pro-tip: add 1-2 tablespoons of peanut butter to drink a cup of Reese's.  It adds protein and flavor!!
 With excellent results for muscle-growth and good taste, I highly recommend this protein. I have used Muscle Milk, Syntha 6, and Gatorade protein powders in the past and I would recommend this one in a heart-beat. It has a lower sugar content and consistently gives me the boost or recovery I need for my workouts. For flavors, I would recommend chocolate or vanilla, both taste great and you can add fruits or peanut butter to it in a blender.
 I have been using Optimum Nutrition whey for over 10 years and it has always been my favorite. The consistency and flavor is great. The Extreme Milk Chocolate is my favorite flavor. I usually don't like Chocolate protein shakes because they can taste very bland but that's not the case with this! I also like other flavors like Chocolate Mint and Cookies N Cream!  I  love that this doesn't clump up and easily mixes in my Blender Bottle. It mixes great with water, milk, or coconut water.
 This protein powder doesn't need another great review but I just have to say how much I LOVE it. I've only had the Double Rich Chocolate and I keep wanting to try other flavors, but DRC is the best bang for your buck nutrition-wise. It has only like 6 ingredients and NO FAKE SUGAR. I can't say how much I detest the flavor of stevia or similar in my protein powder. I love this protein because it tastes great, mixes easily, and has a good calorie to ingredient and protein ratio.<br/><br/>Optimum Nutrition, I will try your other flavors when you take the crap ingredients out. For now it is DRC only!
 Looks: Like just about every other protein powder.<br/><br/>Smells: Faint, rich chocolate scent.<br/><br/>Tastes: Good flavor, but not much of it.  I found that a little extra power plus a teaspoon or so of sucralose substantially improves the taste.<br/><br/>Feels: Not as filling as some I've tried, but acceptable as a post-workout drink.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Ranks maybe in the upper third of whey powders I've tried.  Could use more flavor, and maybe a little fiber to bulk it out.  Four stars.
 Beware. this is NOT pure isolate. it has some concentrate and they don't tell you how much. Even with lactase in it, it gave me gas. Wife not happy. Taste is great though. I switched back to Isopure Unflavored which is my all time favorite.
 Tastes pretty good (honestly, no powder tastes delicious right? I like this one and trust the quality. Went with it because I think they do the best job of addressing the bad stuff (metals, etc) that you often read about in bodybuilding mags. There is a lot of nasty not-so-good stuff in some of these powders, so I go with brands like this that I trust a bit more.
 This has got to be some of the best protein that i have had, ever.<br/>Mixability - I've been doing two scoops with a banana and dare i say, peanut butter! Mixes great in the blender with said ingredients, in a shaker bottle its still smooth, just a little more work ;)<br/>Taste - i can't wait to finish pushing heavy weight just to get to this flavor!! (chocolate)<br/>Price - at only 3 grams of carbs per serving and 24g of protein, this thing is basically an isolate! You're getting bang for the buck here.<br/>Gas - yes, I made that a point too ;D i will say cheaper proteins , or maybe even lower quality ones get me gassy with some funk on top of it!<br/><br/>Im willing to bet money that the other flavors are just as great and I will be getting to them as money allows !
 Great taste and mixes very easily!!  The amount of protein per serving is excellent.  I try to maintain a healthy lifestyle and diet so this really helps in between meals and after workouts.  I'm not trying to achieve massive muscle gains, so I wouldn't be able to give a great opinion if it has been giving my muscles a boost.  But in the past month that I've taken it I've gained 1 lb of muscle according to my body composition analysis.  I only workout 2 times a week, and the majority is mainly cardio.  I'm pretty sure that if I focused my workouts more on muscle gains, then this product would definitely show good results.
 it melts completely in cold water with very little blending. I am not sure if it's designed like that. Afterall whey protein is not that easy to be dissolved. The most wired thing is, I kept the bottle unwashed for two days and there is no bad small AT ALL! Is there any protein in it at all? For all my previously bought whey protein, the bottle will be smelly after one night if I don't wash it.  I think that's the normal phenomenon for whey protein, right?
 I'm at the beginning phases of losing the 25 pounds I gained this past (very stressful) year. I got a trainer who recommends an expensive brand of protein for the occasional meal-replacement and I just can't see the point. I researched and found this product has great reviews. Plus, a Reddit user tested various protein shakes and found that, though like all products tested, this product contained less protein than advertised, they had one of the closest levels to what they claimed and one of the highest levels of overall protein.<br/><br/>I don't typically like chocolate products (not even chocolate ice cream!), but I ordered the double rich chocolate since my past experience shows chocolate protein from any brand tastes pretty ok, whereas my preferred flavor, vanilla, can be decent or really bad. Plus this way I can share with my girlfriend who is also starting to lose weight. I am very pleasantly surprised! I'm not just putting up with it; I actually like it!<br/><br/>I replaced my morning (coffee + tons of empty calorie creamer) with (espresso + 1/2c almond milk + ice + 1/2scoop of this protein powder) all blended up. Its less calories, has way more nutritional value, and actually tastes like a darn good 100-calorie mocha frappuccino. Plus, with how good the chocolate variety is (I haven't tried everything on the market but I've tried 3 or 4 other brands of protein shake), I think next time I will be brave enough to get vanilla!
 I am honestly really disappointing in this product. It did not taste at all like how it did previously, and I have purchased this product repeatedly through retailers in the past. This is the first time it has tasted the way it did. I used to actually enjoy drinking this with some milk, but now I can barley choke it down. I really wish I had taken the time to read all the reviews prior to purchasing it. If I knew how terrible this product was due to the formula change, I would never have bought it. Don't get me wrong, it still has protein and helps with gains, but the taste is just terrible. This is not Amazons fault at all, but Optimum Nutrition's. They really need to listen to all these reviews and go back to the old formula or else they will lose all their customers.
 This is our second HUGE bottle and in all our third because we tested out the smaller bottle first. My son really likes this drink.  I taste tested it once and it is really good.  I don't know about the other flavors but this one is delicious.  It lasts a long time and never lumped or turned.  You will get several months out of this container if you drink it once a day which is what my son does.
 Started pulmonary rehab in October to w/ the goal of giving my lungs more endurance &amp; hoping for the return of some muscle definition loss due to inactivity. Going into 3rd month, I lost 2 lbs which is NOT my goal!! I cannot stand to lose any weight! The staff convinced me to implement a protein supplement in my diet, recommending this Whey product. I  ordered the 5 lb jar (who KNEW jars could be so doggone HUGE!).  At first, was not thrilled w/ my "weak chocolate drink" but changed my thinking, &amp; it became my "chocolate flavored water" drink!!  My body was puzzled that first week, wondering "Hey!! We never EVER ingest this much fluid in one day!" So not only am I getting my proper amount of water w/in a 24 hr period, I'm getting my required amt of protein AND some calories as well!! Have regained my lost 2 lbs  AND continuing my original quest of strengthening my muscles, lung power, etc. Can't go wrong w/ this Whey protein!! Thrilled I followed professional advice rather than my own (which would've been EAT OREOS!!!).
 I've used this product before. It certainly is an effective protein. How much this helps you is 90% dependent on how hard you workout, so when someone says a review saying something like... "**** THIS, DOESN'T WORK, GARBAGE", you can disregard those neanderthals.<br/><br/>What I am surprised is the flavor. I haven't bought it online, but I've bought this protein twice through GNC with different flavors. I believe regular Chocolate and then Vanilla? Fantastic.  But i've tried this protein twice now (Mint Chocolate) and I was shocked... Tastes just like cheap Walmart protein. Barely a hint of chocolate or mint - taste like flavorless whey protein.<br/><br/>I've read some reviews of the flavors or quality dropping over recent years, and I am skeptical about the overall product now. Hopefully it's just a lack of flavor and not the protein mixture, because I care more about the results than the taste. Otherwise, I'd highly recommend this protein (just not Mint Chocolate).<br/><br/>Cheers,
 I had been buying 1.5# protein from Walmart and it was fine, but one tub was lasting less than 2 weeks. A friend of mine turned me on to ON and honestly the big upside (at first) was the 5# size. It lasts me about 6-7 weeks drinking a shake or two a day on most days.<br/><br/>My first tub was the Banana Cream. On a scale of 1-10, 1 being horrible and 10 being amazing, I'd give Banana Cream about a 7. I really liked it, but found it was much better mixed with a banana or strawberries or something besides just the powder. But I was hooked, and it seems to support my goal of weight loss and modest muscle growth/strength increases.<br/><br/>The next tub I bought was the natural version (gold label, different Amazon listing). in the Chocolate flavor. On that same scale of 1-10, I'd give the natural chocolate a 9. Maybe a 9.5 It's so good I can mix it with water in a blender bottle and it's like a shake from Dairy Queen. Mix with almond milk and it's even better.<br/><br/>I cannot think of any downsides to ON Whey powder. I have no aftertaste or ill effects. It's filling and the price--to me, at least--seems very reasonable. I am going to stick with the natural flavors and *maybe* try a different flavor when chocolate runs out. Or maybe not. But I can highly recommend this. I'd be hard pressed to buy anything else regardless of price.
 Great protein. But ridiculously sweet!  Even with just plain milk, it taste like I am drinking a sugar shake.  Forget about adding fruit or yogurt or anything sweet to it. I don't understand why companies do not seem to understand that "sweet" does not mean "flavor".  It's just now sitting in my pantry. I am returning this product.  ON makes great protein, I wish they would make them less sweet or just with no sweetness at all - it would be perfect for fruit or veggie shake. Too bad!<br/><br/>On a positive note, I have used their Double Chocolate flavor which although still too sweet, it is somewhat manageable.  It is certainly not as sweet at his vanilla flavored one.
 Have been using this for a couple of years as my lunch drink.  Since I only do a glass a day, not really trying to bulk up or gain muscles really can't say how that works out.  I usually mix it with frozen strawberries and ice cubes then use a small blender.  Taste great and easy to prepare.  Probably should eat more than that for lunch, but I'm lazy and this is a way to avoid overeating. Apparently others like it too, as I had half a can stolen from my employee lunch room, so now I only bring a baggy at a time.
 I love this product I been using it for the last 10 montsh It gives me the perfect amount of energy before my workout. I do HIIT and is amazing the difference when I drink this pre or post workout, my body feels it. If I don't drink it I will have muscle ache for a couple of days after workout. Very high quality protein and eventhough is pricy still beats other offers in the market. I love the taste I have try different flavors and so far this is my favorite and I don't add any sugar and still taste delicious. My husband loves it too.
 Product came damaged. Doesn’t look like the damage happened from outside the box so I’m skeptical about using it. Excellent customer service by amazon on taking care of my problem so will just order another one. I’ve used this protein for months and nothing taste better.
 When it comes to protein powder, I am very picky. it's because i have a very sensitive stomach. ON is one of the best protein powder that I have used. I have used many different brands before. Some are okay, some taste funny. I hate the chalky taste. ON by far has been the best for me. it mixes well and doesn't have an aftertaste like others. The extreme double chocolate flavor can be mixed with milk or water. It does taste better with milk. Despite my sensitive stomach, ON powder works. I have had others that made me run to bathroom right afterwards. But this one, my body tolerates. 24 grams of protein per servings with less sugar, I definitely recommend this protein powder. I know the same product doesn't work for everyone, but this one works for me. I have noticed the gains too. I would stay away from the banana creme flavor though. I gave it a try and returned it right away. It tasted funny and upset my stomach.
 I bought the cookies and cream flavor and it tastes amazing. Mixes very well in my mixer bottle, so there are no issues with chunks. This protein has helped me recover quicker by mitigating the after workout soreness. I did not want to overdo it, so I have only been taking one scoops worth of mix daily. This is high quality Whey Protein. I have been able to put on muscle mass since I started taking this to supplement my diet for over 2 months.
 I work at a gym, I'm a chocoholic, and I've literally tried every single chocolate flavor protein on the market. Then I tried THIS. Gold Standard Extreme Milk Chocolate flavor is the ONLY protein powder that tastes like actual chocolate milk. It's so smooth, and doesn't have an aftertaste. The quality of this protein is top notch, and as a woman, I stick with 100% Whey protein. (Too much Soy protein is not good for the body.) After going to three different supplements chains, I learned that none of them carry this particular flavor in store and that I would have to order it online. After comparing prices, Amazon's price was much lower than anyone other price. Buying this in bulk (5lbs) is also a better deal than buying the smaller size, plus I drink it every single day. I highly recommend this protein and have since purchased the Gold Standard Casein protein to drink right before bed so I don't wake up hungry in the middle of the night.
 Do not buy!! 3 weeks in to my protine I came to the staggering realization that there were worms/ baby maggots in it!! My protein had a webby look to it and sure enough was from the maggots. Very disgusting. Should have seen it when I first opened it.
 The best protein I've personally found. It dissolves amazingly well. Most protein seems to not dissolve fully, but this dissolves amazingly with only shaking of a bottle (without one of those metal things in it). Some of the flavors are amazing, and some are crap. Just make sure you get the good flavors. Of the ones I've tried: the chocolate mint is really good, extreme milk chocolate is pretty good, double rich chocolate was pretty good, cookies and cream was okay, cake doughnut was disgusting, vanilla ice cream is gross. I haven't tried any other flavors yet, but I'll update this review as I try more over time.
 I have used ON Whey for about half a year now and it is pretty much perfect as far as a whey protein supplement goes. It dissolves flawlessly with a blender ball and a couple shakes, you can drink it anytime of day, and it causes no problems with my very sensitive stomach. The double chocolate flavor also works really well when blended together with peanut butter and milk to make milkshakes as I have experimented with a couple of times. I drink whey about 3-4 times a day, once when I wake up, once after workout, and once before bedtime (I'm a poor college student and can't get Casein for the nights). It has worked wonderfully so far allowing me to put on some mass without gaining the fat of other protein supplements. I just ordered another batch and I am a proud user of ON Whey!!
 Coffee is my favorite flavor. I have tried Double Rich Chocolate, Mocha Cappuccino, Extreme Chocolate, French Vanilla, Strawberry Banana (this one made me sick), Delicious Strawberry, and others. While I hate the taste of protein in general, after a while the other flavors would make me feel sick. Masha Allah, I have not had this issue with the Coffee flavor. I wouldn't say it tastes exactly like coffee, but mixed with milk, the taste is not half bad.<br/><br/>As far as nutrition goes, you get 24g protein per serving, and the serving size is 32g, which to me is excellent, especially compared to other proteins that offer more protein per serving but their serving size is much larger! I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking to try a different whey flavor in the ON Gold Standard line
 Have used ON for 12 years, never go without. Double Rich Choco has always been my favorite flavor - this  most recent purchase (Sept 2018) is completely different, no flavor, have to force myself to drink it just to use it up. It still has the usual ON standard of dissolving excellent in water. The flavor is just not there - used to be rich, creamy, tasted like (cold) hot chocolate, like drinking dessert. Wish they would go back to that!
 So far so good..I'm only going to review the taste as of now and will come back to provide information on other factors. I purchases this to get back into my weightloss and fitness aspects. I lost a tremendous amout of weight and recently gained some back but need to get back to toning and losing the access fat. The taste of the Mocha Cap I have to say is the BEST I have ever had so far. I was using protein shakes previously for 2 years and couldnt find a taste that I loved but now I have! Definitely satisfied with this product for taste thus far. I do mix it with Unsweetened Vanilla Almost milk which is about 30 calories so with the protein powder I'm only taking in 150 calories for a meal.
 I ordered the cake batter blend and got the strawberry banana instead, it was mislabeled. I docked the rating one star because of this. I was planning on ordering the strawberry banana in a few months anyway so it is not worth the hassle of returning it and I like it.
 I've been regularly using this exact product since 2013, although this latest order was the first from Amazon.<br/>Until this order the taste and smell of the protein powder was always fine. However, this one had both an odd chemical/soapy smell and taste. I contacted the manufacturer and they are to run a test on that batch made in Oct. 2018.<br/><br/>In the meantime I returned to Amazon the product tried only twice. Then I ordered again from the same business I'd been using since 2013. This time, though, I got the Mocha Cappuccino flavor. It is just fine
 This is an amazing product, but I am a little worried, after i broke the first seal of the product i took the cap off and protein came out. There was no seal closing the container. I have not had this product before so maybe that is the norm. Please someone let me know if that is normal before I try the product. Every other supplement that I have ever had has had a seal closing the container.
 Item is not eligible for return, I mean an unopened sealed item in its original packaging is not eligible for return.<br/><br/>(I wanted to return after reading the comments about ingredients being changed)
 The bottle came extremely extremely damaged. Everything in the box was in perfect condition except for the gold standard so that means they put it there all damaged in the first place.<br/>Terrible.
 I am using this product from last 6years, I used to buy 74 serving whey goldstandrd,this is the first time I buy this 73 serving, its a fake product because I no the real taste of this prodoct.It has too much added sugar and awefull taste never buy this product.Now I cant throw and I cant drink this protien.
 Had to find a replacement for EAS myoplx, unfortunately this is not the product.<br/>Not creamy and lacks the full of flavor taste.<br/>A bit light on taste and grainy/gritty<br/>I am ok with protein amount, just not full body flavor like Moplex was
 I started ordering ON protein when I started doing the AthleanX workout program. This was one of the recommend "cleaner" proteins out on the market. The price point is also a little better than some of the other products out there. You just need to keep an eye on Amazon's pricing because it does frequently fluctuate.<br/><br/>I typically get the 5lb French Vanilla and have no complaints. It mixes well in the blender and has great flavor. I will note that when I use a shaker, sometimes there may be some clumps, but I haven't found a protein yet that doesn't clump in a shake bottle. This protein also mixes well in pancakes, oatmeal, etc.<br/><br/>Overall, I would recommend this product, as it has become a staple of my daily meal plan.
 I have been buying optimum nutrition protein powder for a decade because it typically has a tiny bit of sugar instead of sucralose.  A little bit of sugar won't kill you if you're trying to gain muscle, tastes better, and isn't a mild carcinogen. This tastes like walmart/body fortress brand.  I am disappointed.
 I've been buying this product and this flavor - double rich chocolate - for years and have been very pleased. However, I've noticed in this package the flavor is not as satisfying. The chocolate is not as intense and it has a hint of cinnamon flavor to it. I've used the same amount of water and whey as I have in the past. I thought I'd give it a little time but now that I've had about 10 servings I continue to be dissatisfied. Might just be a bad batch but I'll need to plan on ordering from someplace else in the future.
 It is at least 14.2x better than the vanilla ice cream flavor i got last time. I actually like drinking the shake (I take it with milk) and its good with a bit of coffee syrup in it (the stuff we use to make coffee milk in parts of the country that don't suck).<br/><br/>I do half a scoop before workouts and a full scoop after. I'll eventually go up to a full scoop before and after, and if i'm ever a 200pounder i'll do 2 scoops after...but for right now there is no reason for that. Good stuff. Taking it with creatine (also ON) and i'm putting on muscle quickly.
 This stuff tastes okay but really tears apart my digestive tract. A serving first thing in the morning fires up severe heartburn followed by lower GI discomfort all day. Same result on either an empty or non-empty stomach. I don't have this reaction from Syntha 6 or even Muscle milk. I wound up tossing most of this in the trash. Very disappointed.
 I used to take this stuff years ago and always swore by it. Now it seems they've switched up some of the ingredients. First shake I drank blew my guts up. Will be looking for a new brand. ON is not what it used to be.
 Very bitter, I tried mixing banana, strawberry, blackberries...  Even peanut butter and it still was very bitter. I don't know if it's the flavor or if I got a bad batch. Disappointed.
 The Double Rich Chocolate tastes HORRIBLE! Do not buy it! I've tried other chocolate ON 100% whey protein powders and they taste great. I'm not sure if the powder was rancid or something. Take my word and do not buy it!!!!
 This protein powder has been my old stand-by for the last 10 years and its never let me down.  I'll admit--there are better quality and higher performance blends out there but in 99% of the population they are completely unneeded.  It never ceases to amaze me how many people like to major in the minor and have 5 or 6 different protein blends for specific times of day.  If your in the top 1% of your sport that might (MIGHT) be worthwhile--for the rest of us all your really doing is helping to put the supplement manufacturers kids through college.  Use this after your workouts and when ever you need a little extra protein and you'll not be disappointed.<br/><br/>Pro's:<br/>--Tastes decent<br/>--mixes well with a spoon or shaker (even in oatmeal--after its cooled a little)<br/>--good price<br/><br/>Con's:<br/>--The only protein powder I developed an allergy too!  Not sure if it had anything to do with the protein or the 5 servings a day for 2+ years I was using through college...probably the later.  After I took a year away my allergy was gone.  To be safe now I rotate this protein brand with a couple other--never had the problem again.
 I am real pleased with ON Whey Protein. I use it once a day and after 5 months definitely feel and notice a difference in muscle. I may up my intake to twice a day on workout days, but for now once a day.
 I'm not sure what this company thinks chocolate is supposed to taste like. This tastes like burnt cinnamon mixed with chalk. If you look at the most recent reviews, they're overwhelmingly negative. Looks like they changed the recipe since the majority of the reviews were made. Too bad Amazon doesn't weight recent reviews more than old ones. It'll take 16000 bad reviews before the overall rating gets to where it should be now.
 I use it primarily with my strength training and to help me reach my daily protein allowance.I love the taste.Most of the time I mix it with water. Sometime I mix it with low fat milk.I can tell the difference with my weight training.I'm 66 yrs young as of August 25!
 Awesome whey protein! Far better than Body Fortress whey that I used to use. Much, much better flavor, so good in fact you can sip this like a milkshake and enjoy it. On the other hand, I always chugged Body Fortress whey since, to me, it tasted nasty, This OP whey also dissolves very quickly whether mixing with a spoon or shaking it up. I've only mixed this whey in water and have not tried it with milk. I may try mixing it with milk someday but water has been sufficient for me.
 I'd rank this as my 3rd favorite protein powder (1st being Banana Cream, 2nd being Chocolate Peanut Butter).  Tastes pretty good, but I kind of grew tired of it after a couple weeks.  I got Chocolate Peanut Butter after I got a bit sick of this, and decided to try mixing the Chocolate Peanut Butter 50/50 with this flavor and I didn't notice any difference in taste (it still tasted like Chocolate Peanut Butter!), so I finished the rest of it off mixing with the peanut butter as I can never grow tired of peanut butter!
 Giving this stuff 4 stars, even though I can't use it anymore :( I guess some folks are just intolerant to this type of supplement. But its probably the best tasting whey i've ever had.<br/><br/>My body is just intolerant to the stuff. It's like drinking super concentrated milk lol.<br/><br/>Caused lots of bloating, gas, cramping, and every kind of uncomfortable digestive feeling you can imagine.... but for someone who is not intolerant to the stuff, it worked great. It did help me gain a little bit of weight which is what I was shooting for, but still had to discontinue, I am now taking beef isolate.
 Although the flavor was good I got severe stomach cramps from it. If you are sensitive to whey concentrates them this is not for you! It was a hassle to try and return so I didn't bother. Return shipping was $14 and no guarantee I would get a full refund due to it being a food product.
 This stuff is amazing! I’m giving it 4 stars because I went ingredients based and this was the best option as far as flavors, but I’m not 100% sold on it. It’s more Strawberry than Banana flavored, and quite frankly it tastes like bubble gum which isn’t very good after awhile. I definitely won’t be buying this flavor again once I finish this batch.
 This is the protein powder I always buy. I work out 6-7 days a week, and I drink this after I get home from the gym.<br/>This school year, from September to May I drank two shakes a day of this. I gained almost 20 pounds from this! My goal was to bulk up, and I think that this helped me to succeed, the only other supplement I used was C4 pre workout.<br/>The flavor is good, I recommend all chocolate flavors. I just would not recommend cookies and cream.<br/>I buy this and use it everyday, would recommend.
 I have been using ON Gold Standard 100% whey for about a year now. The latest order I recieved seems to be fake or adultered in some manner as I get serious stomach cramps and diarrhea after having it. And no this is not due to lactose intolorence (I'm not intolorent) or having the shake too fast. As I've mentioned I have been using the product for almost a year without any issues.
 Alexa ordered this by accident instead of my typical one.  By the time I realized it, it was too late to cancel the order.  This stuff tastes horrible.  Has almost no flavor and I had to force down every uncomfortable sip.  Never getting this crap again.
 This product has sucralose, which sounds like some new variation of sugar but is an artificial sweetener that used to be more commonly known as Splenda. I didn't realize this until I read the ingredients list. If you are trying to avoid artificial sweeteners, skip this protein powder. I used to use it as a meal replacement and found the vanilla flavor blended into fruit smoothies pretty well. I've since switched to Shakeology which is far more expensive but still a good deal when used as a meal replacement and it's much healthier!
 Optimum Nutrition's Gold Standard Whey is the best I've used for the price.  It tastes great, helps keep me in great shape, and has an incredibly low amount of fat so I can get the nutrients I need without all the bulk that other products have. This flavor, Extreme Milk Chocolate, is hands-down the best tasting protein shake I've ever had in my whole life. I had previously been using the Cookies &amp; Cream flavor, and well that was great too, this one's even better. If you drink it with white milk, it tastes as good as a chocolate malt from a good restaurant. Great deal as always on Amazon, and this product is pound-for-pound the best protein powder supplement on the market. When I say pound-for-pound, I mean value for dollar. For a very reasonably low price, you get amazing quality. Bodybuilder.com is where I came across it, as it was awarded the top protein supplement for years now on there, and many other serious nutritionists I know also love it. I highly recommend this product, and you won't be disappointed. I've been using it for years.
 I tend to thing that people exaggerate when they say something it really awful. I like Nesquik strawberry milk btw. This stuff is extremely chemically and has a weird aftertaste. I kind of felt like I just got done licking a 9 volt battery. I was thinking about toughing it out and just finishing it out, but there's 5 pounds of this stuff! Thank goodness for Amazon's return. I'm sticking with Rocky Road. It is very palatable and kinda yummy.
 Formula was changed. I was unaware of it and fully regret buying this protein, even if I did get it on sale. The change to the formula is horrible  and now I don't know what to do with 10 lbs of protein powder that makes my berry smootheis worse. Most protein powders are drinkable with water, milk makes it taste better (moreso like a milkshake), and berry smoothies, you dont even taste it. However, with this new formula, any combination that dissolves this powder makes the original medium taste worse.<br/><br/>Do not recommend at all.
 Optimum Nutrition 100% whey chocolate  coconut flavor is very good.  I found it a little too sweet, but I'm not a big sweet eater.  My husband loves it.  The whey dissolves quickly, leaving no lumps or gritty feel.  Although it's not recommended as a meal replacement....I have had a scoop, when I absolutely had no time to eat.  It is filling and provides a nice level energy.  I'd definitely purchase again..and would like to try other flavors.
 Not as obvious of a coffee flavor a I was hoping but not a bad flavor. Others have complained about the flavor and having not tasted the earlier blend, Ican't compare, but would say this is acceptable.  I have a breakfast drink every morning adding half a glass of ice, 2 scoops of powder milk, half a scoop of instant coffee, tea spoon of fiber, and a small shake of tumerik.  Other powders froth up way too much. This one down't AT ALL.  That is a plus for me.  Compared to slim fast and many other brands, this is low in sugar and fat, so I recommend this one.  The price is great too.  The four star is because it is called "coffee" and barely has that flavor at all, otherwise a 5 star.
 This is my third purchase for this item.  It mixes well, tastes great and the cost per serving isn't bad.  I've mixed this with a shaker bottle and it mixes perfectly after about 20 seconds of serious shaking.  I've used a mini-blender with no chunks after about 10 seconds.  When I make smoothies with my 800 watt blender, it works great but it does get a little thicker even if I don't add fruit or yogurt.  As long as you drink it right after mixing, it's perfect.  I haven't tried any other flavors so I can't compare the taste but I really like this one.  My wife just started drinking this after going through a 10 day juice cleanse and she said this tastes like a dessert compared to those drinks.
 This is very good protein! Not very much filler and they keep the cholesterol down compared to other proteins. It tastes great too.<br/>I'm a mass builder and take two of these a day, one first thing in the morning and another immediately after my workout. My post workout shake I add one teaspoon of creatine (unflavored same company) and a heaping teaspoon of peanut butter and I take it with milk while bulking. It mixes perfectly in my shaker cups.<br/>I have notable results with this stuff.
 This is my second 5 lb tub of chocolate mint powder from Gold Standard. I'm not sure if the company changed the ingredients, but this new tub is making my stomach hurt. I've also found chunks whereas that was not a problem before. I asked Amazon for a refund. I'm really disappointed because this powder was pretty tasty and I consumed it about 5 days/week after my workouts. Really bummed I have to find a new brand.
 This 100% whey is my go to product after working to ensure I get an ample amount of protein. I mix the whey protein with my almond milk and it really tastes like a chocolate shake. It goes down very well unless you mix it with water. I tried water and I couldn't bear the consistency of it.<br/><br/>I like buying the big bottle because you get more of your money's worth. I most definitely recover faster while taking this whey after workouts. I didn't take this whey protein for like a week after workouts and my muscles were sore for a longer period of time so I have proof this whey protein allows my to recover much faster.
 This is the second time ordering it online where the taste of the double rich chocolate is completely flat. I don't know if it's inconsistent manufacturing practice or poor storage of the powders post-manufacturing. I am not impressed with the consistency of this product. I would not order this again.
 I got the Cookies n cream flavor as I wanted a vanilla based protein to be able to add things like peanut butter or chocolate when desired. When I first open the container I was a little nervous because the smell was EXTREMELY sweet and more like a caramel. To mypleasant surprise the taste isn’t too sweet and is great with almond milk and peanut butter. The only small problem I have is that it says “with cookie crumbs” that are no where to be found. My boyfriend has MTS Machine protein in Ice Cream sandwich and you can actually taste the bits of the ice cream sanwhich. Overall this protein has great taste but like other reviews said, I wish they wouldn’t use sucralose.
 I gave this five stars because when I tried to think of negatives, I couldn't think of any.  I am not saying this is the greatest protein powder, but it is very good.  I was very hesitant trying a coconut flavored protein powder.  I was ready for it to be really sweet and way overly flavored.  To my surprise it actually tasted good and not overly done.  Now I like coconuts so my point of view may be skewed, taste wise.  As protein powders go, the digestion is normally a problem.  This blended smooth and I didn't find myself burping afterwards.  I will make a shake while working out, normally early on.  Then make a shake afterwards and blend mine with water.  From my history of using Optimum Nutrition Whey Protein, I haven't been disappointed.  It's a good quality protein and if you enjoy coconut flavor, it's just a bonus.  This is a good quality whey protein powder and I am glad I tried it.
 For quality, I think I would give this two or three stars, but as a protein powder in a market with other protein powders that add sugar and filers to their blend, this product has a pretty decent reputation for delivering decent results over the other protein powders available. However, I'm a bit skeptical that this product may just have phenomenal marketing strategies instead of actually producing a good quality protein powder, because this product may have trace metals in it. Give it a good google search before purchasing this item. I think they may make a more pure protein powder blend, but you'll have to dish out a little extra dough in order to get quality.
 There are many protein powders on the market. Really, do we need them to have all sorts of exotic names and have strange ingredients? All you need to build muscle, stay lean and stay satiated, is plain whey protein. Chocolate is by far my favorite, I've had vanilla, strawberry and other flavors, but chocolate is still the best tasting all around. I have been using this for literally years, and would not know what to do without it. Great as a pre-workout, and post workout protein drink, as well as an evening drink before bed time. I have had the casein powders before bed, but they take a bit to mix up, don't taste as good, and it is milk based, but add this powder to milk, and you still have a casein protein mix. I mix one scoop before my workout with milk, one scoop with water afterward, with milk before bed, and I even keep some at work to help me through some hunger pains now and again. This sells for a great price too, can't beat it. I love it.<br/><br/>I dropped the stars to 4, as I used to get it all the time until they stopped selling it in Amazon's subscribe and save programme. So I switched brands. I now get Syntha 6, which I think is better. It was also getting too expensive. I couldn't justify the high price anymore. After using the Syntha-6 for a while, and still had some of the ON left, I wanted to finish it up and was surprised that I didn't care for the taste anymore. Maybe I just got too used to the newer brand.
 Optimum Nutrition is my preferred brand of protein powder and 100% Whey Gold Standard Mocha Cappuccino is my favorite flavor. And, you probably can't find better prices for it than on Amazon, especially with Prime. As you'd expect, the larger the package, the lower the per serving cost. Too bad this flavor doesn't come in 10 pound tubs, but maybe some day.<br/><br/>I've tried a few other flavors in the chocolate family but keep going back to the mocha. Flavor is subjective, but there's no real expectation with mocha flavor so it's hard to be disappointed.<br/><br/>I've only had it with plain cold tap water and always use more water than instructed. This doesn't make for a thick shake but it is a pleasant tasting drink. It mixes up really well in a shaker bottle and a blender ball isn't required. I'm sure blending it with ice and adding other ingredients make it seem more shake-like, but I think it's just fine with only water.<br/><br/>The reason I didn't give this product five stars is because occasionally there's a weird chemical-y or metallic aftertaste. It's not unique to ON products but I still notice it a few times a week. I have no idea what causes this and it doesn't happen right after drinking it. Sometimes the aftertaste will pop up a few hours later but I know it's from my protein shake. Still, it's not enough for me to try other brands or flavors - espeically since I already know I like this one.
 The plastic container arrived but had some big dents in it. It's actually quite strange because the cardboard box itself was fine, so I highly suspect the tub must have been damaged before it was packaged. I suppose it doesn't matter much since the contents is just powder, so it's not like that could get damaged, but I'm still upset the item itself arrived in such poor condition.
 This protein powder is amazing. Yes, you can buy cheaper powders out there, but I have yet to find one that dissolves as well as this and that tastes amazing. While I tend to use a blender to make a smoothie, you can just stir this up. It tastes like a milkshake and does not have that chalky taste that I have come to expect with the normal protein powders. I have already reordered and am trying other flavors.
 I use this whey protein on a daily basis. First off, I think that this is one of the best deals on whey that you can get anywhere, as in price per serving. Second, there are very little carbs and the very slightly sweet taste is from sucralose, which is the same sweetener as Splenda. This cannot be digested by your body, so it is therefor zero extra calories. You get 24 grams of protein per scoop without any extra sugar. I feel that by using this product right after my workout, I recover from my workouts a bit faster from the immediate protein and I can get back to the gym quicker, leading to quicker results.
 Good product, no "amino acid stuffing" (imbalanced amino acids for cost reduction), best nutrition specs among flavors offered (including lowest sodium, a critical criteria for me due to high-ish blood pressure), decent taste mixed with water.  I've been taking 3 scoops a day for 3 months with plain water, midway thru my 2nd 5 pounds canister, just received my 3rd subscription canister.
 Optimum Nutrition whey is the only protein powder I buy anymore.  It is made from quality ingredients and tastes awesome.  My personal favorites are double rich chocolate and cookies and cream.  The cookies and cream is super excellent because it can be mixed in fruit smoothies without altering the flavor or color like the chocolate does.  Its pretty much the one I would buy if I could only get one.  A special tip is to mix your protein powder with sweetened almond milk and a shot of thick chocolate milk.  Dang it is good!
 Disappointed! The formula has been changed and they have added Sucralose. I experienced mild dizziness after taking this product and realized it was caused by the Sucralose..
 I just received the 5 lb double rich chocolate.  It contains Aminogen and no Sucralose!
 I have tried the Rocky Road, Mocha Cappuccino and Cake batter and I liked them in that order. OP makes good flavors and they mix well. I would prefer more Whey Isolate in this but it is what it is.<br/>Finally, I notice a metallic tasting residue at the bottom of these shakes after it settles for a few minutes but I haven't had another brand of powder in years so I can't say if that is the norm or not. I try not to drink the last ounce so as to avoid it in case it is some kind of manufacturing contamination. Every couple of years Consumer Labs/Reports shows that they contain a small amount of toxins in protein shakes but I buy this brand because they showed that OP was one of the better ones.<br/><br/>I intend to order the Rocky Road flavor again before branching out on new flavors since it is by far my favorite one.
 I don't have the biochemistry background to say weather or not this is a superior product.  I feel stronger, with a better recovery time, but I am taking several different supplements and vitamins so it would be impossible to isolate the effects of one over the other.<br/><br/>What  I can tell you is that this is a great tasting supplement.  I can't speak for every one of them, but I have the ON Milk Chocolate whey in a two pound canister at home and I have bought the five pound Chocolate Mint flavor off of Amazon here.  The milk chocolate is better than average, but the chocolate mint is tasty to the point that I worry about over-indulging in it.  I've been mixing it with two percent milk, and it is a creamy and delicious drink that -- and this is important -- blends nicely even in the milk.  The <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Sundesa-BB28-MC01-BlenderBottle-28-Ounce-with-BlenderBall-Blue/dp/B0018G4ZEW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Sundesa BB28-MC01 BlenderBottle 28-Ounce with BlenderBall, Blue</a> helps, but I've even spoon-mixed it at home and it worked well.<br/><br/>You can find whey at the five pound size for maybe fifteen bucks less, but this is a good price for a good product, as long as you stay away from GNC.  They'll try to sell you this for retail.
 I have only recently began trying to add a lot of protein to my diet to help build some muscle as part of a weight loss plan.  After tracking my diet for awhile I realized I wasn't getting nearly enough protein and was actually losing muscle mass.  I purchased this product about a month ago and have added it in at least once or twice a day.  I can't speak about results yet as Im still early in my training plan, however I can say that this product is easy to drink!  I was worried that these protein drinks would be horrible, but have found that this one is easy on the taste buds.. and can be mixed with a spoon in water if you don't have a shaker cup handy.
 I love this brand, I've purchased this many times but the last one I got had a super weird taste to it. It almost tasted like it went bad. I ended up throwing it away because I could not drink it. I'm thinking it was just a bad one or something because I've order this brand of protein maybe around 20 times. I will still purchased this and hopefully I don't get a bad one this time.
 Took the plastic off the lid and started to unscrew the lid, powder started falling everywhere. Seal was obviously broken inside. Was stuck to top. Can't use because not sure how long the freshness seal was off. Would like a replacement without having to ship the defective one back. That one belongs in the trash anyways.
 I have been using this protein for almost 8 years and I have never been disappointed. I have done several bodybuilding and fitness shows utilizing optimum nutrition products and I have always seen results. I believe if you work hard and utilize supplements you will see results as well but this alone will not help you get to where you want to be. Like Ronnie Coleman says "everybody wants to get big but nobody wants to live no heavy ass weights"<br/><br/>By the way this is more for a lean gain or cutting phase rather than bulking. This is due to the low carbs and low fat and calories that this protein contains.
 Like most protein shakes, if you just add water it is not going to taste like you went to Dairy Queen. but with a few recipes you can make some excellent tasting drinks.<br/><br/>-= Vanilla Shake =-<br/>To start, find your round spoon buried inside your container. Its in there, just use a kitchen spoon to dig around and find it.<br/><br/>- 1 scoop of protein. (vanilla ice cream flavor)<br/>- 1 cup of milk. (add more milk as desired)<br/>- 2 ice cubes.<br/>- 1 scoop vanilla ice cream. (optional)<br/>- Blend 10 seconds.<br/><br/>Even without ice cream it taste great.. for me, I don't worry about fat so I enjoy the bonus time to time. Don't have a blender?  no problem, put 2 cubes in ziplock and smash em in a towel lol.<br/><br/>I even throw a scoop of protein in my waffle mix on weekends to mix it up.. So don't worry about flavor.. you can put protein in anything..  drink it raw, or give it love, it is up to you..<br/><br/>Hope this helps all those who worry about flavor. Just remember, protein doesn't come as a jar of cookies..  you gotta make the cookies.
 Since I started using ON protein powder my recovery time from speed and distance workouts is sharply reduced. Same for racing; I realize now that I used to starve my body on a diet too heavy in carbs, now I replenish it within hours of extreme effort. It easily mixes into juices, and I've switched over to blending it with ON amino booster for more recovery and a burst of flavor.
 I mean...its Optimum Nutrition so there are probably thousands of reviews for this. It's a great product and works well, I just have a problem with the taste. I bought the mocha cappuccino flavor and it taste like a light version of the chocolate flavor. The protein shakes I make don't make me gag or upset my stomach, so I still like it, I just wish that this particular version had a stronger cappuchino flavor. That's not really a big gripe to write a review about but if anyone wanted to know, there ya go.
 Great product.<br/>I like to mix it with milk so the vanilla tastes like an ice cream shake. Is not heavy, scoops are small. When I want to change the flavor I add cinnamon or a banana/ chocolate or any fruit. It helps to keep my weight without having to choke so much with food. Lol
 I've been using this protein for the past 6 months now, and it is one of my favorite out there.  The price at Amazon is the cheapest thus far and the quality of the protein is great!  I have tried countless brands or types of pro tine out in the market, but non have had such a great taste with only using water as this.  I've gained approximately 20 pounds of muscle mass from only taking this protein, some creatine, and lifting weights 4 days a week for the past 6 months.  The fact this pro tine comes with 71 serving is amazing for the price.  Don't get all caught up in all the hype over the latest and greatest by salesmen out at your local stores or online.  Stick with what has worked for others and most of all, what works for you.  Here is a quick breakdown...<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-Taste<br/>-Ease of use (water to keep the calories down)<br/>-Price<br/>-Amount of servings you get<br/>-Results!!<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-Other flavors may not be as good such as "Natural Strawberry"<br/>-Large tub to carry around<br/>-Having the same flavor over and over gets a little old after 6 months<br/>-Making sure you have a reserve tub before you run out = )<br/><br/>Not too much of cons if you ask me.  I'll try the cookies and cream next to see how the taste is.  Try the Extreme Milk Chocolate flavor, you won't regret it.  Best of all, it is very light and goes down easy.  Hope this helps!!
 Wow, this is the tastiest and best quality protein powder we've every tried. This will be our go-to from now on...no need to look any further, this is the best!! Dissolves great, even just with a spoon. We've tried it in water and in Almond Milk, both taste great, but the AM gives it a delicious creaminess. Doesn't taste too sweet or leave any strange aftertaste. It's just plain good! So glad we did the research and found this one. Two thumbs up!
 I love this protein! It tastes great and is from a reputable company that aims to provide their customers with high quality materials.<br/><br/>The price off of amazon is literally impossible to beat, especially with prime shipping..<br/><br/>In terms of the customer service from Amazon relating to this product.. amazing...<br/><br/>I received my package today with two 10 pound bags of protein and 1 of the bags had a medium-size rip in it and a bunch of the protein had spilled out into the box and all over my other items.<br/><br/>I emailed Amazon and LITERALLY within 5 minutes I received a response indicating that a brand new 10 pound bag of protein was being sent out immediately with ONE-DAY SHIPPING. I just checked my account and sure enough there is another order for a 10 pound bag marked as "shipping now" with the delivery estimate being tomorrow!
 Great flavor, and a good mixer. Vanilla goes well with lots of different ingredients. fruits, chia seeds, peanut butter, cinnamon, etc.
 This is truly the gold standard for Whey protein. First off, the taste is similar to unsweetened cold hot cocoa to me, which is pleasant enough for me to not get sick of it after drinking it for days on end. The thing I like about it is it seems to have more protein per scoop than the other leading brands. I have noticed a positive difference in my muscle mass while taking this compared to the other big names. I can't really think of any negatives.<br/><br/>P.s. I've noticed this whey mixes best in a blender, or even a blender bottle. Stirring it in can leave it a bit clumpy
 Isopure can be an alternative to this product but its a lot more expensive .I have been using whey since 2 years and I just want to say ,If you wanna go for a cheap,effective and tasty protein I highly recommend this product. All the flavours are awesome ,my favorite is double rich chocolate.For best results drink it after your workout ,I received the product right on time through amazon. The order was amazingly packed. Just don't wanna give five star because there are many other proteins which are substitute for this product.
 I have just started to do a serious workout regimen. I looked online to find what the best whey protein powder was to go along with my workout, and a bunch of different websites said that this was the most bought and most reviewed.  Some reviewers say down below or above (depends on where this goes) that the company changed the flavor of the product but I bought the double rich chocolate and it tasted great to me.  I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to get stronger and or bigger. This is my first ever protein powder and I can't wait to finish the whole thing and see how big/strong I become.
 I bought this in the flavor Rocky Road and it is a mild but yummy flavor. It's not an overwhelming flavor nor is it bland; Not overly sweet but has just a pinch of sweetness to make me actually look forward to it after a tough workout. It's sort of a MILD chocolate flavor; Some "chocolatety" protein powders remind me of chocolate milk which I don't like. This one isn't overly chocolately at all (which I guess makes sense since its Rocky Road and not straight Chocolate flavored lol).  I'm so glad that I like it because I was nervous since I bought 5 lbs of it haha! Also, this powder absorbs super easily in water; no clumps or chunks like other powders that I've used.
 I have tried a ton of protein powders and this one BY FAR is the smoothest one out there. No need to shake like crazy or put through a blender, you can stir this with a spoon and you won't get all of the clumps like you do with outer powders. Great for me because I am always on the go and don't have time to do the whole "shaker thing" ... Great flavors too!
 Does this work? What are your results? For some reason people become offended by these questions and want to launch into a sermon. I can answer the first question with a yes. For example, last night I did an extreme shoulder workout and my shoulders felt like needles in them. I drank this and went to work. and within an hour it felt as if I had not worked out. Because of my goals I am doing extreme two workouts a day, and say I did two extreme bicep workouts a day; I would feel it for the next three to four days. After buying this, the soreness, weakness, and fatigue would be gone in a short time. Thus it works really fast in recovering your muscles. Results? I can not give that at this time because I have only been taking it for two weeks.<br/><br/>Taste--I cannot believe how light it is. I pour in milk in a blender, pour in one scoop, and drink the whole thing in one shot and it tastes really good
 If you are performing a great deal of intense exercise it is a good idea to supplement good nutrition with some protein shakes. However, it is a common mistake to think that supplements will provide magic results, when in fact they only account for a small percentage of the total results (I would say no more than 10%), provided your training and nutrition are good also. I lift weights 5 times a week and have had good results supplementing with ON Whey Protein. I have two shakes a day, one first thing in the morning the one after my workouts.<br/><br/>The product itself is great. Very clean and pure protein, low-calorie servings and good taste. I have tried Vanilla Ice Cream, French Vanilla Creme and Double Rick Chocolate. The flavor is something of personal preference but I have noticed that the Vanilla flavors are slightly easier to dissolve in liquids. However, if you use a blender (please do so) you should have no problems with any flavor.
 I'm 5'10 and weighed 140ish before taking whey. with keeping up my workout regimen and diet and then adding this to it, i was able to put on 10lbs of muscle. this is a pretty good powder and its perfect for hitting your macros. As a female who has a very hard time of gaining weight i noticed a difference by taking this. i worked at GNC and this was fairly popular there too. Some say its over hyped, but eh it gets the job done and its a good price. what more do i need.
 ON Gold Whey is known for high quality protein and was part of the protein absorption testing and was shown to be high quality, but there are lots of high quality protein powders.  I think the main factors for picking a protein powder are: does it mix well and does it taste good.<br/><br/>ON does mix very well.  I mix with 2% milk and I can use a shaker and no clumps are in the bottle.  I've even mixed this in a pinch by stacking two cups together ala Cocktail and it came out blended.<br/><br/>The taste is decent and better than most I've had.  The only thing that put me off initially was the consistency.  Using one scoop with 8 oz. milk the mix is still very liquid.  I've been used to having a thicker texture with this type of ratio, so it was a bit off putting.  But, I've grown used to it and it's actually nice since you can finish off the shake and not have much left clinging to the sides.
 I tried out a few different protein powders-- mostly from Six Star or Optimum Nutrition-- and I've found that most of them don't mix too well. The Six Star ones would turn into a sludge-like mixture, even with the recommended amount of water per scoop. Optimum Nutrition mixes much better, but the first flavor I tried (the mint chocolate one) was good, but not great.<br/><br/>This Rocky Road flavor, however, is delicious. I mix mine with water and it still satisfies my sweet tooth. It has a rich chocolaty flavor with a hint of marshmallow that's reminiscent of a whoopie pie (if you know what that is!). Also, it doesn't leave those annoying clumps in your cup like other powders do. Easily my favorite flavor, and one of the better brands I've tried.
 On Nutrition is making some of the the best tasting and easily digested protein lines out there.  Rocky Road is definitely a winner with just a hint of the marshmallow taste.  Experiment and the flavor gets even better.  A handful of frozen organic raspberries puts it over the top.  An my new found favorite:  Mix up in a Magic Bullet scoop and a half of Rocky Road, low fat milk, half banana, two spoons of peanut butter and some ice chips!  FREAKING INSANE tasty!<br/><br/>Another huge like on the Gold Standard Whey is that it mixes up and cleans well.  Just a rinse and your done.  No chalky taste or after taste either.  KEEP IT UP - ON!
 Not bad flavor, it is a good amount because my girlfriend and I used it for almost 2 months 3 times weekly.<br/><br/>We tried chocolate and strawberry flavors and I would rather the chocolate one.<br/><br/>My girlfriend is kind of eco-friendly so after finish the product, she used this big plastic bottle for the sugar, salt and stuff like that. :P<br/><br/>I like it.
 I've been using ON as my goto protein for years now. The price is usually the best for the per serving amount and the flavors have never disappointed. I've mixed this both with water and milk. Milk does give it a thicker consistency when mixed but that should be expected. Milk also enhances the flavor. This is not a meal replacer but I have used it as a snack to supplement my protein intake throughout the day. I will continue to use ON in the future.
 I'm on a medically-supervised diet (high fat, adequate protein and low carb). I found that I was not getting enough protein, so I bought ON Whey Gold Standard. I'm thoroughly impressed! It tastes great--it's quite drinkable. It also easily dissolves in cold milk (I shake the mix 1 1/2 minutes and that does the trick). I mix the powder with "Soy Slender" Vanilla Soy Milk!<br/><br/>I was skeptical about the taste, but I'm truly impressed; I will definitely buy this product again.<br/><br/>Edited 11/13/14 After having seen my doctor, I wanted to add this: She approves of protein shakes; however, since the powder only has 1g of fat, she recommended that I add 1T of heavy whipping cream to add a bit of fat. It tastes EVEN BETTER with the heavy whipping cream!
 Been using ON Whey Gold Standard a long with my work outs and exercise and it works awesome. I've only bought the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor, which I've used to mix in fruit, but I think I might try another flavor for my next purchase since I don't mix in fruit often anymore.  I noticed that after using this protein, my muscles have gotten more defined and I've lost a lot of body fat. I've lost some weight too about 8 pounds but I'm more impressed with the muscle mass definition and loss of body fat.  I've never taken Whey protein before consistently, I've tried Muscle Milk in the past but it didn't do anything because it had so many calories and fat in it.  ON Whey is the best for low calories, low fat and highest protein intake per serving. I recommend it!
 Have tried many many companies proteins.<br/>Vanilla and Chocolate are the base flavours I use to judge them across an even scale.<br/>to be blunt-you get what you pay for. This is about $8-$10 more for 5 pounds than the competitors but it is worth it for the flavor alone. The scoop is a 30g unit, with 24 of those grams being protein. Most are 38-45g scoops with the same protein content...<br/>Very good flavor, not overly sweet, no aftertaste. Excellent mixability.
 Image is misleading. Ingredients list in nutrition label online doesnt mention sucralose, but actual product mentions it.
 I have tried numerous brands and flavors of protein powders but this is simply the best IMHO. I use almond milk because I am lactose intolerant and the combo tastes great! I also throw in ON's Micronized Creatine Monohydrate with the mix. This makes for a perfect protein shake for muscle recovery after a hard workout!<br/><br/>Update: to get more protein I have started using Lactaid 2% milk. It offers 8g of protein vs. 1g from almond milk. That makes this shake a nice 32g total! The taste is even better with the Lactaid milk! I am hooked for life!
 This a no fuss protein power. It tastes great, packs a good amount of protein in each scoop, and isn't too hard on the wallet. I suggest buying the 5 pound tub if you are going to use it consistently. It's great for blending into smoothies, oatmeal, or just buy itself with water. I don't buy any other brand.
 This is terrible! It tastes waaaayyyy different than the normal store bought brand. Amazon should regulate these knockoffs better.
 O/N is great and I had been using it for years. I would give ON and the seller 5 out of 5. But then why 4? Because I am writing this review specifically for Mocha Cappucino flavor.<br/><br/>Before I start here is my taste:<br/>Vanilla is the worst, chocolate is OK, banana, strawberry (or their mixture) are good. Extreme Milk Chocolate is the best so far and White Chocolate is amazing too. I tried coconut chocolate too but it was disappointing too as the coconut flavor was fake and weak.<br/><br/>Just like the coconut one, Mocha Cappucino really disappointed me as well since its flavor is really weak. If I didn't know it was coffee flavor, I would think it is chocolate.  Thus, if you love coffee and consume too much, this flavor is not for you. It doesn't give what it offers. Hence, I won't ever buy this flavor again.<br/><br/>so far my list frombest to the worst:<br/>1. Extreme Milk Chocolate<br/>2. White Chocolate<br/>3. Strawberry banana<br/>4. Banana<br/>  Strawberry<br/>6.Coconut Chocolate<br/>  Mocha Cappucino<br/>  Chocolate<br/>9. Vanilla
 The sucralose in this product makes me sick. It literally makes me feel dizzy and light headed. Other than that the taste and protein profile isn't bad.
 Tasted like sour milk.  Gave me a weird queasy feeling and a headache.  I really wish I hadn't bought 5 pounds of this stuff.  It was an expensive mistake.  I'm going to have to throw it in the trash.  Honestly, I'm quite surprised based on all the positive reviews.  By the way, I think this is my first 1 star review.  If you decide to buy, avoid the cake batter.
 The insanely putrid artificial coconut flavor permeates its odor on anything it comes in contact with. Even a coffee mug will reek of the artificial coconut chemical smell indefinitely. this is a scary product. also sense whey is a by product and often paid to be disposed of its completely a rip off to charge 50 bucks for 90 cents worth of product. pure insanity
 Should have read the reviews before purchasing.  Switched flavors from DOUBLE RICH to EXTREME MILK and have been pooping like a monster ever since.  Looked at the ingredients, and sure enough sucralose is included.
 This is without question the best tasting whey powder I've ever bought. It's straight up delicious. It has none of that "protein powder" taste that anybody who has used protein shakes is familiar with. I'm not a hardcore weightlifter or anything, but I like to have a protein shake for breakfast since I don't have much of an appetite in the morning. It serves that purpose very well. But man, it's so good. I would drink it over chocolate milk if given the option.
 Been using this stuff for 5 years. Have never found anything better. Great for post workout as a quick digesting protein; But also good as a meal replacement for when your in a quick pinch. Combine with peanut butter for more calories (and amazing taste) and have a banana on the side or blended in it and BAM you got yourself a quick little meal (a meal is always best to eat, but when not available this protein source can make for quick pinches). I take a scoop when I wake up as well to get my body started and to get some quick digesting protein into my system that has been fasting while I was sleeping.<br/><br/>PROS: Value - Find something on the market with the amount of servings of 74<br/>Product - Whey protein Isolate is always better than concentrate<br/>Uses - post workout, pre workout, whenever! you need a quick source of protein<br/>Digestion - Doesn't make you feel bloated or full (Can eat a meal after)<br/>CONS: Low Caloric (for weight gain) - If your planning to gain some weight you better eat more and combine this with peanut butter, bananas, and milk. But again this is a better protein than those weight gainers that have whey protein concentrate and a bunch of crappy carbs mixed in it
 This is the only protein powder I’ve used that actually tastes decent. I get the vanilla ice cream flavor and mix it with almond milk, tastes like a vanilla milkshake... at least as close to one as you can get with almond milk and protein powder!<br/>I also love that it only has 1 gram of sugar.
 This is my favorite protein powder. It’s hard to find one that isn’t heavily sweeetened and doesn’t have a fake sugar taste. I buy the vanill ice cream flavor and mix it with almond milk, it’s pretty close to a vanilla milkshake considering it’s packrd with protein and only has 1 gram of sugar.
 We've gotten this product for a few years and enjoyed it.  Then they "improved" the flavor.  The flavor is the same, but the texture is like drinking suede.  It's awful.  We're now looking for a different brand of vanilla protein powder.
 I thought it was very reasonably priced because I used to buy the two pound I use has a supplement and replacement for my breakfast generally with two fruits blueberries half a banana I put some probiotics with it and it sustains me for most of the morning and before a workout I like the high amount of protein to low fat the low sugar and I feel a difference I happen to enjoy the vanilla flavor I use my NutriBullet with some ice and some almond milk sometimes I mix it up and put kale and make it and as its smoothies
 I have used ON whey in the past and am happy with their products.  The reason for the 3 starts is double chocolate is horrendous tasting.  It mixes very well and doesn't have a chalky feel to it, but it's very hard to choke down in double chocolate flavor.  Would definitely go with a different flavor.
 I bought this to add a little size as a result of my weight workouts.  I have been using it for about 2 weeks now, but only do weights 2 - 3 times a week.  I think it is making a difference, but I will know more in a few months. One thing about this product, it is NOT FOR WEIGHT LOSS! Unless of course you only eat celery all day long.  The product tastes wonderful, like a super rich chocolate milk shake when mixed with skim milk.  But it does bring some calories to the table, so be aware.
 I bought this after reading reviews of various protein shakes in health publications. I use it as a morning and post workout supplement when my body needs quick protein in an easily digestible form. The good thing about this product is how easy it mixes with water. I tried cellucor whey too. Cellucor whey is a little bit sweeter and more expensive. I would still prefer optimum nutrition whey over cellucor. I feel like protein powders meet a need, but for me personally-none of them taste good!
 Protein tastes fine, mixes fine, and most everything about it is pretty good. However, they should stop using both sucralose AND acesulfame K in their powders and switch to better non carcinogenic sweeteners like stevia or natural sugar
 Like many others, I have been using this as a post-gym supplement for a couple of years. Whey isolate taken right after working out is great to help ease soreness, build muscle faster, and burn fat. It's also good for brain function and anyone who needs a protein supplement in their diet. I've tried several flavors and the coffee is my favorite; when mixed with milk it tastes exactly like those bottled starbucks frappuccinos you can find in vending machines or convenience stores.<br/><br/>This is high quality whey isolate for a reasonable price, and is definitely the most popular whey on the market for a reason. The only downsides, in my opinion, are that it does have artificial sweeteners and flavors as well as a tendency to give me some pretty rancid gas. Not all of the flavors taste good, so read up on some reviews before you buy.
 This whey protein powder works great for us. We use it in smoothies or mixed with just milk (try it hot for a healthy hot chocolate!). It tastes good, is satiating, provides long-lasting energy, and helps us with our protein needs on those days we don't cook meat. We like that it doesn't contain a lot of sugar and isn't made with soy.
 I love ON protein.  It's the only brand I will use.  The strawberry reminds me of strawberry Quick milk I used to drink as a kid.
 I don't know about you, but when I'm done getting swole, it's time to get my Wheys on.  I always reach for ON Gold Standard Whey, because the taste and price can't be beat.  But I did not expect to be in for such an amazing treat when I ordered my latest jug of protein goodness.  Optimum Nutrition has given their 100% Whey Gold Standard a Gold Medal facelift, with a balls awesome gold foil label.  But they didn't stop there.  The scoop in the jug has been refinished with gold as well.  I feel like a champ scooping out a double scoop serving of pure awesome into my blender.  The blender trembles with anticipation at getting a chance to mix all that double chocolate madness into a shake for my enjoyment, and nourishment.<br/><br/>If you're serious about becoming the man (or goddess) you can be, then you have to get yourself some of this amazing Whey.
 Everybody's tastes vary so this is likely a futile post.  I like the flavor though it is a little weak for my taste.  On the upside that likely means I will likely never tire of it... especially when I can just add a little chocolate, banana or strawberry to the mix.
 Tastes fine and mixes well with water. The french vanilla flavor is a little off in my opinion (tastes a little too much like toasted marshmellows). I think the cake batter flavor has a more "vanilla" flavor. Overall, ON whey has been my go-to for awhile and I will continue to purchase another flavor.
 The mocha cappuccino is delicious!  It smells good too!  I am addicted to my The Zone protein shake I have most every morning for breakfast: 1 scoop GS Whey, 9 almonds, 1 cup frozen strawberries, 1/2 cup frozen blueberries or pineapple, 1 cup any type of milk, 1 egg beater (or 1 egg, or 2 egg whites).
 I am pleasantly surprised that this protein powder and how good it actually tastes.  I have been using it as a meal replacement (light breakfast on the go) and pre/post-workout.  It mixes perfectly with a cup of milk and cold brew coffee.  I have been using it almost daily and I am very happy with it.
 I have tried many different protein powders and this is my favorite. It blends smoothly, has a great taste, and is definitely worth the money. I have been struggling with energy levels and being able to put on that extra muscle that I was looking for but every since I tried this product I have been able to increase my gains and increase my energy levels.
 It's pretty good on a relative scale.<br/>Most other quality powders taste like chalk or sweat or rotten syrup with a cheese after taste.<br/>This provided the great delicacy of cafeteria chocolate milk, which isn't bad at all compared to other brands.<br/>Also a quality product in itself. Definitely a great value.
 This is the best whey protein protein I ever had. It literally taste as good as nesquik chocolate milk if you mix the whey in a small glass of milk. It taste so good, I could drink the stuff all day or make a huge glass of it. Taste better and sweeter in milk vs water for some reason - delicious. I almost didn't buy this because of recent bad reviews regarding artificial sweeteners. The Double Rich Chocolate flavor doesn't have sucralose or any of that other stuff. Maybe the other flavors need artificial flavoring, but if you stick to Double Rich Chocolate, it taste delicious and doesn't have the artificial stuff in it.
 First time we've tried this brand, we typically just buy from Walmart or Sam's but decided to give it a try and we loved it. We got Cake Batter. I read a lot of reviews before ordering because I hate getting that fake tasting chocolate flavor that a lot of protein powders are. Cake batter and Rocky Road were both highly rated so that's next on my list. Cake batter tastes relatively close to real cake batter, but it is fairly rich/sweet though so if you're not into sweet flavors I would try something else, but I'm pretty big into sweets so I love it.
 This protein powder blends like a dream. I've yet to experience any of the graininess or clumps that are so characteristic with most powders on the market.<br/>As for the the taste? I've only tried two varieties so far--French Vanilla and Rocky Road--but they've both been pretty solid. The vanilla was toned down and subtle with a very slight aftertaste that took going through a quarter of the tub to get used to.<br/>The rocky road on the other hand? S*** yes.<br/>It has just enough sweetness to be satisfying without being cloying. As far as the aftertaste is concerned, it leaves a subtle hint of almonds mixed with marshmallows. It tastes great in both water and milk but I've also found that it's amazing in unsweetened almond milk.<br/>The gains I've seen while using Gold Standard have been fairly impressive, as well.
 If you care about your gainz, you'll buy this product.<br/><br/>But really though, I haven't tried many other whey products, I just chose this brand because they are considered the 'gold standard'. It seems to be doing the job, and I can't imagine why I'd buy anything else.<br/><br/>What I can comment on is how easily this product mixes. Can easily get rid of chunks by stirring with a knife or something.<br/><br/>Extreme milk chocolate and rocky road are also delicious. I sometimes find myself craving these shakes because of the taste. Disclaimer: I do really enjoy chocolate milk though, so my opinion is definitely biased.
 horrific banana antiseptic flavor, chocolate is much better
 Taste horrible.  No way I am going to finish the container because I have to force myself to finish just one protein shake. Hoping I can find a friend with no taste buds that will take it off my hands.
 I got the double chocolate , best protein I've tried, real muscle recovery!! soreness after work outs is  practically nonexistent!! BEST TASTING PROTEIN  I`VE TRIED!!!! Try it and you might like it!! I am sold on this protein , will definitely order again!!!
 Just adding another voice to those that dislike the change in formula. I have been purchasing this brand for years, but no longer. The taste is dramatically different and I'll be looking for a different brand in the future.
 Just loved the Strawberry Banana flavor. Its very refreshing and not too sweet. Best flavor till now!
 The scoop size reflects the grams per serving on average which is a big bonus - I don't need to worry about getting my food scale out to ensure I'm putting in a proper serving size (see pictures - seriously, I made a mess for this!). The chocolate taste is not overpowering and not super sweet, but I like it a lot. It's very easy to blend in room-temp. or cold liquids, but I struggled mixing it into my morning coffee as a sort of mocha protein drink. It clumped up like other protein powders I've used when I tried to mix it into hot drinks. I really like the taste, mixability, and drinkability of this protein powder other than that slight mishap! I highly recommend it for anyone looking into protein powders. It's simple, easy, and relatively tasty. The price is quite comparable to other protein powders, as well.
 I tried this protein because I wanted something a bit more affordable than what I was using before. bIG mistake, this is the worste tasting chocolate protein I have ever had. I'm seriously debating tossing the whole jug because I don't think I can stomach the flavor, regardless of mix ratios.
 I hope this review clears the air on some important questions that many people have about optimum nutrition whey products. According to optimum nutrition they manufacture some of there products differently as per request of the distributors they are being sold to. For example vitamin shop sells a chocolate whey by optimum nutrition that is weaker in flavor than the same product sold by costco. This is because of the formula !!! costco sells a gluten free formula that has more flavor filler but apparently the same nutrition! vitamin shop sells a formula that has less flavor filler but apparently the same nutrition. This was all very confusing to me so i had to call optimum nutrition and get the low down. With all this being said i was hesitant to purchase whey from amazon not really knowing what i was getting into. I took the chance to get the chocolate mint 5lb and i am completley satisified with the product tatse and effect. Just keep in mind that the distributor does matter. I would reccomend this product and i will be purchasing my whey from amazon again.<br/>On another side Note they do seem to have good customer service and all of there other products such as pre work out and amino energy and creatine seem to be extremely consistant regardless of the distributor.
 Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Whey is great. The company doesn't lie and the protein powder is great. I'm actually writing this review because there's just something weird going on with this flavor. It tastes funky, I don't think I'd recommend it, and now I have 75 servings left to finish. Tastes a little like ground up cookie crisp with a weird aftertaste, not like the oreo milkshake that I was going for. Anyway, just my two cents. The stuff is still super useful for hitting my daily protein intake.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Vanilla ice cream and extreme milk chocolate both taste pretty great mixed with skim milk. Mixing with coconut or almond milk is pretty tasty too, but I wouldn't recommend mixing with water if you're sensitive at all to taste/texture. It makes the powder super watery and not that tasty. But you do what you gotta do.
 This is some great tasting whey protein powder.  It dissolves  so easy in milk.<br/><br/>I like to mix it up, then let it sit in the fridge for a while (maybe an hour).  Take it out, shake it some more to remix, then put it in the freezer for a few minutes to get it super cold.  It's almost like a real milkshake that way.<br/><br/>Honestly, you forget you're drinking a healthy shake it tastes so good.  And trust me, I'm not easily pleased with the flavor of these things :-)<br/><br/>I've been told by a friend to stick with the Double Rich Chocolate flavor though.  He tells me some of the other flavors aren't so good.
 First off, I've used a lot of protein powders in the past. I can't tell you which ones have worked better than the others or anything like that. No change in protein powder is going to make you bigger; you get bigger and stronger by lifting consistently and correctly, and also by providing your body with the correct amount and type of nutrition.<br/><br/>That being said, from the nutrition facts label, this is by far one of the best proteins out there on the market. The taste is great (and I just drink mine with water) and you can tell that there isn't too much sweetener in this powder. I've used muscle milk before and still do occasionally when it goes on sale, but there's way too much sugar in it. Optimum is always consistent and holds itself to the highest of standards; they put out products that you can trust in. Aforementioned, I drink this as a supplement after my workouts. It's a well known fact that one must provide him or herself with a healthy dosage of both carbs and protein shortly after a workout, and that's precisely what I use this for, especially when I know I can't get a meal in within forty five minutes of finishing a workout.<br/><br/>In conclusion, you can't go wrong with this protein. I haven't had any problems with it and I've been using it for a while now. It is my protein of choice. 5 pounds should last a while. I definitely recommend it. Four stars
 Whether you’re new to the health craze or a seasoned veteran gym rat, navigating the supplements marketplace can be very challenging. Everywhere you look, you’ll be peppered with advertisements falsely claiming that their product is the magic bullet that transformed some random Joe Schmo to Ryan Gosling. However, in my unbiased opinion, the closest product to a sure fire magic bullet is Optimum Nutrition’s Gold Standard Cookies &amp; Cream Whey Protein. Whether you’re looking to get “jacked” for spring break, like me, or preparing for Mr. Olympia, this is hands down the product for you. I’ve concluded that this is the best protein powder based on three essential criteria for a college student: the taste and mixology and the quality and value.<br/><br/>TASTE &amp; MIXOLOGY - 9/10<br/><br/>The first thing all consumers of supplements ask is “how does this product taste?” Well, unlike most other protein powders, the 5lbs of Cookies and Cream is really damn good. You might think that the low carb artificial sweetener would ruin the taste, and you’d be wrong. In milk, the flavors are genuine and robust. If you’ve ever had a Chick-fil-A Cookies &amp; Cream milkshake, imagine that but toned down a notch. In water, the flavor was much more subtle and didn’t taste as good as it did with milk, hence the reduction of 1pt.<br/>Just as important to taste is how well the product mixes. For fair analysis, I used the spoon and cup method in two solvents: water and 2% milk. The instructions call for 1 scoop (~30g) of powder along with 4-6oz of fluid. The powder held its own in both liquids with an edge going to milk in the flavor department. Best of all, there was no mineral grit that you sometimes get with other cheaper products!<br/><br/>QUALITY &amp; VALUE – 10/10 (reduced from an 11/10)<br/><br/>Where this product truly shines is in the value department. While protein powders should merely act as a supplement to your regular diet, achieving your desired level of macronutrients can be tough and expensive! Priced at $57.99 for 74 servings, one scoop containing 24g of protein comes to only $1.27 – about the same cost as a McDouble but tastier and filled with less chemicals. These 24g of proteins solely come from whey concentrates or isolates meaning better absorption for repairing your muscles after a tough workout.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE<br/><br/>If you want a product with no frills or false advertising, this is the product for you. The cookies and cream flavor is a tasty protein packed with the highest quality of protein all at an affordable price. Whether you’re new to the gym or have been pumping iron since Arnold, this is the product for you.
 Love this whey, mixes up so well. And very smooth when mixed right. I like the coffee and mocha cappuccino flavors best myself, had too much straight chocolate and vanillas. I usually make them straight up. Mixing might go better with others. Been increasing my intake, always seems to help my workouts during and sometimes in morning half this half slow digesting protein. At night switch up to the casein or another slow absorbing. Very affordable priced, yet high quality. Im not close to a pro, but a good choice to buy imo.
 Wow! Purchased the double chocolate and this is the best tasting Whey protein I've ever had. It may be because I bought it alongside a not-to-be-named competitor's egg protein which tasted like sea salt, but honestly this stuff will surprise you with how delicious it is. Great ingredients and value per scoop too. Will definitely buy again.
 I'll just say here that Rocky Road tasted fine to me. But people should be concerned less about the taste of products like this and more about their effectiveness.  It's a supplement, not a delicious pizza with your favorite toppings.  Gold Standard makes some good products and Amazon sells them for almost always the lowest prices you'll be able to find.  That's all you should need to know from these reviews.  As for whether this protein is the right kind for you, consult google.com and look up specific types of protein and which ones are most beneficial for your lifestyle and health goals.
 This review is just for the banana cream variety only. Somebody in our house used it once and suffered terribly for the next 1 to 2 days. Someone else wrote a review a day or two ago and mentioned the same problem. I'm not sure if it's a bad batch  or a funky flavor. I'm going to try to contact the manufacturer in case there's something wrong with the batch. The texture seemed a little different than the double chocolate variety I've been using. YRMV
 first off this is the best protein product you can buy. there is no competition. I have tried chocolate mint, banana creme(my old favorite) and just had my 1st taste of white chocolate which instantly made me need to review this product. Utterly delicious i dont even understand how this is a supplement. it tastes like a freaking milkshake.  5 out of 5
 This stuff makes me feel like a god
 They've definitely changed the original formula so it does not taste as good as it used to.  Otherwise it's got a great nutritional profile, low in calories including both fat and sugar.
 Optimum Nutrition (ON) is my protein powder of choice. High quality, great taste, and dissolves nicely. The coffee flavor was very good but my fall back choice is the vanilla ice cream or french vanilla -- mainly because of taste and versatility. I add 1/2 scoop to my cereal in the morning, and one scoop to my after workout banana shakes. Vanilla seems to work best - but I will say, the coffee flavor is also nice. You can't go wrong with ON.<br/><br/>Currently using ON 100% whey isolate from Costco. A little expensive for the 5lbs but dissolves very nicely - doesn't clump and tastes good.<br/><br/>Almost no fat or carbs - ON is the best when it comes to whey protein supplements! (Only other product I have used is Muscle Milk products so am not an expert on other brands.)
 This is the best tasting protein powder I have ever tried. I bought the Double Rich Chocolate flavor and put it in the fridge to cool a bit before drinking. It’s absolutely delicious. I also like that this is a protein blend and sometimes drink this before going to work. I truly believe this has made a big impact on how hungry I am after work and as a result, my ability to make wise food choices when I get home.
 Extreme Milk Chocolate is so good, its dangerous! I started working out, and ON has always been my supplement of choice ever since my brother got me into the brand about 7 years ago. I been sticking with them, and really enjoy the simplicity of their bottles, but the quality of product they make. I'm glad I swapped to extreme milk chocolate because its really good, don't hesitate.
 My wife buys this and she really likes this protein drink.  It is the only one she will buy.  It has a high protein and taste is good.
 formula changed:(  now it's gritty and leaves a gritty residue at the bottom regardless of how much you shake it up,  barely tolerable.
 I generally get this whey because it is the best bang for the buck, but the flavors are often lack luster. I have tried the Double Chocolate which was okay and I am currently trying the Vanilla Ice Cream. The taste is extremely displeasing. I will try and deal with it for the next two months, but I do not recommend this flavor.
 5 stars: I love it<br/><br/>Normally, I get tired of protein powder flavors long before I reach the bottom of the container. With the Mocha Cappuccino flavor blended with skim milk, I actually look forward to drinking my daily protein supplement; it's as good/tasty as a Yoo-hoo! Gone are the days of having to chug a shake just so you don't have to taste it!<br/><br/>Definitely purchasing again.
 So I don't typically write reviews but this product is just fantastic. I just recently picked up a different brand of Whey powder mix and comparing this to other brands is kind of a joke in my opinion.<br/><br/>It's no secret to people here that Whey protein can have a distinctive cool cup of garbage and cardboard taste, but this gold standard Whey mix has been almost unbelievable. I ordered the vanilla ice cream flavor and man, what a treat for post workout. I go the gym every other day and drink this daily and will absolutely be purchasing more flavors in the future.<br/><br/>Another really great feature about this protein mix is that stirring it is ACTUALLY EFFECTIVE! The stuff I just bought from the store (not this product) Not only has a horrible gritty texture but taste disgusting before during and after drinking it. I regret picking convenience over quality.<br/><br/>TL;DR: Amazing taste, easily blended with spoon,  an amazing smooth texture makes this one of the best protein powders on the market
 I thought cake batter was good, until I tried the coffee flavor. LAWD. I was expecting the worse, but this flavor is goat. Only downside is its 40mg of caffeine per scoop. At leaSt you can drink protein AND coffee though.
 My husband and I have been buying this brand for years. We've tried other flavors but always go back to this one. I've mixed it with regular milk, almond milk, water and egg whites...all good. It has some clumping (which I don't mind) but if you have a hand mixer, it's not an issue.
 Been using this product for the past 9 years. I'm not trying to get huge - and i'm not huge (5'11" ~160 6%), but as someone who works out hard 3-4x a week, i'm looking to add protein to my diet where i've been deficient (breakfast was my opportunity area). This product met that need.<br/><br/>I blend a scoop with 20oz of water, 0.5oz of 100% fruit juice, a frozen banana or two and ice cubes - yields about 50oz of smoothie - i drink it all and then pee like a horse. I always blend after workouts, but i blend on off days as well.<br/><br/>Even though i've been perfecting the formula over these past 9 years (initially starting with the protein stirred into skim milk - some meathead told me that i shouldn't do that - so i stopped), this protein has always tasted great. I use vanilla ice cream. I have never been dissatisfied with the quality of this product.
 This powder is great for after workouts but is kinda thick at first. You definitely need a blender or a protein shaker cup for this to work since stirring it is incredibly slow and isn’t very efficient despite what the description says.
 I've been lifting over 50+ years and using all kinds of supplements. All the latest health information confirms what I've always known since the 60's ;you lift heavy weights, your body needs additional protein to rebuild the muscles. This stuff taste good, dissolves well and gets the job done. By quality and price it's a good deal. Most others- you have to take twice as much, and they don't work as well as this stuff. I bought a two pound can to test out , and have now ordered the five pound can. Mix with water, milk or anything; and it seems to fit what I need. There is a lot of science that goes into making this stuff ; and this ON seems to have it right.
 I would like to start off by saying I'm very new in the world of supplements and bodybuilding, and this was in fact my first purchase in that domain. I'd been lifting two or three times a week for the last few years, but only recently have I started doing hard one hour workout sessions every day. Quite simply, this product has made that possible. I feel fully recovered by the next day and only three weeks in, I have noticed a visual change in my physique, less fat and more muscle. Obviously this product is not solely responsible but it has helped tremendously. It's a great product to help with muscle soreness and build muscle.<br/><br/>Taste wise it's just okay (I have thee double chocolate flavor) and produces a thin shake when made with water. It's better with milk, but since the product is meant to be taken IMMEDIATELY after a workout for best results you might only be able to do that when working out at home.
 I did not like the flavor of this protein.  I have used protein for a long long time.  This flavor is terrible
 I mistakenly ordered 5 pounds on my last order. I never really realize how much protein 5 pounds is. I feel like I'm set for a while. It feels like a huge gamble, since I based my flavor choice on 1 random review in the hundreds that exist for this protein. I picked up the rocky road. I wish I could thank whoever recommended it, because it's great. As always, this protein has been my go to for a while because it tastes good, it mixes well, and I don't feel like I'm drinking all sorts of crazy chemicals. I've tried the chocolate (also really good) and the vanilla ice cream (not my favorite but is really nice mixed with fruit).
 Dissolved quickly and easily in water but the taste.... I can barely stand to drink the stuff. It’s absolutely terrible.
 Good price, quality product.  Have tried most brands. Mixes easily, no problems digesting.  I bought this instead of Now Foods isolate.<br/>Have had 0 issues digesting it, and flavor is good.  I can drink two shakes per day with no digesting issues, mixed on-the-go with water and two tablespoons powdered milk.  No need for elaborate blender shake with this protein; can be ingested with a cup of liquid in a shaker and tastes great.<br/>There's a tiny bit of sucralose in it...oh well. I also started taking one Lactose tablet before ingesting shake and it seems to help.
 This is the only Whey product I've used.  I purchased it based on the amazon ratings and review comments.<br/><br/>It's got a great flavor and mixes well.  I usually mix mine with a banana and chocolate (yup, I'm a chocoholic, he he) soy milk.  It is creamy which is good.  It's not watery, nor like a thick shake, so I say 'creamy'.  As I said the whey mixes well, does clump or anything.  And, the flavor is good, but not perfect.  There is a slight, very slight, after taste which is just a tad bitter.  But, as I said, this is the first whey I've ever tried, so all of them may have an after taste.<br/><br/>I would buy this again.  But, may try vanilla.  I tried mixing blueberries and strawberries with the whey and regular lite milk and I could not taste the berries.  I can taste the banana with the double chocolate though, so it works for me.  I have heard about adding orange juice to it, and that it is great like that, but have yet to try it.
 The double rich chocolate powder offers a sucralose free protein powder. This is a major selling point as many competing protein powders contain sucralose, which creates a synthetic tasting flavor. The reason I rated it 4/5 stars was because the powder gave me a stomach ache the first few days of use, but after becoming used to it, this symptom has gone away.
 Double chocolate could taste better (very artificial flavor) but the purity of this whey is great for not being an isolate. There are no fillers such as maltodextrin and is low in fat and saturated fat. Carbs are low which is perfect for controlling blood sugar and I have made some very nice gains taking this product.<br/><br/>The most important thing is ON is a trusted brand and I know I am getting the protein stated on the label and do not have to worry about the amino spiking going on in the industry. I can rest assured that the extra money I am spending is warranted. You get what you pay for.
 Tried many proteins, keep  coming back to ON Gold Standard. I haven't experimented with all the different flavours but let me tell you guys what I think of the few I've personally tried. I like to keep it simple with Vanilla Ice Cream and that's my go-to flavour. Double Rich Choc's pretty good, and so is the Mint Choc and Extreme Milk Choc. Please don't buy the Rocky Road based off that other review, biggest mistake!!! Tastes like fake sugar and has a god awful aftertaste. Salted Caramel tastes pretty good, but it has a bit of that weird aftertaste too but it's nowhere as bad the Rocky Road.
 The taste is good but not great, but this is a great protein product. I kept reading on different sites that this was the most highly recommended protein and I can now see why. It is a very high quality protein. I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a protein supplement. I have used several different protein supplements over the years and this is the best one. I even like it better than Pro Nos by MRI which up and tell now had been my favorite.
 I abide by Optimum Nutrition's Gold Standard whey protein and have been using the product for years. The taste is great, it blends well and quick with water or milk, and have gotten the best results in terms of strength and mass from taking it. Unfortunately, I am give this review 4 stars due to a defect with the packaging. It looks like the item was tossed around within the box and a corner of the package ripped open, spilling about 3-4 scoops worth of powder. I ended up having to transfer the entirety of the contents into jars that luckily have not been thrown out yet. Most likely was a defect in the original packing, but the box itself probably should have been handled better by OnTrac.
 I'm super picky about how my protein powder tastes and oh my goodness this is so good!!! I'm able to mix it with milk and it literally tastes like chocolate milk. I love how the calorie to protein ratio is so low- I'm officially switching to this brand from now on.
 I took this protein powder while I was doing the Insanity DVD set. If you have ever done Insanity you know how sore and tired it makes you, this stuff was a godsend. It has the perfect blend of everything you could want. I had the energy, the fuel for my muscles, and the perfect post workout effects to reduce all the pain and soreness. This is the only protein powder I have actually stuck with and not just let sit around in my cupboard. I bought the Double Rich Chocolate and it tasted amazing! Mind you I used water mostly, so that's saying something. Plus for the size this stuff is so damn cheap! It's practically a steal, go to GNC and see what they price their "quality" products and you'll spend nearly $100. Optimum Nutrition is just hands down a quality product.
 I bought the double rich chocolate and it surprisingly was very delicious and easy to drink. It doesn't completely dissolve but that isn't a big problem in my opinion so it still gets five stars. This is now my go to protein powder.
 I first tried this in the 2 pound version from GNC. I really liked the chocolate malt flavor so when that ran out I decided to buy the 5 pound container. This one mixes much better than my previous container. My only complaint was that it was very frothy. Next time I will shake less vigorously and hopefully it won’t be so frothy.
 By far my favorite protein powder. It mixes easily with a spoon or a shaker (I use a shaker primarily). The taste is great with just water, but is better for most people when mixed with some type of milk or milk substitute (I use a single scoop with water only).<br/><br/>I prefer the Double Rich Chocolate, but I ordered the Delicious Strawberry most recently and it was pretty good as well. I probably wouldn't buy it again in such a large quantity because unlike the chocolate flavor, this one isn't really enjoyable for long-term (daily) use.
 I used to love this! My favourite flavor was "vanila Ice Cream", and I have been consuming it for many years.<br/>But recently, Optimum nutrition changed the flavour... I don't know what they did, but now it is way too sweet.<br/>I wish they did not have changed that... too bad...<br/>I will have to start searching for a new flavour.
 Flavoring needs a lot of work.  I hope this way protein has amazing nutritional value because I have to force myself to finish the glass. I purchased the double rich chocolate in a 5 pound container. Big mistake. My suggestion if you are going to try this to see if it suits your pallet try a small container first. After I finish this 5 pounds I’ll switch back to what I used to use.
 This is the best protein on the market. Doesn't clump, doesn't get thick, and almost every flavor available is fantastic. I usually alternate between buying it on Amazon or bodybuilding.com based on who has the better price. This protein is even good to cook with. Would highly recommend to anyone wanting protein.
 I have been purchasing this product for almost two years. I do exercises five days a week. I take my Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard three times a day. Mid morning, afternoon and at night. It all depends on your goals, but for my goals it is just perfect. This may not be the kind of product that is gonna make you look huge on a couple of months, but it does help to mantain your muscle structure and if you are working out with diets fat free, snacks, junk food and stuff like that, this product will surely do is to calm the anxiety for eating at any given time. And it will give you the right nutrition. I highly recommended if you already have been working out for a while and have the type of fit and muscular body.
 Great taste. Too bad they're now shipping their products in the same 5 lb tub, but only putting 4.8 lbs of material in there. Shame on you, Optimum Nutrition, for such a sneaky way to implement a price increase! Didn't you learn any moral lessons from the McCormick spice Supreme Court case about slyly using the same sized container with less product in it? After 15 years of using your product, I'll find another company to whom I'll give my future business.
 VALUE: At the time of my purchase in early 2013 this was one of the best dollars-to-pounds ratios of whey protein out there. For $100USD you get ten pounds of whey. Ten pounds of most other whey products would cost $150 to well over $200 (I'm looking at YOU Jay Robb Enterprises). Even my other favorite whey protein, <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Biochem-s-Ultimate-Protein-System/dp/B0009DVNCC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Biochem's Ultimate Protein System</a>, had to be ditched for the value that Optimum Nutrition's ginormous ten pound bag of Gold Standard Whey provides.<br/><br/>FLAVOR: Double Rich Chocolate - Awesome taste, not medicinal, metallic, lingering, or otherwise yucky. It's one of the only protein powders I've had that I can mix with spring water and not gag on, or be forced to chug. If you're a skim milk kind of person, it's going to taste so good that you think it's your cheat day. If you use 1% milk, well, that kinda IS a cheat day, and it tastes like a milk shake.<br/><br/>CONSISTENCY: It mixes well in milk and water. I have a <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/blender-ball/dp/B001KADGMI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">blender ball</a> container and it merely takes a few swishes to get about 95% of the powder mixed. However, keep in mind that this *IS* whey we're talking about. Whey is sticky and clumpy no matter what. If you mix it just before drinking it, you'll have some gobs to deal with. If you mix it, let it sit for an hour, then mix it gain, it'll be smooth. This protein also works well with other micronized supplements. I regularly mix creatine and glutamine into it and they all play nicely together.<br/><br/>TEXTURE: It's silky and not grainy or mealy. I mix one heaping scoop per one cup of water. It will collect on the bottom of your container, even after just ten minutes. Expect to twirl the drink around a bit before drinking it if you sip on it between workout sets. My daily routine is to mix four scoops in four cups of water. I have one cup in the morning, two cups during my weight lifting, and one cup at night. I always have to swirl it a bit, but It's always smooth.<br/><br/>NUTRIENTS: Each scoop has 24 grams of protein and 120 calories. That's pretty lean; the leanest possible calorie amount for that many grams of protein being 96. Ten calories are from one gram of fat. I've read that this makes it 81% protein by weight per serving. There's only three grams of total carbs. There are four grams of glutamine and glutamine precursors for muscle repair, so factor that in if you supplement with extra glutamine. There are also 5 grams of BCAAs in the form of Leucine, Isoleucin, and Valine. It uses sugar alcohol based sweetener to reduce calories, so beware if that's something you're against and pass on this for something with stevia instead.<br/><br/>PERFORMANCE: I've been using four scoops of Double Rich Chocolate each workout day, five to six days a week. I have seen big gains. It's hard to pinpoint where the gains are coming from exactly; the different workout regimen, supplements like creatine, a larger and more protein packed diet, or some other combination. I think each thing has its own effect, and this protein plays a large part<br/><br/>MISC: Can be used as chock blocks for single engine aircraft. Excellent ballast in the trunk of your car in icy or muddy conditions. Don't show up on rally day without it. Includes home defense possibilities, assuming you can heave it far enough at an attacker. Also good for squats and deadlifts when you can't find your barbell.<br/><br/>CONS: All of the above are the pros. The only cons I can see are the calories and the artificial sweeteners. It's not the barest bones protein you can find, if that's what you're looking for. The sweetener thing might rustle some people's jimmies, but most folks will be fine with it. For what it is, I don't think you can find any better testing, lower calorie whey protein on the market.
 I've been through one canister now and I like the results. I originally started this workout plan to lose some weight. I lift two days a week and do hard cardio two days a week, every week. I have been at it for 5 months now, and I haven't lost a pound, in fact, I've gained about 8 pounds. But thanks to ON I know it's all muscle. I weigh more but my waist is smaller - I can tell by the way my pants fit. My arms, shoulders, and even my legs look lean and muscular, but my little belly is still there. Part of it is body type I guess. I'll keep at it as long as I can. I have one shake with milk in the morning for breakfast and one immediately after my workout, which usually ends up being around noon. Once I started using ON I noticed I was less sore after lifting days. I also feel good about myself because I know I'm only putting the best stuff in my body. Overall I'm very pleased, but I wish it would help me get rid of my little belly.<br/><br/>And oh yeah, it tastes great blah blah blah. Mixes well yada yada yada. Frankly, I don't care about this stuff, as long as I get results.
 I got the Key Lime Pie and it's on point in flavor even if I mix it with matcha. Only complaint I have is that I wish they offered all flavors in all sizes. Think the two pound covers almost all flavors, but I really want to be able to have multiple flavors just sit on my counter without taking up half of it. Seriously, if they offered build your own variety packs I would jump on that deal so fast. As for those who keep saying the container is only half full, different flavors will vary in weight slightly. They have the standard large container to fit all powders since you are buying by WEIGHT not by package. Some flavors will be denser (like chocolate) than others causing the half full bottle. They also need there to be some room in the bottle for sifting since it is a powder much like flour.
 Protein is fine. However, it did not come with a scooper. I read online that the scooper could be buried inside of the protein. So, I slowly emptied out my entire tub into several ziplock bags and found no scooper. Such a painstaking waste of my time! Now I have no way of measuring the amount of protein I am eating, which defeats the whole point of the product.
 I really like the strawberry banana, those are my two favorite flavors of anything. I've tried the banana creme and although it did have a slight hint of banana, it tasted like very diluted banana syrup, meaning it doesn't have a strong banana taste, just a hint of it. This one tastes more strongly of strawberry though I haven't tried the delicious strawberry so i can't compare.
 I've always been a skinny guy. Eat whatever I want and gain nothing, never had a huge appetite. I've been around 130'ish since high school. 4 months ago I decided to start lifting and came to find out I needed 3000+ calories and high protein for it to be worth my time. Counting calories in the right food to get the number I need is very difficult.  I just can't eat THAT much.<br/> Gold Standard Whey has been great. I keep my diet on point and I've gained 25lbs and just about 3 inches in my biceps.
 Long time ago I ordered one of their products for about $50 dollars. The order came to our apartment office, but I completely forgot about it. It got sent back, but no refund at all.<br/><br/>Sorry, the double chocolate taste great. I make one every day. Add blue, straw, and black berry. Some milk and cinnamon powder. Dont forget peanut butter.
 The flavor on this whey is one of their best flavors. Accidently bought another flavor that wasn't as good. WIsh they didn't have so many darn options for chocolate. Now I'm stuck with a huge container of the not as great flavor.<br/><br/>But as for this one we loved it. My and my husband both used it until it was gone. I even used this in a few baking and non smoothie dishes. Would buy THIS ONE again.. and not the other chocolate flavors.
 I've been using ON whey powder for close to 10 years - and I will continue to use it due to its combination of taste, recovery enhancement, and price. Every few months, there is a new craze or supplement which EVERYONE is trying - and I will give it a trial run, but it doesn't come close to this powder in terms of potency, convenience, or price. A lot of the new stuff is coming in pre-packaged little bottles: this is expensive. Most importantly, non-powdered stuff makes it difficult to customize the concentration of protein to each day in your workout. Last, while not super important to me, the taste is actually pretty good for a supplement.
 I wouldn't purchase cookies and cream again. Flavor is 2/10. MTS whey cookies and cream has  a much richer flavor and ON pales in comparison.
 I've been using it for a week and can see a difference in my eating/performance patterns already. I am not trying to bulk up, quiet the contrary. I take it as a post workout shake and skip dinner. I do not feel hungry and helps me control the midnight cravings. Plus it is so tasty that on weekends I make breakfast shakes with it.
 My husband and I have used this protein for over a year now and continue to by this brand not only for it's cost but for the taste. It tastes great! The ingredients are really good and it doesn't have the bad fillers that you find in other protein powders. We normally mix this protein with water but when you mix it with Almond milk it almost tastes like a chocolate shake. We also have used this powder to make brownie recipes and protein cookies. Overall it's a great product that we will continue to buy!
 I trust the quality of ON but do wish this flavor was tested for PEDs like most of their other whey products. As for the taste. I did enjoy the taste, the coffee is not too strong. ON is the cheapest whey supplier  so good on them for making it reliable and cheap.
 I have been using ON Gold Standard for a while now - it mixes well, tastes good (not as great as others but it's also a better product than the tastier ones so I am OK with that) and it's a good value. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to supplement their protein without breaking the bank.<br/><br/>The 'Extreme Milk Chocolate' is my favorite of the flavors, but others are pretty good as well. I shy away from the fruit based flavors though, I have never found them to be as good as chocolates and vanillas.
 I bought this online after I bought a smaller one from Trader Joe’s . I read the reviews and some said it is watery . Guys indeed it is comparing to the one I bought from Trader Joe’s . Funny thing is when I compare it is the same exact product just larger size . Of course it is cheaper to buy here but idk ... definitely watery
 My husband and I both have tried the vanilla casein from Gold Standard, which is also amazing. But this is the best tasting whey protein I've had so far. The chocolate is great and when mixed with some almond milk or regular milk, it tastes like chocolate milk. You can also add a scoop of the vanilla and make it more of a milk chocolate flavor, throw in some PB2 for extra flavor and protein, and you have basically a chocolate peanut butter milkshake.
 Tastes great but mine didn't come the the scoop which makes it awkward for getting the correct portion. I would think they could put one in the container for what they charge for a 5lb portion.
 I'm a diehard ON buyer, it's the only protein powder I'll buy now, but this flavor is just terrible. I've never had this problem with them before so I don't know if I got a bad batch or what. It tastes like a lot of fake malt flavoring has been added in to the mix and leaves an absolutely horrible aftertaste. I'll still be buying ON (their mint chocolate is phenomenal), but I won't be buying this flavor again.
 Excellent product.  Rocky Road takes great with no after taste, even mixed with water.  No clumping up.  Drink it with almond milk, and or honey flavored almond milk.  Tastes fantastic.  Have felt extra energy and some growth in size and strength.  If you have never tried whey, or even tried other brands, try Gold Standard.  This stuff actually works.
 I had an 8lb bag of this for some time that I liked. The taste was strong in a good way. This one seems watered down! Not sure why, everyone says they changed their formula so maybe that's why? Idk but not as tasty as it was. This is the only flavor without sucralose so I am stuck with it.
 For the money, the very best one out there. You can pay twice as much as not find a better tasting, mixing protein powder. And it's not packed with a bunch of who knows what. 3 carbs, 25 grams of protein, and it is a 1 scooper. Great stuff.
 Amazon did not allow my initial review .. stay away from strawberry flavor ..
 I have purchased this product over 10 times.  In that time, I have put on plenty of lean muscle and dropped over 65 pounds.  This product is highly recommended.  My wife, 70 year old father, and I all use it to great effect.  In a world of confusing sports supplements and costly scams, it is awesome to find something that really works.
 First of all... I'm not a juice-head (nothing against those guys... I have friends like that... so please don't beat me up), I'm an average middle aged guy who is exercising more (cardio, some weights and I play ice hockey 1-2 times per week) and watch what I eat.  I'm trying fix what sitting on my butt at a desk for the last 15+ years has done to me.<br/><br/>So far I've lost 60 pounds over the last 18 months, slowly but surely &lt;applause break&gt;.  Did you guys know eating half a pizza isn't good for you and having two bagels on "Bagel Friday" isn't such a hot idea either?  Who knew?<br/><br/>So... I've added this to my workouts.  I have a scoop with a cup of low sugar vanilla almond milk within a half-hour of either working out or playing hockey and I've noticed a huge improvement in not being sore as hell the next day... that alone makes this worth it for me.  It makes it a ton easier to go exercise the next day, which is good.<br/><br/>I work out or play hockey in the late evenings after work, so having this when I get home fills me up so I don't go around the kitchen "grazing" on junk before I go to bed.<br/><br/>I've also looked at the label to see what's "in it" and the bulk of it is the protein.  There is lots of junk out there where less than half is protein and the rest is filler.  Plus I could ACTUALLY pronounce the other ingredients. That and so many good reviews of this product encouraged me to give it a shot.<br/><br/>Make sure you think out where this container is going to go... it's big.  The first couple of times I used a spotter to make sure I didn't fall in... I'd hate to read about any of you have some "Baby Jessica in the well" incidents with this...  I just dated myself didn't I?<br/><br/>So... I think you should give this a try.. also did I mention it tastes great too?  I love this stuff!  Do it.
 Excellent as advertised. Easy to make. Gives me energy and fills me up. Fulfills by cravings for ice cream and milk shakes. I usually mix with frozen fresh fruit (bananas and berries), a bit of soy milk, and water. I have for breakfast usually.
 This is a great product, and it comes at a fair price.  My problem with it is that the scoop almost never gets a full serving in it.  By this I mean that I can pack the scoop then weigh the powder that I was able to get into it and not reach the 31.5 gram serving size.  It is usually at least 5 grams short.  This can easily be fixed with a scale, but it is an oversight that hurts those people who don't own one.
 So tasty, my favorite is the Rocky Road which I tried because many people suggested it. I also love the chocolate and the mocha cappuccino. I use this daily as a meal replacement or after workout shake and only add water. I have used it in smoothies and even made pancakes out of it, but really it is just delicious by itself. If you aren't used to eating whey, it might make you a little gassy but a probiotic will do the trick for that. This is by far the best tasting, most affordable, and most effective whey.
 First time tasting banana, but my ultimate favorite flavors are anything w/ chocolate. Banana is great, I add chia, flax, banana, ice and raw cacao nibs and it's delicious.  I like my shakes a bit thicker, so it depends on how I'm feeling. The banana is a great flavor &amp; ties everything together.  If in a hurry a little water &amp; shaker action works great too. You definitely can't go wrong with the old faithful Gold Standard.  This protein is on the "lighter/non-thick or heavy" shake.  If you are looking for thicker and something that will fill ur shaker to too I suggest Metabolic Nutrition protein.  All great flavors. I have peanut butter cookie to vary through the week.  I won't ever stop using gold standard, the protein to go to.
 I’ve used ON and this flavor many times in the past. I’ve always purchased from Costco, but this seemed too good to pass us. However, I think this taste very watered down. I tried mixing with less watery than normal (4-6 ounces), but still is very watery. Anyone else have the same opinion? Not sure why this is.
 This is the first protein I've actually enjoyed (not hated) drinking. I bought the 1 lb bag to try the flavor (double rich chocolate) before committing to a large size. This always mixes without any clumps, is never grainy and doesn't have an overwhelming taste. I just bought a 5 lb tub, so I'm a fan!
 I got the double rich chocolate and it tastes like chocolate milk. I'll probably start mixing it with water so I don't have to worry about keeping it cold. Dissolves really well, never any clumps.
 The rocky road flavor is great.  I read several reviews stating this and it's the truth.  This protein mixes better than any other I've purchased before, no clumps at all.  This whey tastes as good mixed with water vs some of the other brands/flavors mixed with milk which was a huge surprise to me.  This is all I use now.  No need to purchase a bottle of BCAA'S like I did because one serving of this contains almost double the amount of taking a days worth of BCAA'S in pill form, plenty to digest the protein.
 These other people are crazy. This stuff is great. I just mix with water. Tastes great, no aftertaste that is better or too sweet. For those that say don't buy, they want it to taste like ice cream or not like they are putting POWDER in a drink to mix. Get with it people. Buy it.
 This protein powder is by far the best tasting i've tried.  After having a few different flavors from Optimum Nutrition and other companies the Double Rich Chocolate is my favorite.  I've even used it with just water instead of milk a few times and it kind of tastes like watery Yoo-hoo but in a pinch its nice to know i can fall back on water.  I highly recommend it to anyone looking to get into protein powder.  I've noticed quite a few changes to my body too since adding to my diet and exercise routine.  The consistency is great too, I started using a blender but moved on to a blender bottle with a shaker ball and it is still awesome.
 I tried many different brands and flavors before I found this one. I have drinking this as a meal replacement for over two years now and I love it. I have myself convinced it tastes just like chocolate milk. I had weight loss surgery almost two years ago and Optimum Nutrition Double Rich Chocolate is a part of every day meal planning for me. It gives me all the protein I need to keep me healthy and I think it tastes good too. My son in college now drinks it as well when he misses a meal or as a late night snack.
 I will say that I am not an expert, nor am I the type of person who works out enough notice subtleties in the protein. What I can say is Gold Standard whey has worked for me. Also, in comparison to other proteins' ingredients, this one is one of the best. Finally, it tastes great. You don't feel like you're having a chalk milkshake. It actually tastes good!<br/><br/>My Flavor Rankings:<br/><br/>Delicious<br/>1t. Vanilla Ice Cream<br/>1t. French Vanilla Creme<br/>3. Chocolate Mint<br/><br/>Ok<br/>4. Caramel Toffee Fudge<br/><br/>Yuck<br/>5. Cookies &amp; Cream<br/><br/>I will update as I've tried more flavors
 Take this protein after your workouts. Mix it with a little bit of creatine, &amp; it will do wonders.<br/><br/>This past year, I've been using the ON Double Rich Chocolate protein, and I have to say that I like it. The taste isn't bad, actually close to good. I always mix it into a protein shake. 1 scoop of this, 1 banana, 1 tbs chia seed, 1 tbs organic peanut butter, 3 ice cubes, 4 frozen strawberries &amp; organic milk = you have a match made in heaven. You can always mess around with the ingredients, like putting flax seeds, coconut shavings, blueberries, dates, almonds, fine-ground coffee, or a myriad of other things in there.<br/><br/>Enjoy!
 I've used Optimum Nutrition whey for a about 5 years now.  I really love how easy it mixes compared to most powdered protein.  It leaves no lumps and is not grainy.  I originally got it for my husband who was on dialysis and so had to have very high amounts of protein but needed one that didn't have certain minerals, supplements, etc. - this was the only one I could find that was just the whey protein so it is wonderful for anyone on dialysis. It can be hard to find at times so was really excited that Amazon is carrying it and at a price that is better than nutrition stores.
 Some protein companies use amino spiking in their products. While it is true that amino acids make up proteins, there are some fairly useless amino acids out there, or very cheap incomplete amino acids. Some protein powders use creatine in them, which is fine but creatine is made up of amino acids that are very cheap (some companies will list the amino acids that make up creatine and count that as total protein count). This is wrong and immoral and the FDA is investigating certain companies. When you are buying whey protein you want a full complete 25 grams of whey protein, not 15g of whey and then cheap amino acids dumped in. Most of these cheap amino acids are from dead animal parts, hair and etc. If you dont believe me google amino spinking. OP DOES NOT AMINO SPIKE! I love this company, they are moral and with top quality products. The Chocolate protein powders taste really good compared to other protein powders. I like their BCAAs and L-GLutamine also!
 Great tasting product at a great price. I have not tried all the favors so far, however then extreme milk chocolate is pretty good. Cookies and cream was a little disappointing -but maybe it just takes some getting used to.<br/><br/>I do wish the product came in smaller options to try out certain flavored before committing to multiple pounds of something when you're not sure if you're going to enjoy it.
 Cookies &amp; Cream is by far the best flavor protein powder I've ever had. I used it with just cold water in shaker bottle, I'm very impressed.  I will update if it gives me the bubble guts.<br/><br/>Update: Doesn’t give me the bubble guts. Taste great, doesn’t make me gag. And mixes well.
 I will warn you it has a lot of fake sweetness taste to it, but if you don't mind that, it's great. I like Cake Batter flavor because its good for making protein pancakes or adding to other healthy baked recipes like muffins. I also put it in my oatmeal. I've even mixed it with peanut butter and it creates this sweet kind of creamy peanut taste that's yummy on cinnamon raisin Ezekial bread.
 Im not a fitness junkie or a scientist, but I can tell you just by comparing labels that this is a better product if you're not trying to intake as many calories or fat compared to the other "popular" brands out there. Like everyone else and their mamas on Amazon have already pointed out, this is the best stuff, but comes at a cost; a cost that seems to be ever rising. But come on people, its the difference of only a few cents per serving. I would and will be buying this again. 3rd container, Double Rich Chocolate is my favorite. GAAAINNNNSSSSSS hahahaa sorry.
 This whey protein tastes AMAZING mixed in just water. That, for me, is very important. Most are chalky or stay chunky despite using a shaker bottle, but this blends up cleanly and leaves no unflattering aftertaste. I can't recommend this enough. I am a fitness instructor and teach on average 12 classes a week, with half being weight lifting. So this is a very important purchase for me. A scoop and a half and you have as much protein as a chicken breast. Boom.
 Used to love banana flavored premier protein shakes but our grocery store stopped selling it. Ordered banana cream flavor from this company  but i dont like it at all. Way artificial flavored and added more powder but its still really clear and not anywhere as thick as premier protein
 I love this brand, I couldn’t find another protein powder which is not too sweet. I always buy this in double rich chocolate flavor and it’s really a dark chocolate flavor, not sweet at all. I like the ingredients too.
 Just got. Put one scoop in a glass of milk and darn it almost tastes exactly like Chocolate Milk. Love it!! I only wish it had the same additional supplemental vitamins as their Protein Energy line.  I have their Protein Energy Cinnamon Roll and love it too. I put it in my coffee and oatmeal.
 Just got it today. Giving 4 stars for now based on cost per serving (80 cents per serving) and taste (i got chocolate coconut and mixed with almond milk and it tastes like a frickin almond joy, so good!). But I would suggest the company find a way to secure the scoop to the lid of the container because I had to dig to the bottom of a 5lb container with a spoon to find the scoop. I am also 100% not a fan of artificial sweeteners and try to avoid them as much as possible so I am a little disappointed that this contains artificial sweetener.
 I have been using Dymatize ISO-100 for quite some time now and got tired of the taste along with the bad breath and gas it gave me. I haven't really noticed any significant gains with the ISO so I decided to give ON a try and boy I am sure glad I did. After two weeks of regular training I noticed significant increase in muscle mass to the point where my wife started to use it to complement her weight training. I started out mixing it with water but have since switched to unflavored/unsweetened almond milk. It mixes great with no clumping and the taste is so much better compared to the ISO and best of all no more bad breath.
 I'm sure that the OTHER flavors are delicious as people say but do yourself a favor and DO NOT BUY THE VANILLA ICE CREAM FLAVOR. It honestly tastes like garbage.
 Nothing to complain about here. I have stayed loyal to optimum nutrition products because they are what I started on after doing some research and they haven't led me astray once....well minus the soy protein I got on groupon once. But I think that's just because soy protein is disgusting in general....but that's a side story. Love love love the cookies and cream flavor, but it's more like chocolate chip cookie dough flavor than Oreo, which is what I expected when I ordered it the first time.
 Sure if I had tons of money I would diversify my proteins a little more.  With that being said, I truly do not believe that you will be disappointed in this product if you use it in accordance with a proper exercise program and diet.  All their products taste great, do not give you gas, and mix quickly.<br/><br/>I chose The Vitamin Shoppe as my vendor because "Bodybuilding.com"  wants to charge $18 for shipping to an APO address and The Vitamin Shoppe did it for $5.  I use to think that Bodybuilding.com had the fastest shipping, but The Vitamin Shoppe got me my protein to Misawa, Japan in less than 6 days!!!!!  That is record time.  They shipped the order the very next morning.<br/><br/>Thanks again Vitamin Shoppe!!!!!
 Purchased for a picky toddler who refuses to eat meat. We add this to his morning milk and he guzzles it down. It's the only way we really can ensure he gets protein through out the day! I love the fact that it's low in sugar and carbs and is really just giving him the good stuff!
 So far so good, I tried to taste it dry just to see if I can taste the chocolate flavor, its very bland but when mixed with water you taste the chocolatey flavor and its so delicious. I would have this pre workout and after. or whenever I'm craving for some real food.
 This one is fake for sure. Its kinda flavored  wheat flour.
 This is one of the best tasting proteins available for its price. The macro-nutrients are very good as well in order to ensure to reach your proper nutritional goals. These are 120 calories, 1g fat, 3g of carbs and 24g of protein. I have tried the Cookies and Cream as well as the Extreme Milk Chocolate flavors. Both of which I highly recommend. If you have not tried Gold Standard Whey before or if you have had a bad experience with the taste of other protein supplements out there, I recommend that you give this line of products a try.
 I pretty much love this Whey in my stack. I take it before and after my workout days along with Casein that I also take before bed time. I have seen a dramatic difference in my body when I coupled this with clean eating, fat burning supplement and exercising for 1 hour / 7 days a week. This is the best tasting protein I've ever tried and it mixes very well with milk (full fat / low fat) and water. I also use it for making tasty pancakes and muffins. My best buy along with ON Casein and Hydro.
 This is the best tasting vanilla protein powder I've found - we are big fans of the Optimum Nutrition brand in this house and have multiple flavors. I use this particular one for shakes and even for a few different protein treat recipes.
 Excellent product, I recover much quicker and have noticed some decent gains in the past month of this products usage.  The flavor I chose, extreme milk chocolate, is amazing.  The flavor is not too strong but still masks the protein taste that artificial flavoring is supposed to do.  An added bonus is that it has BCAAs and Glutamine included in the formula so you do not need to have multiple supplements like I used to have.<br/><br/>--Would recommend to a friend
 Can’t really say much.. but this is the best protein, i have tried to change it for a while and get something else a bit cheaper .. couldn’t handle it and returned the other one and got back into gold standard.. it is just the best
 Probably one of the best tasting flavors available from ON. I like to mix mine with a banana + peanut butter. Only disappointment is Costco sells it at a cheaper price and will no longer be buying this protein via Amazon
 It's a good product, I have been using this brand for over 10 years. They have always been my go to when I'm in the mood to augment my muscle mass quickly and efficiently. I highly recommend this particular flavor if you enjoy the taste of coffee, at times the taste can be a bit faint. Try not to dilute it too much if you want a stronger flavor.
 It's called the gold standard for a reason. Great quality protein without having to worry about amino spiking. The flavor is decent but I may go with the double chocolate next time just because I love chocolate! I usually mix it in with a cup of coffee and splash of creamer and syrup which is great.. you can have it with water if you're cutting or make a mass gainer shake.
 The Double Rich Chocolate tastes like pure cocoa powder.  We had the extreme milk chocolate before, which we felt tasted rather weak so we decided to try something that would probably be stronger.  However, this is a very strong pure cocoa powder taste.  It is rather bitter and not very sweet.  My husband is okay with it since he doesn't drink it for the taste, but I like to make shakes and tasty stuff out of them and this one isn't doing it for me.  If you don't like super sweet shakes then this one is for you!  I had the Cookies and Cream before and felt it was a little too sweet, but I would much rather have that flavor than the Double Rich Chocolate.<br/><br/>Pros-Fast delivery<br/>Packing was great<br/><br/>Cons-Flavor was not as expected (bitter, not sweet)
 I am so disappointed with this protein mix. It hardly has any chocolate flavor at all. Let’s face it, if it doesn’t taste good, you aren’t likely to continue using it. I will finish the packet, but won’t reorder.
 I just got the powder after ordering it yesterday. Thanks Prime! Anyway. I was hesitant on trying Extreme Milk Chocolate because of always hated chocolate flavored stuff than actual milk chocolate bars. I stuck to vanilla everything. Bit I have to say, this is the best tasting protein I've ever had. It's just like chocolate milk!!! I mix 8oz water with 4oz lactaid (you can use plain milk) and bam. I'm afraid I might drink more than I should.
 Taste is excellent<br/>Results are excellent.  take after work out and just before you go to bed unless you want caesin won't give you the post work out pain coz has some BCCAs. 1 to 1.5g/kg protein requirement so 2 servings at 24g each gets u to almost half your daily needs. Low carb content.<br/>Money value just right
 SIMPLY LOVE IT!  GREAT PROTEIN.  GREAT TASTE.  GREAT PRICE.  I WOULD GIVE IT 7 STARS IF I COULD.<br/><br/>I had about 3 migraines a week for 10 years.  Praise the Lord I finally discovered that dairy products were the chief triggers, but I never made the connection because the symptoms always occurred a day later.  I've tried every milk substitute under the sun and every one of them triggered migraines as well, and I had given up ever eating cereal again, let alone weight training protein supplements (yes, eggs were a problem too).  However, I can drink the 100% Whey with no side-effects whatsoever.  I use it as both a milk substitute and a weight training supplement (3-4 servings a day).  The 5 pound canister at a great price makes it affordable too.  I don't have enough stars to rate it.
 ON 100% Whey Protein is the first protein I ever purchased when I was getting into weightlifting in college. I have since tried a variety of other brands such as Cellucor and MyProtein and just made the switch back to ON and I am so glad I did! It has really proven to have the best tasting protein I've had in a long time, especially the Extreme Milk Chocolate. I feel like I am having a chocolate shake every morning after my workout, it's all I look forward to now. Will definitely be sticking to ON Protein for a long time, I can never get tired of this delicious flavor.
 This is a tasty protein powder that's always done me well, a drink before and after even the most intense workout has a very noticeable and greatly appreciated effect on muscle soreness the day after. It can be the difference between not being able to walk down stairs without fear of falling and being able to skip down them.<br/><br/>It's by far the least objectionable powder I've ever consumed, the micronization really helps with that unpleasant graininess that you'll almost always find in your protein shakes, and it ends up legitimately tasting like a chocolate shake unlike any powder I've tried before!<br/><br/>I purchased the ten pound bag, and the Ziploc-style seal on the bag is surprisingly strong, I had it stored in the attic at one point and found it buried under a great deal of stuff, and pulled it all off positive that it would be spilled everywhere, but thankfully it held!<br/><br/>My one issue, and the reason I'm taking off a star, is that with a bag this big, that initial search for the scoop is exponentially magnified. I had to spend a half hour, literally, just searching for the thing! It would be much, much better if it was attached to the inside of the bag, close to where you're opening it, and I would recommend being ready with big cooking spoons or something to dig around, as I wish I had thought of before shaking it around endlessly.<br/><br/>Overall though, this is the best tasting protein powder, and I doubt I'll be switching from this standby any time soon.
 This is everything you could want in a whey protein powder; great tasting, mixes easily, and provides a clean low carb/calorie protein supply to recovering muscles.  I purchased the Rocky Road flavor and the taste is incredible, I'm over halfway through the five pounder drinking at least one shake a day and I don't think I will ever get tired of the flavor.  If you are on the fence about what protein to get then you should definitely give optimum a try and I don't see anyway you will be disappointed.
 After trying several protein shake supplements, I was often disappointed in both the taste and texture of most brands. Optimum Nutrition protein powder tastes great, easily mixes with liquid, and leaves no strange after taste. The milk chocolate is delicious, but the cake batter was a little too sweet for me, especially first thing in the morning. I drink one of these shakes every morning after my workouts, and it almost seems like a treat!
 tastes awesome
 I read a lot of the reviews before purchasing and it seemed like the Double Rich Chocolate flavor had a lot of great reviews on the taste. Never having tasted it before, I was weary of buying the 5 pounds but I figured if it sucked I'd just suck it up like I have with the rest of the protein powders I've bought. Well, I'm glad I listened to the reviews! I haven't tasted any other ON protein powders, but the Double Rich Chocolate is the best tasting powder I've tried. Most protein powders don't mix well and have the "crystals" floating at the top or just taste terrible. I used to add a little milk to others because only water would make them unbearable. This one tastes great with a mix of milk and water or just water. I was very surprised that it tastes the same when mixed with only water. It tastes like cold, hot chocolate. I'll definitely be buying this one again
 I have been a fan of this protein for some years now.  I took a leap to try a new flavor.  I very surprised on the taste of the coffee flavor! It really does taste like coffee!  There is a hint of coffee bitterness and creamer.  Mix it up with some crushed ice and this stuff is awesome!<br/><br/>I have always been a coffee lover so the thought of buying this sounded disgusting.  So like i said, it was a leap.  Good job O.N.
 The nutrition of this product is equivalent to a lot of proteins, nothing too spectacular. I was thankful that the serving size is only one scoop, I think we all dislike it when the protein manufacturers say a product has X amount of protein, but that's because they measure it by two or three scoops. Anyhow, I strongly disliked the taste of this powder, I definitely recommend mixing it with peanut butter or something else to peel back a bit of the off taste. I had just come off the Pro Whey Vanilla, and it tasted four times better, at roughly the same price with half the cholesterol. This protein is just OK, I recommend getting a different flavor, if that's a usual hangup when you consider proteins.
 I have been using this whey for almost 2 years,<br/>For me is the best product. I also took 3 times a day.<br/>This helped me a lot to win muscles.<br/>I recommend this produto, is really good<br/>and vanilla ice cream flavor is the best .<br/>Eu tenho usado esse whey por quase 2 anos<br/>para mim e o melhor do Mercado,<br/>me ajuda muito a ganhar massa e o sabor de vanilla ice cream e o melhor.<br/>obrigado.
 There are  only a few things that separates one protein supplement from another. Price and taste.  This product is priced right, not so good in the taste department. I have plenty of it so I am sure I will get used to it. I will buy it again as it is economical. The chocolate was priced right, but I'd like to try the vanilla . Hopefully they will offer it at a lower price. Good chocolate is great, bad chocolate is bad chocolate . Bad vanilla is easier to choke down than bad chocolate.  I am tough. I can handle it. Weight lifting and conditioning isn't for cry babies.
 I'm lactose intolerant and I've tried alot different whey proteins that said would work for me, but all came up short and upset my stomach. This actually never upsets or even hurts my stomach and I use it before and after my workouts. Don't buy cookies &amp; cream tho not the greatest taste, but nonetheless this is a great product! I recommend this especially if you're lactose intolerant like me.
 This has become my favorite protein.<br/><br/>The quality of the stuff is absolutely through the roof. I've bought multiple tubs at this point, and every one is just as good as the last. The results speak for themselves - you know you're getting a quality product made with the best ingredients.<br/><br/>The flavors are just as good as the quality. Vanilla Ice Cream is my favorite, from both a taste and versatility standpoint - I love to mix it with fruit, or peanut butter in a NutriBullet. It's also great on it's own. I've also come to love the Rocky Road flavor, which can't be mixed with as wide a variety of things, but still goes well with peanut butter, or some greek yogurt.<br/><br/>Will continue to support this brand, and product - haven't been disappointed yet.
 Good product nothing to say. I picked vanilla flavor. After gym one scoop of protein and usually mixing with one banana and couple pieces of ice, I use hand blender.<br/>My wife like to add protein to pancakes it makes your breakfast full of protein and carbohydrates.
 I did extensive research and this was the best again and again.  I remember using Optimum Nutrition in high school, and got results back then. I ordered the Natural Chocolate which I loved having Cocoa and Sugar, but my wife thought it was a bit bitter for her.  Overall, great Whey protein, and have added muscle mass by upping my protein to 1.8 grams per Kilograms of weight.  Mixes extremely easy and will always be on my subscribe and save.
 I have been using ON 100% Whey for years. It's the only protein I have had to date that doesn't give me any digestive issues. I have never been diagnosed with any digestive diseases but some powders give you the dreaded protein farts. This brand has never done that. For flavors I prefer the cappuccino mocha. Others I have tried are strawberry: not very good, strawberry banana: very good, chocolate: it's chocolate, cake batter: its ok but it got old quick. I take 2 a day, mid morning snack and immediate post workout. I've been using this brand for 5-7 years if my memory serves me right.
 I've been using this for a week and I like it so far. It dissolves nicely in both water and milk (using blender bottle), and leaves me feeling sated afterwards. Smells a little odd in the jar, but tastes decent for a protein mix.<br/><br/>Serving ideas:<br/>- Don't use more than 8 oz of water or it tastes really thin.<br/>- Try using warm/hot water for a "hot chocolate" like experience.<br/>- Add a heaping teaspoon of cocoa powder to each serving to make it more chocolatey. (It's too sweet by itself for me.)<br/>- Mix with milk instead of water for a thicker drink.<br/>- Add a shot of espresso for a pre-workout protein mocha!
 Doesn't make me sick! I gave this one a shot because of all the crazy highly rated reviews. I can't comment on how well its working to help build muscle since I just got it a couple weeks ago but I have had whey protein in the past and after I drank it, I always felt like I was going to throw up. This one had no same side effect. Although its not the best tasting drink in the world it is subtle chocolate taste and with regular (not chocolate!) milk or water it goes down pretty smoothly. I am impressed.
 Superb taste that makes you eat it faster than you expected. I mix it first thing in the morning, changed my morning coffee, and makes me feel better during the day.<br/>Some other proteins are just soooo bad flavor that becomes a molestation to eat them, so even though this is a really quality price/protein/ingredients ratio, it makes you eat it happily and than a gram or two of protein per serving more (or less) and other marketing bla-blas, are less important.<br/><br/>Take it and enjoy it. It is quality stuff.
 I typically order a Chocolate flavor of the Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Whey protein. Thought I would take a chance on the cookies &amp; cream flavor since I like cookies and cream ice cream. This tastes nothing like cookies and cream! Me and my brave coworkers that also tried it feel that it tastes like butterscotch. It is SUPER sweet. I also don't find that it dissolves as well in water as the chocolate flavor I've tried. I hate to waste food, so I am forcing myself to finish this, but I'm back to my original chocolate flavor after I get through the 5 lbs of this :-/
 Just a flavor review. Haven;t used it enough to notice a difference yet.<br/><br/>Cookies and Cream has a very weird after taste when used with water. But having it in milk makes it taste just like cookies and cream. Put chocolate in it for even more protein. Mix it with cereal.<br/><br/>But i wish it didn't taste so weird in water. I am gonna try vanilla next.
 I bought this particular product because of all the great reviews I read about it.  I am taking it because I determined I wasn't getting enough protein in my diet and I'd read my articles that whey is one of the better forms to take in supplement form.  While I'm a heath food nut so to speak, I can usually tolerate the taste and consistency of most anything if it works.  This product taste great, blends or melts into whatever you put it in unlike any kind I've used previously.  I wasn't excited to read kind of sweetener used but I didn't find that it left an after taste so I'm happy with the product.
 I ordered this just to try out since I ran out of my ISO Pure protein shake and wanted some change. So if you're switching from Dutch Chocolate ISO Pure to this Double Chocolate ON Whey, you would find that ISO Pure had a much better taste when mixed with water.<br/><br/>It took longer for ISO Pure to mix with water and it leaves some sort of residual white granules after you drink it all, which to date I don't know why they were there in the first place. However this product mixes easily and well with water a little too well to an extend that you'd feel you're just drinking flavored water. So initially it took me a while to get used to it but then I found a great way to get around its viscosity, I started mixing it with my Banana shake in the morning and to tell you the truth, my shakes never tasted better.<br/><br/>I would recommend this product for two reasons. 1. It tastes amazing with milk and 2. that it is more affordable than ISO Pure by almost 30 bucks or more for the quantity. Both of them have similar specification so the results should be similar too.
 This is my first whey protein buy...and I am VERY happy with it! Great flavor...I was nervous I wouldn't like it with water and it is seriously just like a rich chocolate milk w/ water. That being said you could surely add/mix ingredients with this if that's your thing! I have also tried it in yogurt, baking, etc....it's really good in everything. Not disappointed in the slightest. Ingredients seem quality and minimal!
 I'm no expert on the nutritional facts or amino acid profile of this protein. I do know, however, that this is the best tasting and most easily mixing protein I've ever had. I have purchased other Optimum Nutrition proteins in the past but none of the other flavors were nearly as good as this banana cream flavor. It tastes great when mixed with milk or used in a smoothie. It's pretty awful tasting if you try to mix it with water though.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Taste<br/>Mixability<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>The included spoon is difficult to dig out since it gets mixed into the protein during shipping.
 Gold standard says it all optimium nutrition 100% whey Is one of the best protein on the market at a great price. If you’re serious into nutrition and bodybuilding this is a must have product don’t waste your money on all the other garbage on the market this is been the number one protein for many years for a reason
 It seems like a good product. It has certainly been a good choice when I searched for the most protein grams that I could find per dollar spent on a protein powder. I don't give it five stars. It doesn't seem worthy of five stars to me because of the ingredients that are in it as compared to other protein powders that are vegan, gluten free, and other healthy labels such as those.
 The initial taste tastes very naturally strawberry, then the aftertaste tastes like brake fluid.
 It’s too sweet. It gives me stomach ache if I mix it with milk. It would be nice to find protein powder that is not sweet.
 As someone who has been very involved in fitness and tried tons of products, I can honestly say this is a staple in any serious routine. You can certainly find higher quality, or lwer priced protein. However, for the price and quality, there is no competition. It consistently wins protein powder of the year on bodybuilding.com. Extreme Chocolate Milk is the only flavor I have found that I don't get tired of. Most of the others taste strange in water.
 ON is always my choice for protein powder because of the excellent value, and it's the only brand I've found that doesn't make my insides angry. Also, it tastes much better than most brands - I highly recommend mixing with milk instead of water, and possibly adding PB, honey, or other additions and blending for variety.<br/><br/>Double Rich Chocolate is probably my favorite flavor. I've also tried Vanilla and Strawberry with less successful, but certainly not bad results.
 I was particularly looking for protein supplements without much sugar and absolutely no artificial sweeteners. It doesnot say anything about it however after going through almost 90% of the bag I noticed one day it says in a extremely small font that it is flavored both naturally and artificially. Then eventually after researching the ingredients i found that it contains Acesulfame Potassium which is a artificial sweetener. So, i am not buying it again.
 Product is great and I have been using it for a while. Good source of whey protein when comparing it to other brands. I have tried a few different flavors but rich chocolate is the best. I don't think it tastes good with water so I have switched to using almond milk and it tastes great.
 I LIVE off this stuff. It also kept me alive while serving in Peace Corps too, where protein was almost non-existant. Back in America it can make a skinny guy turn into a slightly less skinny guy. Also good for gym. Buy it before they mess up the recipe (like all good things)
 This stuff is decent. It isn't near as tasty as the synth-6 stuff but that one has a bunch of sugar and makes me fart a whole lot more than any other powder I tried. The double chocolate ON powder is tolerable, the cookies and cream one is horrible and I had to force myself to finish it eventually mixing a scoop of it with a scoop of chocolate just to finish it off. They are decently priced but they fluctuate a lot so keep an eye on them and check all the flavors because the prices can vary quite a bit.
 My reaction to this powder:<br/>"OMG, that smells amazing"<br/>"Whoa, way too sweet"<br/>"I want more"<br/>Yes it's sweet, yes it's delicious, no artificial sweeteners are not bad for you.
 I typically wake up thirsty, so I drink perhaps 3 cups of water right off the bat, then need about two more cups to handle my three tablespoons of psyllium and various pills. By the end of that, breakfast was a nightmarish slog that left me feeling tired and overly full. Now though, I can get plenty of protein to trigger satiety and promote muscle growth, without feeling like I need a nap ten minutes after waking up. The tiny amount of sugars and carbohydrates make it perfect for my current diet, though it also means the finished shake is pretty thin. I fix that by combining it with psyllium, which creates a perfect texture. The effect has been tremendous. I approach my day with a new energy, better than coffee has ever provided, and I now know what it means to be a "morning person." Highly recommended to anyone who has trouble waking up or getting enough morning protein.
 I had only ever purchased the double-chocolate (which tastes like Nestle Quick).  So when I decided to give this flavor a shot, I was happy it wasn't an overly sweet coconut flavor (like a Mounds candy bar can be).  It's still coconut-y (?) but not overdone.  If you like chocolate and coconut, you'll enjoy this.  I really enjoy ON's Gold Standard 100% Whey protein.  It really works for me.  The amino acids blunt that lactic acid build-up that causes so much of the soreness after a good day at the gym.  Consider their creatine to add to your post-workout shake.
 I realize that this produce received lots of stars and a lot of sales from Amazon but I have found it to have a poor taste -- poor enough that I will not try a second scoop -- even added some powdered peanut butter and cocoa to boost the flavor and that did not help.  I do not question the amount of protein or that it is healthy -- just that the taste is nasty to me -- I will go back to the much more expensive Amplify protein powder from a well-known health supplement store.
 Optimum Nutrition is a great product. I love the taste and love that is not filled with a bunch of junk. When you break down the by the serving price it's actually one of the best deals out there. I not only use it when I'm in a phase of working out I make it a pretty well permanent part of my diet. Great tasting and mixes up very easily in a shaker cup
 A bodybuilding staple. As a gym monkey I've been around the block with all of the other proteins.Universal, Evo Nutrition, Isopure, Arnold, Now, Cellucor, MHP, the list is quite long. This may have a little more bodyfat than some of the 2lb high end zero carb wheys but it does the job. If you aren't leaning out for a show and work hard there is no reason not to love this.
 I bought this flavour because I balked at the fact that chocolate (my usual go-to flavour for protein powder) was way more expensive, by about 20%.  Normally I am really skeptical about protein powder flavours, because of bad past experiences.  "Cookies and cream" made me think of some fake tacky sugary taste.  But luckily some other reviewers said it was really nice.<br/><br/>I trust ON's products as I've used them a fair bit before.  As well as containing all the relevant BCAAs, I like this product because it doesn't contain TOO much protein - some of these other ones contain ridiculous jacked-up amounts of protein per serving, and a lot of people don't seem to realise that your body can't take in protein at more than a certain rate anyway, so I think that more than about 30g protein per serving is a waste.  Shakes like this get the protein into your digestive system very quickly, so any excess just gets pooped out.  This one has 24g per serving which is a good amount.<br/><br/>Another test of a good protein powder is how gassy it makes me.  They all tend to cause a bit of gas, but some brands are way worse than others, which makes me wonder what stuff they put in them that's so gassy.<br/><br/>So far I've found that this ON product mixes really easily, no lumps, I use one of those shakers with the springy metal ball inside, and I don't have to try very hard to get it to mix with milk.  Overall, kudos to ON for being consistent.  The cookies &amp; cream flavour is really subtle and not oversweet, so I'm stoked about that too.
 If you drink whey protein everyday, the 5 lb is the way to go. Last much longer and definitely get your moneys worth. Plus the flavor of this (Cake batter) is AMAZING. I mix some water with milk and I love it. If I use just milk, it tastes better than milkshakes. GREAT STUFF!
 I’ve steered away from protein powders because they tend to taste terrible. After reading many reviews of the rich chocolate flavor I decided to give it a try with the smallest size. It tastes amazing! There is no aftertaste which surprised me. I mix it with low calorie almond milk. Before my work out I throw it in the freezer for about an hour or so, let it defrost while I work out, add the powder and it tastes like a chocolate shake. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to enjoy drinking protein.
 Only the best for your body!<br/><br/>I have been using gold standard for almost a year now and have no complaints whatsoever<br/>this is some of the best tasting protein and its not even loaded with sugars like others<br/>The french vanilla flavor (which i am currently using) only has 2 grams of carbs per serving so only 2 grams of sugar
 I accidently ordered the Double Chocolate flavor and that was a costly mistake. The Double Chocolate flavor taste more like medicine than a chocolate shake.  Normally I purchase the Extreme Chocolate and it is great.  For your sake, don't make the same mistake I did.
 I like this stuff and this company.  Call me naive but I am a fan.<br/><br/>Edited January 8, 2018.  After one return and reciept of another bottle, I received another unsealed tub with the contents literally uncontained and all over the lid.
 I have used ON 100% whey protein for many years. I've tried a number of other protein powder but none as as good as ON in my opinion.<br/><br/>Pros<br/>great taste<br/>25G protein per single scoop and scoop required is not large<br/>mixes in milk with just a spoon<br/>one of the best values - the amount per serving per container makes this one of the lower cost options in the protein powder world<br/>quality ingredients<br/><br/>Cons<br/>the price has risen quite a bit in the past few years
 The flavor wasn't as chocolate as I would've wanted, especially when mixed with water. People have suggested not to mix with milk because it wouod delay the absoprtion but ideally if for the flavorwise i wouod say u should. It's still a great product for the price as I don't see myself come even close to finishing off a 6 lb tub.
 I usually buy the extreme milk chocolate but wanted to give this a try for pancake and smoothie recipes. It actually tastes amazing on it's own!! Optimum Nutrition protein is a great way to get the protein that you need if you're trying to lose weight (and/or build muscle). For myself, I sometimes have it instead of dessert in the evening. Or I'll have some before bed to keep my metabolism going while I sleep.
 This is the only brand I use.. The flavors are delicious.  Mixes smooth and easy with water or milk.  I have tried a lot of different brands and this is the one I have been using for over 10 years. Highly recommended...
 Same good product. Some reviewers noted they did not get the one that contained Aminogen. Mine did. I didn't tamper with which seller to buy from. I just added the item straight to my cart. I'm unsure if that is the reason or not but it was the only thing I could think of.
 I love this stuff. To supplement my P90X, I bought the Vanilla to mix in to my morning post workout shakes. It may be the other ingredients that I add that make it taste so good but the overall protein shake is very tasty. Try out my recipe, and make sure to blend it on high. Takes about 5-8 minutes to prepare and is totally worth it and beats the heck out of carbonated energy drinks.<br/><br/>Item Quantity<br/>Florida Pure Orange Juice No Pulp 1 Cup<br/>Organic Strawberries Washed and De-Stemmed 8 to 12 Depending on Size<br/>Organic Bananas Peeled 1 Large or 2 Medium<br/>Plane White Greek Yogurt  2 Loaded Spoon Fulls<br/>Garden of Life Perfect Food Formula 1 Scoop<br/>Schiff Joint Free Plus 1 Scoop<br/>Optimum Nutrition Whey Gold Standard Vanilla 1 or 2 Scoops<br/><br/>Drink shake with a capsule of CoQ10 for boosted cellular energy production/regulation.
 Doesn't mix in any kind of liquid. The powder hardens in the cup and around the spoon which is extremely hard to get off. Major concerns that I have consumed a powder that does that. I thought the gold standard would be better than the original since it is a higher quality, but I guess not.
 I bulked and it was pretty gosh darn delicious. Earlier in the year, I had purchased a 10-pound bag of ON Whey Gold vanilla because it was on sale, and it tasted pretty "meh." Taking that into account, when I was buying this one, I googled what the best tasting ON whey protein flavor was and it said this one, and well goodness gracious, it was right. This is delicious, and it certainly does the job. Would highly recommend as I've been a fan of the ON whey protein and have personally seen and felt the difference this makes.
 I am a CrossFitter and did not like Progenex. This is a great protein protein product. My post-workout almond milk and banana smoothies are perfect. It has a great flavor (chocolate mint), is not gritty and there is no weird aftertaste. Love it. P
 I bought the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor and I have not been able to find another flavor that i enjoy this much. I currently have the regular vainilla and i will sometimes get a bitter flavor and get a grainy feel in my mouth. Also, great value for the big 5lb tub.
 Good taste,<br/>good quantity (filled to the top),<br/>1 scoop = 24g protein!<br/><br/>The other brands all come about 30-40% filled (why make the container that big... just be honest)<br/>The other brands also require 2-3 scoops for ~25g protein<br/>The other brands dont mix well, they clump together even when I have a shaker and mix ball
 Amazon has the best price for this protein powder AND this is the best kind I've ever had. It dissolves nicely in water or milk, has a great flavor, and clearly helps with muscle growth. Recommend!
 Had used this brand for years. Love the product! Works great if you workout regularly. Provides the boast and muscle toning.
 Just ordered cookies and cream after having an issue with the banana cream.  The cookies and cream smells and tastes like a very bad cup of coffee with a terrible after taste.
 for someone who does not use powder very much, this size is too much.  For the rare users, get a smaller container.  This will last more than several months with me!
 This has been my go-to protein for years. I’ve tried different brands, including certain companies that have better reviews than optimimum, but I keep coming back to ON. You can beat the amount of servings and taste at this price in my opinion.
 I tried the chocolate coconut flavor and love it! I don't like chocolate flavored things, I like my chocolate plain, so this combo with coconut is perfect! My last protein shake I ordered on Amazon (100% Whey Pro-Amino Vanilla Ice Cream 2 lbs) was delicious but I was looking for a more wallet-friendly option. My 18 yo son dipped into that 2lb container quickly :) This 5lb baby I am not worried about running out as fast. I add chia seeds and freshly ground flax seeds to my shakes. When a handful of frozen fruit is added is is absolutely heavenly. I am going to try other flavors too. I think it's a great price for a great product.
 Double Rich Chocolate:  Very good taste with both milk and water.  Thin, dust-like consistency.  Dissolves easily.  Will buy again.<br/><br/>Aug 2018 update: Well... I did buy it again.  I liked it that much.  Great favor.  Will stick to this product from now on.  Works well with water, juice or milk.
 Dissolves very well in water with a shaker cup. I use it in conjunction with Creatine, glutamine, BCAA, and NO2 first thing in the morning before my workout. Good taste as well.
 This was the first time I had this flavor, being Double Rich Chocolate I thought it would taste like chocolate.  This however actually taste like nothing, I use two scoops in a 28oz shaker bottle with water.
 I have purchased this protein for the last year and cant imagine going to something else.<br/>It mixes in water with no lumps, not thick so easy to swallow, and taste great.<br/>I have been seeing great results and quick recovery after drinking this vs. other protein supplements.<br/><br/>I wanted to push to see if they can provide a subscribe and save on this product so for people like me that order a 5lb container every month can save a little money.<br/>I am sure there are many who would love to have this benefit.<br/><br/>I have only tried Chocolate and Double Chocolate...I never get sick of it.  Like drinking chocolate milk.
 You workout to improve your body.  This version has artifical sweetener which can damage your health.<br/>I buy the natural version.  A very small amount of sugar should not be a problem.  I will take a known product sugar versus using sucralose and then not knowing what long term harm it will cause.
 I use this after I go to the gym. I use a few ice cubes, and a scoop full of powder, and a cup of milk, all into a shaker cup. It mixes very easily and tastes great, and makes me feel more energized after my workouts. Sometimes if I have time I will use my blender stick to add a health kick aspect to it.  I sometimes will add a half cup of blueberries, or a banana, and some greek yogurt, maybe with some flax seeds or whatever type of healthy fruit I can add in. I like the chocolate taste it gives on its own, and it blends well.  I give this product a 5 star rating, based not only on the quality, but also the price and quality of this seller.
 Most body builders end up using this product, so getting personal opinions from people you know that about flavors should be easy.  I find that it tastes great.  I got the milk chocolate flavor, which a friend of mine actually finds too sweet. I do love chocolate and anything sweet, so if your'e the same I recommend it, but if you don't have a sweet tooth I'd try something else.
 I've been using Isopure for 15 years. Thought I'd give this brand a try. Wow. Actually tastes like strawberry. Must say this brand has the best tasting flavor I have ever tried. Will be sticking with Gold Standard for the foreseable future. Sorry Isopure.
 This tastes excellent for a whey protein powder. It mixes pretty easily, and I am getting great results so far. If it continues down this path, I will revisit this review and give it five stars.
 The best! You cannot find a better whey protein powder out there. This is the only one I use and have been doing so for many years. The Double Rich Chocolate is not overpowering, especially considering I do not even like chocolate. I prefer to make my shakes with water versus milk, but thats just personal preference. I also mix in a bit of creatine monohydrate and take one in the morning and one after each workout. Will continue to purchase this particular protein powder!
 Rocky Road!! It's super good! Get the 5 pounder, I'm glad I did. May not be for everyone but it's worth a try. It's my new favorite. The flavor is strong in a good way, I like to mix a scoop with about 7 oz of milk for a nice creamy experience. Also taste great with blended peanut butter and banana. If you like the different chocolates ON has to offer as well as the Cappuccino; I would say you will be very happy with the taste.
 I remember trying thee mocha cappuccino when it first came out and it had an excellent taste.  This is my first purchase of it in years (they only had a 2lb last I purchased) so time is a factor, but it tastes a bit different than I remember. Still taste is good, great mixability, good BCAA profile and not too much filler.  25g protein in a 32g scoop, not the best but it's a lot better than the cheap brands.  I will likely not purchase this flavor again though, and will stick with either chocolate or coffee flavor.
 Pros:<br/>Delicious (I've only tried extreme milk chocolate)<br/>Easy to mix<br/>Doesn't cause stomach cramps<br/><br/>Over the past couple of years I have tried many types of protein powders from EAS, Muscle Milk, and other ones that I don't even remember the name that were on sale. This by far is the best tasting, less filling, and easiest to mix out of every other protein I've tried. I hate when other proteins give me stomach cramps because it feels like I just ate 5 plate at a super buffet and they don't even have nearly as many grams of protein in them. Other proteins are hard to mix and get chunky and lumpy at the bottom but this powder is so fine that it is as smooth as milk.<br/><br/>As I said I've tried many protein brands in the past couple of years and usually I am open to try something new and I get bored with my current protein. I used to not stay with the same protein for more than a few months but I've been on this protein for about 6 months and I don't plan on changing for a long time. I did recently switch to the natural version of this protein because it is only a couple of dollars more. I am going to start using other proteins in my diet like casein and hydrobuilder; I am not going with any other brand than ON!
 I got the Cookies and Cream but sadly its taste leaves something to be desired and the smell is VERY overpowering and not in a good way.  I got this brand instead of the Cellucor for price difference.<br/><br/>I cant say it doesn't work so I gave it 4 stars but I would not get this flavor again for sure!  I don't like pure chocolate or vanilla flavors so I will go back to cellucor cinnamon swirl.  It was well worth the try for the price difference but for preference in taste ill go back once this runs out.
 I've been very happy with this powder.  It tastes great and mixes extremely well.  I add a bit of peanut butter, some blueberries, etc. and make some delicious post-workout shakes with either my Magic Bullet at home or a blender bottle when I'm on the go.  I've tried several different powders over the last few months and I think I've found my go to now.
 This review is only on taste since I have nothing really to compare to. I normally hate protein powders and never had any that was easy to drink ages ago. Coffee tastes great, like a coffee milkshake. I haven't tried it yet but I bet it would taste like a Starbucks frapacino if mixed with ice!!!  I won't have a problem finishing this jug. Been drinking twice a day without any issues.
 I'm currently on a modified ideal protein diet. All of the gold standard whey proteins I have had are a terrific low carb meal alternative that works well with the ideal protein diet. I would highly suggest.<br/><br/>The flavors I have had so far include:<br/><br/>Banana Cream - Best of the batch so far IMO. I'm a sucker for Banana flavor though, and the "fake" banana flavor is done very well in this shake.<br/>Rocky Road - The best "chocolate" flavor. Lots of marshmallow flavors in there as well.<br/>Double Chocolate - Not bad, but not great either. Sort of a weak chocolate<br/>Cake Doughnut - Very good clean taste. Another go to esp for a before noon shake.<br/>Birthday Cake - While good, tastes overly sweet IMO. Also the little birthday flakes are a little annoying to clean out of a shaker glass.<br/>Chocolate Mint - Weak, my least favorite. Very low on the chocolate taste. Mostly mint in the flavor, and it isn't done real well.<br/>Salted Carmel - Good, but leaves a strong aftertaste, even after brushing your teeth.<br/>Blueberry Cake - Very good, another "cake" flavor done well.<br/>Cookies n Cream - Not my favorite, but very good and clean tasting.
 I'm a new consumer of this stuff, I work out a lot and decided to get a protein supplement to increase my gains. Tastes amazing mixed into milk, water not as good but it gets the job done. Idk why everyone is freaking out about some sucralose and how its making them sick from sweetness, seems fine to me then again I only tried the chocolate one and i'm not too sensitive I don't eat bitter powders all the time to notice extra sweetness.
 Good results, but flavor is a little weak for my taste. Product has decent solubility. Recommend using extremely cold water or milk for best taste. Good value and great protein ratio, combined with creatine supplement, this makes a great weight/muscle gaining regiment.
 Optimum Nutrition (ON) is one of those whey proteins that does not affect my stomach. I had Rocky Road years ago and it was amazing! Since then I have been trying to get it but have relied on people to buy whatever is available at GNC when they travel. Usually GNC does not have this flavour. They usually have Double Rich chocolate which is VERY tasty as well. I recently travelled to the US and so I ordered Rocky Road. Although I have not started back training as yet, I can rest assured that this product will be awesome! I have been using ON for years now.
 I have heard about people complaining about how awful those whey proteins are. This is the first time that I tried whey protein powders and I can assure you that this chocolate flavor tastes awesome with milk, kind of like ice cream. I would buy more when my stock runs out.
 As of today April 18, 2018 I can verify that the Double Rich Chocolate Flavor still has the original recipe with no salt or sucralose added.
 Love this chocolate whey product!! I mix mine with instant coffee and ice and it's super delish!! I drink it in the morning after a workout and as breakfast along with oatmeal. It's quick, easy, and the body absorbs it quickly. The product is wonderful and has all the essential amino acids you need for muscle building and repair. Plus, the body absorbs the whey a lot quicker compared to having to chew up your protein. I've tried a lot of whey proteins and this is a product that I like the best. It mixes well and it's not too sweet. Would definitely recommend it.
 I've had chocolate, vanilla, cookies and cream, and even birthday cake but I have to say banana is by far my favorite protein flavor by Optimum Nutrition. Whey is a great supplement if you want to add protein to your diet or workout regimen and Optimum Nutrition definitely delivers on the quality! Will for sure be continuing to buy my protein from them!
 Great protein - mixes well and is good quality. This product is not sweet at all - I add a stevia packet to my mix and that does the trick. I’ll buy the extreme milk chocolate next time around for a sweeter shake. This was a 1 on the scale of 1-10 sweetness.
 I loved this whey. I bought the Chocolate and it was delicious. It never upset my stomach as I have heard some can. It never tasted chalky or disgusting. I was pleased with this and will definitely buy this brand again.
 Bought this because a buddy of my swears by it. NO WAY. Gas and upset stomach for over an hour every time I used it. Great for quantity, but I'll fork ever a few extra dollars for the best. Back to Phormula-1 from 1st Phorm. Get yours at 1stphorm.com/redsgym and you won't regret it.
 tub of protein came unsealed ... kinda gross.<br/>—-<br/><br/>update:<br/>amazon replaced the first tub with a sealed one. glad, and its great so far
 Best tasting protein powder I've tried.  Cheap, low calorie, and high protein.  Doesn't make nauseous if I drink it before cardio, which other powders have.  The double chocolate tastes great.  One of these 5lbs will last me about 2 months, so it works out to less than $1 a day.
 Better deal to get the 5 pound vs the 2 pound. It will hurt your wallet in the short run but it will help it in the long run. What else can you say about this stuff? If you put in the work and take this stuff how you're supposed to then you will see gains and fast.
 My favorite protein powder for taste and mixability, but the chocolate flavor is lacking. I only get the chocolate flavors to mix in my yogurt. However, the French vanilla creme is amazing!
 Tried them all before this one. Never going back. So smooth and drinkable. Easy to mix, I use blender and whole other products stick to the sides during mixing this doesn't. It mixes so well and blender is easier to clean up.<br/>My stomach likes it better as well and if it's at least as efficient as others which I don't doubt it is a wise upgrade.
 This protein powder is excellent. It mixes very well in my blender bottle with either milk or water. With milk, it tastes like a milkshake, and with water it tastes more like chocolate milk. This is much better than the previous protein powder I used from Body Fortress. I highly recommend this; when I run out, I will definitely be buying from Optimum Nutrition.
 ON makes quality supplements we all know that, this one is no different. I've tried Elite, Muscle Milk, but none of them came close to the taste of this one, plus is a very quality and complete protein, i bought the vanilla flavor, mix with one banana, hemp seed and milk is awesome, it is in fact so good that i can even mix with plain water and it tastes good.<br/>price is cheaper than anywhere else i've checked too. Delivery took 2 days with PRIME. You really get what you pay for.<br/>Big thanks to SAM for a very comprehensive review of this product.
 I had the Bariatric Sleeve 1.5 yrs ago and are really stressed to continue protein shakes. A friend told me how delicious the Cake Batter flavor was so I decided to give it a try. Yum Yum!!  I love it. Love the consistency this brand makes your shakes.<br/>I will definitely be buying another flavor to try. Very impressed with this brand.
 Gold standard is, in my opinion, one of the best protein supplementation products out there. Tastes great, and is perfect for someone needing a meal replacement or extra protein for body building.<br/>I would recommend getting a blender bottle or some sort with a wire mixer to ensure the shake isn't chunky when drinking it.
 So far great protein! I got the flavor I ordered and the taste is great. And it's good till 9/18.
 I have been using this protein for over two years and I absolutely love it.  However, the most recent purchase of it makes me sick every time I use it.  I get a really bad stomach ache.  I do not know if any ingredients change or maybe I received a contaminated container.  It still tastes great but makes me super sick.  If there was an ingredient change then I will not be buying this product again unfortunately.
 Take a high quality protein, give it a realistic flavor, offer it at a nice price, and you've got one of the best protein supplements around.  I've tried many protein powders, and always end up coming back to ON: for nutritional profile, mixability, and taste.  Yes, there may be a few others that taste a little better, but they fall short overall (i.e. having considerably less protein, or using high fructose corn syrup, among other things).  I'm interested in the best bang, and this is it.<br/><br/>Perfect for smoothies (added in order of water first, then frozen fruit, then powder, and ice last)--no clumping, side-sticking, or chalkiness.  Good value too (I aim for less than $10 a pound).
 As a non scientist, I usually just buy whatever tastes or looks the best. This product hit a home run in both categories. I credit Gold Standard Whey for me being strong enough to give my dad's friend a black eye after he kept touching my David Backes jersey. I was like dude stop touching me but he kept touching it and trying to turn me around like I was his slave so I just turned to my dad and was like is your friend trying to take me home tonight or what?<br/><br/>Well he wouldn't have any of that - when I walked away from their discussion where they were probably praising Bush's actions in the Middle East or trickle down economics my dad's friend Mr. FUHRER (I mean cmon, do you hate this guy yet? Decided to come at me from behind and put me in a headlock. I was pretty drunk at the time but was able to break free and punch the dude in the face. What an idiot. Why would somebody attack someone who consumes Gold Standard Whey daily? The dude got a black eye. His job is to get people to sign up for 401ks - I wonder what his stats were for that next week?
 I like this product.  It is a very fine power soluable in both water and skin milk.  I puchased the coffee favor without trying a small sample pack.  It tastes like coffee.  Not exactly Columian but OK for being  a protein power.  If you my coffee ice cream you will like this stuff.
 If you are familiar with the nasty flavors, aka if you've ever tried fruit punch you know you don't want 5lbs of it.<br/>I had the mocha last before this and even got tired of that one.<br/><br/>I haven't gotten sick of this flavor at all. As a matter of fact, depending on whether I feel curious or not I will just order the same flavor because I know this one is a hit for me.
 it doesnt taste like coffee at all. it really tasty like bubbly chocolate with less sweet taste. its pretty awful if u were expecting anything remotely resembles cappuccino. i was i was disappointed to say the least
 As someone that has tried a myriad protein supplements, I must say this is the best one. This is my go-to protein supplement for the last 5 years. I really like the fact that it has higher protein content and lower calories and fat, compared to other brands. My goal is to build lean muscle and stay fit and this has helped me in reaching them. Also like the various flavors. My favorites - French Vanilla and Banana cream. Also Amazon has the best price.<br/>Give it a try.
 I've always liked Optimum Nutrition products, as they use high quality ingredients and overall have good products. So naturally, when I started my new diet/exercise regimen, I knew O.N. would be the protein I would use.<br/><br/>I purchased the double rich chocolate, and the flavor is pretty good for a protein powder. It's even better in milk, but I can't currently do that in my diet. Aside from the high quality whey, I like the fact that it has BCAA's, including a significant amount of Glutamine.<br/><br/>It's also a good value, although next time I'll go for the 10lb bag, as it's even cheaper.
 This product is a cornerstone in my workout regime. I take it once before and after each workout session to really keep me going. Before I started using this product, I was barely making any noticeable progress. I was doing everything I could to gain mass, get bigger, but it just wasn't happening. This made it so much easier and it tastes great. I felt I'd have to resort to using Mass Gainer, but this did the job just right. I highly recommend for beginner to intermediate lifters.
 Been using optimums protein for years. Mixes and their flavors never get old. When they make another package offer/deal I will buy again!
 I was previously purchasing my protein from Sam's club.  I found this on Amazon and absolutely love it!  The flavour taste much better than any of the protein powders I have taken before.  After I finish this flavour, I plan on trying others.  I definitely can tell a difference in the quality of this over the cheaper brands out there. I highly recommend it.
 This tastes like vanilla ice cream but leaves a sweet aftertaste after drinking. Sometimes the powder does not dissolve completely and there are small clumps. But that’s not really a problem for me. I would buy this again.
 Here is my spin on the "ON Gold Standard 100% WHEY "Vanilla Ice Cream" flavor...<br/><br/>The protein itself is good from a dietary point of view.  Is easy on my stomach so no distress on my stomach while I go about my daily routine.  I have to say the taste however is less than desired.  I love ON Gold Standard and have been trying many flavors for some time.  When I just mix this with water, tastes like some convenience store skim milk that was frozen and thawed out.  I will have to give this a go with 2% milk and see how it mixes up.  I've tried White Chocolate and and Cake Batter and they both are amazing.  First time I've been let down by the taste of a ON product.  I am very Anti "chocolate" since everyone makes a "MEGA CHOCOLATE DOUBLE OVERLOAD" flavor.  I've tried mixing more powder and less water and the same result.
 My husband and I have been researching protein powders for years and this is the best one for the price that we have come across. So far we have tried Chocolate and Rocky Road. By far the best tasting protein powder we have been able to find. High quality protein that is ACTUALLY HEALTHY! So many protein powders out there are garbage, but this is the real thing!
 I am on a restricted calorie diet and recently added power 90 workout videos.  I started drinking one of these after my workout and it really lessens my soreness and recovery time.  Also I am building a considerable amount of muscle despite my very low calorie intake.  At 230 calories per 8 oz glass (if taken with 1%) it had to replace my mini ice cream treat I ate each night, but the double chocolate tastes almost as good!  I also have tried vanilla ice cream and I can get it down after a workout if I use an immersion blender, but it doesn't taste very good.  The double chocolate tastes very similar to a malted milk shake.
 Been taking this for 3 years now and its the best protein supplement out of my experience.  You don't need me lecturing about the benefits of protein sups so I'll only speak of why I prefer this over others.  Double chocolate tastes great without being too sweet or filling.  Mixes super easy in a cup with a spoon or a bottle, almost little to no lumps every time.  Great price for the amounts of protein each serving contains.  Available in big 10 pound bag, not all brands carries 10lbs.  Definitely recommends this to all protein supplement users, beginners or experts, you will taste and feel the difference.
 2nd time purchasing this whey product and just completely satisfied. Same day shipping was amazing; order it from work when I packed my last protein to last the day, and it was at my apartment by the time I finished my workout that evening. The extreme milk chocolate is a really solid flavor that goes well with milk or water. I typically load up a shaker bottle with a scoop and then around 6-8 oz of water and it makes a tasty shake. Great product guaranteed.
 More protein then most can handle. I tried to do 4 scoops a day but evey day that passed it felt like I never made a dent in this thing. I really regret getting the cookies and cream because it made everything taste weird. If I was to do it agian I would get the vanilla. Dont make the same mistake I did haha.
 This product is very good and I totally recommend it to anyone that is looking for a protein powder to get them over that hump or to just help with muscle regeneration. I find that even with all the protein gains you get with this product it also tastes GREAT!!!!!! I feel like im drinking chocolate milk. This product also has 5.5g of BCAA (Branched Chain Amino Acids) along with the 24g of protein for only 120 calories. What I thik helps seperate this product is that it has no fillers and I feel that is what you pay the extra price for I have used other protein powders and have had some fillers in it and gained weight due to it not being 100% whey protein. This is definately a top shelf product and would recommend it to anyone that lifts seriously or thinking about getting in the gym on a regular basis you will see the effects of it after about a week of use....
 I bought this for my mom who has cancer and has lost alot of weight and needs extra protein in her diet.  She LOVES the taste of it and has no problem drinking it all down.  I have a special mixer cup I mix it up in so the powder gets mixed up really good.
 I've added this to my breakfast and started doing very light workouts. It tastes good and I've since lost 5 pounds in the last month while barely adjusting my diet and life routine at all.<br/><br/>Adding protein seems to make a difference in my body weight so I'll keep buying this one. I have read this protein drink has the fewest metals in it and I really enjoy my morning shakes. I'll stick with this powder.<br/><br/>Other powders I've tried are Tiger's milk and a few GNC branded powders as well as AdvantAGE and Myoplex. I like this one the best.
 I've been a fan of Optimum Nutrition for years; I've tried the strawberry (regular and natural), vanilla, chocolate, white chocolate and the toffee almond what-the-heck-ever flavor, and they've all been good if not great. They taste good blended with some peanut butter and light vanilla Silk as well as with just plain water. I also experience less bloating with this powder than others. The only whey protein I recommend more than this is Isoflex, but that one costs nearly double so if you're on a working class budget and want good quality, this is it.
 We have the vanilla ice cream flavor and it really does taste like vanilla ice cream. It’s nice and creamy with no grainy texture or gross after taste. Even the kids think these taste great.
 Excellent product. Very happy. If I gave this 5 stars, it is everything it claims to be, and if there is any kind of an issue with this product, I would def write it here.
 The last powder I bought had 63 grams of sugar per serving and clumped up even when mixed well in a shaker bottle. I had to blend it to get it fully dissolved in water or milk. This powder on the other hand has only one gram of sugar per serving and completely dissolves in milk or water. The best part is it tastes great. I will definitely be using this protein from now on
 Since im not a person that goes to the gym as much as he would like, nor someone that will spend 3 hours there every time he goes i needed a supplement to help me recover after those days that i manage to workout, this has been working greatly for me, i normally use it on the afternoons immediately after the workout, the flavor is actually good if you mix it with milk, not so much if you do it with water, but the benefits are apparent, maybe not physically but I do not feel so tired and out of energy as i did before taking this, hopefully it will help me increase muscular mass but as far as helping me recover energy it does great!
 Do not listen to anyone when they say this tastes good. This DOES NOT TASTE good. I knew right when I smelled it, this is gonna be a horrible month since i take 3 scoops daily. God help me.
 I have been using this brand by Optimum nutrition for a while and always recommend it to others.  I like how it is low in carbs, and sugar and there is lots of protein.  I am not sure if they changed the vanilla ice cream or not....but it is different.  I will definitely be getting the chocolate next time and trying a different one for the vanilla ice cream.  It isn't my favorite flavor anymore.
 The best powder on the market with the best price. I have had multiple kinds of protien powder but keep coming back to this. It doesnt taste chalky or bland but has a nice flavor without a bad after taste.
 I have had a few other protein powders, been trying to find one so I can get more protein in for less cost and they seemed like the best route to go especially if trying to keep the calories low. This is by far the best one I have had. I’m not dreading drinking my protein shakes anymore. I will say it is not as good as the premixed Premier protein drinks in my opinion, But as far as the mix at home powders go this one is by far the best that I have ever had.
 Best protein for the price, lasts forever, tastes great, solid calories, mixes well just in a shaker cup
 I am thankful that I could find a "coffee" flavor  protein powder but I don't like the fact that it tastes sweet! I drink coffee without sugar and the sweetness is making it hard for me to have the desire to drink!
 I read others reviews on this and saying it tastes a little funny...it does have a bit of an awkward taste but come on, it's whey protein powder, what do you expect. I think it is just fine and if you blend it up with some frozen strawberries a banana and milk you don't taste the awkwardness.
 I have been working out pretty heavily for the past 3 months. I work out for 2 hours 4 days a week and 2 miles before that. I never thought in a million years that I would buy this stuff but after seeing the reviews, I had to give it a shot.<br/><br/>Taste:<br/>Not too shabby, another review said the strawberry tastes "deity". It does have a slight hint of something other than sugar but all in all the stuff resembled a bland Strawberry Instant Quick.  ...which is good, since quick was the sweetest thing I think I have ever drank. 1 out of 10 I give the flavor an 8. As in I could drink this stuff for a month with out any worries.<br/><br/>Results:<br/>After using it for 2 weeks I did start to see more of a build after a work out. Before taking this supplement I noticed a plateau in my muscle growth. After 2 weeks my arms started gaining again. ...This stuff works.<br/><br/>How to use it, for men anyways:<br/>Take your weight and then use that number to use the number of grams of protein per serving. Example: I am 200Lbs so I take 8 Scoops (8x24 grams of Protein) which puts me just under. With the nice rounded scoops I use, I can assume I am taking the proper amount.  ...Honestly though I take about 100 grams a day, 1 scoop before and 1 scoop after a work out, and they through out the day I will take 2 more. From what I read your body can only absorb 24grams in protein in a 3 hour period.  ...may want to look that up your self. Another review I read, a fellow used 2lbs container in 45 days and he saw results.  ...no way he was doing 8 scoops a day.
 it tastes like Vanilla....Um... flavor is pretty good. It also seems to suppress my appetite a bit - BONUS. what else can you say. I'd buy it again. I do feel like it is doing good for my muscle mass.
 It's fine. Just BARELY qualifies for my price filter ($10 a lb, never pay more), and is just SLIGHTLY better than other whey proteins. It also has less saturated fat, just by .5 grams per serving. I wouldn't have paid more, but I did have to buy the 10 lb. size to get what I would just call adequate. Nothing spectacular.
 What can you say in a review of a protein powder? I buy the Double Rich Chocolate flavor. It mixes well in a blender, tastes great, and I have confidence in the quality of the protein. I've used this product for about 5 years and have never been disappointed.<br/><br/>Personal recipe: 8oz of skim milk, a handful of mixed frozen berries (blueberries, raspberries, blackberries) and a scoop of the protein powder. Mix in blender for about 10 seconds. Best morning protein shake ever.
 First time switching from BSN Syntha 6.  Was concerned the flavor would be gross but the Rocky Road is actually every bit as good as BSN offerings. I'll probably stick with this brand as the calorie / protein ratio is much better.
 Tastes amazing and works as intended. Despite what some reviewers have said, Double Rich Chocolate flavour does not contain sucralose (at least mine didn't). Pick a flavour and look through the pictures (ingredients list provided) before you buy if you care.
 This whey protein is effective for people who do muscle building. I like the double chocolate flavor! It really tastes so good! it’s not really thick compared to other whey protein! So I recommend this product to everyone!
 This is the best tasting shake I’ve had. Naturally it still has that weird protein taste and smell, but it’s hardly as noticeable. I don’t use a lot of water with mine, just enough to break up the clumps
 Using this product for years now.
 I was once tiny like worm, am now big like dumptruck. Toss some of this in your water and watch your gains get gained right before your eyes. I've only tried the rocky road flavor, and it's actually pretty tasty, so I don't plan on switching.
 I have used this protein many times, I bought it from Amazon when it was the deal of the day and was not disappointed! Great price for it!
 I've been using Optimum Protein and also BSN Syntha-6 protein for years now.  From a purely nutritional standpoint, this product is hands down the best I have used.  It contains must lower sugar content than other protein powders.  The downside is that the taste/flavor is a tad bit dull.  I've tried 4 different flavors, but my favorite is Chocolate Mint.  Try using very cold water when mixing the shake and the flavor won't be as noticeable.  4.5 stars, knocking off a half star for flavor.
 Buy it hear for less money than at a GNC and save yourself from having to deal with cashiers that try to persuade you into buying other stuff you don't want.
 It feels odd to review something so dependent on your own individual work ethic for results, so I'll just say this:<br/><br/>This is, by far, the tastiest and easiest-drinking chocolate protein powder I've bought. I keep trying other brands and I keep coming back to this one.<br/><br/>As for the rest? Who knows whether all the #SCIENCE jargon on all of these tubs actually does anything. I just know that the first step is actually being able to drink it.
 This is the best flavor they sell, without a doubt. Protein powder has a very distinct flavor/aftertaste that is common to all the flavors except this one. I will always buy this flavor from this point on.
 This flavor actually tastes really good mixed with water, unlike any of the others I've tried (Strawberry Banana, Cookies &amp; Cream, Extreme Milk Chocolate, etc). This is a huge plus for me, since mixing with water is so much easier and healthier. This flavor also seems to be less lumpy than the other ones, but maybe partially that's because mixing with water helps prevent lumps compared to mixing with milk or almond milk.
 Having used this particular flavor for a few months now I can tell you two things. 1. It is pretty bad with water, I could somewhat stand the chocolate version with water. 2. I'm only about half way through this Cake Batter flavor and have already become tired of it. Perhaps I'm just being suborn, but when I first got it I couldn't get enough. My advice would be to take it slow if you are used to a different flavor.<br/><br/>Having said that it goes pretty well if you want to make a smoothie. My favorite combo uses two bananas 4-5 cubes of ice and 1 cup of milk. Adding anymore starts to take away from the flavor of the powder.<br/><br/>TL:DR Its a good flavor, but take it slow.<br/>  Try making a smoothie with it to enhance the flavor if you do get burned out.<br/>  4/5 Because the flavor seemed to get old to me, still good when made in a smoothie.
 its not like a miracle powder, but sill its one of the best protein sources out there.<br/>It mixes really well with water or milk, at least it mixes far better than others i ve tried. I used to take pro star protein but I really prefer ON.<br/>I thought extreme chocolate milk flavour was going to be really good but not so great as expected. When mixed with water, tastes like chocolate with no sugar on it at all. Still, when mixed with milk and ice, tastes like chocolate milkshake.<br/>You wont see any gains if you dont eat well and train hard. Its not like a meal replacement.<br/>I do recomend to take it only after workouts and not at breakfast. At breakfast you can take other meals that have some protein on and cost lower than a protein shake like eggs or maybe some yogurt with cereal even some fruit.<br/>I also like this when its mixed with fresh outs, banana, milk, honey and ice.
 I had previously purchased and loved the taste of a 2 lb bottle of the Chocolate Mint Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard (supposedly this exact product but smaller). I liked it so much I bought this 5 pounder. Once I tasted this, it was terrible in comparison. No mint flavor. Somewhat chocolate-y. Very disappointed and now I'm chugging my way through this huge bottle of meh-tasting protein. I'm sticking with 2 pound bottles from now on since quality control with the flavor seems to be lacking.
 Went for the milk chocolate. Great flavor. This stuff is a good source of protein and also helped me realize I'm seriously lactose intolerant :)
 Man that’s one legit protein shake. Just ordered the 5 lb one. I just wanted to try if it works and to my expectation it did worked. Happy with the purchase. Signing out soon to be Asian buff dude 😎 yeah!!!!
 My son is preparing to leave for the Marines and in his preparations and all last year he has been using this supplement powder to help better develop his body in a way that will help him be a great asset to the Marines he says it works well. It works best before a workout and he used it often.
 I am an avid buyer of Optimum Nutrition Whey Vanilla and Mocha Cappuccino Flavor and I have to say the Cookies and Cream is the worst protein flavor I have ever bought of any brand. Makes me nauseous each time I open the container
 I've tried multiple gold standard flavors and this is by far my least favorite. At first I thought I didn't add enough powder since the taste was very diluted. However, after trying it again, it became clear that the flavor is the issue. It tastes very watered down and not the double rich chocolate I was expecting.
 Great protein supplement.<br/>Been using this for years<br/>Hard to beat the supplements in this with the taste
 This is the best whey protein in my opinion. Food is always the best way to get protein though. If you do not reach your protein goal this way, make a shake.
 This is the best Whey for pure protein without additives.  I can have issues with lactose at times but seem to have no problems with this whey isolate.
 This is probably the best protein powder on the market. It really is the gold standard. Great reputation as a company, which is very important when buying supplements since you never know what you are getting. I always feel significantly more sore the next day when I skip the protein shake post workout. I like the coffee flavor a great deal. Tastes AMAZING with milk and not bad with water.
 I been exercising and supplementing consistently since 2003.  In my 20's I tried all the most popular supplements: protein blends, creatine, pre-workout, intra-workout, etc etc.  Now in my 30's I only care about staying fit and healthy and the only supplements I use is a good multivitamin and this product.  All the fads and gimicks don't work.  All the additives in combo supplements/shakes are doing more harm to your kidneys and liver then benefiting your muscles.  ON Gold Standard protein is just that.  You can rely on its quality and effectiveness.
 Protein gets 5/5, the vanilla ice cream taste, gets 3/5. Extreme milk chocolate is the best flavor, it's a classic milk chocolate taste.
 I ordered the double rich chocolate because sucralose is no longer an ingredient (good news) and has been replaced with aminogen (good news).  I ordered the 10lb bag and found that there is no sucralose... but there is also no aminogen in my bag.  The Optimum Nutrition website lists the ingredients, and aminogen is listed.  Why is it not in my 10lb bag?!  Optimum nutrition needs to get their act straightened a bit.
 If you like the taste of coconut this is for you you! One of the best tasting protein powders I've had. I've also never had a protien that mixes so well. It literally never clumps! I usually mix it with whole milk and after 10-15 sec of shaking it is smooth as silk! This is also my first time trying this brand so I'm assuming their other flavors mix well, too.
 This product works well in combination with other Optimum Nutrition products to help build muscle and add weight. Using this product along with exercise can produce amazing results. The taste is reasonably good making for easy and tasty consumption. These are large containers that will last a long time.
 I took the advice of my good friend who is a bodybuilder in San Diego and tried this product.  10 pounds of a quality, delicious and effective whey protein mix for under $90.00 with free shipping?  That's right!  I have noticed great definition, strength and recovery results after using this product after weight lifting sessions for just under a year and I stand by this product wholeheartedly.  I find that if I add 2 frozen bananas with two scoops of this product and some water, I have a protein shake with a ton of protein that tastes just like a milkshake.  This product is a deal!
 I've tried several different whey protein powders and Optimum Nutrition beats them all hands down.  The Double Rich Chocolate tastes great - although, I'm not quite sure why they call it "Double-Rich".  With that name, you would expect it to be extra chocolatey but it's not - it tastes like regular chocolate to me.  I mix two scoops with 8 ounces of milk, throw a few ice cubes in there so it thickens up a bit and gets extra cold and voila! yummy goodness with over 50 grams of protein to boot.
 The taste is decent. The only thing I have to compare it to is the double rich chocolate flavor and what I immediately notice is that the strawberry flavoring doesn't cover the suclarose flavor as well as the chocolate. It doesn't taste objectionable and I will have no problem finishing off the package I just don't know that I would order it again. That said, it definitely taste like strawberry and if that's what you're after this should do the trick for you.
 I read the top-rated reviews for other flavors and chose them over traditional flavors. They're horrible. I gagged practically every time I tried one of the others.<br/><br/>Chocolate is definitely the best. I usually blend this with peanut butter, oats, and milk and it actually tastes good. In terms of nutrition, it makes it very easy to meet protein intakes while bulking.
 this was recommended to me by a friend who had been using this for awhile.<br/><br/>i'm super impressed with the taste and even though it isn't a hunger suppressor, i don't feel hungry for 3-4 hours after a shake.<br/><br/>i drink it with pineapple juice or skim milk + fruits (banana, kiwi, berries or apple), ice, and nonfat low carb yogurt or greek yogurt. keep it around 250 calories per.<br/><br/>it is a decent price as well. HIGHLY RECOMMEND
 I've been taking Gold Standard Whey for a few years now, on and off. This Double Rich Chocolate mix is awesome. It genuinely tastes good.<br/><br/>The only downside is mixing it in a blender. After a few seconds, it really thickens up. I've found that added 50-100% more water smooths it out for the most part. Just be prepared for a 32oz shake when you were expecting a 16oz.
 Very strong banana taste. Good price for the amount of product. A little upset that there didn't appear to be a quality seal on this variety, but it sounds like some flavors do and some don't come with one. Scoop was buried and the first shake tasted fine, so I'm not worried about tampering. But all 5 pound flavors should come with a security seal, ON! (if you read these reviews)
 the specs on this are exactly what I wanted. Taste is a bit less "than good" but not to the point I am "holding my nose" to drink it. Everyone says this is the biggest bottle they have ever seen...  :)
 Can't believe how full it is!! Usually it's all settled and the container is half full. Very impressed with the amount of powder. I was hoping for a little better in the taste department, I had a powder I once loved, but don't remember who made it? It was amazing!! This tastes better than most....(white chocolate)
 So I have to give a bad review to the chocolate mint powder flavor. It's not what you would expect, the chocolate flavor is barely there and there is more mint flavor than anything else. It's kind of gross unless mixed withsome other things. But I do have to say this is my favorite brand of PROTIEN powder it works well and it helps me make gai s the flavor is just terrible.
 The price and the amount of product you get is a STEAL! Each container comes with 72 servings and it can easily last you 2 to 3 months depending on how often you use the serving size (if you only take the shakes during workouts 5/days a week it will last you a long time). Always invest in larger containers like these instead of the smaller ones because you're getting more product for your dollar. Tastes great too. The White Chocolate flavor is very suddle and not as apparent as other flavors, so I will try Cake Batter next to see how it treats me.
 I've gotten the smaller package of this item a few times before and always thought it was the best there was. I had been out for some time and was missing it, so I was happy when the 10 lb bag arrived today. Double chocolate is amazing, far better than the more generic flavors sold locally at the big boxes.
 This is a whey that I've been using for many years, and always been happy with the product.  I turned to Amazon for this purchase because I found the pricing cheaper than my normal distributor.<br/><br/>This is a good whey.  It's not a thick whey, meaning that if you only mix it with water, it tends to be very watery. However, if you mix it with some milk, it makes for a great shake.<br/><br/>As always, quick shipping, and the product arrived in tact.
 Probably one of the best tasting whey proteins I've ever had. Mixes very well even in milk if you have the correct ratio. Some people complain because they either aren't mixing it well or have very little liquid in it. Definitely makes me feel so much better after a good workout to drink this. I usually feel like crap after unless I've glupped one of these down.
 I love this whey.  I have the double chocolate which honestly tastes like chocolate milk.  I have often purchased vanilla whey products because chocolate flavors always tasted more chemical.  I mix this with skim milk and it really tastes like a treat instead of a supplement.  Why make fitness and protein consumption a chore, buy double chocolate whey!
 This is a great product and I will definitely be purchasing it again! The extreme chocolate milk flavor is very good and is comparable to nesquik ( I always use milk though) the nesquik like flavor makes it very easy to drink!
 The Double Rich Chocolate is the way to go. When mixed with water it tastes like hot chocolate that you let cool to room temperature. Really good, mixes well, and no artificial taste at all. Get those maximum gainz
 Good product...I enjoy mostly all of ONs products. The flavor on this is def artificial....but still a good protein shake
 Worked amazing and is extremely tasty with milk. With water not so much. If youre gonna use water go like 25% milk and the rest with water. Sounds gross but that was the best way I found it with water.
 This stuff is amazing.  Tastes great and dissolves much better than other brands of whey protein I have tried.  I got the strawberry banana flavor.  Can't speak for the other flavors but I'll probably try them out.  It works great for making high protein desserts as well.  Do a search for "protein powder recipes".  This stuff works great for that.
 My favorite protein,great flavor and quality.This is one of the only proteins out there that isnt spiked. I love this protein and they have a customer for life
 From the second I opened it I smelled coffee.  This tastes nothing like cookies &amp; cream.  It has a bitterness that you would associate with coffee.  I don't enjoy coffee, so I would not order this again.
 Not only is it high quality whey, but it tastes great and dissolves very easily. I've tried a few others and this is my favorite by a long shot.
 I'm no bodybuilder, but I know my recovery times are cut with this product. It is high quality, no side effects etc, and alongside good workouts, is doing its job of supplementing what I can't possible get from foods unless I want to eat tons of meat and get gout.<br/><br/>I've also experimented with using this about 30 min to 1 hour before workout, and I think it provides more stamina during the workout, enabling me to go harder even when working multiple muscle groups for increasing heart rate.
 A LIFE INVESTMENT.<br/><br/>The chocolate whey is quite delicious. As a body builder who eats very little animal protein aside from egg whites and fish, I rely heavily on whey  as a source of protein and nourishment. For those of you who don't have an appetite in the morning, you can mix this powder into a glass of milk or even water to start the day. You can even add it to things like whole wheat cereal and plain oatmeal to give a great taste in addition to protein. I consume about 1 gram of protein for every lb of body weight per day, which in my case is about 160 lbs. It was very important that I invested in a protein supplement that contained all natural ingredients. The FDA recently conducted a study that found no toxins or potentially harmful ingredients in Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Whey. In the past I have used BioChem EAS whey. Gold Standard not only lasts longer, it also has a much better taste in my opinion.<br/><br/>Definitely one of the best decisions I have ever made for my body.
 This stuff is great! It's a no B.S. protein powder. Tastes great (Double chocolate) and has no pre-workout junk added to it. Will definitely keep buying in the future.
 DELICIOUS indeed. I was afraid after reading the most recent reviews stating that now it has sucralose in it and unbearably sweet to drink because I  can't drink or eat anything too sweet, however, delicious strawberry is perfect. My flatmate who goes nuts for anything sweet does not like this because it tastes too mild. Perfect for me
 Mix with milk and it tastes just like a strawberry banana milkshake! Doesn't have the same chalky taste that vanilla and chocolate tend to have.
 I can only give it three stars at this point it's to early to tell. I gave it a review because it does taste great and mixes really well. I have stomach problems and I have no negative effects from the product.
 Bought this on the recommendation of several online blogs the at said it was among the best tasting.  They nailed the vanilla ice cream flavor, it's delicious.  I cut its sweetness with unsweetened almond millk.
 I have had bad strawberry flavored whey protein before, and this is definitely not one of them! This stuff tastes fantastic. I mix in a little coconut oil as well as a teaspoon of hershey's chocolate, and it tastes like something you might get at the bar of a beach resort in some far off exotic locale.
 I have tried many different brands of protein powders, but I found that this powder tastes the least like protein powder and mixes very evenly. I think that many powders can become clumpy even with the appropriate shaker bottle. This product offers a great post workout supplementation for recovery and building muscle. The only downside I can find is that it costs a bit more than the competitors, but I will definitely purchase again!
 Flavor is not as good as some other brands I've tried but mixes well and easily<br/><br/>Better than Pure Protein mix which sucks.<br/><br/>Been a Body fortress user to this point, so I'll report back if I remember if the gains are any better with this product
 While the product mixed very well and tasted fine with milk or water, it was VERY SWEET to my taste.  I did not expect it to be sweetened since, silly me, I only checked the label for sugar content and didn't think to check for artificial sweeteners.<br/><br/>I bought the vanilla flavor so it would go with smoothies.  It also makes a kick-ass iced latte-- out of coffee or tea.  Brew it hot with twice as much coffee/tea leaves, pour over ice, swirl it around to make it cold, and then take out the ice cubes before you add the whey product or else it will clump all over the ice.<br/><br/>Overall this is a good product, but I would prefer an UNSWEETENED variety.  Maybe that would taste like crap, but I would rather add honey, maple syrup, or Stevia to something if I want it sweet.  I will try the "Natural" version of Optimum Nutrition's whey protein when I am out of this one.
 Strawberry is good and mixes well.
 I started to use this product month and a half ago looking to put some healthy weight, I am not body Builder nor one of those ultra strong guys, I am just the average Joe looking to improve my Physical appearance without looking like a wrestler, so far this product has done a good job along with a routine of 3 times a week of gym and healthy diet, as I said I am not pro in anyway but I have some muscle in all my body, just the right amount, I guess if the product can do this for me, must work wonderful for those looking like Mr. Universe.<br/>I like it.
 This stuff works well to blend with some ice in the morning for a cold Mocha Frap - great tasting flavor.
 I first got optimum when I started lifting seriously and the results were impressive. If you are on the fence about supplementing protein GET THIS. As soon as I started supplementing protein I experienced muscle gains from doing the same workout. Not only that, I lost weight. I would recommend Optimum because it is in my price range, it has little sugar, a solid amount of protein and it TASTES GOOD. The double chocolate does do not hold me to any other flavors.
 The Double Rich Chocolate tastes like my favorite brand of hot cocoa! Works great in water or milk by itself, or mixed in with oatmeal. Would definitely recommend if you're looking for a great tasting powder. Mixes well in any kind of blender bottle, or even stirred into oatmeal. Great taste, great ingredients. I will continue buying when my five pound tub is out!
 Some proteins have been extremely hard on my digestive system. This one has never caused any discomfort. It is more expensive than most but if you can afford it, its well worth it
 I have only ever tried this and Shakeology. Shakeology had more sugar and less protein, not to mention was more expensive, so I tried this instead. The vanilla flavor tastes like vanilla pudding to me when I combine with almond milk, so it's fairly easy to drink!
 I avoided this brand for years of bodybuilding, ignoring every article and suggestion I read because I'm cheap . I dealt with almost every brand I found and paid for it in stomach aches or nausea from horrible taste and bloating.  I finally cracked, spent the extra money and I am sold. 2 weeks in I still can drink it everyday with no problems. It tastes delicious (double rich chocolate), gives me the extra protein I need for bodybuilding and doesn't make my stomach turn inside out. About the only brand that comes close for me is Muscle Milk which tastes a tiny bit better but costs more per pound and made cutting next to impossible because it was fattening. On is a superior product and I will buy it exclusively now.
 No Whey this Whey can be that good! Been taking this protein for years and even have my girlfriend buying her own. Many years to come.....!
 I dont know<br/>If it was the whey<br/>or the way<br/>I worked out<br/><br/>but now my arms<br/>are bigger<br/>no doubt
 Lets start out by saying this is the one of the top whey protein powder choices on amazon market, i am not new to whey protein, but the store i buy it from no longer stocks it so i decided to order off amazon, first i would like to say that this is a great addition to most workouts, but you need to remember this is no magic that will make you gain muscle or loose weight, all results are because of commitment and dedication.<br/><br/>now a little bit of the cons, This product is not all natural and if you order the wrong flavor you might have one with aspartame and other artificial sweeteners in it.<br/><br/>I use this product to make protein shakes after my gym workout, i have been using protein shakes for a while with great results, i have recently been introduced by a few close friends to some supplements that would inhance the speed/progression of workout results and this is one of the key components if you do not already get enough protein from your diet, or you need to supplement it.<br/><br/>the conclusion, if you are willing to be dedicated to a workout regimen, and you keep good nutrition this suppliment should help see results.
 Protein tastes AMAZING! I got the Mint Chocolate in the 5LB tub, which I wasn't sure about, but I don't regret it at all. Mixes thick, even with skim milk. However, if you take a utensil and mix it then use a shaker bottle, it comes out smooth. The 5 LB tub should last about 3 months if you take one shake a day. The tub says 72 servings, but it actually comes out to around 90. Impressed.
 I love it.  I've been looking for a protein powder to use with water and tastes good.  I love chocolate and vanilla, but hate that's the only two "normal" flavors usually available.  I'm not into the fancy Raspberry Chocolate, Peanut Butter Vanilla, and so forth.  So happy to have another option.  And an option that tastes delicious and fills me up.  It has really helped me with my hunger.  I always struggle to get enough protein and this helps tremendously.
 This is a pretty good product and flavor is good (although too sweet for me) it mixes up great in warm and cold liquid. I've switched protein powders due to this one containing ingredients I'd prefer not to put into my body.
 Not a huge fan of the vanilla ice cream I just ordered (which the 2 stars is specific to). Too sweet. The other flavors from ON I've had have been significantly better. Specifically, I really like the mocha cappuccino. Overall though, mixes easy, digests well, good stuff.
 This protein powder is one of the only ones that I use for various reasons;<br/>1. it is very pure. It barely has any fat or carbs, and it is pure protein.<br/>2. Because of the above reason, it is fairly low in calories compared to other brands like *ehem* musclemilk<br/>3. It is very good for its price. If you go to any other supplement stores, they will at least charge 1.5 times the price that is charged on Amazon.<br/><br/>Overall, a solid product at a great price. I highly recommend this for anybody trying to gain mass
 This is the ONLY protein powder that I have found that I like. I am very picky because it has any sort of lumpy texture I gag. I have mixed it with cows milk, almond milk and water and I like them all. Of course cows milk is the best because then it truly tastes like chocolate milk.
 Best tasting protein that I've ever had personally. And it mixes in pretty well. I find if I use warm water, stir it up, and let it sit for a minute there are no clumps when I drink it. Be sure to put the water in first though otherwise it clumps to the bottom of the cup super hard.
 Delicious strawberry not so delicious to me. Has an aftertaste. Maybe cause of dairy derivative ingredients.
 Double Chocolate - 1 1/2 servings with 1 cup of warm milk hits the spot like a hot cocoa, while getting my protein in.<br/>Really delicious for a protein powder.
 This stuff is great. Excellent chocolate flavor that tastes just like cold cocoa. Does not upset stomach and definatly helped with my recovery during post workout. Easily breaks up in a shaker bottle. Large container means this lastes a while. Noticed bigger gains then when I was not using it.
 I bought this protein powder because of its high protein to fat, sugar ratio.  Each scoop has 24 g of protein but only 1g fat and 1g sugar. (Many other powders and ready-to-drink shakes have higher fat and sugar content.)  This particular brand was recommended to me by a personal trainer for exactly this reason.<br/><br/>The flavor is okay, but it's a protein powder, it's not going to be delicious without increasing the amount of fat and sugar. I'm on my second 5 pound tub and haven't gotten sick of it yet.<br/><br/>Some suggestions on how to eat it:<br/>I put one scoop in my plain oatmeal every morning with some fresh berries, making a low-Calorie, protein-packed breakfast. The berries improve the taste drastically.<br/><br/>Make a smoothie with banana, strawberry, skim milk, and a scoop of the powder. The smoothies are more work to make but taste great and are really refreshing after a workout.<br/><br/>Mix a scoop into a glass of milk. You can mix it with water, but I don't think it tastes good. The only issue with the milk is that the powder tends to clump in the milk instead of mixing completely. I still use this option because it's a quick post-workout snack.
 This is simply my favorite protein shake.  It is bursting with fresh banana flavor, but mellowed by a subtle creaminess.  This creaminess also lends to a velvety mouth feel that lends itself well to other additions like: Cocoa Powder, Powdered Peanut Butter, Almond Milk, and etc.  This is the second time I've purchased this, and don't think I can change.
 I'm somewhat disappointed in the flavor of this product.  I got the rocky road based on a lot of positive reviews, but I found it a bit gross.  Plus nothing I try and mix it with, hides the overwhelming flavor.  However the powder does dissolve fairly smoothly.  It blends better with water than milk, and I typically try to do it ahead of time and leave it in the fridge.  It comes out the most smooth this way.  I have tried the double rich chocolate and liked that flavor much better.  However I only tried it once and if it was day in and day out, I might change my mind.  Plus I'm no lab scientist, but the amount of unknown ingredients are a bit concerning.
 #1 protein on the market. Love it.<br/><br/>Pro's: easy to drink, inexpensive, easily dissolves in water, low in calories and fat, high amounts of BCAA's in each serving.<br/><br/>Con's: None?<br/><br/>This protein + creatine (also by ON) and maybe a shaker cup and multivitamin are the only supplements you will ever need. Don't be fooled by all these other scams and expensive proteins.<br/><br/>EDIT: just bought the Mint Chocolate after finishing 10 pounds of regular chocolate and needing a change. WOW! Great change of pace. Just enough mint. 10 stars
 Great quality and tastes great.  It ends up with a few clumps no matter how carefully you mix it in, but that seems par for the course for these products.
 Everyone knows that ON makes some of the best whey protein out, no need to get into all that. I absolutely love the Chocolate Mint flavor. ON adds digestive enzymes to their protein, it really does help. Other protein "blocks" me up, never have any problem with ON Gold Standard. I mix mine with skim milk, mixes well, tastes great. I'm not too worried about the bro science of not mixing whey with casien, it works very well for me. I have tried it all, it's the only protein I buy now.
 I bought this just recently and used it only once or twice, but the effects were significantly noticeable right off the bat. I usually forgo eating dinner then jog, followed by a light workout (pushup, pullups, situps, etc), and it kept me going even after I usually stop. So much so that even though my muscles were exhausted, my energy was still going strong and I wanted to keep going only after a short break. What was really amazing was that, I was not sore the following day! The flavor is not too bad. It almost takes like watered down Yoohoo, but not as sweet. There are tons of smoothie recipes online so taste won't be too much of a problem.<br/><br/>But enough about the product, I want to commend Amazon for their great service in this review and feedback..  I won't get into the specifics but Amazon went above and beyond with their customer service and gained my loyalty for life. If every company had such outstanding service as Amazon displayed with me, then Consumer Affairs would be out of business.
 Good price and love the 5lb size.  Considered to be one of the top proteins on the market and ordering through Amazon it works out to only a few bucks more a pound than budget protein
 I can't tell you 100% it works or makes a difference..But I love the taste and I believe the added protien helps. I lift 5 days a week, 2 hours a day and did I mention I'm 46 years old with 18" arms and 31" waist..I going to keep taking it and eating 5 lbs of chicken beast a week with a tons of almonds, skim milk,lean beef ,eggs, spinach, sweet potatoes, raisins,bananas and flaxseed ..Leave the sodas and crap on the store selves and you'll see a huge difference..Your diet is 90% of your workout..
 I love that it doesn't clump up like most I've tried in the past.<br/><br/>Edit: finished the first batch. Still maintained non-clumpstatus at the end. I gained 5 pounds (though Christmas/Thanksgiving probably had more to do with it). Happy.
 One of my favorite proteins to use, or actually, is my favorite since I have already ordered this three times.  I enjoy the banana taste which goes well with any other mixture of soft drink.  I mostly use water to mix it in.  Some times I will make smoothies.  Great for recovery especially right after work outs and in the morning after.  I use once a day, but I try to use it twice daily.  Trying to bulk up but not too much.
 I was recommended this by a colleague with a MS in kinesiology and an interest in sports nutrition.  He said it was an "okay" product and that there are much better products out there. Being on a budget, I just went with this. Soon after I purchased, I read an article where a lab tested whey protein, specifically BCAA content that is claimed by some reputable companies, and I was disappointed to find out ON's results for Gold Standard.  Here is the link:  ...]
 The wife and I have tried several protein mixes in the past, but this one far exceeds the others.<br/><br/>First, the flavor, we got the Mocha Cappuccino at the wifes request. It's not bad at all, and I'm not a cappuccino or coffee drinker at all.<br/>Second, the consistency. It's not grainy at all like some of the others we're tried, it's very smooth, and we only use blender bottles to mix. They say you can use a spoon, but I'd be a little leary of that myself, as there is always a bit (very tiny amount) of powder left unmixed at the bottom.<br/>Third, and this was the biggest for me. I think these shakes tend to taste awful when mixed with water, but I'm lactose intolerant (even though I love cold milk). The digestive enzymes ON uses make this a non-issue. I can drink a full glass, and feel not even the slightest cramp or gas bubble later in the evening, not a twinge. With other brands, even though they say they use digestive enzymes, I had to use almond milk because at the very least, I'd feel bloated later in the evening. This goes down smooth and doesn't bother my stomach in the slightest.<br/>Once this is gone, we'll definitely be buying ON brand from now on, I'm thinking the double chocolate next time.<br/><br/>There really is no downside for me, hence the five star rating.
 This and Now foods whey protein isolate are the only protein powders I buy.  Optimum Nutrition never disappoints when it comes to quality and the nutritional value of their products.  Double rich chocolate by ON is by far the best tasting protein I've tasted and also contains  minimum amounts of carbs compared to others.
 Excellent protein powder. This was my first purchase of a bulk protein powder supplement and since this one had very good reviews I decided to give it a go. Yes, it is more expensive than most other options, but the fact that it tastes excellent and supplies a hearty amount of whey proteins make it worth it to me.<br/><br/>I first tried the single 1-pound bag of the Double Rich Chocolate flavor (about $15 at time of purchase). Initially, I tried it mixed with just water - and it was great! I would describe the flavor profile to be most similar to that of the prepackaged hot chocolate you buy at the store like Swiss Miss. Initially upon the first sip or two, there's that distinct and mildly off-putting protein beverage taste, but after a few sips you don't even notice.<br/><br/>I then tried it with ice cold 2% milk - whoa! Way better! Even less of a protein-powder taste and it dissolved quite well. I've had success in mixing it via blender, cocktail shaker with ice, or just in a mason jar. Personally, I like using the cocktail shaker with ice because it makes it super cold while keeping the froth component lower than the blender, although it also works great in smoothies if smoothies are your thing. I have since purchased the 5-pound bucket which at time of purchase was about $59.<br/><br/>Can't say that I have any real complaints about the actual product. Great taste, and very nutritious. I have one serving with milk after each weight training workout (4-5 times weekly). I would like to see it priced better like some other options, and I hope that Optimum Nutrition considers making more sample-size 1-pound bags of other flavors besides vanilla and chocolate available on Amazon. I would love to try other flavors besides the Double Rich Chocolate one I've tried, but I'm wary to drop $40-$60 on something I may not like.<br/><br/>All in all, great product that I would recommend. Definitely planning on being a return customer with this one. Blessings!
 Taste weird, i am using this product since few year, the one i got from amazon taste too sweets, i am buying always from GNC, this time i tried from Amazon,  taste really bad.
 I switched to this from the Costco protein I normally get. They are roughly the same price, but the ON Whey has less sugar (by 1g) and more protein per scoop. The taste is pretty awful, it lacks the full chocolate flavor I am used to from the Costco protein I used to get, so mixing it with just water, as I am used to doing, is out of the question. It took me around 2 months to finish this off, using about 4 scoops a day for the last month. I have now started mixing this with shakes in order to maximize taste. I've found that in berry smoothies and other ideas you can find on BodyBuilding.com the protein is excellent. 4 stars for bad taste, but excellent results. Has no bloat factor and I've seen steady muscle mass increase as I've added this to a balanced diet and exercise routine. Have already ordered again.
 Mixes well with water or milk, a very nice coffee-like flavor, if you are a coffee lover, this is for you(Mocha Cappuccino)! Provides the necessary protein and BCAA in a scope with minimal sugar a win-win for sure.
 My son uses this he is a workout nut.  Drinks several a day, and is getting some nice looking muscles. Taste great mix in small blender.
 One of the best protein on the market. Easily blends in shaker cup, blender, and by spoon stirring. If looking for strong vanilla taste, then this is the protein for you. Taste comparison is that of french vanilla creamers used for coffee, a robust and smooth flavored followed by a pleasant aroma. There is a vanilla ice cream flavor, but I have looked at other sources and reviews that it is a disappointment. This protein is macro nutrient friendly for anyone wanting to watch what they eat or making some gainz! If taken once a day after a workout, product should last around two-three months with its 73 servings. I bought this product for $57.99, it was the best bargain I was able to find and plus with amazon prime arrived in two days with free shipping. Overall, I highly recommend this product and for the cost, one is certainly getting the most bang for their buck.
 My friends hyped it up and I bought it. Some of the reviews are dead on when they said it doesn't taste good. They say it's extreme milk chocolate but it barely tastes like chocolate. Someone posted a picture of the drink in the reviews claiming it looks like spitwater....and as much as I want to argue that, I can't.
 I usually never review anything but I think this one I have to at least say something. While I think the product is extremely high quality protein from a well known brand...the taste is horrible. I wish I would have bought the smaller container for that reason. It was horrible to get down with just water. Its barely decent in milk. I guess this is my own personal preference but I will definitely be buying a small container of a different flavor in the future. I cant wait until my 3 pounds are GONE!
 This product has a strong mint taste. If you like Andes candies, and are planning on blending it with milk and a banana, you will likely be happy. That is what it tastes like, but with a chemical, artificial aftertaste. I don't care for chocolate mint, not even in ice cream, so I never would have ordered this flavor.  I gave it a shot once it arrived but couldn't make myself use it. Amazon promptly refunded my money, and I bought chocolate, which I like very much, in the store.
 I've used this same product for about a year now and am really happy with the quality. I felt sick at first drinking this because I guess my body wasn't used to it, now it's part of my daily diet. It helps especially when I'm strength training particularly hard. I haven't compared it to many other products but the ones I have also claim to be the best which don't come close to this. I think I really like the fact that I get everything I need in quanity while maintaining quality and ontop of that I get my chocolate fix! mmm chocolate
 Have ordered Vanilla, White Chocolate, and Double Chocolate. Each one, tasted AMAZING. However, I recently found out I had psoriasis and that dairy was making it worse, which is around the time I started taking whey protein....Needless to say, I've had to stop consuming this and switch to an alternative. Will miss this protein powder.
 Stuff tastes pretty good.  Nutritional value is spot on.  I would recommend ordering some PB fit and mixing it in.  Blend that with a banana, ice, and this protein powder and you've got yourself a pretty tasty meal.  I will definitely purchase this again.
 Excellent value. It's much more cost effective to buy the 10 lbs bag.As far as the quality of the protein, it really is the gold standard. This is the best mid price protein out there. All protein powder taste awful to me but this one is passable without all the extra added junk you get with other proteins.
 My favorite protein powder! I prefer the Chocolate malt over the chocolate, as it's more creamy. Amazing with milk or mixed with cold brew coffee and ice. Breaks up easily in milk or water without a blender ball, so great for on the go or mixing if you don't have your Blender Bottle handle. Tastes pretty decent with water alone, but obviously tastier when mixed with milk!
 It's pretty good. I can't really speak to the building muscle but the flavor is good! I drink it in the morning with just water and blend it in the blender. If I actually want it to taste good I mix it in with a cup of milk, a banana, and some ice, and you get a pretty good smoothie! This is the double chocolate flavor by the way.
 This stuff is incredible.  I've purchased numerous types of protein.  This stuff (malt) tastes incredible.  If you put it in milk, it tastes just like a milk shake.  This protein will not leave you feeling bloated, gassy, and all of that other nastiness that some of that stuff gives you.  Highly recommend!
 This one &amp; Rocky Road are my favorites.  If you like Along Joy &amp; need your protein fix, this one is for you! Its not too sweet &amp; mixes well with Almond milk.
 It is a trustworthy product. Been around for a long time. Great discounts every once in a while at Amazon as opposed to other online retailers.
 Double Chocolate: 2 Scoops in about 18oz of water mixed very well (no clumping) but the taste was extremely bland.<br/><br/>Would not order this flavor again.
 I am sensitive to so many artificial sweeteners and such in protein shakes and I can drink this one with no side effects. I love the flavor and ease with which this mixes, even in just a shaker bottle. I think I finally found my go-to protein powder.
 I have used Whey Optimum nitirition 100% whey gold for over a year and a half now. It is packed with protein and does help with muscle building and shorten your recovery time after you work out. I have tried the vanilla creme flavor and would say it's a 4/5, but stay away from the cookies and cream. The cookies and cream taste more like a coffee flavor and it's not that great; more like a 2/5. I would recommend this to anyone who is starting to build muscle because it does help out. The shipping was fast in that it came in a week and cheaper to buy on amazon than in-store.
 Tastes fine with just water, which is a plus. No side affects. No quantifiable way of knowing that it is doing anything positive, so not doing anything negative is good enough for me.
 Tastes great, like melted ice cream. While that may sound intense, the flavor is very light and easy to take.
 I bought this protein powder having heard that it was the best flavor by far. However, after trying it, I realized that it was not the best flavor, but just kind of an average flavor. I can only sometimes tell that it's rocky road... other times it just kind of taste like chocolate with a funny aftertaste. I will say though that it's not bad at all, I just wasn't floored by it.
 Definitely a light and enjoyable protein blend to take if you have a blender bottle or a blender. I bought the banana cream because it was cheaper than the other powders and I really enjoy blending it with strawberries, milk, yogurt, and peanut butter. Comes out tasting amazing and very nutritious. I might try another flavor for fun when I finish my current tub, but overall very satisfied and will definitely be ordering again.
 LOVE, LOVE LOVE! This is without a doubt the best tasting protein powder I have ever tried! Blend it with a bit of milk and ice cubes and if I didn't know better, I would swear I was drinking a Wendy's frosty. It blends really easily as well, doesn't clump up like some protein powders I have tried. If you don't have a blender bottle handy you can mix it with a spoon and it mixes really well.
 This is a review for the coffee flavor.<br/><br/>Pros: it tastes really good. With milk it tastes like melted coffee ice cream. Without, it tastes like a specific brand of Korean coffee ice cream melted (not as milky) so still pretty good.<br/><br/>Cons: smells really off and rotten-ish. Everytime I open up the container I'm hit with this smell of rotting creamer/milk smell. I think it might be from the bit of dried creamer in the ingredients list but I can't be sure.<br/><br/>I'm really hoping others can confirm this smell and assure me it's normal since I've been taking the stuff for a few weeks now.
 Excellent flavor, it doesn't have a harsh aftertaste. From what I read from reputable sources (other than the company's), the protein is a higher quality protein.  It is a little costlier than other brands, but you definitely get what you pay for.<br/>Only ~120 calories, ~2 grams carbs &amp; ~25 grams of protein per scoop.<br/>If you use some 1% or skim milk, you get a more satisfying shake, but even when it is mixed with water, I wasn't disappointed.
 Taste isn't great, but from what I hear, Double Rich Chocolate isn't everyone's favorite, and that's what I got.  What I will say is it mixes well in a shaker bottle, with no clumping.  I like that it's a low calorie option, and I can make it a heavier meal if I throw in some milk, peanut butter, and a banana.<br/><br/>If you're coming from Syntha-6 (like I did), know that this is a huge step down in flavor, but it's much lower calorie and has higher quality protein.
 Love this stuff, with out it my muscles are really sore. I'm old and have lots of health problems. 👍
 My son loved this product so much that when he finished I ordered more. He does have more muscle mass ! Recieved on time !!
 Giving this a three star rating because YMMV with different flavors. I had the coconut chocolate and double rich chocolate which were amazing. I decided to try out some different flavors and got the 2lb version of cookies and cream and caramel toffee fudge. They may just be bad batches, but both are terrible. The C&amp;C smells and tastes like spoiled milk, and the caramel toffee fudge has a very bland taste and smells like a forgotten shaker bottle from the bottom of your gym bag as soon as it hits the water.  Tried both flavors with water and with 2% milk to see if there was any difference. The only change was the consistency of the shake.This will not deter me from further ON purchases, but I will most assuredly not be purchasing those flavors again.
 Definitely the best protein powder you can find. It last awhile and the amount of protein and other nutrients you get can't be beat. The price is great and the shipping was fast.
 I mix mine with milk and drink it after my daily morning Crossfit workouts, and after a good hard mountain bike or road bike ride.  Helps fill my tummy up and holds me over until lunch.  And it tastes great.  I'm on my second container already and I'm not tired of the taste yet.  Tastes just like chocolate milk.  I use organic 2%.  I've tried it with nonfat milk and it was just like drinking chocolate water (yuck!).  So I recommend at least 1% milk.
 Tastes great (ordered Chocolate Mint) and can be prepared easily without the need of a shaker which makes cleanup a breeze! Will definitely recommend!
 I was worried about taking a this protein shake but one of the person trainer at my gym said it was perfect for me. So I started taking it I didn't notice anything but after a month or two of just working out and drink this shake. people were noticing I was getting bigger and then two months later I noticed I was in great shape.i strongly recommend this protein shake.
 Like the taste but it has sucralose in it, AKA SPLENDA!!!!!! Do you fools think we are stupid??? Do you think I want cancer???? I am working out to be healthy not to take a protein shake and get cancer. SHAME on YOU!!
 You can trust ON brands. They don’t have a lot of fillers and they make sure to give you good product for the price. Only brand I use.
 this is one of the best proteins out there.It has a whey blend of Isolates and concentrate, with 5 grams of bcca, and glutamine.I did a lot of research on Optimum products.I bought the five pound double chocolate cause it was a great deal at Amazon.when I get a little tired of the chocolate favor,I can allways add a banana or peanut butter in it.I had the chocolate peanut butter 3lbs. before,so I decided to go for the five pound and make my own.there know need to go out and buy more bcaa, because you have it , all in one thanks Amazon..
 Taste good blends nicely many uses shakes, pancakes, addition to yogurt etc - low carb low cal<br/>Love this protein have used many will stick with this one
 Love this brand. Tastes really good. When compared to other whey protein bags I believe ON had the best deal, best bang for your buck when I did my research. Has a great amount of protein per serving and has a great amount of servings per bag when compared to the other brands out there. This is my go to whey protein. I've been open to trying others but have yet to find anything else.
 Tastes pretty good and overall has a lot less artificial fillers than other brands. I got this because it had the highest ratings for protein powder and I definitely think it’s worth it.
 I know I'm not supposed to just drink it for the taste, but it's actually the best chocolate drink I've ever had.
 Great tasting protein shake. This makes a big difference. It almost doesn't make any sense to weight train unless you drink a protein shake afterwards. It takes a couple weeks, but you start seeing gains a lot faster than when you only workout. Getting to the gym is hard enough as it is, it's nice to get more out of every workout.
 I bought the one pound in double rich chocolate. I have never used a protein powder before. It is not very sweet, but that is a good thing! The less sugar the better! I highly recommend using skim milk or unsweetened almond milk to mix it with because it doesnt taste very good mixed with water, but it is still edible if you absolutely HAD to use water.
 I've used various whey protein powders and really like both the vanilla and chocolate Gold Standard.  The vanilla is actually delicious!  I don't drink it alone, but mix it with 30cal, vanilla almond milk, spinach/kale mixed leaves, fruit and a little vanilla extract.  Sometimes add no salt Trader Joe organic peanut butter. Yum!
 I've tried other whey products and always come back to this one.  It is not the cheapest but it is the best one that I have used.  It mixes very well.  Most importantly, the taste is excellent.  I used to get the Vanilla Ice Cream.  It is really good if you want to mix some fruit in a blender.  The Double Rich Chocolate is my standard though.  The taste does not get old like some of the others I've tried.  One thing I like best is that I can fill a mixing bottle (this is a great one  Single 20oz Sundesa Blender Bottle) with powder, keep it with me and fill it with water when I need it.  It still tases wonderful with water instead of milk.
 I'll get this brand when it's cheaper than competitors. They all mostly taste and perform the same to me.
 I have tried tons of proteins and flavors and none of them compare to the Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Whey. The Double Rich Chocolate is about as good as it gets when it comes to chocolate flavored whey. It mixes extremely well and I never have problems with chunks in my shakes. The combination of cost, amount of protein per serving, and flavor makes this, in my opinion, the best protein available.
 This is by far the most tasting Protein Shake I have tried. I was recommended to try this brand but to get the Rich Chocolate. It does not taste "fake" as other shakes have some weird flavor. Will re-order 100%
 This is not the first time I've purchased and used ON Gold Standard Whey, but it may be the last. I have never had a problem with this product before, but  for some reason I get stomach cramps every time I eat this stuff. I think it might be a bad batch, since I'm not lactose intolerant and (like I said) it's usually not an issue. Very disappointed.
 I am not an expert at protein but this product was highly reviewed in many places.  The surprise for me is that it tastes reasonably good.  I mixed it  some soy milk and water.  it dissolved well in a water bottle after some shaking.  In the past I bought powders but always tossed them out because they tasted so awful. What a surprise
 I've always loved this protein powder, it is effective and cheap. There is a very low sugar content, almost all of the calories come from protein, so its great for someone trying to cut fat while gaining muscle. The only downside is that it has a kind of high cholesterol content, but I wouldn't let this dissuade anyone from purchasing.
 Notice increased rate of recovery and increase in gains within the first few weeks of using it.<br/>Been taking it 3 times a day. (One in the morning w/ breakfast &amp; before workout, one after my workout, and one before I go to bed.)<br/><br/>My biggest gripe is that I got the Rocky Road flavor, while good tasting, it contains sucralose (splenda) in it.<br/>While I'm not terribly concerned because the amount of the sweeter is very low in the powder. (i.e. You would need several large scoops (1/4-1/6 of the container) before you even came close to the amount that is in one can of soda)<br/>Next time I purchase I will be buying the vanilla flavor as it does not contain sucralose in it.<br/><br/>I cannot say whether sucralose has any long term health effects, but if it does, I would prefer not to find out on myself.<br/>Happy with the results, not very happy to discover sucralose in it. Since it's my own fault for not researching properly, I see no reason not to give this product five stars because it works beautifully.<br/><br/>ON is one of the only companies that has been found not to lie or alter the truth on their labels. Other companies that offer protein powders can differ by up to 20% on their labels, so do your research!<br/><br/>I used to buy BCAA's and Glutameine seperately, but since this is a blend, it fulfills my daily intake of what I usually would take, saves me money.<br/>I also take ON's creatine powder w/ the protein powder three times daily. I found using the creatine w/ the protein powder helps it mix with the water better so I don't have powder at the bottom.
 Tastes. Okay mixes better. Stopped using because there's more protein per scoop in other types
 Optimum nutrition, it's THE protein that everybody gets when they start working out. There is a reason for that. Great product
 Double Rich Chocolate is one of the better ON whey flavors, although not the best.  I'd probably rate it a 7/10.  That said, it has a good macro-nutrient profile and mixes reasonably well (anything other than cold water is easy; in cold water a shaker is advisable).
 Not very impressed unfortunately. It's ok... not bad but it doesn't compare to Cake Batter, which I've ordered once again. The only flavor where I've actually made a second protein shake just because it tasted so good.<br/><br/>My brother on the other hand didn't like it, saying "it tastes like cake batter... you don't want to drink cake batter, you want to eat it." Whatever that means, it smells and tastes great to me.
 Chocolate taste is not my favorite. It has too much sugar and could have higher protein per serving to stay competitive with other brands.  I've changed brands since.
 Way overpriced. Good protein but you can find brands with the exact same content for much cheaper. Don't be fooled by clever marketing.
 Very efficient and cost effective whey. while the pricing might not be as cheap as some brands it gives you the best bang for your buck. would suggest pairing it up dextrose and BCAAs post workout for the best post workout recovery.<br/><br/>Whey is just super convenience to balance out your daily protein macro needs. I usually measure my foods to have a more precise view of what macro intakes are and whey shakes are a god send for when you have nothing readily available.<br/><br/>If food is consistently available on bulk (egg whites, skim milk, fish, chicken breasts, lean cuts of beef or pork) then don't worry about it. but if you want something nice and convenience then whey is pretty much the way to go.
 I did some research on this and selected this brand of protein powder. I am quite happy with the product in terms of nutrient content and price.<br/>I will definitely purchase this again..
 OP products are always pretty great. They dissolve well, taste great and most importantly have the best nutritional value.
 This was a hard protein powder to get used to - it's not sweet. I don't need my protein to taste like a milkshake, but this was pretty unpleasant to chug down. It also tended to stay a little clumpy, but a Blender Bottle helped with that. It also kind of made my stomach hurt if I drank it before a workout, and didn't eat a real meal with it at the same time. Don't try this for the first time by getting the five pound size...
 Horrible Taste just couldn't stomach it.  Didn't do anything for hunger.
 The protein itself is great, but the flavor is what really ruins it for me. I love cake-batter flavored desserts and treats so I assumed this would taste as great as those sweets. I was 100% wrong, this flavor just tastes like a super watered-down version of vanilla with sugar added to compensate for that watery flavor. Despite this experience with the taste, I will still continue purchasing this product because its it the best you can get for your money! But before you get a tub over 2lbs, really pay attention to the flavor you chose because you might be stuck with it for a while.
 This protein has won supplement of the year two years running and for good reason.<br/><br/>Mainly, you get what you pay for. This protein is what it claims, 100% PURE protein. Unlike other brands that claim to be pure, an quick look at their ingredients show that they are far from that.<br/><br/>Gold Standard doesn't skimp on quality which is evident when you open the container and try it for the first time. It's ultra powdery consistency and the way it blends into your milk clean shows that there are no additives or filler.<br/><br/>If your stuck on what flavor to get, I'm a BIG fan of mint Choco chip. It almost tastes like a treat than a necessity to muscle gains. As far as other flavors, my wife loved caramel toffee but I found the caramel flavor too overpowering. Rocky road is good but pales in comparison to MCC and double rich Choco is a safe bet for those less adventurous.<br/><br/>Also, don't forget to take gold standard casein protein before bed for maximum muscle gains.
 Happy with this purchase! The order qualified for same day shipping/delivery and the price was great. The delivery driver who brought it was so nice. I picked the milk chocolate flavor and my husband and son are very satisfied with the flavor. Look forward to ordering different flavors.
 It tastes ABSOLUTELY NOTHING like white chocolate. But, it does taste pretty good. On the flip side, it doesn’t dissolve very well it’s very very clumpy. And there’s no scoop so hope you have one.
 High in protein, low in calories and carbs! This particular size has lasted almost 4 months,  a shake every morning for breakfast for 2 people in our house! The Coffee flavor is very good, not to sweet. Great with almond milk.  I have found it cheaper to buy protein in bulk, makes a much more cost efficient choice than buying tubs at Walmart half this size, I was spending twice as much!
 This stuff is good for keeping up your protein intake with minimal calories. I lost about 20 lbs while keeping my riding performance up so it works well enough. Taste better than the hydro stuff; kinda like boring hot chocolate mix.
 This flavor is great, best protein powder I have ever bought.  This is my tried and true brand.  Mixes great with coffee,milk or just plain water.  Just make sure the coffee is not too hot otherwise your powder is get all goopy and gross, so add ice to cool it down some if you need to.
 Tastes great, mixes easier than the store-brand stuff I was buying before, and it's cheaper. Nothing to dislike, yet.
 Only protein I take. Some flavors suck “cookies and cream” had to choke that down. Does it’s job, also fills me up enough so it’s a nice snack if I think I’m hungry.
 I've bought several varieties of Optimum Nutrition's whey protein, and I can definitely say that it's one of the best out there based on the results I saw when using it as a supplement.  The powder also dissolves very well in liquids compared to other leading whey protein products and the taste is pretty darn good.  That being said, I think some flavors are a little milder than others.  The Double Rich Chocolate is one of the less flavorful in my opinion, so if you are looking for something sweeter, I would recommend Extreme Milk Chocolate.  All in all, you really can't go wrong with ON.
 The protein, itself, mixes effortlessly and is very finely milled. As for taste, I got the strawberry banana. I was skeptical about how it would taste, but it ended U.S. trasting really good and satisfying sweets cravings. Very similar in taste to the Wonka strawberry and banana Runts which I have always liked, so it's good in my book.
 First I will mention as other reviewers pointed out, the container has a tamper seal but is not sealed air tight...so powder is all around the lid when first opening.<br/><br/>I personally dont find this to be a problem...<br/><br/>The container is huge and provides a ton of servings. The chocolate tastes great in milk and not too bad in water either. For the price it is a great deal.<br/><br/>I do wish they made it easier to find the scooper inside, I had to fish around looking for it in that huge jug of powder! lol
 Hey man, you want to make some gains! That's good, real good.<br/><br/>Now buy this protein bro. Tastes great, says to add 8 oz of water per scoop, I'd go with 12 Oz, just dissolves with less effort.<br/><br/>Unlike some proteins this is high quality because it dissolves relatively easily. While your at it, get yourself a blender bottle if you haven't already.<br/><br/>And also, there are no problems with digestion. This is the first protein where I can have as much as I want of it and not face any complications with digestion.
 I have tried more than 10 different brands and nothing even comes close to this, albeit a little pricey, this has been the best. I'm only talking about the double rich chocolate flavor though.
 I use it everyday, it is a little weak but the taste is good. Just add ice cubes.
 I needed extra protein in my diet. I especially love it I smoothies
 I use a 5 pound in a month (3 scoops a day) and believe you me I have tried every GNC protein flavor. I can confidently say this is the BEST protein shake flavor I have tasted. It is subtle at the same satisfying. Out of all the flavors for some reason this one mixes the best in water and milk both. It tastes heavenly in milk (I sometimes add a dash of coffee). I like that it does not have the strong sugary taste like the strawberry at the same is perfect to the palate.
 If I had only known this stuff would taste this good, I would of ordered it a long time ago.  It mixes easily with water in my shaker bottle.  It's also about the cheapest price that i've seen.  Only thing I wasn't prepared for was how huge the container is...the size of a small child.  My appetite isn't as big as it used to be.  So this really helps me get enough protein throughout the day. I take it before and after my workouts.
 Only protein I will ever use. They finally got the bag right. It now hase a zip type re sealable top. I can dump protein from this to my smaller bin and I know they let over protein is properly sealed. Don't waste your money on crap quality protein in those small containers from Walmart. Buy bulk and you will save so much money in the long run.
 Very mixable, yummy and I don't even like chocolate. I'll drink hot chocolate once in a while, but I never really crave chocolate. This stuff is really good. I tried the "Delicious Strawberry" but it was way too chemically and it kind of felt like I just got done licking a 9 volt battery. I have learned my lesson, sometimes different just plain stinks.
 AMAZING!! I love this powder; it tastes like chocolate milk and easily mixes. Does not upset my stomach like RSP Nutrition did. Love this mix!
 I prefer this chocolate over double chocolate, tastes like milk chocolate bar when mixed milk.
 Great source of protein . Although I had ordered 15 servings pack and I think the quantity was not as much as I expected. But quality wise this is the best whey protein out there!
 Thia is the best protein whey that i had. I ordered vanilla ice cream. I think the flavor depends on how you would like to drink it. For example, I mix it with fruits. So if you get the coffee or chocolate flavor, you cannot mix it with fruits because of the taste. However, every flavor you get is gonna be boring, so in my opinion is better to try different flavors.
 I bought this as part of a diet and without having any idea of how would it taste. I have to say that this shake tastes really good with ice cold milk, but since my diet also limits milk intake, I've had to drink it with 4oz of water, which is also acceptably good. The price vs volume vs protein per serving ratio can't be beat. Very happy with my purchase.<br/><br/>In case this review gets lumped together with all flavors, I'm referring to Vanilla Ice Cream.
 Pros:<br/>-Cost per Gram<br/>Cons:<br/>-Doesn't keep me satiated like other whey blends<br/>-Weak flavor. Even combined with fruit or berries have to add 5-7 grams of Stevia to make it bearable with milk. With just water it's plain nasty.<br/><br/>Won't be purchasing again since the price point was the only redeeming factor and that is offset by the amount of Stevia I must use with it.
 It is the benchmark for a reason.  Helps to bulk up and tastes/mixes great.  Only thing some people may not like is that it does contain what seems like a decent amount of lactose.
 I've been drinking the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor for years now and it was a neutral flavor that worked well in water, milk, or whatever liquid of your choice. However, this is the NEW IMPROVED GREAT TASTE and in my opinion, it tastes awful now.  Overly sweet and a somewhat synthetic aftertaste. It tastes pretty similar to the French Vanilla flavor they have.  I'm not sure why they changed the formula because I will not be getting this flavor again.<br/>If you don't mind paying a little extra for your whey protein isolate, i recommend the Isopure Vanilla as an alternative. It's a little pricier, and the instructions suggest you use two scoops for 50gm's of protein per serving, but that much really isn't necessary.
 My son loves it and uses it after his soccer training, games and training sessions.
 I really wanted to like this. So much so that I bought the 5 pound jug. Sadly, it makes me sneeze endlessly as I am allergic to corn and so they must be using corn as their source of Modified Food Starch because all other ingredients are found in other products and don't bother me. So, I have cut back to using it only as a backup if I run out of Cellucor and then only a reduced amount. Too bad as it tastes pretty good.
 Great taste and mixes well. There aren't a lot of optimum whey protein flavors I can say I really like (usually not much flavor) but this one is a keeper!
 I NEVER write reviews here, but after trying this I just had to. This is the best whey protein powder I've ever tried and I've had some pretty bad ones. I ordered the double rich chocolate flavor and mixed it with some milk after my workout and it tastes just like chocolate milk. It mixes very well and doesn't leave those nasty chunks some other powders do. I'm very happy with the taste and consistency of this product!!!
 I was buying cheaper whey protein, and stepped up to this after a lot of research. I am glad I did. Good taste. Higher quality. Price is higher, unless you buy a giant 5 lb bottle like I did. Then the price is the same, per lb that is. Your wife will roll her eyes at you when you explain your reasoning.
 BEST DEAL EVER! Sprouts sells Unflavored Whey Isolate at about 10 bucks a pound. This is about 8 bucks a pound, comes with a scoop and taste like chocolate. Bang for buck, this is ideal choice it terms of whey protein (as supplement). Does not throw me off ketosis, i take 4 scoops a day.
 There's no alternative to this protein supplement. You get all the protein you need and amino acids from a trusted brand. It doesn't have a lot of calories so its perfect to use when trying to cut. I've tried 4-5 of their flavors and they are all fantastic. Don't waste your time with a cheaper brand, you are getting exactly what you pay for.
 I've been lifting for approximately 20 years and have tried numerous supplements and protein powders.  This is by far the best protein powder I have ever used and I have been using it for the past 4 years.  These are the main reasons why I like this protien over the numerous others I have tried in the past:<br/><br/>1) High protein vs. carb/fat ratio: 24g/1g/3g<br/>2) Will disolve in water<br/>3) Tastes great for not having a lot of sugar<br/>4) Good price<br/>5) Low level of metals typically found in other protein drinks
 This mixes very easily, which is a huge plus. You really can just stir it into water with a spoon, but a shaker cup still works a little better. The flavor is good (I got extreme milk chocolate). I wish it was a little thicker when mixed, but I think that's why you can mix it with a spoon. Definitely wirth it for the price.
 Someone visibly tempered with the expiration date and the batch number. You can clearly see the scratch lines. Why would anyone take their time to do this if not to deceive..?<br/>I’ve realized that after I’ve taken a serving. Now I’m feeling unsafe after using something I’ve bought with my money in order to promote my health... what a world we are living in.. smh..
 The double rich chocolate flavor tub is perfect.  I was expecting something akin to fudge, but it's the perfect balance of sweet and tolerable.  Lets be honest, nobody would want to eat 16 oz. of fudge batter.  Your teeth would rot.<br/><br/>The powder mixes with water so easily.  I shake it in my blender bottle 5 times and it's already completely dissolved.  It's pretty filling so sometimes I'll down a cup for a fast breakfast.<br/><br/>Overall it's a great value, anyone looking at protein already knows it's benefits. No use preaching to the choir.  This is the best value you'll get for whey protein, quality and quantity wise. And taste, don't forget taste.
 I've tried french vanilla, extreme chocolate and mocha cappuccino.. so far loved them all! This brand of protein is my favorite thanks to it super easy absorption into virtually anything. I mix it into pancake batter, oatmeal, yogurt or just plain milk / water.. no chalky weird taste after!
 I love ON gold standard protein. It tastes great and easily mixes with a shaker. I always get cookies and cream. Which is really good! So I wanted to try another flavor. Mocha cappuccino is tasty. Taste like chocolate milk with a hint of coffee. Would buy again.
 I've been drinking ON protein for the past 4 years, and tried almost every flavor. Best protein I've had compared to others, hands down. Personally, key lime pie, vanilla ice cream, and white chocolate are the best
 I have been using Optimum Nutrition for years. I love them, I will not use anything else
 Works really well. I used to use Body Fortress but I decided to try this one because the 5 lb seemed to be a better deal. This mixes a lot better, and I don't feel as gassy later on. The taste was a bit odd at first but it's not bad. Tastes like hot chocolate. I also don't feel as sore after my workouts, and my muscle growth seems to be a lot better.
 I've been buying this protein powder for years and always the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor. I took one scoop out of my most recent tub and immediately noticed the taste difference. It was sickeningly sweet and no longer enjoyable. I checked the package to make sure I bought the right flavor and saw the "new and improved great taste" label. Still good powder, but I would steer clear of this flavor.
 This giant jar should last you a good few months, and is a decent deal for the price.  The biggest reason I'll buy this brand again, though, is that it's definitely the best tasting protein shake I've ever had.  The Banana Cream flavor, when mixed with milk, really does taste like a banana milkshake!  The consistency is also perfect - no clumps or goo left at the bottom of the bottle.<br/><br/>Bottom line:  I'll never buy a different protein shake again.  I'm getting more as soon as this runs out.
 Great protein supplement. I prefer the 5lb amount since its more economical in the long run. The double rich chocolate flavor is awesome and can be added with anything to make an even better shake. Works for both males and females; I really saw fast improvements in my muscle growth when using the Whey, also not much muscle fatigue the next day after gym.
 Love this protein! I mix my protein with frozen fruits and look forward to my post workout shake every workout. It may be a little on the expensive side but it's well worth it for ON's quality.
 The malt flavor tastes amazing and as always tastes much better with cold water
 Hands down the best whey powder I have ever purchased. Will be ordering more every two weeks.
 Double Rich Chocolate flavor tastes very good and mixes very smooth in a basic blender bottle. I find the taste is substantially improved in skim milk, versus just water. But it is still agreeable with just water. I am a repeat customer. Never bothered trying other flavors as this one is very good and I'd hate to end up with 5 pounds of a flavor I did not like.
 This review is for Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard, Extreme Milk Chocolate, 5 Pound.<br/><br/>I am a veteran to supplements, especially protein.  As a weightlifter for the past 18 years, I can tell you I have tried dozens of proteins.  This, by far, is the best for me.  It has been my go to protein for the last several years.<br/><br/>I get no digestion issues.  No gas, no upset stomach, nothing.  It mixes easily with water and a shaker cup, and tastes great when mixed with other foods, like bananas and peanut butter.  I weight out the protein on a kitchen scale, and find that I get more than the number of servings listed on the container, by several.<br/><br/>A note of caution, and this is for any powder supplement.  Use a scale.  The scoops are generally not accurate.  They may be close, but if you need 64 weighted grams to get two servings, two scoops may be less, or often drastically more.  Invest in a ten dollar kitchen scale, and really know what you're taking in.
 The rocky road flavor is amazing. I've been drinking cookies and cream MTS for a while now and decided to change things up and I've been very happy. It blends very well. It tastes phenomenal. I mix mine with unsweetened almond milk and find it to be great. Very happy and will continue with brand and can't wait to try different flavors.
 I have used and experimented with many protein supplements.  $ off $ and pound for pound this is by far the best of the best.  I am completely happy with the results, the flavor, and my wife appreciates it too...no not just because of the intended results...this is the first protein supplement that doesn't cause obnoxious gas.  I questioned that the nitrogen levels in my blood were too low but the results rule that out.
 Me and my hubby love this protein . Last forever for both of us. Drinking one everyday (2)
 Probably the best-tasting protein powder that isn't full of junk on the market.<br/><br/>Whey is better than soy, especially for me--doesn't mess with your estrogen levels.
 This is my brand of choice for the calories and protein ratio it is perfect for me. The flavor isn't too over powering and it easily mixes with water, milk, coconut milk or coffee. Yes I like to mix the vanilla with coffee.
 Best tasting powder I've tried (double chocolate), just like chocolate milk with no weird aftertaste or grittiness. I'll go for one of these shakes instead of a chocolate bar and it takes care of any cravings.
 I have been training with weights for many years, and protein supplementation has always been an important complement to that.<br/><br/>In the old days, I got a large portion of my protein from cans of tuna I would carry (along with a can opener) in my lunchbox to work every day.<br/><br/>The advent of protein powder changed that, and I have used several different brands of whey protein isolate over the last ten years, all of them of good quality.<br/><br/>But I think that this Optimum Nutrition product is the best of them. I recently ordered my third 5-pound container of the Double Rich Chocolate flavor.<br/><br/>The flavor is the best of any chocolate protein supplement I have ever had. The product mixes better than any other powder I have ever used, mixing completely and leaving no clumps (I always mix it, with ice-cold water, in a BlenderBottle, another excellent product which I highly recommend).<br/><br/>Additionally, when ordered from Amazon in the 5-pound container, this is an excellent value.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this excellent product!
 I searched around for a protein powder that did not have a lot of fat and refined sugar.  Seems like most of them are loaded with sugar.  I know some other posts here don't like the sucralose but I have never found any credible sources of research that says it is bad for you.  And refined sugar is definitely bad for you so I'll stay away from the known evil.<br/><br/>At first I was mixing this.  Tried spoons didn't work too well, tried forks and other mixing instruments and it was OK but lumpy.  I always put it in milk, tastes best this way to me.  Then I started to shake it instead of mixing it (shaken, not stirred) and boy is it much better that way.  Very seldom do I get a clump and it is much creamier.  It tastes good.<br/><br/>I'm not a scientist or dietician but this stuff squashes that "protein hunger" I used to get.  I work out 5-6 times per week with weights and generally consume 3 scoops per day (I think that is about 100g).  For me, it is a real bargain and works well.
 Whey protein was not sealed
 Keeps me from getting hungry and helps me through my workout. Great flavor. Don't know much since this is strictly the only ones I use and I don't see reason to try different ones and the price is amazing.
 So far, this is my favorite flavor of ON powder. It tastes like a vanilla milkshake. It also blends really well in my shaker cup.
 Tastes great. Doesn't make a thick shake. Adequate amount of protein for moderate frequent exercise. Filling and worth the money. If you are looking for something after a run or average gym use to increase protein intake this is perfect. flavor is great. Got the extreme milk chocolate. Best chocolate flavor I've had yet. Highly recommend
 This product is hands down the best protein powder on the market. The quality is by far the best of any I’ve ever had. I order the 5 gallon tub and it will last me roughly 3 months, so for the price it would be hard to find a better deal. I would definitely recommend this product.
 Product results in what I wanted was okay, felt full with just fillers. Taste (chocolate) was not very good but tolerable.  Mixing was not good either as it didn't dissolve real well and left clumps all the time.
 My favorite protein. I've used it for years. Great flavor and easy to mix with anything. What else is there to say!
 I was a little hesitant about trying this after first making it because it didn't smell the best. It tasted great! It was smooth and easy to drink. I will sometimes add a spoon of peanut butter, which also gives it a great flavor. I have noticed that if I drink it in the morning, then I am less likely to snack on junk food throughout the day.
 My go to protien which is affordable, tasty and healthy! I love coming back to this item
 I started off with the ON Platinum Whey and downgraded to Gold because I figured I wouldn't notice the quality and save some money. I was wrong, because it really does differ by a lot. I know most people get the Gold Standard because the Platinum is a lot more expensive. If you can make a few sacrifices in other expense areas, and instead spend more for the Platinum Whey, it's like night and day in my opinion. The Platinum Whey tastes 10x better, it's thicker, feels like great quality and goes down easy. I've had family members make a Platinum shake just to drink it because they like the taste! The Gold by comparison felt watery (even when I doubled the scoops) and tasted horrible compared to the Platinum.
 Great protein powder.  Taste pretty good.  Will be buying more when I run out!
 This is my favorite whey protein. I have been using same from last one year and it has helped me to get the gains. I am not a serious bodybuilder type but have got some muscles. I drink 2 scoops before workout and it has been good. I like the taste too and it mixes faster than other whey I tried.
 I bought this as a cheaper alternative to BSN’s protein powder. First off, the taste is not as potent as with the BSN Chocolate cake batter, but it is still palatable and good tasting. It makes thinner shakes than the BSN using the same amount of water. You get more protein per scoop, at the same time you getting fewer calories. If you are just looking for a basic protein that tastes good at a fair price, then this is a pretty safe bet.
 Worth the few extra bucks for a superior product, I take with coffee and after a work out and like this protein
 Not sure if they've change the formula or something but the taste is off.....Its very watery and to make matters worst they sold me a product that expires in MARCH 2018 and I bought it in JUNE. This is ridiculous....
 I have tried several other proteins and although they were not bad, I soon started to notice the expense they were becoming.  I then started doing some research through some trusted websites and came upon this brand, and I must admit that I will never try another brand again.  This brand makes all the supplements you need for anything that you're into, and this protein in particular gives you the most for your dollar.<br/><br/>- Servings -<br/><br/>With 75 servings in one of these, with a subscription through amazon you will be paying less than .50 cents for each serving.  Each serving giving you 24 grams of protein, among other things as well that are included (see label).<br/><br/>- Price -<br/><br/>As stated earlier, you cannot go wrong with this brand of protein.  You simply cannot ignore the quality of the protein and the relatively cheap price for which it sells.<br/><br/>- Taste -<br/><br/>Delicious!  Do not be fooled by the natural look, this brand has done its homework and they give you quality.  You don't see any shinny containers, huge muscle guys on the label of the container, or anything that screams buy me!  They rely on their quality to speak for itself.  The taste of this protein is pretty good, specially with a low sugar content and it is super easy to mix.<br/><br/>Overall, I cannot be more satisfied with this protein and I highly recommend it to everyone I come in contact with. I hope this helps you as well.<br/><br/>** UPDATE ** 12/8/2013<br/>I am still loyal to this protein power and still recommend it.  I've tried a variety of flavors and none disappoint  me.  I think the strawberry banana or just strawberry are the most tasteful for smoothies.  Enjoy!
 Best all around protein out there. Been using about a jug a month for 4 years or so. Best flavor to me is the extreme milk chocolate. The white chocolate does not taste like white chocolate, and the vanilla gets old real fast.
 Okay, so here goes the typical review about ON Gold Standard:<br/><br/>It's the best whey protein out there and it's the industry standard for a reason. ON doesn't make you feel bloated, it doesn't make you feel sick, and it's genuinely the most commonly found protein amongst athletes. There's a reason for that beyond the price (even then, it's not the cheapest protein out there).<br/><br/>Once you start taking protein, the 10lb bags are definitely the way to go.<br/><br/>I'll not write any more about the benefits of whey, but rather my experiences with the flavors I've tried (chocolate and vanilla):<br/><br/>Chocolate: this is a pretty strong chocolatey flavor and it mixes really well with milk. I throw a scoop into my vitamix and use strawberries and a half avocado for a really good shake. It's thick and REALLY heavy on protein. (Throw in some chia gel, too!)<br/><br/>Vanilla: THIS is one with a LOT of possibilities! Want a froyo/berry smoothie? Sure. Want to go vanilla with espresso? That works too! I think after I'm done with my current bag of chocolate, I'll be sticking with vanilla from now on. There are tons of recipes, but this is one I used more than anything else: half cup of plain greek yogurt, handful of frozen strawberries, handful of frozen blueberries, almond milk, chia gel, and a scoop of vanilla protein. The vanilla isn't overpowered by any other flavor and leads to a really good taste profile. (If you want the espresso one, it's one scoop powder, 1 cup of room-temperature coffee, some almond milk, and throw in a tiny bit of the darkest chocolate you can find)<br/><br/>And as always...<br/><br/>Father forgive us for the gains we are about to receive!
 My favorite protein flavor so far out of about 10 flavors I've tried.  This stuff tastes awesome and goes down good.  I prefer to mix it with milk instead of water, I give a 10/10 with milk (tastes almost like a DQ banana cream pie shake without the crust chunks), with water probably like a 7/10.
 Love this flavor! Not too coffee and not too chocolatey- perfect blend of both!
 mixes easily. the "double dark chocolate" is the worst chocolate flavor I've ever tasted in a protein drink. I've consumed a lot of protein drinks....
 No frills protein. I love this stuff. Right now I'm stuck with some crap that a relative gave me as a gift that tastes like a spoonful of sugar and is heavy on the stomach. Can't wait to finish that tub and get some more of this!
 I'm on my third tub of ON gold standard whey and it is the best I have one scoop every morning with 12 oz of milk. I just use a blender bottle and it mixes very well. Every other protein I have tried I have stomach problems and gas the first week I use the protein until my body gets used to it but this protein did not upset my stomach. In my personal opinion, I think it tastes great with milk but only ok or so-so with water. I will be purchasing this for as long as I work out!
 I did a fair amount of research on protein supplements and went with this brand because of the fact that it is not heavy with chemicals or metals.
 Been using this for over a year, Happy with it.  They have changed the ingredients, though, switching from sucralose to ace-k as a sweetener.  I prefer now to stay away from artificial sweeteners,  but options are limited on the market.  Too bad.
 Taste is probably a 7/10 but it is protien packed, all quality whey, easy to put down(chug), and very easy to mix with just glass and spoon or a shaker.
 Great product! I use it to add protein and some extra flavor to my daily kale smoothies.
 I love this stuff. I always use this with my green juice after the workout and it taste like chocolate milk. It doesn’t mess with my stomach and I feel good after drinking it. Would recommend to anyone looking for a good taste protein shake mix.
 The vanilla is very sweet. I am not used to artificial sweeteners, I usually buy the Gold Standard Natural which has a very good sweetness level.  This non-natural Vanilla is very sweet and leaves a funny taste in your mouth.  Less calories though...110 vs 130 for the naturally sweetened.
 i really wanted to like this but the taste is weird. it's very light, barely there flavor.
 I use to by this size, but I've buying the bigger size now since I always order it; it's the only protein I use..  Great protein.
 This is the best tasting protein powder I've ever had. And I've run through quite a few. I got the rocky road flavor and I wasn't disappointed. It smells amazing and has a taste to match. I'll definitely be buying from ON from now on.
 This product is definitely on the top of my list of best proteins the runner up which is made by the same company is BSN Syntha 6.  I'd have to say if you take BCAA supplements then BSN Syntha 6 would probably be a better option only because of the EAAs it provides but regardless this stuff is pure mixes extremely well and taste great.
 Been doing P90X and wanted a protein supplement to help me recover after workouts.  I went for the "Extreme Chocolate Milk" flavor and mixed a scoop up with a glass of milk and it tasted like just like chocolate milk.  I used a whisk to stir so I wouldn't get any lumps and this tastes delicious.  I thought I was going to have to force myself to drink a protein shake, but not with this!<br/><br/>Love the flavor and it's a great way to get a boost of protein!
 5'8", 150Lbs. I do super sets and use one scoop after doing 6 to 8 exercises. 10 and beyond 2 scoops. I hit the weights for a full workout once a week, and definitely know this is contributing to the growth and recovery of my muscle fibers. Plus it is delicious. Other days I may hit the gym, but sometimes don't do enough to validate drinking any at all. I add a teaspoon of ON creatine powder to this as well.
 artificial flavor gave me diarrhea
 So, I used to buy Six Stars whey protein but I decided to buy more and online since it saves me time. This one I bought it supposed to be chocolate but it barely taste like that. Is this normal? I put one cup of water with one scoop and it just tastes bad. I am concern the product may be bad.
 This is a great choice for Whey Protein.<br/>Optimum is my number one choice as a post workout drink.<br/><br/>It is gentle on my stomach and very easy to mix and drink.<br/><br/>I prefer the double choc flavour as I find the after taste a little more pleasing than Extreme Milk Chocolate.<br/>But it all comes down to personal preferences.<br/>I look forward to trying out some of the other flavours
 I mix this product with water and rice milk. In the shaker bottle there’s no issue with clumping. The flavor could be better (cookies and cream), but was a nice change from a chocolate flavor.
 Seriously loving the flavor ON protein offers. The chocolate malt is the bomb. Mixes really nicely tastes great and no gritty texture
 I like the strawberry &amp; banana, but chocolate is also great
 I'm lactose intolerant severely and this protein does not make me feel bad. At the beginning you might feel just a tad upset but by your second serving your body will adopt to it. I recommend you try half the serving to see how it goes and let your body know that you putting this into you.
 Best there is, no digestive issues
 Coffee it’s a little bit too sweet but not bad. I prefer to mixed with milk.
 Tastes amazing with water or milk. Works amazing. Mixes 100%. What more could you want?
 The protein tastes great when combined with milk.  The flavor doesn't taste really good with water.  Definitely going to buy again when I get low on this protein.
 I've been using ON products for years in addition to other brands and I always come back to ON.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Affordable<br/>A few shakes in a blender bottle and it's mixed perfectly<br/>Tastes great (I currently have extreme milk chocolate)<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Why can't the spoon somehow be attached to the lid? It's annoying to find it all the way in the bottom of the tub
 Reasonable price. Decent taste and mixes well.
 I have two children that under Doctor's orders drink two protein shakes daily.  This has been a daily struggle for four years now. We have tried several shakes out there. We have ran into problem  with clumping and the children disliking the flavors. This has been the very best we have tried by far. The Children have tried and loved the Chocolate Coconut, Strawberry Banana, and Vanilla Ice Cream. These shake are very easy to mix unlike others I have tried. We are very satisfied with the flavors and product its self.
 Great product to use after gym... doesn’t hurt to get it cheaper on Amazon
 Not only does this taste the best, but it has the best protein to caloric intake ratio.  Low calories, not too much sugar, no carbs and it mixes easily with water or milk.  Can't beat this.  This is a staple in any male/female that goes to the gym.  On the go shake that I take and would recommend is the Pure Protein shake with 35grams of protein and 170 calories.  I stack these two in my daily routine in between meals.
 One of the ONLY whey protein powders that doesnt have a ton of crap in it.  I wanted something that tasted great, but did not have a bunch of artificial sweeteners.<br/><br/>I do not have any clue if this product is actually making a difference in my gains or workouts, but since started taking the shakes, I have packed on about 10 lbs of lean muscle.
 Mixes well, taste is mellow (not too sweet, not too chalky), and does its job beautifully.
 I've tried this product in the past and something is definitely different now. The texture is off and its very liquidy. Taste seems a bit off as well. Really having a hard time to even get one scoop down. Disappointed.
 ON 100% Whey Gold - This is the one you want. Testing done on these have yielded nearly the full 24G per serving as advertised (testing not done by me). A lot of other brands don't come anywhere near serving up a full 24G per, thus they are misleading and you don't get your moneys worth. Yea, this is a bit pricey BUT you are getting what's advertised!<br/><br/>I've tried Mocha Cappucino and I really liked it. Right now, I am trying out Coffee - really good! It's very similar to Starbucks Vanilla Frappucino.
 This seems to be the most popular whey protein powder on the market. It is cheaper than most other professional whey powders and comes in a vast variety of flavors. It mixes well in water or milk but tastes better with milk in my opinion.<br/><br/>As for building muscle, I guess it works...I have tried some other brands of whey protein powders and settled on this one mainly due to its price and availability. I am not a supplement junkie so I am not adding pounds of muscle every week but I am slowly working up towards my goal with nothing but this protein powder and a bottle of Centrum multivitamin for supplements.
 ON is a seasoned brand. So their quality control is pretty good.<br/>But I came to know that chocolate flavor really puts me off, it's a personal choice, Its a decent product but expensive.
 Really taste good and good quality ingredients. I mix this powder with milk and usually eat a banana with the drink. Can be used for multiple purposes. Highly Recommended!
 I have started working out again and wanted a quality Whey protein.  The Fitfather project recommends this as a quality product.  It tastes great and it is low in sugar and carbohydrates which is important for me since I am a diabetic.  I use this every morning to make a delicious breakfast shake and it does not affect my blood sugar levels at all and I feel great.
 The batch of Double Rich Chocolate I got must have gone bad or something at the warehouse. It tasted absolutely rancid from the first moment I tried it. Shrugged it off but finally got a fresh bag from Costco. When compared to a GOOD/regular batch I picked up from Costco, which tasted fine, I ended up throwing away the Amazon batch.
 I got the double rich chocolate, and really like Optimum Nutrition. But this one didn't taste very good to me, the vanilla ice cream was much much better.
 This taste is pretty good. But when I got the delivery, this protain powder was already opened without any seal inside. And powder was filled only about 2/3 of the jar. Feels like used. Is this alright?
 This is some great tasting whey!  I normally hate the flavor of whey protien but I've found the double chocolate by gold standard to be excellent.  I recommend this product to those on high protein diets that want a little more than chicken and cottage cheese but normally can't gag down whey shakes.  You'll like this stuff.
 I have used this brand for five years. I know that this explanation is not really based on science but trust me that you can absolutely notice the difference. I could have a killer workout and after taking a scoop of this protein, I am completely fine the next day. I have tried other whey proteins and again, no science, but I could absolutely feel the difference. You always want an isolate brand, I know that much, because it will target your muscles.<br/><br/>My qualm about this product (and not really, because it is with all whey proteins, mostly) is that it contains a lot of artificial sweeteners, which is not good for someone on a all-natural diet.
 Been using this for 3 years. Remember, this is protein isolates, so bear that in mind in terms of when you take it and such. Helps me get adequate protein intake each day. Athletes often under (or over) estimate their protein needs. I put it in a funnel to go into a water bottle. Add water, shake, and it's good. No need for filters/strainers to remove clumps. I can basically shake it out.<br/><br/>However, if you are looking to mix it by hand in a cup or glass, you'll get more clumping, in which case you should use a spoon or fork to mash them out, as the clumps are actually dry balls of the power that have been surrounded by the wetness of the water. It also takes a little longer for it to be ready if you do this method.<br/><br/>I take a scoop in the morning and bring the bottle with me out the door so it's very convenient to make.<br/><br/>Don't really taste the mintiness much, but it's better than just straight chocolate which I've also tried, so there's at least some difference.
 i have not noticed any gains from using this and of course i work out, in the end real food is best protein use this only as replacement only con is that it should have more calories, DON'T REPLALCE YOUR MEALS WITH THIS
 I am a 55 year old woman who is not trying to bulk up. I tend to have low blood sugar so I’m always on the lookout for a lean protein source. A nurse friend recommended that I try the Gold Standard Whey protein powder for when I need a quick protein boost and don’t have time for a healthy meal. I’m now on my third 5-pound container (each one lasts about two months) and it’s become a diet essential. I’ve stuck with the Vanilla Ice Cream each time because I’m happy with the flavor. I generally blend it in water, but even non-fat milk adds a nice creamy texture without too many more calories. I just mix with a spoon or in a shaker and have never had any problems with clumps.
 Great! Didnt come with a scoop though. 1/4 cup
 Taste perfect, donot like other protein power. Recommended for beginner
 As with the other O.N. whey proteins, this packs it in.  Flavor is great, provided you like coconut (duh!).  I will admit to having never used any O.N. whey with water; only almond, soy, or skim milk, all of which really make this like a shake or dessert drink.  The chocolate coconut flavor is a little intense for me and a 1-to-1 ratio is too strong for my liking, so I dilute the serving just a bit.  Add a banana, pineapple, and/or strawberries and you actually get close to a tiki drink!
 Amazing taste for the double chocolate when mixed with milk. I hate mixing with water as it tastes horrible no matter what brand/flavor you choose. This is quite pricey though which is the only downside.
 ON has been my primary protein for the last 15 years. Always great quality, taste great, doesn't give me a rumbly tumbly. I'm lactose intolerant and other proteins can upset my stomach or bloat me, even with lactase enzymes in them. This one never boats my gut. Everytime I try the next "NEW" protein I ALWAYS go back to ON. Also does everything else whey should do.
 In the beginning I had cookie and creams, it doesn't taste bad but I would always mix it with a banana or some berries because I don't think it tastes like a nice drink with milk only. Now I tried Rocky Road, absolutely love it! It tastes like hot chocolate with a strong marzipan taste, so if you like chocolate and almonds rocky road is the flavor for you! It dissolves really easy too but I would recommend using the BlenderBottle, the taste is so good that you don't need to use your blender, maybe only if you want to put some ice cubes in there.<br/>The only downside is the price, $70 inc. shipping is quite some money for 1-2 months but I guess you can't change that.<br/>Overall very happy with the product.
 Great quality protein with no creatine and no loads of extra sugar mixed in. Just whey protein. I've been using this for several months and have seen steady consistent progress in strength and muscle. The strawberry and chocolate taste pretty good for a protein shake. I did have some gas and bloating when i first started taking it, but that subsided after a couple of weeks. You definitely save money when you buy the 10 pound bags. Great product.
 I thought this stuff was pretty nasty at first. Even after shaking it up well and diluting 1 scoop with 10 oz skim milk, it still had a bad aftertaste and I had to gulp it all down at once. After a couple of weeks, this stuff started to taste great, like real chocolate milk, which I know a lot about since that's one of my favorite drinks. It's creamy and delicious, I love it. The only thing is that you can't just shake it up and pour it into a glass. You have to keep shaking it every time you take a sip. If you choose to spoon stir it, it's even worse - you have to stir like crazy, take a sip, and then stir again, otherwise it comes out of solution.<br/><br/>I was once out of milk and had to drink this stuff in water. I've never drank out of the toilet, but there is not a doubt in my mind that toilet water would be tastier than this stuff in water. Make sure your fridge is always stocked with milk.
 I have tried many different protein powders over the years. What comes to mind is Muscle Milk and how terrible that stuff was. Expensive, too many empty calories and didn't even taste that great. Optimum Nutrition's 100% Whey fits the bill for my needs. I want protein without a ton of filler and calories. 24 grams per serving, which is one scoop by the way, meaning you get a lot of servings per 5lb tub. If you need more protein you can always double up on a serving. I tend to use 1 and a half scoops which gives me 36g per serving.<br/><br/>This stuff tastes great. It mixes easily in milk or water using just a spoon or in a shaker cup.
 We have had chocolate, chocolate mint and this chocolate coconut....the plain chocolate was the best.  This with the coconut took a lot to get used to and I dislike the amount of artificial sugar that is in it as it does leave an aftertaste.  Will be looking for another soon and hope to find some that doesn't use asulfamine or any sucralose or asparatame.....
 I've been a user of ON Whey Gold Standard daily (literally once or twice a day every day) for years. After trying everything on the market and comparing ingredients, etc. this is by far the best tasting and easiest to mix. Prime makes going to GNC or other health stores pointless. Even bodybuilding.com can't compete when you need your protein quickly!
 Tastes great and is zero (0) Weight Watchers points. Be careful of the size you buy. This one was so large it won't fit on the pantry shelf and will last me many years past the expiration date.
 I like this product, there are so many flavor to choose from
 Price when I bought this was the cheapest even compared to Walmart. Taste delicious and mixes well. What more can I say!
 One of the best whey powder brands! The powder is easy to dissolve in cold water and tastes yummy, unlike those plain tastes of some other brands.
 At only 70mg of sodium per serving for the coffee flavor, this is the lowest you're going to find without buying "unflavored". I've tried to find other products that match the quality/price of the gold standard whey, and continue to buy this month after month. Always ships fast too.
 I can’t review on the performance just yet, but the flavor profile is a disappointment. The double rich chocolate could best be described as: drinking a glass of water when someone walks into the room and whispers “chocolate”.<br/><br/>I’ll be able to stomach the rest of this 5 lbs by adding a few drops of liquid stevia and a teaspoon of cacao.
 I keep on cycling between getting a different brand and this one because of the price of this one, but I ALWAYS end up regretting it. The fact is, this is the only protein that doesn't make my stomach hurt after I drink it. You get what you pay for. Stick with this.
 Great results!  Keep in mind that the first 2-3 weeks (depending on how much you work out) you'll start to see your body gaining fat.  Don't get discouraged as it will start to go away once your body learns to take in the amount of protein you're giving it and properly burns it off as you gain muscle mass.  I've tried other brands and this is one of the best by far. Also I don't know why people are saying they didn't get the version shown in the picture.  I got the "older version" of this blend as pictured.
 Even though this was fulfilled by Amazon I suspect it might be a fake. I've had ON Chocolate Mint before and this does not taste the same, the mint flavoring isn't even detectable. Also, the cap does not have the embossed ON true strength mark on it and the safety seal did not have the gold hologram stripe even though it specifically mentions it on the side label.
 Excellent protein powder with delicious banana flavor.  I did some research and this seems to be the best value available.  I mix a scoop and a half with two cups of milk and add strawberries and blueberries.  If I do not have the fruit, it still tastes good with the powder and milk.
 No scoop 😒 So what is the size of the measuring scoop that's suppose to come with it? 3 Tablespoons?
 Cant go wrong with ON Gold Standard.<br/>This tub doesnt taste exactly the same as my first tub, but had a slightly weird taste for the first couple scoops. Don't know why it was like this. It seems fine now, or at least im used to it now.<br/><br/>Extreme Milk Chocolate is a perfect taste, sweet enough, tastes like a chocolate shake. Doesnt taste fake or anything.
 Very sweet!!! I should have tried the chocolate. Pass on this one. Wish I could exchange it...
 Ok flavor. I prefer my coffee a little more bitter tasting. Medium dark. This kinda taste like the store bought vanilla star bucks,  sweeter than i like. It's not bad,  i just like trying different flavors.
 When I ran out of GNC protein powder, I was looking for an alternative that blended better. Optimal nutrition is perfect. It blends perfectly in my smoothies without clumping like GNC did, and it tastes excellent. Plus, it has fewer calories and far fewer carbohydrates.
 Optimum makes the best whey protein, and I would strongly recommend to anyone looking for a good post work out protein! It is effective and helps with recovery time. It is a must have in my daily supplements! It should be in yours as well.
 Mixes well .....taste good ...use it after I work out
 This is a good tasting protein. 2 scoops gives you 48 g of protein. I have tried the extreme milk chocolate and the vanilla. They both taste good in water, and I like mine with 1/2 almond or coconut milk and 1/2 water. The vanilla is good in fruit smoothies although it is a fake tasting vanilla, still not bad for protein.
 Loved it, mixes good and taste great, I used it to help me start fasting and it did help. Wanna try different flavors and continue shopping with this brand
 I like a tasty protein, without having to add honey or some other sweetener. This protein gives you about 26 grams per serving. When you work out you need 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight, so if your target body weight is 190 lbs then you need 190 grams of protein a day.<br/>The taste is quite good (vanilla cream) and mixes easily. I have been replacing meals with a protein drink, and have lost an inch on my waistline in a week. I am not hungry. Plus, I'm weight training 3 days a week. Five stars!!
 Optimal source of protein for a post-workout shake. Fills me up as a meal in itself. Not necessarily for gains if that's what you're looking for, but I could tell my muscles recovered quicker when I would use it as opposed to not use it.
 I couldn't figure out what flavor to get so I settled on boring chocolate, but this milk chocolate is so delicious! Mix it with milk, or add banana &amp; peanut butter for a meal supplement. I use it as a post workout &amp; notice I wake up less sore &amp; keeps me from snacking at night. I would give it 5 stars but I wish it would have a natural sweetener instead of sucralose.
 I bought these same exact ones before and they have always come with a scooper to scoop out my protein powder but this one doesn’t. The ones I bought before were of the same cost from vitamin shoppe. That’s the only weird thing I have observed. I am using my rice cup for scooping out which is inconvenient
 This is the best whey protein I've ever had. I mixed it with milk and it was delicious. It didn't give me the runs like the Walmart brand always did.  I bought the strawberry flavor
 This is a good product with high quality protein. Tried the Milk Chocolate flavor which tastes fine, nothing crazy.<br/><br/>I previously tried the Pro Complex and it mixed with water/milk noticeably better, so for the extra $6, I'll probably switch back to that. I actually prefer the mixed protein blend of that product as well.<br/><br/>If you are explicitly looking for 100% whey, this is a fine product.
 Typically I purchase the double rich chocolate whey from ON if I'm not buying SmartPowders chocolate whey, which is cheaper. However, the last batch of ON I bought has the double rich chocolate whey tasting... strange. It's not that it tastes foul or expired, the flavoring they add just seems... duller. Just be cautious when you buy this product, buy something else for the next few months if at all possible.
 This is my favorite! Best value too!
 I've been using this protein all summer and it has worked great. Two of my friends were on other protein brands and ended up switching over to Gold Standard after seeing what a value it is for what you get. Double Rich chocolate tastes great, and it contains everything you need in a good post-workout protein. Just add water or milk and you are good to go. Add some yogurt, peanut butter, and fruit and you have a suitable meal supplement as well!
 I found the Rocky Road to have a flavor that is too strong with a pungent artificial sweetness.  I am disappointed that I have 5 lbs of this to consume!  The last flavor I had was Chocolate Mint which I really liked - nice chocolate flavor, but not too sweet with a hint of mint.  I also like the French Vanilla.
 I was fooled by the large number of good reviews but this stuff taste so bad I gave it away could not drink it.
 Best tasting powder on the market.  All the aminos and it flat out works like protein should.  25mg protein per serving is perfect for me and my kidneys.  Try vanilla in a blender with a banana, strawberries, milk, and peanut butter and you've got a great morning pick-me-up.
 I've tried several other brands of whey as well as other flavors of gold standard and this one blows them all away. It's actually quite pleasant tasting and not just tolerable like most others. Its even better tasting then some of BSN's stuff. It can be a bit rich especially on an empty stomach so I either water it down slightly or drink it a bit slower. Other then that it's fantastic stuff.
 There are really not much to say about the product itself, Whey is a well-known and excellent protein shake brand, and as far as I am concern , it is more of a fact than a mere statement. I looked up the internet and it shows mocha cappuccino is the top rated one; I normally uses the double rich chocolate one but want to try a different flavor so I bought it out of curiosity and it turns out to be pretty good. It has a somewhat milky chocolate taste, not as rich as the one I used to drink, but this one has an extra hint of coffee flavor spreading from within in a subtle way which is pretty interesting taste-wise. Anyway, to quickly sum up, this is one of the best protein supplement I've ever tasted, first-timer going into this I recommend trying the Double Rich Chocolate or the Mocha Cappuccino flavor.
 I have take this brand of whey for many years now and it work prefect for me. There's no need to get the platimun.
 This is good stuff, but I must say it does not get thick like Muscle Milk can. Even though it is double rich chocolate, it does not seem to have the same texture as Muscle Milk. OK, so this is actually good in it's composition and price. I will continue to use it as it fits my needs perfectly. I will buy Muscle Milk to supplement my occasional need to feel like I am having a milkshake that doesn't ruin my diet.
 I was wary of this protein powder at first, because most powders that I've tried taste awful. This one is the opposite. It literally tastes just like cold "hot" chocolate. I will definitely buy this protein powder from here on out.

 Overall, I love optimum nutrition products and will continue to buy their products, but this product surprised me. The double rich chocolate was very underwhelming. It smells weird, had very little flavor to offer, and what was left had an awkward/bad tasting with an even worse after taste. The milk chocolate is the way to go.
 I thought that this stuff would be poor quality and upset my stomach like so many other whey products do....but it's actually really awesome and I've ordered it again.<br/><br/>Taste is great and it seems to be low on lactose for the lactose sensitive like me :).<br/><br/>Time to get some gainzzzzzzz
 This is the only time that I've actually ever liked Vanilla over Chocolate. This is no doubt good protein and tastes decent. But the vanilla flavor kinda of dwarfs this. Which is rare as I usually only like protein shakes that are chocolate. Like I said this is alright, but I would consider the Vanilla flavor before this flavor. Sounds weird if you're a chocolate flavor kind of person, I know. Anyways, this does taste great and there nothing wrong with it, I just prefer vanilla for this particular brand, which usually isn't the case.<br/><br/>You can make it taste better with peanut butter, consider the calories it will add if you do, though.
 The powder is very fine which makes it easy to mix.  The taste is good and doesn't bother me a bit.  I drink about 2 1/2 scoops a day for 60 grams of added protein in my diet.  I plan on buying another jug right after this review.  I highly recommend it.
 I want to start by saying, I rated this 4 stars because it has artificial sweeteners and I wish it didn't. That said, I think the calorie count is so good because of the sweeteners and I will continue to drink ON 100% Whey. I use this after a weight workout and find I am less sore when I drink it within 30-45 minutes. I also use it, in a milk shake, to help get my protein up for a day.<br/>My favorite, this week, is Double Chocolate, but I also love, love, love the Tropical Punch. I mix 4 oz cold water with 4 oz orange juice and the Tropical Punch and it tastes like Hawaiian Punch (the texture is a little thicker, though). This is the best tasting protein powder I've tried. It is smooth and tastes just like chocolate milk in skim milk. I also put it in sugar free almond milk (40 cals/8 oz) and it tastes very good. It's a different flavor and makes a delicious milk shake when mixed with 4 oz almond milk and 4-5 oz ice cubes. My daughter likes it in soy milk, but I don't do soy, so can't say how good/bad it may be.<br/>I don't love it in water, but like it a whole lot better than other powders I've tried in water. This is yummy, if you aren't sure what flavor to get, I would recommend any of the chocolates, or, if you can find it, the Variety Pack.
 I really like this protein powder.  It doesn't have the fake aftertaste that other protein powders I try have.  4 stars because it isn't as good as the coffee one.  I think the price is good for the amount you get as well.  Everything came quickly.  Only problem I had was that my scooper was at the bottom of both of my containers and was super annoying to get out.  Not sure if I'd repurchase this since I'm obsessed with the coffee flavor.  Great nutritional stats too!
 Tastes a whole lot better than many others on the market.
 CAME WITH A TWO SERVING SAMPLE OF PRE WORKOUT. Which I'm super pumped about. I've never tried pre workout before, but I've been curious about it since I started lifting about six months ago. As for the protein powder,it's really good. It dissolves instantly, as advertised. And no weird aftertaste, which I definitely notice with other protein powders. Overall, a great first impression. Not sure yet how it will affect my long term performance.
 Met expectations and is in a convenient size for my needs.<br/><br/>I am on Adderal and, as such, for most of the day I have zero appetite for food, so this comes in very handy for me.  My appetite does not come back until late at night.  With this, I can get my dietary shakes during the day.
 Ask any fitness expert/bodybuilding and this is the their protein powder. Plain and simple. Don't listen to the "guru's" selling their imitation powders. This is all you need to feed your gains. Lift heavy and drink protein. You will be bench pressing cheerleaders and causing your friends mom's to faint in no time with the proper amount of work.<br/><br/>Remember, you can't flex cardio and you can't see muscle when you are fat. So drink protein powder to get the protein you need to rebuild muscles without the hundreds of calories from another protein source.
 Been using this for one month but not sure if anything changed. I gonna use for another month.
 This is the best choice for a protein shake. Has plenty of protein and is low carb which is hard to find. Plus on Amazon the price is fantastic. I have tried 7 different flavors and Chocolate coconut and Strawberry are my favorite. Highly recommend!!!
 Protein powder arrived quickly. No issues with the product. We have used it for over a year now with my husband having positive results combined with his workouts. I am not a big fan of the strawberry flavor myself so I don't use it often but my husband enjoys it.
 Loveeeee this protien powder. Leaves no after taste. I purchased again in the 50lb choice extra chocolate.
 Nice dose of protein and a bit of caffeine to go with it. First one I can actually drink with just water instead of milk.
 I've been using this product and flavor(choc) for 6 years now.  Its the best tasting whey protein out there.  Solid product
 Tastes great! I love the smaller packaging options to be able to be stored in a gym bag or locker. No gritty feeling. I mix mine with almond milk and it's wonderful!
 Great taste great price. Hubby uses after workouts
 great flavor to mix with coffee
 Extreme Milk Chocolate is the best flavor after trying a bunch. Some of the more niche flavors may be better if you enjoy the specific taste. It is pretty sweet and chocolatey.<br/><br/>No one drinks this stuff because it tastes good. I've heard it compared to ovaltine a lot.<br/><br/>Clumps a ton in water, even when stirred for a long time there are still chunks. Must use a blender to really get it smooth.<br/>Clumps a little less in milk but still pretty bad.<br/>Tastes way better in milk.<br/><br/>Overall its the best product you can get, but it still isn't enjoyable.
 I've been weak, insatiable and lacking! I was the lesser man and have been suaded to switch brands. Due to reviews on so called "experts" and "professionals" i was tempted to try another brand. They said the other brand(muscle pharm combat) tastes better, it mixes better and overall better in every way. But its a lie! It was all a lie! It left a bitter after taste and clumps of undiluted powder. And muscle recovery took longer. So if you a thinking of trying another brand, i say don't! Optimum Nutrition is the best brand out there. Learn from my mistake people!
 I ordered the cookies and cream after finishing a bottle of the chocolate and I have to say that the chocolate one is the best of the product line. I have tried the strawberry too and it has the same problem as the cookies and cream. There is something about the taste that is just a little too unnatural.<br/><br/>The double chocolate however does not suffer from this problem. Something about it makes it the best protein I have ever tried.<br/><br/>If you take a protein supplement, the chocolate gold standard is your best bet.
 I just purchased this after having a 2.5lbs tub of the Strawberry flavored ON protein.  The double chocolate tastes awesome.  No after taste.  I mix mine with 2% milk and it tastes exactly like chocolate milk.  The strawberry flavored stuff had a weird aftertaste to it.<br/><br/>As for the effectiveness, I can see muscle gains with both of these.
 I usually do dymatize iso 100, but since this is cheaper I decided to try it.  It is suprisingly good considering what im comparing it to.  Great product with clean profile. Not the best tasting but definitely drinkable and mixes well.  It's the best selling for a reason.
 Best Whey Protein Powder I've ever had - Been using this religiously for a couple years now
 I was looking for the older packaged version - as was advertised here. More specifically, I was looking for the version that had lower cholesterol per serving. It was advertised that the version shown here (in the description) had 10mg per serving. But they sent me the newer version (which has 30mg per serving). If I wanted the newer version, I would just have walked into the nearby GNC store to get it. I searched everywhere online, thought that I finally found what I was looking for, here on Amazon - only to be mislead.<br/><br/>Other than the cholesterol content per serving, I am a big fan of this product (not the yucky Strawberry flavor though, but the vanilla versions).
 Good product, but I'm really disappointed that this bottle was broke during delivery. The powder is all over the package and my other products.
 Four stars because the taste isn't as great as some of the other brands out there. I will say this stuff works because I am getting huge!!!!
 Its a great product, I have been using Gold Standard for years now and it definitely works. I ordered the flavor Cookies and Cream and it is horrible. It could be that it's just me and someone else may love it, but I absolutely do not enjoy the flavor.
 Definitely recommend this one of the best
 I have the extreme milk chocolate flavor.  I have a blender handy so after my workout I just use water and some ice cubes, than throw in a banana. It's amazing! I actually crave it now.  Even without a banana with just water and ice it isn't bad. I'm doing Body Beast and the soreness isn't nearly as bad now.  This is good stuff I'll be buying it again.
 I love this whey powder. I got chocolate malt and it's good even with just water. I was searching for something with lower carbs than the Syntha-6 and this does the job. I've had chocolate extreme too and it was good but I think the current flavor is best for me.
 I bought the rocky road flavor of this for my husband and he said it tasted surprisingly good. No complaints to be had and will definitely be buying more in the future.
 Strawberry and banana taste great
 My tummy aches when I drink too much milk in the morning. This flavor is surprisingly good with water! Hooray!
 Quality, quantity, and price there's no match for ON protein when it comes to these 3 things! On top of that it mixes very well, and taste amazing. I like every flavor!Great product, I will be an ON man for life!
 Excellent quality. Excellent flavor.
 Best tasting, easiest mixing protein powder I've ever used !<br/>VANILLA CREAM !
 I've been buying this whey for a while now, it's cheaper than buying from GNC.  Lately I've been taking two scoops at once 3x a day in a blender bottle 1/2 filled up with water.  Doing this I gained 6lbs in a week and I am cursed with a high metabolism making it difficult for me to gain weight.  It isn't delicious tasting but not terrible.  I just chug it all at once.
 Tastes good and mixes well. 5lb tub is the best deal for the price, instead of 2lb tub. 2lb tub costs 30$, where as $50 for 5lb tub.<br/>I will give it 5 star.
 My favorite product of all protein powders, delivered fast too ! The best flavor of any chocolate you'll ever try! Trust me ❤️✌️
 I love it  I been loving this product not really a strawberry fan but 1.My family dips in my protein so I had to find one that they didn't like so I could keep it. 2. There are not a lot of flavors that are in the big bags this last normally about two to three months Great.. I used as a Meal supplement and source of protein. In the morning and after workouts when bulking three times a day. Always good with yogurt, water, creatine,bcaa's and ice. Awesome they need more flavors in the big bag.
 I've switched to vegan Pea Protein. It works best for me
 Great deal on this 10 lb bag. Great protein as always, I’ll never buy anything but Gold Standard.
 One of the best protein powders out there to obtain massive gains in the gym. Find out what macros you need to intake to achieve whatever your goal is whether its to bulk or cut and put in work. Stay consistent with healthy macro food choices and put in work making everyday count! Hakuna Matata.
 I am not a serious weight lifter or bodybuilder, but I do like to focus on protein intake as part of my fitness and diet regimen. This product is my go-to for protein shakes and I use it almost every day.  The Double Chocolate is simply the best tasting powder I have found and I am very pleased with this product.
 Tastes great with no GI issues.  Saw this recommended in a muscle magazine as one of the best.  No regrets.  Working very well for us.
 Holy smokes, this was a huge jar and 3/4 full!  I bought it based on Amazon reviews, including what flavor to get and was not disappointed at all.  The milk chocolate is very good, and dissolves beautifully in almond milk.  It's so nice not to have clumps and a tasty post WOD shake.  I recommend it highly.
 It used to be really good, but i got one a couple days ago and i had a really low quality. I had to return it. Do not recommend it at all
 dissolves pretty easily with a brisk, extended stir (I've been using almond milk)... Tastes great and does what it's supposed to!
 Boss.  No negatives to this product for me.
 Gold Standard is by far my favorite whey protein. The huge jug is also an awesome value. I've gotten a lot of the flavors before and chose Chocolate Mint this time. I'd stay away from that (even though I usually LOVE chocolate mint, this doesn't do it for me). Giving 5 stars based on other flavors.
 I usually buy my proteins from nutrition stores, but after finding out that Amazon sells whey protein I said i'll give it a try and was worth it!<br/>Better deal and received the product couple of days later "standard shipping" after ordering it.<br/>I highly recommend purchasing this product because of it's quality, flavor and one of the most popular whey protein in the market!
 This is only brand and product that I trust for my workouts. Time to get that six-pack. Jokes aside, Depending on your protein intake and amount of workout, I felt I had good recovery by getting a shake and maximize my recovery as well as muscle build. Try it and see if it helps you, remember the more the muscles hurt, better workout it was and stronger you will get!
 Very bad taste. Won’t order again
 "The Protein Express Diet", written by M. R. Ford recommended a few specific protein drinks brands.  I tried one I could buy locally, in several flavors, much to my dismay.  Thankfully, I finally ordered this one from Amazon.  It's Terrific!  The flavor is to die for!  I  look forward to my pseudo ice cream shake each day as a special  treat!
 The taste has definitely changed from the previous formula. The last time I bought this product was back in 2014 and I remember how great it tasted. Now, it has a strong splenda/stevia sweetener aftertaste. I'm glad I bought a 1 lb bag just to test it out after reading the negative reviews. Will be looking for another brand in the near future.
 The ONLY whey protein I use, it mixes up great doesn't get clumpy and the taste is very good!
 LOVE this!! What a great flavor. Sometimes I just mix with water and it still tastes amazing. reminds me of melted ice cream. I throw a scoop in my morning coffee. No more creamer or sugar. BAM! protein.. Also made it iced. Wish they offered the sample pack again so I could try more flavors instead of buying quantity of one flavor. Best stuff around!
 Mixes easily with little or no clumping, tastes great, high nutritional content for the price. This is a great "post" drink for workouts when you just can't get to a real meal soon enough or even in the morning before a race. The only drawback is it doesn't really fill you up if you're hungry in my opinion. The price seems steep for the 5 lb. jar, but it lasts a long time and it's nice to have around.
 Best protein powder I have ever had.  It is smooth and delicious in either water or milk, or in other smoothies.  It doesn't have any other unnecessary 'garbage' in it.<br/><br/>I will mark it down, however, for the fact that it contains an artificial sweetener.  I don't normally worry about artificial sweeteners, as it think that whole thing is overblown.  But when sometimes consuming four or more servings per day, you should be weary of what you are ingesting.  I wish so bad that they had a regularly sweetened or unsweetened version of this.
 It was okay but the double chocolote did not taste good when just mixed with water. Plus I think the price is a bit high.
 Cookies and Cream is delicious. I mix with coconut water. Can't imagine how good it'll taste mixed with whole milk. Orgasm delicious probably
 I do not know what else needs to be said besides my title. However, I can go further. I love adding this to my oatmeal to give it flavor. While it does not seem to be the easiest to dissolve, it is by no means difficult to either. A slow steady pouring will get this dissolved quick unless you have a blender bottle. Either way, it is good.
 This is one of the best protein powders out there. My whole family uses it and each of us (brothers and dad) got a different flavor. I bought royal chocolate. While I love the powder, I won't get that flavor again. Bland, even with fruit added to it. I've tried a few now and will definitely be buying the vanilla ice cream in the future. Of each flavor bought by my family, that was my favorite.
 I've used this for years.  I've only tried the chocolate and vanilla ice cream...like the vanilla  ice cream the best.  I mix mine with cashew milk but in a pinch have used water only...still not bad.
 Extreme Milk Chocolate is very similar in taste to chocolate milk with little to no whey protein taste; it's pretty great, by comparison to other flavors.<br/><br/>However, I did notice an artificial sweetener in the ingredients list and will move to a different mix. For those whom do not mind the risks/uncertainties revolving around artificial sweeteners, it is a great mix.
 Great value for the price. Amazing and well trusted protein powder!
 I do not know much yet about the types of proteins and how fast acting and such. I do know I have tried several other brands and this Optimum Nutrition Rocky Road tastes delicious. I use a blender to mix one scoop with 1 cup of unsweetened almond milk. Very smooth, no grit, and tastes like a milkshake. Definitely my go to protein powder now.
 I chose the rocky-road option which is good but not as good as I was hoping. However, it mixes in to milk SUPER easily, barely have to shake it or mix it at all and there are no clumps which is awesome. It has BCAAs already in it so it is good stuff. Highly recommended.
 I've tried a few other protein powders out there and Optimum Nutrition is my favorite.  I've been lifting weights/working out for almost a year now.  When I started, I wasn't taking anything and was getting adequate gains, but I soon hit a wall.<br/><br/>Adding this protein allowed me to get the amount of protein I needed to feed my muscles.  My gains shot up dramatically and now I will not work out without this product.<br/><br/>The taste is great too because I went through a 5 lb container and still loved it.  I highly recommend this.
 I know this gets top marks for protein powders; it is too sweet (Vanilla)for my liking. My son thinks it tastes great and says I like the old bodybuilder powders that taste tacky. This mixes well when shaken or blended. I routinely blend with fruit, so..
 I won't try to add to the praise this product has already received, except to say I Have tried several others over the years and still end up coming back to what I consider the best. The delivered 'subscription' pricing makes it even more attractive. Am not using this because I am a Body Builder, but age, diet, and activity level have made a supplement like this very valuable, plus it tastes great. The only other flavor I have used is Vanilla, good, but still come back to this.
 Smooth powder...taste good with no gritty after taste
 Best protein for the price. The taste is not disgusting, but could be better. Next time, I’ll spend the few extra bucks to buy a better tasting protein.
 been using for years. great product. all business and no bloat like other products i have tried.
 This tastes great and works wonderfully. I drink this with 8 ounces of milk a half hour before each workout and get an extra boost of energy for my muscles. I don't feel like it is making me bulky, which is good because I don't want that. I have been using it for about a month now and I think it is really doing the trick. I would recommend this to anyone.
 Third time purchase, gains are noticeable *flexing* time to re-up. Also tastes good. Protein shakes for everyone!!
 mixes great, no clumping, and a good mix of chocolate and coconut in the flavor. always had good luck with this brand. like drinking an almond joy! also got the cake batter and it's good, not too sweet, very smooth.
 Great taste, almost no fat, it works
 One of the best protein products around. I've gotten great gains since using this protein after every workout. Compared to other proteins, this one works a lot faster. I've been drinking it with milk and it tastes just like chocolate milk!<br/><br/>If it wasn't for the recent price hike, I'd be buying more. I will hold off on it for a while.
 This bag lasts forever, and the flavor (double chocolate) is amazing, never gets old. Definitely see results when USING IT REGULARLY.
 I bought the Extreme Milk Chocolate, mixed it with milk, and was very satisfied except for its "malted" flavor (think Milk Duds), which I'm not a huge fan of.  Before it was gone, I bought the Double Rich Chocolate for a head-to-head comparison and found it pretty good, too, but not as creamy and it didn't quite "finish well".  Not a bad aftertaste at all, just a bit underwhelming, as if I had made it with water instead of milk (I only used milk).  I then mixed what was left of both flavors together and that really worked.  The Double Rich lessened the malted flavor of the Extreme, and the Extreme added the little extra creaminess to the Double Rich.  So you gotta ask yourself if you like that malted flavor.<br/>  The powder mixes well, but a shaker bottle still works best.  I have not tried any other brands or flavors.
 its got an awful taste. I did not like it no matter how I mixed it up an even added fruit.
 Well packaged and tastes great!
 The taste it's ok if I drink this with milk it is quite delicious absolutely no complain with milk it's tasty but if you mix it with just water the taste isn't so great. I think I will use it with milk only from now on. I have to say it does mix easily. I can use a glass and spoon and it mixes well. Again the only reason it get 4 stars it's because it doesn't tastes good with just water
 I like this brand and I like to buy the bigger tubs. And it tastes just as you would imagine!
 Does not mix well, very clumpy. The French vanilla cream has an unnatural, overly sweet flavor. Switching back to Syntha-6.
 I don't normally use Gold Standard, but I respect the brand for the quality they provide. That said, I didn't find this flavor very good. I know Gold Standard's chocolate is quite good, but I wouldn't recommend the chocolate mint.
 While I can't quite figure out how to make a protein shake taste amazing, this product helps! I use it to put on muscle after every workout and it's easy to use. They have instructions on the back as well to tell you how much to put in. Fantastic, I'll order some again for this price!
 I don't usually like chocolate protein powders, but Optimum Nutrition has done it right! It tastes amazing with milk (which is great for added protein), exactly like chocolate milk! It mixes well if you use a shaker cup, if you don't have one it I would recommend it! Mixing it with a spoon can cause your protein shake to be rather clumpy. Definitely will buy this again!
 I HAD HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT THIS PRODUCT THAT I JUST WANTED TO BUY IT, SEE THAT IT TASTED LIKE CRAP LIKE THE OTHER "HYPED" PROTEIN PRODUCTS, AND WRITE A BAD REVIEW, BOY, WAS I SURPRISED, NOT ONLY WAS THE TASTE BEARABLE BUT IT WAS SURPRISINGLY GOOD, I COULD REALLY DRINK THIS STUFF EVERY DAY, (I HAVE FOR THE LAST 30 DAYS AND STILL LOVE THE TASTE), THIS COMPANY HAS FINALLY DEVELOPED A PROTEIN PRODUCT THAT YOU CAN DRINK WITHOUT GAGGING.  I MAKE A GALLON OF IT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WEEK AND DRINK IT AS A IN BETWEEN SNACK AS WELL AS BEFORE AND AFTER WORKOUTS, I LOVE TO PUT IT IN MY CEREAL.  I ONLY DRINK SOY MILK ANYWAY WHICH HAS 6 GRAMS OF PROTEIN ANYWAY SO ALONG WITH GOLD STANDARD I AM DRINKING ABOUT 35 TO 40 GRAMS OF PROTEIN AT A TIME, CANT SAY ENOUGH GOOD ABOUT THIS STUFF, WILL BE BUYING MORE.........
 Exploded in box.  Powder was spilling out of the corners when I picked it up off the porch.
 I have always trusted the quality of Optimum Nutrition's products and their 100% Whey Gold Standard is no exception. This has been a staple in my diet for years both for weight training and ease of taking on the go. The double rich chocolate tastes great in milk/water/shakes and mixes well. Some people have complained about the product upsetting their stomach, but I haven't had any issue with this (I typically only take 1 scoop at a time).<br/>Bottom line: This is a quality, great tasting product at a fair price. Highly recommend for anyone looking to supplement their diet with additional protein!
 This is the only company I trust enough to buy protein from. ON is owned by a huge corporation and has very high quality standards. Most other brands outsource production and you cannot trace the source of the product.<br/>Mocha is my favorite flavor, but you cannot go wrong with chocolate either.
 Solid stuff, mixes fairly well, price is maybe a bit much but you get what you pay for I think. For me it tasted great, In the serving sizes they recommend for mixes, tasted a bit watery, if you don't mind a few chunks consider going with less water or more mix.
 This is my second bottle I like the taste is not to heavy and they have a bunch of flavors I try banana strawberry and white chocolate so far I love them
 not for personal use
 Been using for over a year.  Great results.  Great product.  The double chocolate tastes great in a smoothie, almond milk shake, or even just with water in a pinch.  Great price from Amazon as always and prime shipping can't be beat!
 4 stars because I realized it wasn't the best offer at the time I purchased this product. Local Costco stores sometimes run discount on this product which saves you ~15$ for this product. Ofcourse, you'd not be able to choose from the wide variety of flavors available since Costco only carries Vanilla and Chocolate flavors.
 Mocha Cappuccino is one of my favorite flavors!
 I really like this protein powder. Good flavor, and easy to mix in with smoothies or a quick protein shake after a workout.
 I have been using this protein for years. I am a little irked that they changed the taste of the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor, especially when I decided to get the 5 pound case. That being said, the change is slight and I am now getting used to it.
 Bought this flavor (french vanilla) due to the high reviews. Previously tried Milk Choclate and double chocolate, which are both good. Mixes well and tastes pretty good, better than standard vanilla. For the price, it's hard to beat though if you don't mind a lesser tasting whey, their are more economical options out there (i.e. costco). I primarily use this flavor or making protein pancakes and other baked foods.
 I have used many different proteins over the years. While ON may be a little more expensive, it's worth the extra cost. The protein mixes well, tastes good and (I feel) is the most effective.
 It smells so good too, I had some in my backpack at work. I opened up my back back and was worried I ripped open the bag I had it in because it smelled so strong, But it was all still in there. It smells strong and taste as good as it smells.<br/><br/>Also, the powder is a bit more fine then most protein I've had, so be careful not to make a mess.
 Tried white chocolate for first time. Like regular chocolate a lot better but powder is super great none the less.
 Works great.  I am 6' 5" and started at 175 lbs.  In three months I went to a sustained 185 with great definition.  Had I not hurt my back I think I would be well to my goal weight of 200 lbs.
 Unlike other protein powders, it is not very sweet which is what I was looking for. Does the job.
 Use it in my coffee
 Love this stuff.  Chocolate mint flavor very good in milk and also in any smoothie that chocolate makes sense in.  I mix a 1/4 cup oatmeal, 1 banana, 1/2 cup milk, ice cubes, scoop of powder.  Best breakfast ever and leaves me comfortable and satisfied till lunch.
 Excelente, muy satisfecho con los productos recibidos, tal cual lo descrito. Muchas gracias a todos los involucrados.
 I purchased this size to try and I like it.  I know order the 2 pound tub.  Great chocolate taste.
 I decided to try the Vanilla Cream flavor right off. Other than trying a sample pack of Nutrasystem shake mix, this was my first go around with a protein shake product and I'm very pleased with the taste &amp; the mix uniformity. No issues with stomach discomfort, no bloating or gas. I use two servings (two scoops) as a lunch substitute post morning work out.<br/>When mixed with water, it isn't anything to get excited about. If mixed with 2% milk, it's like a Blue Bell milkshake and just as satisfying. Likewise with skim milk it's better than water. Using milk of course adds carbs and additional calories that you may not want. On that note I decided to try unsweetened cashew milk, its only 25 cal per cup. That seems to be my perfect combination. Cashew milks offers that creamy component missing from other milk substitutes. The resulting shake has the same body as that of using 2% milk but without the sweetness. Very similar to skim but without the watery taste and much less carbs and calories. Two cups of skim is 160 cals vs. 2C of cashew milk 50 cal.<br/>One thing I've been doing is adding 1/4 tsp of guar gum per cup of milk to thicken it a bit. Then I place my mixed shaker bottle in the freezer about an hour before lunch to really add some body to it and make it a bit thicker and more satisfying &amp; savory as a meal instead of something you guzzle down.<br/>It really gets me through the afternoon without carb cravings so from that aspect I haven't had the urge to snack. Just ordered the Double Chocolate flavor to try.<br/><br/>4/26 Update:<br/>The Double Chocolate tastes exactly like your typical sugar free hot cocoa mix. It's ok but if you're craving a pack of M&amp;M's or a triple shot of Hershey's syrup, it's not going to quench that craving.<br/><br/>As for the Vanilla Cream, it satisfies that sweet craving. Some days I'll add a banana to one scoop of mix and 8oz of cashew milk which makes an awesome tasting breakfast shake.
 My stomach gets upset sometimes after drinking protein shake after workout. However this protein powder is in a huge container, and takes me a while to finish it. Make sure to wash the shaker immediately because the protein shake stinks a lot!
 Was my first protein powder and I loved it!!!
 The protein itself is grade "A" quality. What I am not a fan of is the banana cream flavor. Everyone raved about it, so I thought I would give it a try. It tastes very synthetic and too sweet to me and worst of all there are artificial colors, including Yellow 5. It does do well in a fruit smoothie though.<br/><br/>Next time I think I'll stick with chocolate.
 It's whey, it's 100%, and it tastes amazing! Not a gym guy but like to keep up with my protein intake. Two scoops, 4 strawberries, 3 ice cubes, banana, and a bottle of water into a ninja and I'm good to go twice a day. Sometimes I don't even go to the gym ( more often then I'd like to admit) but I do enjoy the shakes!
 Gold standars is always the way to go! High quality ingredients that actually dissolve in your shaker. Great taste too 10/10 as always
 My all time favorite whey protein!
 Very good buy. You will see results as long as you are putting work at the gym. They have so many flavors that are all very good. I like cookies n cream personally.
 Top quality and great tasting protein powder that I have been using for years. Versatile and easy to blend/mix with water, oats, yogurt and in shakes.<br/>Flavors I have tried:<br/>French Vanilla: 10/10<br/>Extreme Milk Chocolate: 9/10 (it is the second best tasting chocolate protein powder on the market - behind Oh Yeah)<br/>Banana: 8/10  - I love the flavor (reminds me of banana milkshakes that I had as a kid) but it is just a little too much
 It’s delicious! And great nutritional values.<br/>I struggle just drinking protein with water, but I love this flavor.
 I have been using this protein for about two years now and still love it. Mixes and tastes great with water or milk. Can't go wrong with one of the top supplement manufacturers in the world.
 Nice price and taste great!  I have this every morning as a shake and every night before bed....its light on the stomach and i dont fill jittery or crazy full after taking this product
 Best whey protein I've ever used. Most likely the only whey protein I'll ever use. No BS, no inflated price, can't go wrong with ON.
 Pretty great stuff. the overall taste mixed with water was surprising. Almost didnt taste like anything. But In a good way. The flavor was super dialed back. Which i found refreshing. kinda like a muted coconut water drink with feint hints of choclate. Which i loved cuz im in more of a cutting process. With other flavors ive gotten that kinda funky diet soda sweetness taste, which i dont like. But i didnt get any of that this time around. When Mixed with milk, its fireee!! Pretty much choclate milk with a smoothe coconut finish. Luv it.
 Great way to put on muscle.  am doing PT and needed a boost to building up underused muscles
 My son is a cross fit trainer and loves this supplement, fast shipping.
 While it's great nutritionally, it actually didn't taste that good to me. I'm not a serious fitness enthusiast, so the super low sugar and fat content to isn't that important to me. I'd rather have slightly more sugar and fat, and have it taste a little better. This shake didn't taste good, so I didn't want to drink it after a workout, now I have a whole tub of protein I'll never use. It just has a weird aftertaste.<br/><br/>Basically, if you care about taste, I'd look somewhere else.
 Tastes way better than the other brands I've tried. Arms are growing, so I suppose it's helping.<br/>Also a great idea if you don't eat meat or many protein rich foods.
 Buy in bulk and save money and dont have to worry about running out. I've noticed the scoop sizes in this are much smaller than many other brands of Whey which means they have less fillers added.
 So far so good !<br/>When I tried it for the first time I put bunch of berries and some other fruits and the taste was totally disappointing. Then I tried it with no sugar added almond milk, 2 strawberry and 2 dates. it became just AMAZING taste. It has no side affect in any way on my body.I’ll buy it again !
 I've been using ON's brand whey protein for a while now. Their quality is unparalleled and it's good to know that this brand offers test results for heavy metals and other contaminants found in other protein powders.<br/>I bought the 10lb rich double chocolate flavor. It tastes delicious with water (sometimes I add dextrose) and mixes easily in my blender bottle. Highly recommend this brand.
 I was very pleased w/this particular protein drink.  I cannot have lactose products and have difficulty finding a protein drink that doesn't upset the stomach.  This one doesn't.  The taste is good &amp; it mixes better than many brands (We use a fork instead of spoon to mix!) I carefully scrutinized the ingredients, the nutritional value etc. and found this particular brand/type to be the best overall and the most tolerable on the stomach.  The price was competitive, too.  Good purchase...
 Excellent taste -- Vanilla Mocha is the best!
 Order the Double Rich Chocolate! NO SUCRALOSE in this one! They started putting this in a lot of the other flavors. Taste awful !
 Time and time again, ON never fails to deliver. It's been my protein powder brand of choice since I started lifting. Coconut chocolate doesn't taste bad, heavier on the chocolate with a mild hint of coconut but no complaints.
 Has a funny after taste sometimes. When going down it’s great.
 Product just as described and super fast shipment before scheduled date.
 You can't go wrong with Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Whey. Always the best tasting and best bang for your buck. I love extreme milk chocolate but I am on this vanilla kick lately.
 This vanilla flavor may be the worst tasting why protein ive ever had in my life. Im sure the results it gave me for recovery and my gains. But drinking this disgusting vanilla flavor is more painful than working out my abs hardcore til failure lol. I was surprised because optimum usually makes great quality, great tasting products. This is definitely their worst.
 This is about the fifth brand of protein powder I have tried. The power resolves well and water and doesn't have a grainy feel or odd taste like a few of the others. Overall the taste is very good!
 Works for me all the time
 The powder dissolves quickly, tastes pretty good (I have only used it in water; it would likely taste better in milk), and is a good value if you are only using it for weight loss.  For weight loss, you use about a scoop or two maximum per day.  That means the container will last you 1-2months.  If you are looking for muscle building, however, you might need twice as much, making it pretty expensive (one container used up in less than one month for ~ $55).  I have not been using it long enough to vouch for any results, but as a diet supplement, it works well.
 I've purchased the same flavor (Strawberry) for several years with good results. The newest tub that I ordered now tastes sickeningly sweet. It is okay mixed in with fruit smoothies, but is overpowering if mixed only with milk or water.
 The protein is very good but the seal was peeled off, so i'm wondering if you're employees are taking some of the powder or even if it was a mistake i'm seeing a lot of other reviews about seal peeled off so you should be more careful, i guess i'll give you a last try and if there's another anomality i won't buy from you again.
 I bought this bag since it was cheaper than buying two 5lb buckets.  Great deal at the sale price.  Transferring the powder to the buckets was a bit of a pain, but it was worth the savings.  If the price wasn't at least $10 less than two 5lb buckets, I probably wouldn't bother, though.<br/><br/>The powder itself is great.  I've been using it for years.
 You really cannot get better tasting protein with these macros. It's called Gold Standard for a reason, it has 5 stars for a reason. Just do your research on the flavors, and don't buy giant tubs of anything until you've tried the flavor before. For example, I loath the strawberry flavor, despite all the praise it gets. Extreme Milk Chocolate (most popular flavor) literally tastes like chocolate milk though, even with just water. Get a 1 pound tub of it, verify that I'm right, buy the 5 pound tub because 120-calorie-24-grams-of-protein chocolate milk is the bomb.
 My favorite whey protein.  I have tried quite a few flavors and like them all.
 Good taste.  Great addition to my routine.
 Strawberry flavor is great, but that might be because I prefer that flavor in every product. Anyway if you're working out and need a good source of protein, look no further.
 Let me get this out right up front: If you have been drinking this flavor and liked it, DO NOT BUY THE "NEW AND IMPROVED" VERSION. Vanilla Ice Cream used to be my favorite flavor of the ON whey line. Used to be, but not anymore. I just received a new bottle, whipped up a cup as usual, and the first thing I noticed was how syrupy and gloppy it was. And when I tasted it, I almost spit it out. Clearly, something had changed -- for the worse!<br/><br/> Let's start with the new consistency. The new label shows a variety of viscosity enhancers, eg, cellulose gum, xanthine gum, lecithin -- compounds which I have no problem with in various products -- which were absent in the previous recipe; but in this new formulation, I can best describe the consistency of the blended beverage as sludge-like, sticking thickly to the blender and cup. It is so viscous, I actually found it a bit difficult to swallow. Well, ok,  how about the taste? It is sickeningly sweeter, and the vanilla flavor seems very different (and not in a good way) from the original recipe. Looking at the labels, I see that ON has added sucralose in addition to the orginal acesulfame. This additional sweetener has the effect of changing both the degree and the quality of the original pleasant (IMHO) modestly-sweet taste to a new overbearing artificially-candied taste.  I frankly can't stand it. I don't understand why ON, which makes 24 different flavors, did not simply make a new flavor for people who might enjoy a syrupy, hyper-sweetened, artificial vanilla-like flavor, and just left the original flavor alone for those of us who had developed a liking for it. Don't buy this product if you are expecting the original flavor; the new version is dramatically different. Furthermore, if you have opened it, used it, and found it too disgusting, by all means return the opened bottle like I did. There was absolutely no indication on the website that the recipe had been changed; hence the product is "not as described on website." Maybe enough returns will send a message to ON. Maybe they will even revert to the original recipe.By the way (no pun intended), my one star review applies only to the flavor change, not to the general quality of the ON products
 It's too short to say if it makes any effect
 Ive been using this protein for years now. I've tried others and nothing compares to ON, both the taste and blendability.
 At the current rate of $53 with tax/shipping, this is the cheapest quality protein powder I've found. 33.37 grams per dollar. It has extremely low fat and carbs as well, which makes it easy to control those factors as desired. I mixed one scoop with one ice cube, 1% milk, half a banana, two tablespoons of crunch peanut butter. It's really a dessert and doesn't upset my stomach like some other brands I have tried.
 good product.
 I like it, I just prefer the original Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard Vanilla (regular one). This flavor, vanilla ice cream, is too sweet for me. I taste more of a sugar flavor than I do the vanilla flavor. I tried adding vanilla extract to counter the sweetness, but it did not help. Once I finish this one, I will go back to the original vanilla.
 Almost insoluble, bland, granular garbage.  I am obviously returning same. I have never been so disappointed since Trump was elected.
 This product is NOT 100% whey protein isolate. I am lactose intolerant and was not able to consume this product. The Main ingredient is whey protein isolate, but there is also a good amount of regular when protein (containing lactose).
 Double Rich Chocolate flavor is the best flavor of all! Shaker cup will easily dissolve the powder.
 Theres nothing wrong with the protein, I just don't appreciate having to go forearm deep into my protein to find out there is no scoop.
 I usually buy the platinum version, but decided to try out the gold this time. While it is a good quality product, the Platinum version is worth the extra money.
 I have purchased ON powders over the past few years and have seen a steady climb in price.  Almost three years to the day I paid $46.99 for the same product.  Why a 23% increase since then.  Since Nov. 2011 I've paid $52.99 and $53.99.  Now it's $57.99?  Wishing I would have stocked up a little more.  I might be switching if I can find something that is comparable.  Hopefully something less sweet as well.  I'm not sure why powders need to be like drinking sweetener.
 I've used Optimum Nutrition for years.works great, tastes great. I typically get cookies n cream which tastes amazing, but this flavor Mocha is rated the highest in taste. It is good,but in my opinion, no better than cookies n cream. Definitely better than plain chocolate or vanilla.
 Quality of protein and mixability is great. The flavor is quite sweet so having such a large quantity gets tiring after about half way
 My go-to protein. This chocolate is better than all other chocolates. The amino profile is on point, the powder has a perfect texture. When I'm bulking I usually buy one or two of these a month - and the price allows me to do that!
 I always enjoy this protein powder.
 I've used a variety of protein powders, mostly because after a while, I'll start to get sick of them.  However, this is the first one that I really can take time, and time again and enjoy.  I usually do about two scoops with some low fat milk - it's about as easy as it gets - after a workout and once around breakfast.<br/><br/>The only knock on it is that it's expensive, at $110 bucks for 149 servings is about $0.75 per serving.  If this cost could get down to about $0.45-$0.50 I'd give it 5 stars.
 Been buying this for years now. I honestly can not come up with one single bad comment if I tried. 100/5 stars. It combines a reputable name with a good price. I would never ever consider buying whey or casein protein from any other company. I have come to love Optimum Nutrition and their products immensely.
 First of all, I love ON's products and started using a year ago and have never changed. The price gets to be a little iffy now and then but overall it is a great product.<br/><br/>The only flavor I have had an issue with choking down is the Cookies and Cream. I thought it would be delicious, and it turns out it is the exact opposite. I'm more of a Chocolate guy and I was getting sick of the same old flavor, so I switched it up, but this has got to be the worst one I've tried.<br/><br/>I have also had chocolate, mocha cappachino, Chocolate mint, and coffee. I ended up mixing my cookies and cream with left over chocolate mint since it was so bad. I can't wait for the tub to be gone.<br/><br/>Other then that, this is a great product and taste great for the most part with little exceptions.
 Bottle of whey came open. No seal on the protein. It must have been opened before shipment, so I can't use this..<br/><br/>Hopefully I can get a new bottle of whey that is sealed properly! @goldstandard: I'm obviously happy to take this review down after this issue is fixed. You normally have good protein
 Great tasting product and enough protein to satisfy most everyone. I have been weight training and/or cycling for most of my 40+ years and have tried countless protein powders and none have been better tasting than Optimum. Once I enjoyed the French Vanilla I never tried another product or flavor. Here is a great recipe for the French vanilla and it tastes just like an orangesicle. Mix one scoop French vanilla powder with 16ozs of orange Gatorade. You will thank me later.
 I like the flavor and it dissolves in the water very easily.
 Very subtle chocolate flavor.  Not my favorite.
 I have used this brand for years, and they are easily the best I have found. Great amount of protein per calories, and tastes wonderful. I recommend them to anyone.
 When I blend this with ice, half a teaspoon of cocoa powder, half a teaspoon of glucomannan, and a cup of almond milk, my chocolate milkshake craving is completely satisfied. Great flavor and blends well.
 I pick things up and put them down.
 I purchased the chocolate mint and the taste is great with milk or water. However, it has soy in it in the allergen info. Disappointing to me because soy is not good to consume. Hopefully there are other products don't have soy. The taste is top notch compared to other brands.
 Best protein powder I have tried. Great flavor, great blendability, and minimal whey taste.
 This is by far our favorite whey protein. It's easy to mix, great taste and it does wonders. It helps us build strong muscles and it minimizes recovery. I recommend this product.
 This protein is just write for me. Easy for muscle maintenance and recovery. Wrapping wasnt as good as other times. Other than that was great!!
 Out of all the proteins I have tried this one mixes and taste the best. Have been using it for years. I like ordering the 2 pound containers and have a few different flavors to mix it up. I drink one in the morning and one after the gym it helps me hit my protein macros.
 It's called the gold standard for a reason. Can't go wrong with this
 I have been using this Whey Protein powder for a couple years. I love the taste and the results. The single thing that is kind of negative is that since I am lactose intolerant, it kind of upsets my digestive system, but it doesn't give me any other side effects, or worst effects. Buy it with confidence, you will not regret.
 It doesn't taste like cake batter; it has a faint taste of coconut. It was a decent deal at $10/lb.
 Love this stuff, tastes amazing and mixes well.
 YOU LIFT THE WEIGHTS AND LET WHEY BUILD THE MUSCLES
 Love this product. Tastes great in a smoothie and gives you plenty of whey protein in a scoop, and the vanilla is delicious. I blend it in a 16-oz Hamilton Beach blender and drink half pre-workout and half post workout. Not a lot of calories but a lot of muscle-building protein. My wife loves it, too. The container lasts us for quite a while.
 Great flavor, went through a whole 5 lb tub without burning out on it like their cookies and cream flavor. It doesn't dissolve quite as well as the double rich chocolate. Like all of the gold standard flavors it is a great value for the amount of protein you get.
 I liked the chocolate flavor too but I got tired of it. The vanilla is much better if you intend to use it regularly.
 I love ON protein and have been using it for years.  The Chocolate coconut tastes great.
 Great quality. I wish it was less sweet. I bought the French vanilla flavor.
 I've been using this product for the last 3-4 years now. I've tried multiple products in the market. But nothing beats this whey in terms of quality and price.<br/><br/>I use 1 scoop in the morning, 1 scoop as pre/post and if I haven't had time to cook then would make smoothies out of it.<br/><br/>I'd say the only personal problem I've had so far is that I cannot digest 2 scoops in one sitting. There are other products (isolates) that are easily digested in one sitting.
 Rocky Road flavor seems like it's too sweet. I had my office friends try it out, and all of them arrived at the same conclusion without receiving any bias from me.<br/><br/>I was having problems finishing this tub toward the end. Had to mix it with other flavors to break up the overly sweet flavor.<br/><br/>The sweetness probably suits some people - just not me.
 This flavor clumps. Normally I get chocolate and it’s good but this flavor is not good.
 I've tried over 10 brands of protein powder.  This the best.  No extra junk.  Just the basic necessities.  There is a reason it's #1 on BB.com<br/>I buy it here because the review system and order system is better in my opinion.
 I got the coffee chocolate flavor one and it is decent. I've also tried the double chocolate. They taste better than many others brands I've tried. Dissolves easily with shaker bottle.
 I've used many different types of protein powders over the years.  I've found optimum nutrition to have the best flavors with the highest quality protein at a completely reasonable price.
 Son has been using it for years
 I've always felt that if you workout hard you will see more benefits, more quickly using this product. It seems to help me rebound a lot more quickly that if I don't use it. The only downside is the price. I'm always looking for opportunities to buy it on sale, because it can be quite expensive when you use it several time a week.
 This is my second package and see the results. That's why i keep coming back for more.......MUSCLE FOOD!
 Absolutely the best. I swear...........I can feel the protein flooding my muscles in my post-workout state. Clean, hugely bio-available source of protein. Love this stuff.
 FLAVOR:  The "Extreme Milk Chocolate" tastes EXACTLY like instant hot cocoa packets (Swiss Miss, Carnation).<br/><br/>Think of it like cocoa, not chocolate.<br/>I haven't tried warming it, as I'm not sure if that'll degrade the product.
 really like the taste,  i have it with oatmeal in the morning, gives me plenty of energy.
 Great protein powder. Love the taste and will drink with either milk or water. Although more gritty tasting with water. Would order again.
 Actually  bought a whole bundle before, it really helped me with my work out. The pre-work out, during work out and protein bundle worked great, i was able to feel the difference after I drink them. However, I just purchased 5ib the ice cream flav and the box was a little fk up, but nothing spilled and was filled up with the good powder. Highly recommended but do better with packaging and shipping please.
 I will drink a glass right before I go to the gym &amp; right after I get back.  I have seen very minor gains at they gym &amp; with skim milk it is about 200 calories a glass with skim milk something to remember if you are trying to lose weight at the same time,  That said it is delicious &amp; I have seen some very slight gains from the product,  I will buy more when what I have runs out.
 4 stars because Gold Standard is the best protein powder out there, however, the cookies and cream contains 10 not calories than the double chocolate and honestly I think after daily use the cookies and cream has made me want to gag after about a month of this flavor, I prefer the double chocolate as it easier taste to drink daily.
 I am not an expert and this is the only product I used to get protein, I am happy with it.
 The best ever whey protein, and trust me I have tried more than 20 different brands
 Gave it a 3 because I haven't used it. I just got it through ordering it, sad thing is it didn't come with a scoop -.-. Going to use it for a while and if good will raise it one more star higher. For the price I just paid I would have been a little more happy if they didn't forget to throw a scoop in.. Update and long overdue. 5 stars now. Works great and got a scoop now ;)
 I have tried multiple flavors of the Optimum Nutrition protein and this is by far the best of the group. It doesn't seem to cause any bloating it tastes great with both water and milk and seems to mix fairly well. The only reason it received 4/5 stars is because there is better tasting gourmet proteins out there. For the cost and for the blend of proteins you get this is a solid purchase.
 I started taking this protein supplement a year ago and I would not thinking about taking any other. I have had chocolate, vanilla, and rocky road. They all taste grade.  If you want to start taking a protein supplements, then this is the brand you want!
 This is a really great whey protein powder. The quality is very good and the ingredients and ratios are great. It even has "Lactase" as a final ingredient, which is the enzyme that helps you digest lactose if you are lactose intolerant like me. And, I even didn't have any issues on my first protein shake I made (which was this stuff, blended with almond milk, frozen chopped spinach, and a banana. But, then, I had another shake later in the day that was just the protein and almond milk and that did affect my stomach a little bit and gave me gas. I think that the lastase in this probably isn't enough for my body. And, it doesn't acutally tell you how much GALU is in it (for reference a serving of Lactaid has 9000 GALU which equals three tablets of Lactaid, and I don't think that much is a in a single scoop of whey protein here; so I offset it now by taking a single tablet of Lactaid or an equal off brand and that solves my digestive issues).<br/><br/>I recommend this powder for any serious exerciser, whether or not you are doing aerobic or anaerobic. Please vote yes below. Thanks!
 Good flavor, low cholesterol, high in protein. Good stuff!
 Great result
 I used a lot of different protein powders like MuscleTech NitroTech Protein Powder, Ronnie Coleman Signature Series King Whey and this one is not even close to them, with taste, texture...
 5th order now....Cappuccino flavor is my favorite.  Double chocolate is good.  Strawberry takes some getting used to...but good none the less.  I take a scoop with 4 oz of water..Mix and let stand for 30 seconds and mix again....The mix dissolves! no clumps no shaking.  I put scoops in a baby formula dispenser and use that at work.  Great source of protein.
 Not to be that person, but Gold Standard is the Gold Standard. Get the Extreme Chocolate Milk, any other chocolate ones taste like chalky BS.
 Wife loves it for gains.
 The only product I use. I love the vanilla ice cream flavor. It's my go-to!
 So far so good,  this protein powder is  easy to drink with just water but also blends well into smoothies.
 Ok
 Price
 I HIGHLY recommend this brand and this flavor for long-term energy and as a meal replacement. I was introduced to the "strawberry" flavored powder first, and despite not liking strawberry flavoring in most foods, this company pulled off a great tasting product, so I purchased the chocolate. I'm extremely happy with this protein powder and will probably stick to buying only this brand in the future. I recommend this for everyone; not just as a supplement for weight training or a means of losing weight, but as an addition to any diet to maintain energy and ensure proper protein intake.<br/><br/>Flavor: Excellent- actually akin to Hershey syrup when mixed with milk<br/><br/>Sweetness: Not too sweet and not at all fake/diet sweetener flavored<br/><br/>Mixability: Mixes so easily! I can mix it into water with a spoon and there are no clumps left. I still use either a blending wand or blender bottle, but with this powder, you can mix with a spoon.<br/><br/>Meal Replacement: Should be mixed with milk or something substantial like a smoothie (i.e. not just water) to be considered a meal replacement. When one scoop is mixed with milk, this actually holds me over for hours. I have a super fast metabolism and am constantly hungry, so this is saying a lot. Fantastic for students or people working with long hours and no time for breaks.<br/><br/>Energy: This powder doesn't just satisfy my hunger, but actually provides me with long-term energy, which tells me I'm actually efficiently absorbing and metabolizing the protein. Some protein powders have less effective forms of protein and you can tell when you feel hungry a short time after drinking them.<br/><br/>Low-Carb: This protein powder has only 3 net carbs per scoop. I have never seen any protein powder, shake, supplement or bar with fewer net carbs. People concerned with weight loss/counting carbs should definitely give this stuff a try. For diabetics and people with low blood sugar (of which I am one), I highly recommend using this particular protein powder because it offers slow-releasing long-lasting energy and will help stabilize your blood sugar.
 Good standard chocolate Why Protein. Tastes fine and no issues.
 It is an excellent protein powder option if you digest dairy well.
 Great taste! This is my favorite flavor along with the Rocky Road from Optimum Nutrition!
 I previously ordered this in vanilla ice cream a few times, and like the other comments mention they definitely changed the formula. It used to be great but now it tastes like absolute s**t. Don't be deceived by the high rating this product has, it is no longer good.
 Second 5 pounder of the banana cream. I've also had a 5 pounder of the vanilla ice cream. I love the banana. It doesn't go well with water. However, it goes very well with either milk (tastes exactly like a banana milkshake) or orange juice (as part of a smoothie, or just the two). The variety keeps the otherwise massive jug from getting boring. Taking it with juice is particularly helpful if stacking with Creatine (for the insulin spike).
 This is my go-to protein powder. I have only ever used this one because I know that it works and also the fact that it is sold my a reputable brand. It is loaded with BCAAs and tastes AMAZING! Personally, I like the coffee flavor.
 Love it, buy it during sales.  The only protein powder that my mom and sister will use.  They had been trying others and had not found one they like and i gave them a almond milk shake with this and they loved it.
 I did not like this product and tried to return both of the containers I purchased. They told me they were not returnable, so now I am stuck with something I won't use and out $100 :(
 ON Gold Standard Whey has truly been the standard against which protein powders are judged, and ON is number 1 for a reason. Product consistency, a wide range of flavors and a strong nutritional breakdown make this THE choice for anyone who views sports nutrition in its own category as part of a good diet. A+
 This is the most consistent whey protein I've purchased. I've bought others but I'm the most comfortable with this one.
 I've been taking gold standard whey protein for a couple of years now and I can honestly say it's my favorite protein powder. I've tried many other products which have been cheaper as well as much more expensive (too expensive honestly) and would have to say that this right here is the best one to buy. Also, flavor wise, the extreme milk chocolate is just delicious!!! It's like a blast of chocolate in your mouth. I wish i could just drink this all day but unfortunately i cannot :(
 Tasty
 My fav protein powder, flavor is great and dissolves effortlessly.
 Optimum Nutrition has a long history of producing great products. It is the only company I buy protein, creating and BCAA products from.
 I purchased this brand based on other reviews. It tastes great and is easy and quick to mix in one of the shakers with the wire ball. You can take it with you in the car when you are in a hurry. It also keeps me from getting hungry for two hours or more so when I don't feel like eating breakfast when I first get up I prepare this instead. It also gives me great energy to start the day, especially when I have not had enough sleep, even better than coffee!
 This protein works great for me. The main reason I tried it is because it is low in cholesterol. I put it in my coffee to go in the morning and it dissolves instantly and tastes great.
 The chocolate is my favorite.
 Delicious! No aftertaste. Chocolate Malt
 The taste is somewhat different to what I thought it would be like but this is a good protein! This must be very good because it leaves me very full, I don't eat after I take this protein, I don't know if that's ok, but this leaves me full.<br/><br/> :p
 Hate to give such a good rating for fear ON will avoid putting it on sale.
 Dissolved MUCH better than grocery store Body Fortress powder.
 Been buying gold standard for years. High quality, tastes great. Can't recommend enough.
 Tastes good. I mix with fresh fruit. Usually blueberries or blackberries. I do use a blender but I think it would mix fine without one.
 Just what I was looking for.
 Bought for my son serving in Afghanistan.  He asked for specifically.
 The flavor is great. Quality is great. Just wish it had more protein.  Might get the big can. Fair price just gonna wait and see if i like results too. Would recommend :)
 Woooow, great flavor.<br/><br/>I've tried:<br/>-Cookies and cream<br/>-Strawberry<br/>-Coffee toffee fudge<br/>-Cake batter<br/><br/>This is one of the best flavors for this excellent protein, only surpassed by cookies and cream. GET IT NOW.<br/>Since it doesn't have lot's of carbs, it's great for pancakes, waffles, shakes, EVERYTHING. Don't get any other, get this one.
 My favorite whey protein on the market! I've had every flavor and there all tasty. Can't best gold standard whey!
 for the gains
 The flavors, specifically rocky road and banana cream taste great. Compared to other brands it is very affordable as well.
 Good product but I’ve been getting tension headaches shortly after taking it. Will have to stop
 Tastes so good! Recommend dropping in 3 cracked iced cubes to either water or milk your mixing it with, to give it a nice thick feeling.
 Tastes great and mixes well with milk. I accidentally got the double chocolate. I wasn't happy at first since I'm not a huge chocolate fan, but it was actually pretty good. My only complaint that a serving size is a rounded scoop. I wish a scoop with the top flattened was an actual scoop, but it's pretty easy to fix that when tracking calories. Fairly minor complaint
 Very tasty, and the five pound tub lasts FOR-EV-ER. The double rich chocolate is delish, especially when blended with a frozen banana, milk, and a tablespoon of peanut butter.
 This mix, almond milk, raw almonds, finely ground coffee, and a frozen banana. Gets me thru the morning with no hunger pains, and it tastes great!
 I think the biggest issue with protein powder is taste. It can taste good but too distinct to drink it everyday like an avid gym go-er needs to do. What's great about this is the taste is good yet bland enough that you can drink it 5x per day for years and not become adverse to drinking it. This is one of the most important things for a serious gym guy like myself.
 I've always loved the brand but unfortunately the Vanilla Ice cream flavor I chose isn't really good  to me :( I shouldve picked double chocolate instead.. Overall it's great but flavor.. not really.
 This is an awesome product. White Chocolate is my favorite, highest protein proportion per serving in the market. Great quality and awesome taste. I am 44, I work out and swim 1h daily and on a healthy diet. It has definitely helped me to gain 2 sizes of pure muscle in one year and I would have done even better if I could have trained more regularly...
 Double chocolate didn't live up to the hype. Extreme milk chocolate though is where it's at.
 Love the powder, been using for just over a year. The price increase of almost $15 is now sending me to the local nutrition store which carries an equal quality product at the lower price.  On the bright side, I can support my local economy. Great product though.
 The only protein I've ever had that tastes good even when mixed with just water. I usually use milk and a scoop of PBFit.
 Works well, just like when I purchase in the store.
 I have been using this protein going on seven years now, it hasn't let me down yet as it provides everything I need in a protein powder -- a high level of quality protein, BCAA's, and glutamine, with a low fat and carb content. Hands down the best protein around without all the gimmicks.
 Just finished up a tub. It was great. Tasted better than most chocolate milks and dissolved really well (if shaken immediately) in milk. Just got a new tub and the protein is way clumpier than my last one (in the tub, dry) and doesn't dissolve as well. I'm guessing some moisture got in at some point. Kind of disappointing to have to go through 5 lbs of bad quality control. I still recommend it though.
 Came earlier than expected as well as taste great (Mocha Capp.) I have had no problems with it yet, except for the fact that the scooper was deep inside the powder, and im guessing that's because of the movement while being shipped...
 I've been using this protein for about 8 months now and am pleased with the results. My recovery time is noticeably shorter when taking this. I had to go a week without it because I forgot to order it and noticed a big difference. The taste is not bad either.
 THANKS
 Great product:<br/>Good clean protein and tastes great!<br/>I use this to make a shake every morning for breakfast and use after workouts for faster recovery.<br/>Make it with milk and add peanut butter for a good meal replacement.<br/>My background:<br/>I am a former body builder but now just exercise to stay fit and keep lean.<br/>I also used to own a nutrition store.
 I"ve been taking it for around a year now as part of my (lazy) workouts &amp; nutrition with no problems as far as I can tell. My few doctors of different specialties see no problem in my blood tests.
 This is quality whey, but I just don't like the fact that it has soy in it (see the affects of soy on testosterone levels). I try to stay soy-free and I used to take this product because it was the cheapest in bulk. I wouldn't buy it again since I have found another brand that I trust more, but for anyone else, this is a very good value!
 Good protein supplement for the money.  Only 3 g of carbs per scoop which isn't too bad, but there are some supplement with ZERO carbs.  I love the Rocky Road flavor!  A good light chocolate flavor! TIP: mix a scoop in your coffee...instant, healthy cappuccino!
 I tried this flavor in a variety pack I ordered from Amazon. I have to disagree with the reviewers so far. I have tried 8 of the different flavors, none of which were bad and Rock Road is actually one of my favorites. I love the way it has a mild chocolate flavor.  When I was a kid, I would pour a cup of 1/2 chocolate milk and 1/2 skim milk. To me, this tastes very much like that. I will be ordering this flavor and also probably vanilla ice cream, banana cream, and chocolate.
 After trying many brands of protein - this is by far one of the best. Power Fortress for me and many others have often led to gassyness - and it sucks. This is definitely one of the better options out there, even though it maybe a little bit more pricey - definitely worth it though. But having only whey isolates cuts a lot of calories (comparatively to Muscle Gainz), so this is definitely for this who are looking to stay lean but want to build that muscle mass ^^
 typical chocolate taste not too sweet - I like it. .
 Wasn't expired.  Not sure what else to say...it's ON protein.
 Blends in and dissolves very well. Delicious flavor when mixed with milk , although not so much with water. But nutritional facts are very good. I compared with many of the main popular brands. It has more protein, and less carbs, fat, and sugar per serving.
 I was very hesitant on buying the mint flavor. But this lasted me a few months and was very tasty and packed a lot of protein. Great with muscle recovery and growth, and it mixes quite well in a blender bottle. I do wish the scooper that comes with it had a slightly longer handle, and it was buried deep into the jar when I opened it so it was hard to find, but trust me it will be there.
 This cam highly recommended on Amazon with a lot of positive reviews.  It tastes terrible and doesn't dissolve well.  I usually use Dymatize but I thought I would try something different.  Not only does Dymatize taste better but the contents, at least at face value, seem better. Unless the ingredients are of that much superior quality I am not sure why this is recommended so highly.  I will finish it and update the review if I can noticeably tell the difference in value but right now I would not buy this again.
 The only thing I don't like about the double rich chocolate is that it has some artificial flavoring whereas my old vanilla was all natural. That said, it tastes pretty good, and when I throw in a table spoon of peanut butter with 8oz of milk and blend it, I get a protein, sort of meal-replacement drink, that tastes just about as good as the herbalife shakes everyone raves about.
 Overall, this is a good whey powder in terms of grams protein/grams in a scoop. Flavors (chocolate and vanilla) are too sweet for me, so it is hard to drink every morning. Even the naturally flavored version of this has people complaining about sweetness. If you want something you can add to a smoothie without a noticeable taste, then this isn't it. I prefer bodylogix natural whey, but the price has gone up on that one recently.
 I don't know the taste, I don't know the effects of this product but I know that I order one flavor and they mess up, I ordered again, they mess it up again... So am I crazy and I don't know how to order who using Amazon for like more then 3yrs or they are just f...k up in head and don't know difference between flavors....
 I've tried several different types of protein and I find myself always coming back to Gold Standard.  I've explored various different flavors and have to say extreme milk chocolate is amazing.  If you're a coffee drinker I'd go for the mocha cappuccino as that is very tasty as well.
 My wife got roped into trying this Visalus stuff so I did a little research. Half a scoop of this (plus a multi-vitamin which you should be taking anyhow) will replace the exorbitantly priced Visalus mix. Visalus is also Soy based where this is not.<br/><br/>The flavor is very good. I drank it with just water or if you want to start mixing flavors, this and any of the other flavors (all chocolates, vanilla, strawberry, etc) was very good. If I felt the need for something sweet, a cup of milk with half a scoop of this and half a scoop of Extreme Chocolate satiated it.<br/><br/>Don't fall for the MLM and Pyramid schemes out there. This stuff will cost you close to 1/10th of what the Visalus product will, it will last 4 times as long and it's far better for you. ON makes excellent products. I have been using them for over 3 years now and haven't had a complaint yet.
 I freeze Pineapple -Coconut juice into cubes....add banana, Marinelli's Apple Juice and cube of Pine-Coconut into blender...adding lots of supplements including Dextrose and Glutamine....absolutely delicious....putting on pounds of muscle...great product that I have been using for years
 Great. I would buy again.
 I've been a user of whey protein for over 20 years. It has done wonders for me in my recovery after a great workout and also assisting me in my development.
 One shake daily for me early morning helps me stay focused at work. While this can easily dissolve with just water, I blend mine with berry's or bananas, milk or juice or water and I add one scoop of beet juice (special blend by nutherapy).
 Good
 I recently purchased the optimum nutrition gold standard whey protein. After reading the reviews on this product I was impressed and decided to make a purchase. I was slightly concerned about trying this particular flavor "vanilla ice cream", but let's be honest, who can say no to ice cream? I have to say I love this flavor! My favorite so far is strawberry ice cream! Just take one scoop of powder, one cup water, one cup frozen strawberries, and blend well. Please note I mix all of my whey powder with fruit or extracts never just powder and water.
 very nice, and good delivery time
 If you Google "Optimum Nutrition Whey Protein" it won't take you long to find out that this stuff is one of the best bang-for-your-buck protein powders on the market.  So the real question is, "How does it taste?" The cake batter flavor is OUTSTANDING... seriously tastes like yellow cake and makes my morning smoothies even better.  I've been told all the other flavors are great as well, but I can definitely co-sign for CAKE BATTER.
 I mixed with 6-8 oz of water... def a no go.  I am going to try the 4 oz as recommended- and see if it’s better.  I don’t like the thin consistency as compared to other shakes I have used - so I hope less water will help.  Def doesn’t taste like a melted chocolate milkshake as I was expecting.
 Best protein product out there.  I'm lactose intolerant but i'm able to have three shakes a day without any issue, something that i can't say of every other protein product that i've tired.
 I love the taste and convenience of it.
 Within five weeks of my new work out regiment I have put on 13lbs of muscle. It mixes well, tastes decent, and doesn't upset my stomach like some protein powders do. Very pleased.
 Strong chemical taste, had to return it.
 This mixes very well, but I'm not personally a fan of the Rocky Road flavor (which I had read was the most popular). I think when I get through this one, I'll reorder in chocolate or vanilla.
 Good
 Arrived on time and works very well! Good for work outs and actually tastes good with milk! It’s okay with water but be sure to use milk.
 By far the best tasting protein flavor ever, I have a weak stomach and I’m not a big fan of protein shakes at all. This product from ON changed my mind! Well worth it!
 Absolutely delicious and shown to be the best protein powder from third party research. Easily dissolves into water and milk. Only complaint involves digging around for the scooper every time so if you are a repeat buyer save your scoop.
 I have been a long-time fan of Optimum Nutrition's Protein powders though I like some flavors better than others =) This Strawberry flavor is absolutely delicious - especially with milk!<br/><br/>Can't recommend it enough!
 The "Extreme Milk Chocolate" flavor is my favorite protein powder to date - but I recommend mixing it with a blender or blender ball.  You can get away with using a spoon or fork in a pinch, but this powder takes on an almost "shake-like" quality when properly blended!
 having only tried this flavor but I enjoy it a lot!
 Optimum Nutrition has a great deal here! got my 10lb bag and the chocolate flavor is awesome! I will definitely be ordering from them again when i am out. Fast shipping! A+++ and the product was packaged great! thank you!
 I got the banana flavor. Yuck tastes awful.condistency is very watery to. I used a lot of other brands and most of them have a thicker consistency with just adding water. I'm going to use the rest of this in pancake batter. Drinking this is not my proffered method.
 My favorite whey for about 6 years now. Whether I'm leaning out or adding muscle, this whey fits best with my macro management. The flavor is great and not too sweet or not to bland in my opinion.
 Has really helped the pain in my quads.
 good stuff. Not a lot of flavor but that's not a bad thing
 Great Whey protein and Banana tastes awesome! A little pricey, but worth it. Use every morning after workout to give body Protein it needs. If this Whey was cheaper I would buy a lot more and drink throughout day. Used many Whey protein powders in last 20 years and without a doubt this one is one of the best I ever had.
 Tasty, definitely a company that I continue to trust and will continue to buy from, just wish the price was a little more reasonable.
 It does not get as thick as before, unless you put the whole package in the water. =/
 Great Product, taste really good, can't even tell it's in my milk<br/>Also they sent me a small trial of their pre-workout mix which is nice<br/>the tub is huge and is more or less full so I got plenty to use for the next couple of months.
 Really great, not too sweet, and I haven't noticed any gasiness. I could drink it (mixed with milk) every day &amp; not tire of it.  Mixes easily.
 One of the best protein powders I've used. The flavor is good and it doesn't clump at all. I've definitely had trouble with other brands that didn't mix up well, but I haven't had any issues here.
 I purchased this product monthly for a few years now, because it was simply the best whey protein available for a competitive price after doing thorough research. Unfortunately it has come to my attention that optimum nutrition is now using artificial sweeteners in their protein products. I do not want to put that chemical garbage in my body so I now need to find another protein which won't be easy because they are all putting the same garbge in ll their products. ON has naturally flavored line but there are only three flavor choices and I have no idea what it tastes like. They also give you several less servings for the same pice as the original whey 5lb product but costs the same. I just cancelled my order. Thanks for messing up a "once great" product.  Typical
 Tried one cup with water and it was just bearable but I can usually stomach bad tasting stuff but I switched to honey vanilla almond milk and this stuff tasted kinda like frosted cake batter which was a significant improvement. Use milk or almond milk it GREATLY improves taste.
 I have just consumed nearly half of the product and results are better than any other protein I have tested before, I can see how my muscles are growing. Note: I'm using this combined with the "phase 8 protein"
 Helps a lot
 Works for me. Taste ok. But I didn't buy it for its flavor. Good quality powder that is affordable. Shut up and chug it.
 rocky road was way too sweet for me in almond milk but was perfect in unsweetened soy milk. i find it gives me a bit of gas but that might just be eating a high protein diet in general. I might try vanilla next time, not the biggest fan of sweet flavours.
 That's a cool protein mix! It worth every penny! You can feel the difference after the gym! The best with milk, but better results with water, as is faster absorbed (but not so tasty)! Over all 5 stars as its getting your muscles pumped up in a natural look.
 I don't see any progress with this
 I like the product ,I  mix with fruit. But I ordered strawberry flavor and I recieved chocolate flavor
 Very good taste, made with good quality materials. All of the flavors  taste good.
 This is legitimately the only whey protein that I buy any more.  Fantastic taste, fantastic effect.  Can be used for meal substitution or simply to put on muscle.  No chemical aftertaste and plenty of different kinds of protein.  Love it.
 Was really wondering if this protein was going to be worth the money for all the hype it received... YEP, DEFINITELY WORTH IT.<br/>Mixes 100% better than my previous proteins with very little to NO chunks left behind after shaking plus I bought Rocky Road and it tastes fantastic - I really enjoying drinking it. Would recommend to anyone.
 I'm super picky with protein, I hate that gritty texture when it doesn't mix well. This stuff is the BEST! I generally mix this with unsweetened vanilla almond milk, just in a shaker cup, no blender. I've tried vanilla ice cream, chocolate,  strawberry, banana creme, and chocolate malt. They are all quite good, but strawberry has been my favorite. This protein definitely gives you the most bang for your calorie buck!
 Great price. The only protein I use and keep me from having to go to store with the annoying sales rep.
 Tastes great in shakes and I’ve been adding it into to brownie/muffin mixes and it’s amazing!
 The only product that I buy.  The taste is good.  It does clump a little but a few extra strong shakes and it loosens up.  I stack this with creatine and glutamine and it makes a real nice combination.  I'll keep on buying.
 Mostly this review is for the flavor (rocky road) as opposed to the actual product. I had been going with strawberry for a while but switched as per reviews on here. However, the smell is VERY strong (not in a bad way, just overwhelming) to the point that most of my coworkers can smell it when I make a shake. Also, honestly the flavor isn't that good, loses to strawberry by a landslide in my opinion.
 I have been working out from the last year. I didn't know about right supplement before. After using this I have got the real pump in muscle. And I can say this tastes great along with great health benefits.
 Tastes pretty good even when mixed with water. When its mixed with milk, it tastes pretty great. I can see noticeable gains when I take this whey protein. I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because of the hefty price, but other than that, Optimum Nutrition's whey doesn't disappoint.
 The flavor isn't too over powering
 Iv been on an ANTI-FUNGAL DIET for 1month and been waitng for this product and mroe to come.which have come!!! did my arms workout today with heavier weights,more intensity!! and of course..more love and happiness!!! knowing these products have come!!<br/><br/>TASTE--Amazing taste.iv tasted many flavors from OPtiumum nutrition and this one is the best one so far for my taste buds,this one or chocolate mint.<br/><br/>TEXTURE--Thickness of the shake id say 3/5  not sludgy thick but thick enough to make it creamy<br/><br/>product came quick and came right in the middle of my workout with creatine!! so really gonna bulk up<br/><br/>Also a tip....for best bulking up results.do a bulking phase after youve gone through a low carb phase and OR removing all processed foods and milk*including whey*...this is what iv done and if you know how to time the foods and supplements right.you WILL build mass,about 1 lb a month,even more if your aroudn age of 18-26.when your testosterone is up the roof
 Fantastic, pure protein powder. No added anything, just what you need! 100% love
 You can't go wrong with double rich chocolate, it mixes well and tastes great.  I just got the cookies and cream as well and it tastes amazing!  The 5 lb tub is a bargain and all of ON products are usually pretty trustworthy, so I love buying these over some of their competitors in, let's say, Wal-Mart or a supplement store.
 good to go
 Double chocolate has an unusual synthetic chocolate taste, not horrible but different than anything else I've tried. Actually tastes better with water than with regular milk, but tasted really good with vanilla almond milk.
 Delicious and economical.
 Taste gets old but this is the best bang for your buck protein and ON is as quality as you can get.
 I will be the first to say that I hate protein powders. They usually have a funky taste and don't mix well. Gold Standard Whey, however, broke that mindset completely. We got the double chocolate. It does not have the weird aftertaste, it doesn't smell gross, it mixes extremely well, and the nutrient information (Im assuming it is accurate) is what I needed for a doctor-ordered high protein/low carb diet. It says it has 74 servings, so it should last for as long as we need it... and then I'm gonna order more because this is an excellent post-workout protein hit.<br/>It also does not sit hard in my stomach like other brands do. The taste is very similar to chocolate soy milk (Silk). I use a blender bottle and cold water, it's great! I would love to try this with almond milk, that sounds tasty. I sampled a couple other flavors and they were all really good as well.<br/>There is a small amount of milk product in this. My husband is lactose intolerant but this actually does not bother him as long as he sticks with the single 6-8 ounce serving.
 So far the best tasting protein i've had.
 Great price for a great product. Flavor is great. I've been buying this for a few years now and for sure the most quality and best tasting out there.
 love this stuff. use it almost everyday and it tastes great (french vanilla). recommend mixing it with milk. so good
 My favorite protein shake. Most protein per $. I've seen the best results at the gym after I've been drinking this stuff. Must buy!!
 I'm no scientist, but I'm pretty sure this stuff is pretty high quality based on popularity and other people I've talked to who are much more fit and swole than me. Maybe I'm wrong though and just riding on a bandwagon. However, the taste leaves something to be desired. It's a little bland. Before this stuff I used Annex Elite Gold (Chocolate Malt), which was authoritatively delicious, and before that I used Gaspari Nutrition Pro Biotic Myofusion (Cookies &amp; Cream and Vanilla) which was also complete yum.<br/><br/>That said, maybe that's because it has less sugar. Maybe it's got less B.S. inside of it all around. I'm no scientist.
 I used to buy my protein at 1lb increments and it added up fairly quickly and it was a pain to keep ruining out to buy more.  Buying it in this 5lb bulk saves money and it's a great product.  It taste great, non-chalky, and not a ton of added fillers.  3rd time buying this product and will continue to keep buying it.  They ship fast, so if I'm low on protein, I usually order and it arrives by the time I've finished my original bottle. At one point I ordered it and it arrived next day.
 Have loved the taste and ease of mix, does have some after taste.  Update I amusing this in a smoothie now mixed with frozen fruits,  nutritional yeast, and coffee mixed in our nutria bullet.  Works really well.  I use the smoothie as a mid morning pick me up, snack or what ever you want to call it.
 I've been taking this protein for about 1 year now. It definitely helping me out with my workouts. I can see some muscle on my body. Taste really good too. I liked to make a smoothie with this protein. Highly recommended.
 I've tried so many different protein powders, different brands, different flavors and each time I had to force myself to drink it.  It was ok if I had a blender around but a lot of time I had to use a shaker at the gym and most powders dont taste good or mix well in a shaker.  When I read the reviews about this protein, I saw things like mixes easily, no blender needed, tastes good... so I decided to give it a try.  WOW!  The double chocolate tastes just like chocolate milk, its not as sweet as muscle milk or as thick.  It mixes really easily in a shaker which is perfect for me when I have to mix it at the Gym.  I'm so impressed I ordered the bananna cream so i can add it to some of my fruit smoothies in the morning!  I highly recommend this product.
 One of the best protein powder i used so far. Good taste and does not leave any after taste.<br/>Product shipped on time and received on time as expected.
 So I purchased this flavor because it was the cheapest out there and I can compromise flavor over price. I think we all know that optimum makes darn good protein powder. Probably the best for the price, in my opinion. SO yeah, i was surprised with the taste of Cookies n' Cream. Tastes much better than I thought... definitely you can pick out the cookies and cream (there are actual little black particles in there for the cookies!)and I would venture to say there is even a hint of tootsie roll in there, haha.
 I used to mix this in with powdered Soylent, but now I just drink Soylent bottles.<br/><br/>It's pretty good when mixed with other stuff but I wasn't a fan of just the whey and water.
 Good stuff, clean protein.  I have to take a smaller amount due to not being able to digest the recommended scoops.  Really assists with feeding the areas of need.
 This whey tastes as good as some of the more expensive whey powders I've had with pretty much the same amino acid profile. Love the French Vanilla Creme, not so crazy (although it's just a personal taste, my wife loves it) about the White Chocolate. I like to blend my protein with blue berries so I prefer a light flavor rather than Chocolate.
 Delicious and mixes well. We've tried several different flavors, and the banana is by far my favorite. Obviously if you are mixing it with a fruit or drink that clashes with the banana, it could be problematic, otherwise the taste is superb.
 I love this product - it makes as close to a real milkshake as you'll find in a protein shake and it's so easy.<br/>This protein powder provides 48% of your daily protein needs in one serving.  The 5 lb container has 77 servings.  I also purchased a single serve blender to have at my office to make these during the work day.  For best results, use frozen fruit such as strawberries or blueberries and a banana and lactose free milk. I use fat-free, lactose-free, calcium added. Occasionally I add a package of Trivia for a sweeter taste.
 I purchased this product after reading many reviews and deciding that ON was the best way to go. This is now the second time I have purchased from Optimum Nutrition and so far all has worked very well. I use the product to help me rebuild muscle after fatigue from exercising. It also works good to hold you over if you don't have time to eat a meal right away, it will keep me full for around 2 hours.
 A wonderful powder, absolutely great taste, without any fake sugar after taste.
 The flavor sucks and it seems overpriced.There are way better tasting brands out there. Sucks for me I threw the box away so I cant return this and stuck with 5 pound of dirt,
 after all these years I still haven't found a better tasting whey product.<br/>It mixes very well and the taste is great. Great product.
 Tastes great, good value for the price
 this is my first time to buy albumen powder, for now i do not see any bad thing about this product, i like banana, so i chose the banana flavor
 Protein has been getting more expensive lately, but this one provides what it says it will. It tastes good especially with a little peanut butter.
 This shake is so good I dream of drinking it. I wonder if I could have like ten shakes a day and grow over 50 pounds of muscle in a year? Can you imagine? Actually for the price I think this is by far the best protein. Lots of flavored to choose from too. Although what if you tried a new flavor and hated it? Then you'd be stuck with five pounds of the stuff.
 First time I tried this flavor and I will just say I'm glad I only purchased 1 pound of it. I gave 2 stars just because of the protein per serving taste was big thumbs down for me
 Double chocolate rick has 24 Gms of protein per 30.4 gms of scoop which is very good ratio of protein. Great mixability and quality. I can see the results :)
 Great taste. Good price when on sale. Cheaper than Costco.
 Great product and it taste good too (with milk). Taken with creatine yields great results. Thanks
 Let me start off by saying it's a great protein powder! I've bought several tubs of Gold Standard before and never once had an issue. I'm halfway through my tub and all of a sudden it smells terrible! I'm scared to take anymore. It has a smell almost like expired milk but the expiration date is good. Has anyone else had this problem?
 This is my favorite whey protein for taste. I don't have any evidence as to its efficacy compared to competing brands, but it does the job for me. That said, be sure not to order this with a heavy item. My powder came with a package along with a shredder. The whey protein container was smashed, leaving whey protein all over everything. I opened the container unsuspecting and ended up with whey protein all over my entranceway and spent an hour cleaning it all up.
 this stuff is amazing... I take it first thing in the morning when I wake up and maybe one before I fight. Then after I fight I take a hydrowhey... great stuff... Whey Gold Standard is much more cost effective than some of the hydro products
 I have a chocolate or vanilla ON shake almost daily, usually for breakfast.  It has a great calorie profile (almost all protein) and tastes good for a protein shake. The vanilla tastes good in milk or juice blended with berries and spinach (add ice or freeze the berries).  Then chocolate is great in milk, blended with a banana and spinach (add ice or freeze the banana).  I don't care for the taste in water.<br/><br/>The shake goes down easily and is great as a recovery drink too.  The price is competitive with other cheaper protein shakes, particularly with subscribe and save.
 I put a few drops of Stevia, ice, a little cream and water. Tastes like a malt. Low carb.
 I don't really know how effective whey protein is for my work out but it kept be full enough for a work out and after if I wasn't eating dinner right away. My friends think this tastes good but it's pretty hard for me to swallow so I should've tried the vanilla instead.
 The container of Double Rich Chocolate I got doesn't have the usual rich chocolate flavor that I've been accustomed too. The Whey was clumpy when I first opened it, but easily sifted to its normal fine granular state. I was surprised that the flavor wasn't what it normally is. Maybe I got a bad batch?
 Leaves a strong after-taste - Vita-Glo is less expensive and richer in flavor.
 First off, my review is not intended to address whether this product has the intended physiological or nutritional effect; there's no way for the individual user to know for sure.  The objective of this review is to highlight differences in taste, sweetness, mixability, and ingredients between different flavors available for this product.<br/>Chocolate Coconut is intensely sweet, very powdery, and has a strong flavor of both chocolate and coconut.  It tastes great, but the sucralose gives me a "buzzy" feeling similar to those I get from other artificial sweeteners.  It mixes readily with coffee or water; a wire mixing ball like the ones typically found in protein shakers is not necessary.  This means a couple teaspoons of powder can be mixed with black coffee as a substitute for coffee creamer, and stirred in with a teaspoon.<br/>Double Chocolate is a little more clumpy than chocolate coconut and has a taste reminiscent of plain cocoa powder.  If you try to stir it into coffee with a spoon, small clumps of undissolved powder will float to the top.  Because lactase is used as a sweetener, it is less sweet than chocolate coconut; also, I do not get the undesired buzzy feeling I get with other sweeteners like aspertame, sucralose, stevia, etc...<br/>If you are ultra-particular, you can read the list of ingredients in each powder and see that the formulations are quite different.  Also, note that there is a small caloric difference between the two flavors, and small differences in other nutritional components listed in the "nutrition facts" label.<br/>I plan to try other flavors and update my comment to cover the differences I expect to find.  Thanks for reading!
 Amazing flavor and fast delivery thank youuuuu
 Best protein on the market. Tastes great &amp; the macros are awesome. Best buy is through amazon or when it goes on sale at Costco.
 Great whey protein for workouts. Tastes great.
 I currently use aftermax and have for quite some time. Great stuff and the chocolate flavor was great.<br/><br/>The cake batter was a toss up mainly because my wife was interested and its a great flavor with water.<br/>I highly recommend using ON and wanted to give my opinion on the flavor specifically.
 Really very yummy. Will buy again
 The taste isn't fantastic but once in a smoothie you don't really notice it. Higher in calories than some other powders but for the price and size, it's almost impossible to beat.
 Good product.
 Smooth, creamy, good chocolate flavor.
 I have been using this whey for about a month now mostly as a meal replacement. The vanilla tastes great with either water or milk. I can't say if it is great for packing on the muscle, as my weight has remained about the same with lifting 2-3 times a week. I will leave that advice to someone who has used it longer with a more serious workout schedule, but it tastes great compared to others I've tried and will definitely buy again.
 Product as described.
 Strawberry flavored powder is AMAZING. Yummy flavor, mixes well, has a solid amount of protein in it, what more can you ask for!
 We have used this protein for two years now, I favor the natural vanilla flavor for daily and post workout smoothies mixed with coconut milk, blueberries, Acai and Maqui concentrates but my wife prefers this double chocolate.  It's great stuff and we have transformed and sculpted our bodies with improved diet and exercise over the last 2 years to a degree I would never have believed as we are 58 and 60 years old.  We're now in better shape muscle and weight wise than when we were 40 or maybe even 30, we use this as a protein boost nearly every day.<br/><br/>A while back we gave up the last of our regular sugar consumption by eliminating it from our morning coffees.  I really didn't enjoy it black and unsweetened and one day I thought to add the ON.  Not bad!  We now mix the double chocolate with organic whole milk or half and half into our coffee with a few drops of stevia liquid.  Fantastic!<br/><br/>If you add the protein powder directly to hot coffee it tends to clump pretty badly. The way to avoid that is to add the milk first to your cup then a HEAPING teaspoon of powder which easily mixes into the milk, then add the hot coffee and froth with the Aerolatte.  It's slightly sweet as is or you can add a few drops of stevia liquid concentrate.  I don't like to eat in the morning,  I have tried bulletproof coffee but I much prefer this, 2 cups in the morning and I am good until 11 or 12 when it's time for bacon and eggs and the full protein berry smoothie.<br/><br/>The Aerolatte is invaluable for mocha's and cappuccinos:<br/><br/> http://www.amazon.com/Aerolatte-56AL3SAT-Milk-Frother-Satin/dp/B0002KZUNK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1415916668&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=aerolatte
 Premium quality. Highly recommended!
 Tastes good, works great! Packs a lot of protein with barely any sugar. I love it!
 Taste great
 The best protein shake that I've ever used.  I can feel the difference after using it for a month.
 Tastes great and easily mixed using BlenderBottle Classic Loop Top Shaker Bottle
 Have been buying this protein for years. Great value and amazing product!
 Great tasting and mixes very easy.
 Arrive as expected taste better than expected especially with lasco Lasoy original milk powder the taste is never better so for those who cannot afford almond milk think lasco Lasoy is another option
 I used to really enjoy the taste of this stuff-- the new formula tastes gross.  Not like chocolate.  Amazon accepted my return product no problem, which I appreciate.
 Short story, best whey for the money.  I've only had the Double Chocolate and it tastes great even with just water.  With milk, it gets a bit heavy but hard to distinguish from a real milkshake.
 I am having a good workout days after taking protein shakes post workout...but I observed that if I consumed with little more milk it makes lactose tolerance &amp; trouble in my stomach...leads to loose motions but I got it...way to ripped off
 My wife and I have used this for years.  It's a good balance of price vs quality.
 PROS<br/>Great Flavor<br/>Mixes very easily (no lumps)<br/><br/>CONS<br/>None<br/><br/>I am a big fan of Optimum Nutrition Products. I have used many of their protein products over the years as a form of recovery. This is the best I have had as far as taste and mix-ability is concerned. The product is delicious and mixes very well. For the price, there is no better protein for me. I have used the Platinum before, which is very similar, but slightly sweeter.
 This tastes great and I've bulked up a little bit since I started taking it after my workouts but I'm just not down with the artificial sweetners and soy. Is that crap really necessary? I'll probably go back to hemp protein. If you take this stuff drink a ton of water with it or it might constipate you.
 This tastes great.  Add some frozen fruit with milk and you've got yourself a great way to start the day.
 Best protein out there for the money.  My wife is a personal trainer and son in football, so we use a lot of protein.  Stop looking, save time, and buy it.  Great nutrition profile, mixing great, and tastes great!<br/><br/>Mike
 Was cheaper than local outlet prices, and had more favorable ingredients. However I can't say I'm a fan of the taste.
 I normally purchase this protein from another website, but that site's prices and shipping have gone up, so I discovered they sold it here. I purchase the Extreme Milk Chocolate, because out of all the flavors I have tried, it is the most delicious. I can drink this stuff all day long, it is that good. I put it in water most of the time and it is still amazing. I have tried it in milk and my breakfast shakes, and it just gets better. I highly recommend this product and the flavor to anyone who wants to try it. You will be hooked.
 Provides energy while doing resistance work in the gym and helps with muscle recovery. It's a little too sweet for me so when I mix it I add a tablespoon of unsweetened cocoa.
 I ordered the white chocolate, it tastes kind of bland and artificial. Rocky road was better.
 Good product
 I love this protein powder, which I'm happy about because I purchased the 5lb tub.  I take it after a workout and surprisingly it keeps me full for hours; and my body thanks me.  I usually mix it with 8-10 oz of water and it tastes like a milk shake (satisfies my sweet tooth as well). I also mix it with my spinach smoothies when I'm out of fruit and it's sooo good.
 Best value, quality protein powder
 This stuff is great.  I have bought many of these and will buy many more.  I love the double chocolate
 Great taste, great ratio of protein to carbs/fats. Easy solution for adding a healthy body of protein to your diet and exercise plan.
 Free of defects.  Looks exactly as pictured.
 Cookies and cream flavor isn't my favorite, but flavor isn't really important to me when choosing a protein. Quality is, and ON delivers some of the highest quality products in the market today. This product is no defferent. One of my go to proteins for years now and years to come. Superb value.
 Good
 I was seraching on my first protein to buy and deicded to go with this thought I'd give it a shot. Thought about going with the Double Rich Chocolate but many people perferred the Extreme Milk Chocolate so I went with the crowd. Recieve it Super Fast, 2 days from Order date. Tried it for the first today. THIS STUFF TASTE SO DAMN AMAZING! like can I just replace my meals with this? (kidding) haha
 Powder was flavorless, and had an "off" smell.  Was a struggle to use up the giant tub.  Vanilla Ice Cream?  I'm not sure who approved the flavor at this place, it actually made my soy milk taste worse.  I'm going back to Isopure.
 Great taste, mixes well. I used this product for a year straight. Helped me lose over 100lbs while I changed my diet and supplemented with high quality protien.
 Tastes great mixed into milk, yogurt, or whatever you like.  Doesn't mask the taste of unflavored BCAA as well as the chocolate varities, but I can live with that.
 Great protein powder. The only protein that i use. Highly recommend !
 Tasty. Despite containing lactase, I still had an upset stomach. Find away to try it first, if you are lactose intolerant.
 Excellent for what it is. On the second thought, I should have bought vanilla so that I could mix it with other flavours, but that was my mistake.
 I am currently doing the P90X program and needed another source of protein to supplement my diet. I generally take this product before working out in the morning. I will also take some throughout the day when I want some extra protein. They always mix well with a blender bottle or an electric blender. You will probably have issues mixing it if you are just using a spoon or a simple shaker cup. I have learned that its best to put some liquid in the bottom of the cup before adding the powder.<br/><br/>I have tried the chocolate, vanilla, and rocky road now. I am particular to the rocky road flavor. The other two tasted fine though.<br/><br/>I have tried the natural version of this product and was not satisfied with the flavoring and the mixing quality with my blender bottle. I am actually switching back to this cheaper version with the artificial sweeteners. I still like the other natural products by Optimum Nutrition, just not the whey.
 This is my very first time trying Whey protein of any kind.<br/><br/>The double rich chocolate flavor is delicious and I've only experimented with water! I'm afraid to try it with nonfat milk because I may want more than two shakes a day. :)  I drink this before working out and I feel more energetic during my workouts. I drink a second shake after my workout and feel good all day. I did not experience any bloating, gas or stomach irritation, as a few people mentioned.<br/><br/>Since some people couldn't find the scoop, before opening it I turned the jar upside down and shook it a few times, turned it right side up and used a teaspoon and found the scoop right away.<br/><br/>I'd be happy to try the fancy flavors if they ever make them without artificial sweetener. I got a free sample of blueberry lemonade in the jar but gave it away.<br/><br/>Thank you to all my Twitter friends who discuss Whey Protein and thank you to the people who answered the questions I had before buying this.
 I love this product for its nutrition value most of all. The price is good for the great quality product that you get. I use a shaker ball when I make my shakes before and after a workout and it dissolves just fine.<br/><br/>I got the Double Rich Chocolate flavor, and it isn't a good taste, at all. That's the reason for 4 stars and not 5. Everything else about this product is great, except the flavor. I'm going to try another flavor from them once I finish this. Hopefully that one will be better and it will be a 5 star product then.
 I have been ordering Gold Standard for 4-5 years now. It is a great whey protein product and one of the better tasting ones. I usually order it from bodybuilding.com, but having amazon prime provides a better deal for me as it deducts the shipping cost.
 Seems to help after lifting weights, adds some muscle.
 You get what you pay for. This protein mixes very well, tasty, and not full of FILLERS! Love it, and have been using Gold Standard for 5+ years. I bought this on Amazon, showed up in two days in a sturdy box. One thing to keep in mind, don't cut deep into the amazon box... you'll cut through the bag. I haven't done it thankfully but I imagine it's happened to people. Seems to easy!! Overall 5 stars for product and shipping!
 So generally I love optimum nutrition and I buy a lot of their stuff but this time when I got this tub, it didn’t come with a scoop. That’s actually pretty inconvenient. I literally weighed my servings out, and I’m positive the scoop was missing because I dug my hand through the tub for a few minutes
 This was a gift, but he said it is a great flavor and he is very happy with the product. It is something he uses daily.
 Most of us have tried many routes, I know I have.  Being said, I am really glad I tried this one, I'm pretty sure I will stick with this from now on.
 tastes yummy the powder has excellent rheological qualities it disperses easily in the fluid of choice and there are no lumps or any such nonsense. Worth the money 100%. Now it better build me some muscle or else.
 The flavor profile is excellent.  The product ships fast and is as described.  This is a great deal.  THe whey powder goes into solution readily, I use a little single person Hamilton Blender that detaches and lets you take your shake on go.  Pro tip, mix in milk with yogurt and a banana and creatine.
 I'm no body builder, and I'm no nutrition expert, but I have used this protein powder for a long time as a supplement to help get a bit more protein in my diet.  I don't know what happened, but this one is WAY sweeter than the ones I used to get.  I love this brand/kind because it always tastes good, mixes well, and from what I know, relatively healthy.  I have to say I'm a little confused/disappointed this time around.
 I'm a big fan of this brand, even though some flavors are better than others, they're all better than any other brand I've tried. I usually get hydro whey chocolate peanut butter, but I decided to try the Mocha Cappuccino and it's my new favorite. It tastes like coffee ice cream! I drink it a little too fast as a result. :)
 I don't think this product needs review, because it has already had its popularity. It was as good as I expected. (Also the taste of chocolate was very delicious.)
 its good protein, i got vanilla flavored, tastes great. but very sweet for my taste. mixes great with water or milk. but i opted for totally flavorless and sugarless (no sweeteners) of any kind.
 I've tried many flavors and types of whey protein and I always end up coming back to the gold standard.
 Very good product
 Best tasting protein powder, hands down. I've tried many. This doesn't give me gags and it mixes so well. The nutrition is on point.
 My favorite protein ever. I love that they offer smaller sizes to buy.
 Like the product, but the vanilla flavor is OK. That's a personal preference though. I'll buy again just a diff flavor.
 Amazon is the place to buy. No shipping and no tax if you are Prime. That puts it $10 or more cheaper than most sites.<br/><br/>Great protein, delicious, shakes or blends well. I like the vanilla flavors because I can add coffee, cocoa, flax seed or whatever.
 Regarding the Cookies &amp; Cream version:  I think the nutritional quality is as good as any of the ON products, but this stuff tastes truly awful.  I usually buy the Double Rich Chocolate, which is actually pretty good, but based on a couple of rave reviews, I ordered the C &amp; C flavor for a little change of pace.  Yuck.  I'm more than half way through the 5# and I really don't think I can make myself finish it.  I just received another jug of DRC and it is still way better than the C &amp; C.  Maybe its the sucralose (of which the chocolate has none), which I apparently can't tolerate.  If you have any issues with sucralose do not order this stuff.  Yuck.
 On a scale of 1 to 10 the taste of the shake is probably an eight. The ingredients of it in my opinion is a 10. It contains almost no fats, a very high amounts of high quality protein, and virtually no carbs making it an ideal shake for people wanting to build solid lean muscle.  Of course, I don't think any protein shake would in my opinion on a scale of 1 to 10 be a 10 as they all taste somewhat horrible.
 I'm a big believer in ON products and truly feel this is one of the best proteins on the market for the money.  The only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is the double rich chocolate doesn't taste as good as some cheaper brands I have bought in the past.  However the quality I feel I'm getting far out ways the taste and I'll continue to purchase.
 Hmm... I mentioned to my spouse that I thought the flavor had changed...after reading some recent reviews... I see why. Additional artificial sweeteners have changed the flavor significantly and will change my willingness to purchase, significantly.
 Some of the best out there. Low in carbs, good amount of protein per scoop and it not to expensive. Can't go wrong with Gold Standard
 It tastes good and I would mix it with chocolate milk or milk and add creatine.  Good value and it works.  Would Recommend.
 I really like this protein. I am not a fan of protein because the taste is so gross. But, this one is very fine and has good flavor. I will buy again.
 It tastes good (bordering on delicious if you add fruit), consistently delivers a lot of protein for a low price, blends easily, and has no appreciable texture.<br/><br/>They may not add a lot of extras to it, but it's the only stuff I've ever found that I can drink 2-3 times a day without batting an eye. Bag after bag, we keep coming back.
 Very good stuff
 My wife prefers a higher protein breakfast and your typical cereal doesn't have enough unless you want to eat oatmeal or shredded wheat all the time or Kashi which tends to go on sale less and were not really sold on the added soy protein that they add to their cereal so the ON Vanilla Ice Cream goes great with any cereal in the morning.  She mixes it with fruit and whatever cereal she is into that day and even oatmeal from time to time.  Mixes well with milk...tastes great and goes along with pretty much anything since it's vanilla.  I just wich it was on sale more often.
 Best whey protein for your money. It tastes great and the double chocolate is a great flavor.
 I've tried so many protein powders, Isopure and Lean Body for Her included. Rocky Road by Optimum Nutrition is my all time favorite flavor. I mix it with unsweetened almond milk. I see a previous reviewer hated the rocky road, so goes to show we all have different tastes.
 Have been using this protein for years.  Love the taste since it's not too sweet and just a simple, straight forward whey protein.  What I don't like is that the price just keeps bounding up.  It's quickly becoming cost prohibitive.
 Taste is awesome - it has minor clumping for me, but I think that is because I use whole milk (personal preference) instead of skim milk or water blend which I think is actually what the manufacturer recommends.
 I've ordered so many different protein powders over 2 decades. I always come back to this and will probably never change again. For the price, it is simply the best. Highly recommend the Rocky Road flavor. Its milk chocolate swirled with marshmellowy creaminess. You cannot beat it.
 Great product !
 I llove it
 my boys who both lift love this mix. we have reordered this multiple times over the years.
 Great  Protein. It will help you recover and grow as long as you did your part. I like it doesn't have a lot of extra ingredients. Taste is pretty decent!, Specially with milk. I feel a considerable difference between times where I make it part of my routine and times I may not be as disciplined. Definitely my new go-to.
 First order was fine. Second order causes my throat to burn. And I can’t return it.<br/>NEVER ordering again.
 This product came to my home tampered with.  The safety seal was obviously messed with.  The container is messed with too.
 Great product, used it before...  I just got it in today and it expires February 2018. We’re in April 2018… I’m just gonna throw it away.
 I liked it but I wasn't as impressed as with other powders. Check labdoor.com for info on better protein powders.
 I'm a 40-something mom who works out regularly and wanted to start using whey protein as a recovery meal after working out. At 24 grams of protein per serving, it's hard to rival as a quick, low-calorie protein source. I've had a few other protein shakes before that were barely palatable, but this shake tastes great and I actually look forward to it. I prepare it with milk and a few ice cubes in the blender. My two teenagers love it and usually have at least one shake/day. Sign up for the auto-ship option-it's a great deal! I laughed when the 5-lb container arrived: it's huge!<br/><br/>I'm a big fan of Jillian Michaels and have had incredible results with her 30-Day Shred DVD. (If you have a sluggish metabolism, this workout will kick it into gear with a 20-minute workout.) I also follow Dr. Mercola on the web and he stresses the importance of whey protein within an hour of your workout. I'm hoping that adding the whey shake will help me maximize my workout efforts.
 Great taste (French Vanilla) &amp; mixes well in a shaker cup or blender...
 Nice taste, easy to dissolve.
 This is a great product. The chocolate coconut  taste Great!!
 Mixes well and tastes pretty good.<br/>I've mixed this stuff with both water and regular cow's milk in classic blenders, shaker bottles, and even just a glass and spoon. This stuff always mixes well and very little power remains solidified. This makes things fairly easy when cleaning afterwards and I can't think of any complaints.
 Mix it with some milk and this is the best tasting whey on the market.
 Good product, but I have tried others that cost less that I like better.
 This flavor was so delicious.
 No complaints. Arrived properly sealed, has great flavor and I'd consider the ingredients in line with any other top brand of protein. I won't hesitate to buy again.
 The French Vanilla doesn't mix as easily as some of the other flavors and can be a little cloying. Solid product overall, will still be purchasing ON Whey just not the French Vanilla.
 ON is the best protein made in my opinion. The banana cream flavor is pretty good with some greek yogurt and fruit. ON protein is pretty pure without any heavy metal contamination etc. I highly recommend it. Amazon price is as good as I have found. All the flavors I have tried have been good. The vanilla is also very good.
 great thank you!
 I am following the Insanity workout and I am in my 5th week. I use it as my recovery drink after the workouts and I definitely see my energy level go up after I take the powder.<br/><br/>I have not had any issues with powder. It is tasty. The container is good. Awesome pure protein powder.
 Taste delicious and no aftertaste and works well. No more cramps after exercise.
 A gift.
 Great item, does the job, love the taste. Only complaints: it can have a grainy/powdery texture and doesn't always mix well, even with a good shaker bottle and aggitator.
 It tastes great and have great amount of protein as compared to the carbs and sugar.<br/>Superb option to supplement and use it as pre/post workout
 I bought this for my boyfriend, he always goes with this brand so he clearly loves it. ON products never disappoint.
 tried cookies and cream on a friend's recommendation- woah never again!  I will stick to chocolate!<br/><br/>ON is THE best whey out there and will be the only brand I buy- no clumping and no fake sweeteners.  Just want to be clear that I only buy ON and the cookies and cream flavor is garbage
 Great protein shake supplement
 Great Item! Shipped fast and arrived fast! Exactly what I wanted!!
 This product has been something i have been buying continually.  I have the Rocky road flavor now and its not very tasty.<br/><br/>so buy this double choc flavor.<br/><br/>Put in Blender.  for a 250 lb man<br/><br/>Two scoops 50 grams of fat free suger free protein<br/>some ice<br/>Almond milk<br/>two table spoons of Peanut butter<br/>a half of bananna<br/><br/>HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAh!
 8oz of milk, a tablespoon of peanut butter, two ice cubes, a rounded scoop of Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard Double Rich Chocolate in the blender for 45 seconds and you have a liquid Reese's Cup.  Delicious.
 Great product with healthy whey isolates as the main ingredient. Tastes the whey (see what I did there?) one would expect a supplement to taste.
 A friend recommended this product to me and I'm so glad he did. I use 2 scoops of this Double Rich Chocolate flavor and add a cup of skim milk and about 7-8 ice cubes in a blender. I like that consistency the best. If I want a really thick shake, I'll add about 10-12 ice cubes. I also add a tablespoon of organic peanut butter for added flavor--that is REALLY good. I drink this within 30-60 minutes of waking and it keeps me full for about 4-5 hours. Great stuff!
 Extreme Chocolate Milk flavor + milk + Ice = something that tastes pretty close to a Wendy's Frosty. Good stuff!<br/><br/>Previously, I was using ON's 100% Soy Protein but I'm making the switch to their Whey as the taste is massively better!
 Great tasting protein for a great price!
 ON has the best whey out there. Double Rich Chocolate tastes a lot like Extreme Milk Chocolate, but is less sweet/strong so it depends on your preference. Basically, you can't go wrong with their chocolate flavors. Very easy to blend too! I don't want anything else anymore.
 Delicious!  I can't believe how great this stuff tastes.  Mixes with no clumping in water or milk.  Scoop and a half in 8oz is a great post workout treat... just sweet enough and not too thick.
 I like the value of this vs the smaller sizes or buying it in those nutrition shops. My favorite flavors are double chocolate which I add to my coffee ( almost like a mocha drink ) and white chocolate. These two taste the best with water. I tried the vanilla but its not as tasty as the other flavors with water.
 Best flavor and dissolves better than any other brand we've tried. The kids love this "chocolate milk" too.
 Great taste, great outcome. My muscle mass has increased in 2 months dramatically using this protein. This brand provides great recovery support. If you want great protein and want to see the results... use gold standard 100 percent whey!
 Honest truth: If you really need to read the reviews about this then please do yourself a favor and actually research Whey Protein. Don't buy because I and someone else said it's the best. KNOW why it's THE best.
 Have looked on multiple supplement sites to compare prices since this purchase and have given myself a pat on the back for going through Amazon to purchase this protein. You simply can't beat the prices that Amazon offers for this product. Even through Optimum Nutrition's own website, it is almost the same price to buy a 2lb. tub for the same price that I got the 5lb. tub on Amazon.<br/><br/>Optimum Nutrition is really the best you can get as far as protein supplements go. I got Double Rich Chocolate and the taste is great. I am considering buying Strawberry Banana next to mix in with fruit smoothies.<br/><br/>I am definitely going to continue to buy supplements through Amazon. The prices just don't compare!
 After much Research,i chose to go with the ON Whey gold Standard. In a month i notice the difference in my Workouts.<br/>  I also supplement this the  On Casein before i go to sleep. The Extreme Milk Chocolate is Very good,like to mix my with milk.<br/>  I worried that it may not mix well,but had absolutely no problem with this issue. Great product;very satisfied with this purchase.<br/>  Looking Forward trying other flavors.
 had tried the chocolate, this flavor sounded good...actually like it mixed with the chocolate so you get chocolate and cookies and cream :-)
 Been using this for about 3 years or so.  Seems to help for everyday use.  Great source of protein.
 Got the item on time. ON is very trusted and well-known brand.<br/><br/>Pros: Price is very Good, 24G of protein , Overall a Good protein supplement to tone or build muscle.<br/><br/>Cons: Extreme milk chocolate is horrible with bare water !!!!!!! . I read like 5 different sites (bodybuilding.com,youtube, etc)  before i decided to buy this flavor. If you plan to mix this every time with water, STAY AWAY from this flavor. Maybe it may taste better with milk .This is just my un-biased review of mixing it with bare water.
 Extreme milk chocolate is the only flavor I've tried but believe me, it really is that flavor. No after taste, no bitter or dull flavor, and best of all: it's actually dissolves and doesn't ball up. I'm truly impressed. It's affordable for the amount it sells and contains more protein per serving that majority of its competitors.
 This is really a good whey protein powder. It's cheap and high in quality. On top of it all it tastes great. Can't wait to try it out!
 Great price on amazon.
 I finished the whole pack and it left no side effects. And i take this every day.
 Tasty cake batter and is so big for a great price..! Will buy again. The package came in on time
 Flavor is great, keeps me full! I mixed with about 80g of frozen fruit each morning and almond milk. The tub lasted me about two months, I used 1 serving per day. Will continue to purchase!!
 I have been using Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard for about 11 years as a meal replacement first thing in the morning.  I especially love the Double Rich Chocolate and add frozen blueberries or strawberries in the blender.  It is like having a treat that is so good for you!  I have recommended it to all of my family and friends because it is good for them and the taste is wonderful.  I love the fact that I am now on autoship and I don't have to worry about re-orders.
 Don't care for it dose not taste like Chocolate at all more like a chalky taste. Will not buy again.
 Great taste.<br/>Whenever I have this whey protein in my day, I feel better overall later that day. Don't know if some additives other than whey protein contribute to that. We've been hearing about some supplements out there that really stand out from the competition for different reasons. I just hope that this product is perfectly safe for long term use.
 Tastes great and filling!
 I love it. Really Good tase and works good for me.
 Great stuff not so much on the flavor it's really sweet but I've been able to get it down. I would order a different flavor next time. Good stuff either way!
 This protein has what you need to take your body to the next level all you need to do is pair this with an immaculate diet and a training program fit for the gods.
 great product! I like the natural flavor
 It taste like powder vanilla milk. Didn't like the taste. I'm not a big Milk fan. It's just my personal opinion, since taste could be very different from one another. If you like milk, go for it. ;)<br/>Great customer service :)
 Was good
 excellent product
 Perfect. Does just as described and is delicious.
 I love this protein powder. I've purchased it for the past 3 years now and wouldn't bother with nothing else. It taste great and has really made me feel full until the next meal.
 WHEY is one of my best. I did research on this product before buying and I am positive with the product and its result. 5 star *
 Not a bad taste for that protein to calorie ratio.
 Tastes great, gives me energy and wards off hunger. I don't work out at a gym, I walk 5 miles a day and it really helps boost my energy. I'm hoping it will help me shed a few pounds.
 Basically the benchmark for commercially available protein powders.  This is what I recommend to anyone who asks.
 Bought this thinking it would taste similar to a different type sold by O.N. at Costco. Not nearly the same, also much "chalkier" than the other.
 I am use to getting BSN products which I like a lot but I thought I’d try something new. Since this Optimum protein is popular I figured I’d give it a shot. So far I don’t like it at all. The chocolate taste is very poor, you can barely taste any chocolate in it when drinking. The powder doesn’t mix well at all and it still leaves chunks of powder stuck in the bottle after drinking. Overall I wouldn’t recommend this product to anyone and for the future I’m definitely sticking with BSN protein which is overall much better.
 Don't love. It's a bit intense. Like Isopure more.
 I needed to increase my protein intake as I am working out at the gym a lot more.  However, it's difficult to eat enough chicken, tuna, or beef throughout the day in order to meet my increased protein needs.  I saw this container at my gym, but it's double the price.  I was extremely pleased to find it at half the price on Amazon.<br/><br/>The flavor is surprisingly good.  Mixed with milk, it has a reasonably rich chocolate flavor without a chalky taste.  I use a personal blender to mix it and when mixed for 30 seconds or longer, dissolves pretty well with only the slightest residue left behind.  I've also mixed it with water and ice cubes, and while it has a chocolate taste, it's pretty thin.<br/><br/>You can also mix the powder with other foods like oatmeal and ice cream.  I added some to my fruit yogurt, and that worked pretty well.  I could easily see adding this to plain greek yogurt and making chocolate greek yogurt.<br/><br/>The effects of this are pretty good--I've noticed better recovery times after my workouts, and while I can't really verify it, I feel like my muscles are (finally) starting to put on some mass.<br/><br/>So--5 stars from me because I like the taste, it's easy to use (they even include a scoop inside), and it's improving my muscle recovery and hopefully, helping to increase my muscle mass.  The lower Amazon price is a huge advantage as well.  Hence, this is an easy recommendation, but I also recommend you get some kind of blender as well, for best liquid mixing results.
 My favorite protein, needs no explanation
 Just perfect! No problems AT ALL. The taste isn't too sweet and isn't too mild; it's the perfect balance.
 Our favorite protien.  Mixes well and is actually very good.
 As many people know, finding a protein powder that tastes good can be a challenge.<br/><br/>I'd heard people rave about Optimum Nutrition for a while, but the price tag in NZ was too high for me to consider. Since moving to the U.S.A., I thought I might give it a go.<br/><br/>This tastes amazing, ESPECIALLY with some almond milk.<br/><br/>It's instantized, so it's soluble in cold water, however don't expect it to mix nicely with just a spoon. You will need one of those mixer cups with the mixer balls in there to get something that's smooth.<br/><br/>24g of protein in each scoop, AND it tastes good. I don't think I'll be trying another protein powder for a long time.
 I went from bench-pressing 100lbs to bench-pressing 450lbs.
 Love this flavor!
 this is my fav whey. keep it thick and use milk for best flavor. its like a frosty but way more doper!!
 whey good,,,
 i like it
 OK, Mom writing this. My 3 adult children, and my hubby all swear by this stuff, but I think it's a really overpriced chocolate milkshake mix.<br/><br/>I'd be interested to see some actual data that proves this stuff is worth the money they blow on it. (According to the Mayo Clinic website, Whey is good for several things regarding weight loss and muscle mass, but always with the caveat "some results are conflicting, and more research is needed before firm conclusions can be made." - so what's that tell you?)<br/><br/>Sure, they all diet and exercise and get into shape when they're on it, but then, how much of that is the diet and exercise, and how much of it has anything whatsoever to do with the milkshake?<br/><br/>They're all convinced that it's the shake, but I'd put money on it that if I started just drinking a shake a day, without changing anything else, the only thing that would happen is I'd get fatter from drinking a milkshake every day.<br/><br/>If you are a believer, buy it. This is the best price I could find on it. If, like me, you'd like to see some clear evidence first, then save yourself a lot of money, and just buy some Chocolate Nesquick with milk, and save your money for the weights.
 Works
 Excellent condition. Taste is acceptable. Dissolves fairly well. Could not find scoop, am currently using 2 tbs plus 1 tsp per 6oz to 8 oz of water or almond milk. Will use scoop when it reveals itself.<br/>Finally found the scoop, a gold colored one, was using about a half or third of the powder to my water or almond drink.  Any way I have lost 9 lbs. At the same time I ordered this I also ordered the merax vibration platform. I have been taking the protein drink, one or two servings a day. I used the vibration platform two or three times a week. So 7 weeks later, I am 9 lbs lighter.
 Love it!! Milk chocolate is my favorite. Very smooth and great taste. Make sure to read the nutritional information
 Delivered on time.Love this protein drink and use it twice daily.It adds easily to anything you drink.A blender or something similar helps so no lumps are found..Great for adding weight for muscle..
 Perfect condition, tastes ok with water. Not terrible at all and it does the job which is the point. May tastes better with milk as it contains fats but I don't want to add calories.
 Tastes great, sometimes has an issue with dissolving which can leave you with some mushy bits if the water is too cold or you don't use enough. Great for breakfast.
 Bought it for my son and he likes it, seems that the trick is to mix it rather than to use it in a blender as that way it becomes too foamy!!
 Love the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor! Great for drinking alone or mixing in smoothies.
 Can’t complain whey is whey, awesome formula
 I didn't realize how big a 5 lb container was! It's huge and will last for so long. And I absolutely LOVE this flavor! I mix it with yummy fruits to make a meal replacement shake, every morning. I would definitely recommend!!
 Very good taste and really appreciate the way it blends into a smooth drink without lumps.  Researched this product and have tried numerous other protein drinks.  This is my favorite one so far.
 Out of all the protein powders I’ve used over the years, this is BY FAR my favorite!!
 Excellent!! Dissolves well and tastes good.
 the double chocolate is hella tasty....i mix 2 scoops  and a banana with a whole cup of almond milk (blender/magic bullet), it comes out great not too thick and not too thin!<br/><br/>will be buying another this week.
 Love it
 I can't get into the detail of its contents because I don't know enough to be able to comment on them, all I can say is that this product fulfills my Ned's of daily protein intake and it tastes great. I do not have any side effects from taking it for almost a year. This has never let me down.
 This product taste great and high amounts of protein.
 Optimum nutrition, this is a great product! That mocha cap flavor is the best flavor protein I’ve had. So happy Claire G. Made me purchase this product on Prime Day. I went from a sickly 115lbs to 170 lbs of pure man beef. Thanks ON, thanks Claire.
 Was very impressed with how delicious this is. My new favorite protein powder for sure.
 TASTE<br/>I've had three different flavors at this point. Its better than GNC stuff, but not as good or tasty as Gaspari Nutrition flavors.<br/><br/>MIX<br/>Im not cleaning no stinkin blender yo. SHAKE SHAKE! Some powder bombs or clumps persist, but no where near as bad as cheaper brands. With enough shakes it mixes, but honestly its an after-workout workout just shaking the bottle to get the mix.
 I started out using optimum and they were great i stoped using them for awhile to check and find something better... there aren't any close to as good as this it not thick nor it have lumps it smooth and trust me i not hyping it up cause its alot of fake profiles hyping these products up so you can buy... guys plz be careful with alot of these product i know to find the right stuff you got to go threw trial and error... but plz read the label and go with your gut cause you waste time and money choosing this is my main whey now
 Taste great, have seen much improvement in gains, mixes well,easy to digest
 4 stars cause the flavor didn't taste like chocolate mint it taste like the chocolate that you got from the ground but realizing is not chocolate but a off brand tootsie roll that's been lightly dipped in crushed grandma mints
 Horrible taste! It is just nasty and terrible flavor.<br/>Bad product
 I been taking this for a few years. I stopped using since I limited my workouts. And all of sudden, I don't feel bloated anymore. Anyone had issues with bloatness with this product?
 Simply the best whey on the market. I'm able to put on the weight I desire by using 3 times a day. I can gain around 10 to 15 in 3 months by using 3 times a day at around 2 servings each mix.
 Have always been a fan of ON products. The Gold standard whey has been everyone's standard, mainstream supplement for bodybuilders. No side effects, prefect mix with no residues nor lumps. It's milk chocolate and double rich chocolate flavors has been my all time favorite!! Great results and great taste. 24g of protein per serving is ample for post workout protein.
 Mixability: 9/10. Some mix better but in my experience Optimum has minimal clumping if you make sure to add the powder in after any liquid.<br/>Taste: 8/10. Great variety of flavors ensures you're never bored. Some have a bit of an artificial aftertaste, and the chocolates tend to be chalky. Otherwise no complaints.<br/>Price and Value: 10/10. Best quality for the price, no other brand comes close
 Perfect for Body building.
 Love it but shipping double the price
 good
 received product but factory seal was torn off :(.  trying to send back and get a replacement with the factory seal still on container.
 Favorite by far. Everything I need.<br/>No creatine. Has BCAA's. Doesn't taste like s***. Goes down well enough with water. Mix with milk for something awesome.
 Best tasting protein powder that I have had. It literally tastes like chocolate milk. Has plenty of protein and is low in sugar. This was my second time ordering this
 Smells and tastes like bubblegum mixed with strawberry, which does not smell or taste good to me.  Had the smell and taste been better, I would have rated this product five stars.  I was expecting more based on other reviews and my own experiences with Optimum Nutrition.  Other than that, it mixes well, I don't have any problems from drinking it, and it is a good quality protein powder.  I have tried and enjoyed the double rich chocolate flavor and will go back to it later.
 Awesome protein! Great value. I use the double rich chocolate. Not a fan of the french vanilla, has a strong protein taste. The vanilla ice cream flavor is also quite good. :-). Looking forward to trying other flavors.
 Love my ON protein!! Have at least 3 servings of this a day and it has great flavor even with water. Compare the nutritional information of this to Syntha and you will never go back (unless you are trying to bulk up!).
 great deal. husband loves this.
 I use this whey for post workout and smoothies.  Love the taste.  ON is a top notch brand.  Here is my smoothie recipe if you want it, in order of placement in the Magic Bullet:<br/><br/>1 banana<br/>5 small strawberries<br/>Flaxseed<br/>1 scoop ON whey protein<br/>1-2tbsp of peanut butter<br/>1 cup of almond milk
 EXPIRED::::::Bought it in July 2018. It was already expired in  3 March 2018
 Want to grow muscles like a demi God? Take two scoops of this following a seriously deadlift, squat, or bench session, and the gainz shall come
 To much filler, stick with medical grade like genpro
 Drank 2x a day.  Noticeable gains.... also noticeable gas!  Doesn't taste too good.  I got the vanilla flavor.  Tastes much better with milk than water.  Almost undrinkable with water.  Great price.
 this is my go-to protein.  after buying a lot from GNC this brand seemed to have better reviews, tastes better, mixes better, and seems to has less harmful ingredients like some of the competitors.
 A must have if you want to build some cool muscles. It's for everyone, I'm not a body builder or nothing like this, just a regular guy going to the gym to be healthy and this helped me to build some extra muscles.
 Delicious. Mixes pretty easily with a spoon.
 This stuff tastes great in my protein shakes.<br/><br/>I bought the double chocolate and I blend up one scoop with about one cup of water and one frozen banana.<br/>I look forward to getting home from the gym because this shake tastes so good!
 One of my favorite flavors!  My other being cookies n' cream.  However, it seems like the product is more expensive every time I buy it.  I'd look for cheaper alternatives, but this is the only brand that I trust for quality.
 100% delicious taste like chocolate milk with a little iced coffee.
 Tastes great and works great!
 My favorite brand since 2015!! Love Double Chocolate flavor!
 I have ordered a number of the 100% Whey Gold Standard 10 pound bags over the past year. The flavors are great and the powder mixes easily.  Rather than mix with water, I typically use Unsweetened Silk Almond Breeze to obtain a smoother texture.  In addition to the taste and ease of use, you can't beat the cost per serving obtained with the 10 pound bags.
 I was expecting a true cake batter taste...but who was I fooling expecting that from a protein powder?  It has a vanilla cookie taste to it that I use with almond milk and in smoothies. I love this brand.
 This is the best protein. It is VERY low in sugar and tastes so good. I often make smoothies with banana/strawberry, peanut butter, almond milk, and a full rounded scoop of this, and it tastes like a shake from a restaurant.
 Best protein<br/>25g per serving?<br/>Oh yeah... easy to hit macros and great taste.<br/><br/>If you are bulking on cutting, it will help you meet your goals. Learn how to use it properly, you will not regret it.
 Tastes like Nesquick. Honestly this is the best tasting protein powder I've ever had, I'm almost a little skeptical haha.
 good stuff
 Good clean tasting whey. always nice to find good flavors that are not chocolate.
 I purchased the extreme milk chocolate, the flavor and smell is just amazing. Taste and smells just like chocolate milk! The chocolate is not too strong. You wouldn't even know it was a protein shake if someone gave it to you.
 Cake Batter is a great flavor!  Works great with baking recipes too.  Will be buying again and trying other flavors (just to see how those are).
 seal doesnt work after you open it. creating a problem since I ordered a 10 lb bag...
 Tastes great! Really filled my need for more protein while staying in my calorie range, skin, hair, nails and energy are so much better.  I a scoop into my warm coffee to make a mocha, don't know if you can use it in hot coffee.  This is my third tub, I divide it into smaller containers for storage.  I don't miss a day!
 It really is the gold standard in protein powder and it doesn't taste like ass. I combine this with the ON Creatine Powder and it's a good supplement for the protein that I don't get because I don't eat meat.
 Taste delicious with frozen strawberries bananas and spinach.
 Tastes great
 I checked with my healthcare providers before adding a protein supplement to my diet. I would recommend the same advice to anyone who is considering using any type of supplement in addition to their regular diet.<br/>My 32 year old son uses Optimum Nutrition protein supplement to maintain physical conditioning and muscle strength, and he suggested I try it.<br/>At age 66, after having several serious surgeries over past 4 years, I was using a different product to improve protein consumption in my diet to help muscle repair/devlopment, with approval of my doctors.<br/>This is NOT a meal replacement product, but an additional source of nutrition, and I continue to eat well-balanced meals.<br/>The nutritional content is significantly better than the previous product I used. I mix the recommemded amount of powder with 2% milk, and fruit (half a banana, and a 1/4 cup of fresh berries) in a blender. Takes only an extra minute or so, and looks and tastes like a delicious milkshake - only healthier! I originally mixed OP French Vanilla Creme powder with milk or water in a shaker, but the flavor was bland and if did not blend together smoothly.<br/>I usually have this first thing in the morning followed by a home exercise program created by my physical therapist to increase flexibility, improve muscle strength, endurance and conditioning, incorporating light hand weights. I occasionally will have another shake after more strenous exercise, ie. brisk 30 minute outdoor walk, or use of treadmill or recumbant bike at gym. It depends on the extent and duration of the additional exercise, to offset muscle fatique.
 This is my breakfast and lunch replacement.  Lost 20 pounds in 2 months and have a ton of energy.  I don't use this for bodybuilding, just for health.
 Just a note for all your Gluten sensitive and Paleo people out there, the cookies and cream flavor contains "cookie nibs" which are made with Wheat.<br/><br/>Otherwise, this is a delicious and great product like all Gold Standard Whey's, just be aware that it contains Wheat.  I had to give mine to a friend and buy another flavor.
 Dissolves very well. tastes great. Tastes best with almond milk. But if you must use water,  12oz of water will dissolve it well while not leaving it watery.
 Ive been using ON whey for about 3 years now.<br/>I was a big fan of EAS whey, but Sams Club got rid of it, and then EAS switched the formulation (used to be ~78% protein by weight, now is 50%)<br/><br/>So I switched to ON, after I found it was relatively affordable bought in the big bulk pack her at Amazon. My key criteria for whey<br/><br/>quality whey protein... check.. its mainly isolates, with some concentrate and amino acids.<br/><br/>digestability: Im lactose intolerant.. enough said.. some of the cheaper formulations are cheaper concentrates...  they give me way to much gastrointestinal distresss.  also some of the budget brands are from China, and I worry about the purity of those products.<br/><br/>affordability: the price of whey has gone up all accross the board.. ON has raised their prices too.. ohh well...<br/><br/>performance:  Ive made some good gains with this stuff.  I try to eat well, but I keep a bag in my office when I dont have time for a quick meal.  and I take it first thing in the morning, and before sleep.  Ive noticed the difference in my strength gains and muscle gains.  Im satisfied.<br/><br/>cons.<br/>it takes about 1 min to fully dissolve with appropriate quantities of water..  not a big deal.. just mix and come back..<br/><br/>wish it was a little cheaper.
 This stuff is some of the best tasting protein I've tried. I have the mocha cappuccino flavor and normally mix it with a 9,5 oz bottle of Starbucks's mocha frappuccino and it taste great together plus I get the coffee caffeine before my workout.
 Cake batter flavor does not taste good. I'm pleased with the amount of protein in each scoop and it doesn't have as much fillers as other protein powders I have used.
 Great deal. Taste okay.
 Teenage boy has endorsed it at tasting good.  That should say it all to parents looking for a protein supplement for their children.
 its good
 I have been using whey protein for about 2 months. I love the taste, coffee tastes good, and so does the banana cream. The ingredients in ON Whey is superior to the ingredients of the first whey I tried from a different brand. Even my friends like the taste of the coffee flavor. When mixed the drink isn't gritty, or thick. It feels like the texture of what it's mixed with. The first whey I used, no matter what it was mixed it was kind of thick and tasted gross. I enjoy and even look forward to drinking this product after my workout. Looking forward to trying other flavors.
 But I really, REALLY don't like the flavor. It seems that no matter how you make it, it's either too watery tasting, or it's too sweetly overpowered. Can't really find the balance. Haven't had that problem with fruit punch or strawberry (which I wish I had ordered instead).<br/><br/>Great product, but awful flavor. Not sure if I can send it back or not since it's opened.
 The French Vanilla Creme is the second flavor I have tried. It's great! Very light tasting. Perfect with milk.
 best tasting whey protein period
 I originally bought this product in December.  I repurchased in June 2017 and the recipe has changed. The seller makes no mention of a change in their product, but this new container has a different texture and taste than what I previously bought.  I preferred the original product over the new one.  If I'd known there was a change in the product, I could have bought more cautiously- read reviews first, or tried a smaller container.<br/>I also buy creatine and casein from ON (all three subscribe &amp; save through Amazon).  I'm skeptical of buying any of their products again, as I don't really like this new whey, and fear other products may unknowingly be changed, also.
 Been buying this double rich chocolate flavor since 2007.  Tastes great mixed with regular milk, coconut milk or in a smoothy.  Helps with recovery after working out. Great way to get extra protein in my diet.
 great
 By far the best tasting protein powder - I make protein shakes with a heaping scoop of Optimum, 1 cup of frozen blueberries, a few frozen peach slices, 1/2 cup skim milk and a little cold water...mix it with my ninja....tastes like a treat!
 Mixes well in water and the flavor is ok. Not the best chocolate flavor I've had but if your blending with other ingredients it doesn't matter anyway. I like to blend with a banana and peanut butter for the perfect flavor.
 Absolutely love the taste of this! I bought a small one because I hate protein powder but it is so good for you after your workouts that I just chug it down!  This one I can enjoy! So better than just plain vanilla and there is no chalky taste to it at all! I would recommend this to anyone!
 I love it.<br/>I love the taste, specially banana cream flavor.<br/><br/>And results, I can see it. I gained almost 5 pounds in 2 weeks. (note: I am in gaining phase)<br/><br/>cons: Its costly.
 I had been happily using the 2lb Double Rich Chocolate flavor when I figured i would be economical about things and bought a 5lb portion. When I first tried the new tub I immediately noticed how sweet this new version was, and realized I bought the Extreme Milk Chocolate flavor. The sweetness was annoying, but i figured it wasn't a big deal. But now after three consecutive uses where i've had three consecutive headaches I dug into it and realized the difference in flavor/recipes is the addition of sucralose in this new version. A couple of other reviews here mentioned it, but in addition to being too sweet it seems like there are people out there that get headaches from sucralose. Since i've apparently never had this sweetener, this was all news to me. But I kept drinking it after my first experience to see if it was the cause, and unquestionably it was. If you know you don't have a problem with sucralose and like cloyingly sweet things then this should be fine for you. If not, I wouldn't risk it. Especially a 5lb portion.
 I bought this as a present for my brother, and he's fallen in love with it. He now uses this product on a daily basis, and the effect of it combined with working out is quite remarkable.
 Good price
 Banana cream tastes great as a cold beverage.<br/>Doesn't mix well with hot water in your oatmeal.
 Been using this product for years now, and can't complain about the quality. Best protein hands down!!
 It doesn't dissolve in water as easily as claimed. It is however very filling and seems to give energy for any activity needed.
 Great for the price
 I use the Optimum Gold Standard Whey Extreme Milk Chocolate every day. I've tried other type whey powder &amp; so far this is the best.
 Best of the best.  ON never lets us down.
 It's always been my first choice for years, but lately i found out that it comes half full....
 I've tried a few different protein powders and this is by far the best tasting, it will be hard for me to every try anything different again
 Started eating whey when I realized that my marathon training was pretty much eating my muscles because I'm a vegetarian who was not getting near enough protein.  50 grams per day is normal for a non-athlete, but there was no way I could get the 120+ I needed with just greens and beans! Drank a scoop of this after every run and I really saw the difference. Instead of getting fatter I got stronger.  Good stuff and the vanilla creme is a non-offensive flavor in yogurt, oatmeal, smoothies, or alone with water (which is how I drank it most of the time).
 One of the best protein !!!!
 Tastes great and mixes well.  This protein seems like it measures up well or better than the competition.  I will buy this again when gone and will try other flavor sad well.
 Love this protein, great tasting and lots of good ingredients
 love it
 I decided to go for this protein due to the tremendous reviwes worldwilde. In regards to the service I must admit that it has been awesome! I can't wait to start tworking out. The delivery was astonishigly quick.
 Tastes great
 best
 I use fairlife, or store brand lactose free milk. If you put it into a shaker ball bottle with cold milk and shake it up for a good while, it comes out so creamy and delicious. It is chocolate milk and a steak
 The taste of this is really awful. I was disappointed after reading how delicious it was. I do like the high protein content for low calories and carbs so I will keep it and mix with fruit for smoothies. On its own it really tastes bad. I would not recommend this or buy it again.
 Tastes great with just water! Not crazy about chocolate in general but Extreme Milk Chocolate is going to be a regular for me.
 Very clean protein compared to others on the market; not much sugar or other stuff like some brands. I like the flavor for my meal-replacement shake in the mornings.
 good
 Bought this for my fiance hoping to find a better value from other whey protein shakes he'd tried in the past and this one has been the best, most cost effective, and reliable brand so far. Very satisfied with our purchase and will continue using this brand till something blatantly revolutionary comes along.
 I've purchased this whey about 5 times...and many other brands over the years.  I am very happy with the solubility of this powder--it does blend in a shaker cup with water or milk.  I like to mix the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor with milk, so one scoop + 8 oz. milk yields about 32 grams of protein.  I have no idea if it's true, but I've read that the body can't absorb more than about 40 grams of protein with any one meal, so I don't bother with more than one scoop at a time.<br/><br/>Many of the other brands I've purchased over the years do not taste as good or blend as well, although this is mostly subjective.  A few brands have a metallic taste--not the Gold Standard.  Also, the GS has 30 mg of Cholesterol (10% daily value/2000 calorie diet), which is 10 mg or so lower than other brands (and even other GS flavors, which is why I stick with Vanilla IC).  The 5 lb container includes 77 scoops.<br/><br/>If you are wondering, I have tried other flavors, but I keep coming back to the Vanilla Ice Cream.  First of all, you can always add fruit to this flavor, or Hershey's Syrup if you're in the mood.  I like a frozen fruit berry blend from Target with milk and powder in the blender; the frozen fruit gives it a fruit-smoothie texture!
 I thought this stuff would have a terrible aftertaste like most whey protein products, but this is delicious. There is no after taste and it mixes very well. You have to try this stuff.
 I have been using this protein powder for over a year now and absolutely love it! The taste is wonderful and mixes so smooth with just water. I haven't found anything better that has more protein / less sugar.
 Perfecto
 Every protein powder on the market has a particular protein purity ( (protein mass) / (energy content) ) and protein cost ( (price) / (protein mass) ) . The higher the purity, the higher the cost. This protein's purity is 0.218 (g protein)/(kcal), and the cost is 0.0331 ($)/(g protein). This puts this protein at the upper-middle range in terms of purity and cost. And generally speaking, the lower the protein purity, the better it tastes, because there is more sugar in it.<br/><br/>If you have enough room in your diet for additional calories, you don't need this protein powder; you can get something cheaper and sweeter with a lower protein density. Just make sure that you're also paying a lower cost in terms of (price) / (protein mass) ! Just because one tub of protein has a lower (price) / (total mass) than another doesn't mean that it's actually a better value, because it could simply have a lower (protein mass) / (total mass).<br/><br/>For me, this protein is a decent purity at a decent cost. It also tastes great and doesn't leave the lingering artificial sweetener taste in your mouth that some protein powders do.
 There just is no substitute.  If you want quality whey this is the best stuff.  Mix with water or milk.  Takes a bit to figure out the quanities of water or milk to a scoop but once you do it is awesome value
 I have used this protein for years. It tastes great and mixes well. I have tried other whey proteins, but they don't come close to the quality of this protein.
 I forgot how awesome good protein tastes! I just mix with 8-10 oz of water. I got the milk chocolate and it tastes GREAT! It mixes well and for something a little different I will add a little pb2
 Very good Whey Protein :)
 I have long been a fan of Optimum Nutrition's 100% Whey. I have tried several flavors including the classic Double Rich Chocolate which has been my go-to flavor for a few years now. I decided to try this newer flavor for my last order based on the flavor ratings from another website. This flavor is excellent, tasting and smelling much like a milk chocolate candy bar. Not too sweet, but definitely an improvement over Double Rich Chocolate. This product also mixes well, like the other flavors of ON 100% Whey Gold Standard that I have had in the past. The only con I have to mention is that there are small dark colored dots in the mix that don't blend out. Not something you notice while you're drinking it, but more when you clean the shaker bottle out after.
 Besides the great nuteitional benefits, this stuff actually tastes great!  It’s a bit sweeter so it’s great for mixing into shakes. Highly recommend!
 I mix this with chocolate milk. Tastes like nice hot chocolate ona cold winter day. Blends extremely well. This is the best protein powder I've ever had so far. Would recommend. I am happy I didn't go for the cheaper brands that probably were not as good.
 Love this product! Tastes amazing and gets you energized for the gym. Also love the fact that I can use it in recipes not just in milkshakes.
 Delicious.  Mocha is such a good flavor.  I'll take this post-workout as well as for breakfast.  A really great supplement with not too many ingredients.
 For nutrition, it's the gold standard. Lots of whey, not a lot of sugar. And it still tastes pretty good but doesn't cost an arm and a leg. Every now and then I don't prepare enough good food and this supplements the lack-luster nutritional value of a hurried meal. Awesome!
 Great protein. ON has always been my go-to protein in my more recent times of working out and getting fit. The strawberry flavor is the only reason why I won't be giving it 5/5 stars today. I usually get the cookies and cream, which is always a good flavor and mixes well. The strawberry had an odd acidic after taste for me, but did mix well with milk.
 The shipping was fast and everything came as expected, so there's no complaints about the vendor. I've had other ON whey powders in the past and have been really impressed with them for the most part. I read several reviews about how great French vanilla was, but when I tried it with milk I was very disappointed. The protein taste is not completely masked; even though the drink smells great, there is a pretty awful aftertaste. Despite this, the protein is good and I have no complaints otherwise. For anyone interested, mocha cappuccino, caramel toffee fudge, rocky road, and chocolate coconut have been my favorites.
 Seems to be working good so far, been noticing some gains since I've been taking it for  the last month v
 Great for post workout shakes. Very good taste and price.
 Flavor wise this is a vanilla that goes down very nicely. Content wise I can only go off of what I have read, which is that this brand is known for using good quality/purity ingredients as opposed to some others, but I will leave that for the scientists and just stick with what I know - for the dollar/size/flavor, this one delivers.
 Tastes pretty good, I actually like it. It came reccommended from my Dr who looks like he eats raw eggs and spartan babies for breakfast so id say get it.
 Love ON stuff! Won't gonelse where unless it's Quest.
 Pair it with vanilla soy milk and it is like ice cream!
 So I'm going to put this bluntly this stuff is awesome! I really like it mixing in a bit of creatine and some extra glutamine.<br/><br/>Pros of Coffee Flavor:<br/>Tastes great<br/>Good for a meal<br/>Easy to mix (Super easy to mix!)<br/>No powder problems<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>High Cholesterol
 Cheaper to buy on Amazon than anywhere else, including Costco. Happy with product. Mixes well with skim milk and tastes a little like chocolate milk. Can be a little clumpy at times but I'm not interested in spending 8 bucks for a bottle mixer. I just stir it more vigorously.
 This is a real treat! Try this: 6 oz ice, a good splash of heavy cream, a scoop or so...and blend.  It's better than ice cream.  Otherwise, it is good.
 I have tried many difference flavors of protein drinks and this one if my favorite.  The coffee flavor is delicious!!
 For some reason, I have always been a ON customer but I bought this protein not long ago and protein does not seem be dissolved in my shakes. I can see how the particles of the protein do mix well. I do not recommend this protein any more.
 I like the strict standards behind this product. Research whey protein and you'll realize just how different each brand can be. I'm very satisfied with the results.
 ON makes good protein but the double rich chocolate is not too great chocolate flavor. Pretty upset about that.
 ON products never disappoint! We use this Whey daily at our home, it a great product!
 have been using this for years and i wont switch to anything else. Tastes great, not chalky, mixes well and doesnt clump in my shaker. Highly recommend double rich chocolate flavor. Havent tried any other flavors but this one tastes amazing.
 Love the flavor. Can be mixed into shakes or smoothies flawlessly. The powder integrates with whatever liquid you want to use it with. After a workout or just as a snack this is a very versatile protein powder. Would definitely recommend you give these flavors a try.
 Taste is really good, seems to be working, and mixes easly with a shaker cup. Instructions say you can mix with a spoon but I got poor results this way, just use a shaker/blender and you will be good.
 I've tried Optimum Nutrition Whey Gold Standard in different flavors, and they are all tasty. I stick with the French Vanilla Creme because it's the most blendable with fruit and veggie flavors. I usually add berries, kale and a couple egg yolks for a meal replacement or after-workout snack. It works for me.
 I've tried a few different Whey Proteins. This is my favorite brand. Although I wasn't a huge fan of the double rich chocolate flavor. It tastes good...but so far my Favorite flavor is Mint Chocolate chip. I've been using ON Whey Protein for over 15 years. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT...
 I have tried all kinds of protein powders and this is hands down the best tasting.  It is reasonably priced, comes in a wide variety of flavors and mixes well.  From what I have read Optimum Nutrition is considered to be one of the better proteins.<br/><br/>All the flavors I have tried, except Vanilla Ice Cream, are full of flavor.

 This is the only protein powder which tastes like chocolate and nothing else, I highly recommend this flavor. Moreover, I used the 'Subscribe and Save' and got an additional 15% off - better deal than anywhere else.<br/><br/>Pros: No bitter taste, mixes well with cold milk, water, no extra effort required.<br/><br/>Cons: ..... I just wanna keep having more :)<br/><br/>Gautam
 OUTSTANDING flavor
 Tried and true.  The taste is great in any chocolate variety and very easy to mix and drink.  I've gone through a dozen + of these tubs in the past year and will continue to buy.
 I've been buying this version of whey protein for a year or so, and it seems to help keep me healthy. I like the ON product because it is manufactured in the USA under some form of qualtiy control. I'm suspicious of any food item that might come from China. I also like the economy of the 5 pound package.
 Great quality for the price.  Mixes and tastes very good.
 This stuff has killed my cravings and helped me lose weight.
 I've been using whey protein for a few months and have noticed some positive gains in muscle mass. I originally used another brand but with so many people giving positive reviews here and on youtube, I decided to buy Optimum Nutrition's Whey Protein Gold Standard and I really like it. The flavor I chose was Extreme Milk Chocolate thanks in large part to another reviewer who said it was the best of the chocolate flavors and he's so right. It tastes a lot like Nestle's Quik and I really like that. I use 1 scoop for breakfast and blend it with milk, 1 banana and some low fat plain yogurt for a nutritious smoothie. Then I go jogging 1 hour after breakfast and in the afternoon I work out and lift weights and for my post workout meal I make the exact same shake once again. I really prefer ON's Gold Standard Whey Protein because it's a trusted brand I trust, the shipping is free on Amazon (and no tax, woohoo!) and because it plain and simply works.<br/><br/>I purchased the 5 lb tub and will definitely buy another one after it finishes. Tastes good and works. 'Nuff said.
 I always get ON protein. The Banana Cream flavor was good - not too sweet but a very accurate taste.
 I've used this before &amp; I absolutely love it. The other proteins i've looked at/used in the past have a lot of dangerous additives that are definitely not good to take. This is straight forward protein and they don't formulate it as a dietary replacement so the fat &amp; cholesterol are lower. My only complaint is that it has splenda in it that I despise as it is converted to arsenic in your blood. The powder mixes super smooth &amp; easily. I use it in my blender bottle but it works fine without too. Never makes me nauseous, and they put lactase enzyme in it that helps those like me who are lactose intolerant digest the lactose in the whey protein. I could not recommend it more. I know lots of people that agree and buy it religiously. Great for a protein supplement and tastes great to boot!
 I got French vanilla creme and though it mixes well, I don't quite enjoy the taste. It's overly sweet and the vanilla flavor is very fake. Otherwise it's fine for mixing in things.
 It's been a while since I've taken any protein supplement.  I took some time off to rely on food alone which helped me learn my body a little better.  Having said that, Gold Standard Whey is an excellent source of protein and extremely convenient supplement to any athletes current diet.  Before I bought this I tried to ease back into consuming whey by trying body fortress's whey isolate which isn't terrible.  Macros are a little closer to what I find ideal, but the mix-ability and taste lead me to believe the quality of ON's whey is better.  Taste great with water as well<br/><br/>It is a little on the pricier side, but as I've said before: you get what you pay for and so far that's been the case with me an ON.
 Blends well; tastes great!
 Tastes better than most protein powders on the market, mixes exceptionally well - no graininess or clumping at all.
 ON coffee is the best tasting protein I've ever had. I've tried plenty of protein supps and this one is delicious. When bulking, I add in dextrose to spike insulin and it tastes like a sweet coffee drink. I'm currently placing an order for my 2nd 5 lb tub. My only complaint is that it doesn't come in a 10lb bag! haha. great product!
 Delish
 Avoid the Strawberry Banana.  It tastes more like a bad bubble gum flavor when visiting the dentist.  Occasionally does not break apart and actually leaves a gum structure in the whisk ball.<br/><br/>Great product and lots of other tasty flavors
 I'm not a scientist that can attest to the particular purity of whey that this offers vs the competition but what I can say is that this protein powder is the best tasting (chocolate), least clumpy, and easiest to mix powder I've ever used. The amino acids are important too.
 The product it self I dont have much problem with.<br/>I ordered cookies and cream flavor and what I tasted/smelled was definitely not cookies and cream. It had a very strong coffe icecream smell. Im not sure if this is always the case, but be aware of the possibility.
 Every time I try something else, I always regret it and go back to ON. Best protein in the world.
 I decided to branch away from chocolate and Cake Batter was good, but I'll be going back to chocolate. If you like vanilla-y type flavors this is great! It's especially good with milk, I really don't care for it at all in water. I mix mine with 1/2 milk 1/2 water and add some cinnamon and that makes it a lot better imo.
 I have ordered this product before and now I got a piece of garbage!!!! Just zero quality standards! This product is totally different from what I got before, color, taste, texture, everything!!!! I will never buy it again!
 Great stuff.  About time to get another batch
 Don't expect a smooth drink. Other than that, it does what it's supposed to do.
 item seems defective or expired, it foams much more than the regular chocolate mint
 awesome.......just awesome......I got the rocky road and its the easiest protein to drink I have ever purchased. Will only be using this for now on
 Great product.  Get a lot for the price.  Nutritionist at Children's Hospital recommended this for my daughter.  This brand especially.
 Great product. you should totally buy!
 Overall great. Only complaint is that the price is high.
 1776 grams of protein for $53.99 on sale was a great deal. i would buy it again at that price for sure. people didn't seem to like my review on the natural factors protein shake and i can only speculate it was because i mentioned adding sugar when one of its selling points is low sugar (like this one). so let me explain myself and make my reasons clear. i stand by my decision to recommend low sugar shakes because it gives you more control. when you mix it with creatine it is supposed to have sugar to work properly. what makes it nice is when you stop taking creatine for a while, like you are also supposed to do from time to time, you aren't left with a shake that already has sugar mixed in when you are going for lean. this also helps if you drink a couple shakes a day and already took all the creatine you need and want to reduce sugar intake. this makes it more versatile for all of your needs... not just one. it  is common for people to bulk and tone in cycles and everyone has a different goals, so being versatile is a clear advantage. people say eating before you go to bed is bad. well of course it is if you are trying to lose weight. however, my trainer wakes up in the middle of the night to eat because he is trying to gain weight. occasionally, i will even add ice cream to mine. i mix the powder with a tiny bit of milk and then mix the paste with ice cream. why? because i like it. this isn't russia. if you don't enjoy it, then what are you doing it for? i know that i would probably do better to use water after a work out and milk before bed. why? because the water makes it absorb faster and is leaner, but the milk digests slower for all night supply. all in all, i like the large protein content, large serving size, low sugar and cost effective stuff that tastes good. this one meets all of those requirements. my favorite is 1 tsp creatine, 1 tsp sugar, 1 scoop of this stuff and about 8 ounces of 1% milk. but what i really like is control to do whatever i want.
 Tastes good and doesn't lead to as much intestinal distress as some of the cheaper brands. But it is more expensive than other brands. A case of you get what you pay for.
 Taste good.  I like to add Benefiber to each serving. 3 servings of protein shake and Benefiber can get me through breakfast and lunch
 Need protein supplement to support extreme daily job workload. This seems to do well enough to feel a difference. I don't like that the container is not nearly full, giant can for marketing magic bs.  Fill it or make it smaller.  Double chocolate is just ok. I mix flavors in it to make it more palatable.  I find it cheaper though, at local stores, so I would check first, especially  since it's gone up again about 4 dollars.  Overall, great product for me to keep my muscles fead.
 From all the other pictures it looks like everyone's came with a scoop. Mine didn't! Otherwise, very light but good taste. First time using protein supplement, so my main concern was the taste and if it would upset my stomach, which I heard some will do. So far so good.
 Only protein I take now, love this stuff
 Mocha Cappuccino FTW!
 Overall good macros, but it doesn't dissolve very well and has a hint of chemical taste. Not sure why. I have gotten it in the past and didn't have this problem. Perhaps the modified the ingredients.
 Much prefer the taste of GNC's chocolate whey powder. That stuff is the best.
 This thing is legit. I've used it for over a year. I went from 120 lbs to 160 lbs using this in my morning and after workout shakes in a year. Wouldn't try anything else.
 Still haven't finished it but the results are coming in and I love the taste with milk! Obviously a product like this only accelerates results, you can achieve the same without it, it just takes a bit longer. :)
 This brand of protein is excellent, high quality protein, high bio availability (tested by independent lab) and mixes well. Not a big fan of the double chocolate flavor, tastes a little bitter and chalky. The regular chocolate is delicious, however.
 I read a lot of the reviews on most of the flavors and many got bad reviews.  I got the white chocolate and it really taste better than expected.  I mixed it with water and at first there is a weird twang but I got used to it fast and really like it.  I will try it in milk next.
 Absolutely loved this product, saw gains while I was on this protein. At first I was sharing this tub with a friend and half way through he stopped coming to the gym with me so I had the rest of the tub to myself. In total I only took 2 scoops of gold standard each day. 1 right after the gym and one before I go to bed. The flavor I got was chocolate coconut, great flavor mixed it with both water and milk and surprisingly with water it tastes pretty damn good. With milk, well it's just like a milk shake. Highly recommend this product and flavor, next flavor I'm gonna try is chocolate mint. Definitely looking forward to purchasing this protein again.
 Is ok , taste is good little sweet for me
 Makes my husband have the worst gas ever.
 I like the taste a lot so far, I gave it a 4/5 hoping it doesn't become tired. I am a fan of Banana flavorings anyway and this one is great. Mixes very easily with no clumps.
 Great product! First tried the double rich chocolate  which is classicly good and goes down easy. Then read some reviews and a lot of people were raving about Rocky Road so I got it. My personal opinion not amazing. Doesn't taste like rocky road and way too sweet and I love rich stuff soo might try mint chocolate next time.
 Great tasting chocolate flavor.  Would definitely buy it again.  The price per pound is pretty good.
 The first flavor I tried of this product was the strawberry banana which is very very good. I really recommend that one. I thought this flavor would be a little bit more richer but it is still smooth to drink. I had high expectations from the strawberry banana but this flavor is still worth buying.
 Chocolate flavor is my favorite since it can be added to a shake/smoothie easy and not give off flavors. It gets the job done and I have no complaints.
 I have ordered Extreme Milk Chocolate and Mocha Cappuccino. Both are great, the milk chocolate gets the slight advantage over though. Mixes well in a shaker bottle.
 I've tried most of the flavors and the rocky road is by far my favorite.  It's very good by itself, but it mixes surprisingly well with a LOT of flavors for shakes/smoothies.  I recommend this flavor over anything else.
 I've tried the extreme chocolate milk, vanilla and loved them both. I've also tried the chocolate malt...I don't like it as much...its drinkable, but not as tasty as the chocolate or vanilla flavors.
 Hands down the best protein I have ever purchased. A little costly but well worth the purchase. Gold standard protein is the way to go.
 Extreme milk chocolate flavor is genuinely delicious, the calories / serving is a little higher than what I used to use but so is the protein content (110 cal &amp; 22g vs 120 cal &amp; 24g)
 Great product mixes very well with water in shaker nothing left stuck to the bottom. Not ideal for making shakes as it dissolves so well but still good. Not a very strong chocolate taste either easy on the stomach
 Very good
 I like this product but do not love it.  I prefer the tasteless protein powder because I can mix it with anything.  This is, however a good product that tastes and mixed easily.
 This is my 2nd time ordering this product. I have tried other similar products but this one has some of the best nutritional info compared to others. Plus the chocolate taste goes wonderfully when added to cereals or taken with milk/water. I will definitely continue ordering this. Plus Amazon has extremely fast shipping on this, I got the free shipping and it still arrived in only 2 days!
 I rotate between a lot of different protein powders and meal replacement shakes, just because i get sick of the same choices and flavors...all except for this one. This is the best tasting one of all by far to me..when made with milk this tastes like dessert..no weird flavors or chalky taste. Highly recommend!
 Good stuff
 This might be really subjective, since there's almost no way to measure how effective a supplement really is. What I can say without problems is that this brand/flavor mix better than most and taste better than most and don't ever give me digestive problems.
 Best protein powder ever!  I have been using it for two years in my breakfast smoothies.  Love the taste and the nutrition is excellent for me.
 The best stuff.
 best whey protein out there.. and best tasting.
 some good tasting protein here. Mocha Cappuccino
 Long time product user so I am a little biased. I am a fan of the flavor and the how the powder is not grainy when mixed with water (I have a partial intolerance to milk).
 I think like this is one of the best protein. For sure best for me. Love that taste and with water is very good and tasty.
 Great taste &amp; mixes superbly with water!
 Oh god and i thought i was the only one who is feeling it's taste is bad now, i have been taking ON for last 5 years but this time the taste as well as consistency of the mix was bad.
 I got the vanilla ice cream and it tasted pretty bad compared to other powders. The low cal content is nice though
 This is a quality protein source at a competitive price.  I am not a nutritionist so cannot comment with much authority on the details of the product, but I always hear positive things about the Optimum Nutrition brand.<br/><br/>I have had two of the flavors:  double rich chocolate, and extreme milk chocolate.  Neither is spectacular, but nor are they offensive to my tongue.  They are perfectly drinkable.  I can enjoy the flavor but they are not amazing, which is fine, because it is protein --  you're not drinking it for taste.  The extreme milk chocolate is a bit sweeter and I do believe I prefer it over the double rich chocolate.<br/><br/>The best value is to get the 5 lb. bottle.  I'm still not jacked after taking the product for a while, but I am getting there!
 Great value and taste.
 Great product. Tastes really good as well. Highly recommended!
 Used this once before love the results i get from it. Love the taste consistency when mixed with water. I feel good after every use highly recommended for people who workout a lot
 Best clean protein out there
 Better prices than Bodybuilding.com
 Awesome
 This flavor Vanilla Ice Cream is deeeeelicious! I put it in coffee with a bit of milk and it was like a preworkout mocha. I will try other flavors but this one will always be my go-to for morning workouts when I need to wake up and get my swol on!
 This is very bland and tastes watered down to me. I have tried "doctoring" in several different ways which have not been successful.
 Bought this for my husband, he seems to like it. It blends easily though I do find the flavor is a little too sweet in green smoothies.
 My brother loves this. He made everyone get him one for Xmas...ended up with 4 of them....lol.
 This is a perfect whey protein. It doesn't taste good but that is how you know it is healthy.
 The  French Vanilla Creme tasted good but there was no scoop in the container.
 Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard is my go to protein. You can't beat the price for what you get. I've only tried the Extreme Milk Chocolate flavor (which is very good) but ON provides so many different flavors I can't wait to try others. I've noticed great gains using this protein.
 Love Love ON products I've tried others and I always come back to them. The mint chocolate and cake batter are the best flavors in my opinion, definitely makes taking protein multiple times a day less of a chore.
 Love this protein powder!
 Very tasty
 I have been using this brand of whey for a few years and it is the only brand I trust.
 I have not seen any significant difference in using whey VS just eating a somewhat healthy diet.  I'm starting to believe the rumors about most supplements being all marketing little benefit.  Banana cream taste awful to me, almost like the pink antibiotic medicine.
 Love this stuff. Double Chocolate is my favorite flavor. Only protein that doesn't make me go to the bathroom after ingesting. TMI?? oh well
 Have used for years! Best flavor protein I have found, best price around also
 Tastes great ... mild tasting and not overwhelming.  I can add strawberries and other fruits for a subtle and sweet taste.  I read lots of reviews before purchasing and this was a good choice.  I wouldn't hesitate to order more from this brand and in other flavors.
 Tastes good who knows if it works haha
 I have been using this product for years and I loved it but recently I ordered it from amazon but I have been getting uncontrollable gas. I don't know if they changed the ingredients. Overall, great product that mixes well in water or milk but for me I can't stand the gas so I returned it. The product is great if you don't have uncontrollable gas. Amazon has good customer service so try the product to see if it is right for you.
 Great protein powder for muscle gains. A five pound tub usually last me about one month. One scoop before I workout and about two afterwards. I also mix a few shakes on my off days.
 This arrived promptly, in good shape. I love this product, have used it for a while, but the Mocha Cappuccino is a new flavor to me. I usually get the chocolate mint, which is so yummy, and it's always a little nerve-racking buying the Gigundo size, not knowing if you'll like it, but I love the Mocha!!<br/><br/>There's nothing I can add to the other reviews. I have nothing bad to say about Gold Standard. It's great stuff.
 Best Whey Protein on the Market - a very bold statement, but a very true one as well for a few reasons (listed below):<br/><br/>1 - Mixability: by far one of the easiest to mix proteins on the market; dissolves better than some and I have never had to deal with any chunks when drinking regardless of whether I use a shaker bottle or mixing it with a fork in a glass - and yes a fork always works better than a spoon<br/><br/>1a - The protein does not get stuck to the insides of glasses or shaker bottles nearly as much as some other proteins<br/><br/>2 - Flavor: This flavor really tastes like chocolate. It is not the type of protein shake that you need to drink as fast as possible so that you don't taste it, this one is actually a good chocolate flavor and tastes good.<br/><br/>3 - Muscle gains: This protein powder helps you put on muscle extremely quickly. Completely sheds the fat while building lean muscle!!! Its amazing.<br/><br/>Note - #3 is completely biased and most likely untrue.  It works like any protein powder and does not magically increase muscle mass.
 love the price
 Tastes great with milk! Get a shaker bottle. Mixed with water is still fine. Chug it, don't sip it.
 Truly the gold standard. I always end up coming back to this protein.
 Always a decent protein with good mixability and good flavors<br/>Can’t go wrong with any of the flavors really
 EXCELENT
 I just made my first shake and the flavor is terrible. I chose this product because of its high Amazon rating. After reading the reviews I learned that this is a new worse tasting formula than the original.<br/>5lbs of whey I won't be drinking...
 The mix is solid and the flavor is great. I usually mix with milk rather than water and it's pretty close to chocolate milk; not the good stuff, rather the powdery stuff of course. It's a little pricey compared to other sources but overall a good product.
 Great product and taste good.
 Good deal
 Delicious!<br/><br/>Love the vanilla ice cream with my 30 calorie almond milk
 Great price for the amount and protien content<br/>Mixes extremely well (this is super key for me)<br/>Tastes Pretty Good (I like the Banana just a little bit better)<br/>I don't look like Arnie or Stallone yet, but hey I've only had it about a week...I say give it at least 2 more weeks and then I will look like them.
 Always on time, definitely my favorite protein, I recommend Extreme Milk Chocolate
 It doesn’t come with a scooper
 I love this protein. It dissolves easily in water or milk. It is very reasonable in price. Additionally, there was a great review recently of multiple prominent protein brands and Optimum Nutrition had the highest protein content of any of them. I will be an ON customer for the foreseeable future.
 Everything you need from a protein powder.
 Accoding to the label this can make 88 servings. I can attest that this is a very large container. The French Vanilla flavor tastes great mixed into a smoothie. The only negative that I can mention: my bottle did not include a serving size scooper.
 Pretty much everyone I know that is serious about working out uses this powder.  The double rich chocolate is my favorite, but Ive had the strawberry and that's good too.  Mixes very easily, and is delicious (as far as protein powder goes).  I usually put mine in skim milk or almond milk, I have put it in water in the past.  In water, it tastes fine but its pretty bland.  In milk, with a little peanut butter or frozen raspberries, its really good and a nice post-workout treat.
 Delicious
 Great product
 The best whey protein there is. Very low carbs and high protein count per scoop. I used these to lose nearly 20 pounds in the last month. The taste and fixability are very good.
 Nothing I can say that others haven't said yet. Great.
 I have used this for several years now and I'm very happy with the results as well as the flavor (Vanilla Ice Cream).  Within 30 minutes of waking, I shake it with some water, 2 oz raw egg whites (in a carton) and 1 raw egg.  It ends up reminding me of eggnog only better and not as thick.  This is one of the things I do that I feel helps keep me muscular and lean.  Great product.
 Good flavor
 Use every day after a workout or as a snack. Every time I run out I order a new 1. Tastes even better if you add a banana &amp; a 1/2 scoop of strawberry Nestly Quick.
 Love this product after working out! The flavor is great and mixes well with other additions. My favorite is with black coffee instead of water.
 love it
 5th time buying this :)<br/><br/>Love: Double Chocolate, Mint, ROCKY ROAD IS AN ORGASM IN YOUR MOUTH :)<br/><br/>Malt is alright - more of an acquired taste if you like that light chocolate taste, a little chalky for me.<br/><br/>I will always buy from O.N. when I need more protein.
 The coffee flavor just isn't there. But it gets the job done for a post work out drink and in between lunch and dinner snack. Will buy again just in a different flavor.
 Great quality stuff, tastes pretty good, has a border line after taste of a malt chocolate shake and with free prime shipping you're definitely saving a good ten bucks compared to any other supplement supplier online!
 Using this for a pre or postworkout shake has been great.  Doesn't give the bloated feeling that other protein powders do.  I tried the Double Rich Chocolate and it tastes good as well.  I will be ordering this again as soon as I run out.  The price was unmatched when I purchased this product as well.
 All and all this protein is great, I have been using it for almost 10 months and only this protein because I didn't find the need to change it.<br/><br/>So taste I have been trying to taste all the flavors they offer. so far I've tried five flavors only Double Rich Chocolate, Chocolate Mint, Chocolate Malt, Extreme Milk Chocolate, and Mocha Cappuccino.<br/>I would rate them only based on the Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard because I have not tried other brands so I can't compare them to other brands.<br/><br/>*I usually take from 2~4 scoops of whey with 6~8 oz of water or milk<br/><br/>my favorite so far is the Double Rich Chocolate I give it 10/10 on taste. either with water or milk it tastes good specially with milk.<br/>Chocolate Mint 8/10 it tastes good but there is an after taste not specially bad but I would rather do without.<br/>Chocolate Malt 6/10 by far my least favorite chocolate flavor. I started to add extra scoops just so I finish it quicker so I can order another flavor lol.<br/>Extreme Milk Chocolate 7/10 not bad but nothing extreme about it. imagine drinking milted chocolate ice cream but not the good ice cream the fat free one<br/>Mocha Cappuccino 5/10 it tastes somewhat sort of coffee flavor but mixing three scoops with water still feels diluted more like water.<br/>Delicious Strawberry 10/10 real good flavor and more servings. it does have more sugar per serving but only 3 gm.<br/><br/>This is based on my taste so you may like different things than what I do.<br/>I will try Chocolate Coconut next.<br/><br/>**update**<br/><br/>Delicious Strawberry 10/10 real good flavor and more servings. it does have more sugar per serving but only 3 gm.
 This is my go to whey protein. Mixes well. Taste great.
 Best whey product I have ever purchased!!! ON, you have a customer for life!!!
 This is the only whey protein by son will drink. He is a competitive swimmer for 9 years and has been drink this for years. Still does in college.
 OMGGGGG, this flavor is so delicious!! I thought it was going to be terrible however I was wrong. I blend it with milk and have that as breakfast....the best!
 I orederd this product several times, but this time it has been bad damaged when I opend it. I will take it because I don't want to wait to change, but I don’t feel pleasant.
 Great tasting protein. Only getting a 5 star now after I bought my most recent organic, vegetable based nasty tasting protein. This gives you a good punch of protein with not too much cholesterol/fat. Milk chocolate is probably the best.
 Tried optimum nutrition before and got major results. Switched to syntha 6 and now to go back to ON and see which has better results
 I used this product fully and i could feel the difference. It has a good taste and dissolves easily. If you are looking for building strength i would suggest this product very much. Though if you are looking for building size i would not suggest this of course.
 Tastes great
 Feel like im drinking chocolate milk and keeps me filled when i use it as a meal replacement. Endless possibilities you can with this! Great buy
 This flavor is nice and smooth and blends better than the chocolate ones I usually get. It actually taste great. Use this if you would like something to mix with fruit smoothies!
 I work out first thing in the morning on an empty stomach. I take one serving of ON's BCAA's, five grams of ON's creatine and a scoop of peanut butter. This and a scoop of ON's whey protein post workout is all use for supplements, and I've been making steady gains over the last three years. The rest is simply consistently pushing yourself in the gym, a balanced diet, and sleep.
 GOOD PRODUCT
 This is my 6th can of this whey product, and I can't say a bad thing about it. I've produced very notable results, it contains a bunch of vitamins and minerals, BCAA's, and other goodies. For this price you won't find anything better
 Tastes and blends well, I prefer the Cake Batter myself. I usually mix it with the Double Chocolate when I have both. Only con I'd say is that they've started using a gold scoop (which isn't transparent). Can sometimes make it difficult to tell if the scoop is full or has air-pockets.
 The double chocolate has been my favorite flavor for over 2 years, but I recently tried the Mint Chocolate and it is Delicious!! I'm a huge fan of mint chocolates so naturally I love the mint chocolate flavor :)
 Great price
 Delicious. I'm not always a chocolate fan. I usually prefer vanilla but this is really good. No fake taste. I mix a scoop with unsweetened almond/coconut milk after my workout.
 Tasty
 Doesn't taste very good, but does any of this stuff ever? Works well for building lean muscle.
 Not the best tasting whey in my opinion but its not bad either! I know a lot of people who use it!
 I like this protien shake specially the double rich chocolate flavored and also the extreme milk chocolate flavor they taste really great you will get your money worth. And it's also cheaper than any where else. Thanks Amazon.
 I love ON Gold Standard Whey and recommend it all the time, but this flavor is dreadful. Truly truly awful.<br/><br/>Sticking to double chocolate and strawberry banana in the future.
 Best bang for your buck on this product compared to every other powder on the whole site. Flavor is great and there is no residue left behind after use, it is very easy to clean. The coffee flavor is great because it can be mixed into coffee and it is very subtle or you can mix it in milk and have a  healthy coffee ice cream milkshake. If you are a big fan of coffee, this is definitely the product for you.
 I thought it would taste better ... Feels like ESN tastes way better.
 At 26 grams it adds a substantial amount of protein to help you reach your protein macro. Great product
 packaging was perfect and so was the product.<br/>Price was super nice and getting MACHO has never been easier.
 Love this! Best protein shake I’ve had. Taste delicious and mixes well. I have the chocolate. I will have to wait and see how much it helps with my gains. I use it for the extra protein.
 I've drinking this for over a year and really love the flavor of double rich chocolate, and it's a choice of quality
 This is recommended by my gym but I didn't want to pay full price and didn't get around to going to GNC so I was very happy to find this at Amazon.  I like the way this doesn't clump and the taste is fine.  I use after workouts and don't feel so hungry.
 It's the gold standard for whey protein... Hence the name... Can't really ask for more.
 I've been using ON Gold standard for 2+ years. This+coffee+cold milk= Great beverage to keep you going through the day!
 this stuff has a decent flavor.  a lot of protein powders are bad chalky tasting but this one isn't bad.  mixes well and very filling
 Thank you
 I just recently received the Rocky Road flavor 5lb container of whey protein powder and I am very happy with it. It tastes delicious and goes really well with bananas and fresh peanut butter. It also has minimal sugar, calories and carbs which is good for me. I'd recommend this product!
 I tried the double chocolate flavor and doesn't taste as I expected. Otherwise good product.
 Tastier than Jessica Albas hoohah.
 Easy to mix or blend! Lots of protein.
 I have been impressed with the results from this protein.
 I had high hopes for this protein powder. I ordered double chocolate and was hesitant because all the bad reviews regarding the flavor. I took a chance anyways, and if the flavor wasn’t so bad it would be a great protein choice. Hoping a different flavor will redeem it!
 Blends smoother than any other protein and tastes great.  There are several great flavors as well.  Don't be afraid to try something different with ON
 love the product.  I use it on my "Chris Powell" diet, during my carb cycling, low carb days.  Its one of the lowest carb protein shakes i've found, that actually tastes good.<br/>The formula is very fine, so it mixes easy, i totally dislike the shakes that are chalky, this stuff is great.
 ON Whey Gold Standard lives up to the hype!  Very easy to mix and great tasting!  This is without a doubt a cut above the rest!  I used EAS for years and have tried Muscle Tech.  This is a little more expensive, but definitely whey better!  Plus, mucho savings through Amazon's subsctription program!  Best price I could find.
 Really love this, it mixes great with water and tastes exactly like a mocha frap. Always looking forward to my protein shakes now.
 French vanilla creme is so delcious by far the best taste I've experienced in protein powder.<br/><br/>I've tried a couple different brands of protein powder and this was my first time trying on. I wanted a vanilla flavored one but didn't want to but the on vanilla since you get less product for the same price. I went with the French vanilla and it is exactly what I wanted. Tastes great and I can use it in my cooled down coffee. I wanna try the other on flavors now but this will definitely be my go to protein powder
 Great taste,
 I love it. Just don't have it before you go to sleep. You probably won't be able to get to sleep. It's full of protein.
 Good price when compared to local area.
 I had VSG surgery may 7th 2014, and I have been drinking this protein for a month now, I do 2 shakes a day with 2 scoops in each shake, it does not have a strong flavor at all, and it mixes very easily its not sweet either. I would like a protein that has a better more pronounced flavor like the muscle milk protein powder it really tastes like vanilla. Im not sure I will be ordering this one again, I find that I need to add flavored syrups to it to make it good and for me to want to drink it, but its an excellent shake if that makes sense with 1grm of sugar and 2 carbs.
 Don’t really ever do reviews on products. So the taste is not very good at all but the price for 5lb is great so if your on a budget and you need whey then I’d recommend it. Like I said tho taste is not there at all.
 Tastes great and includes a scoop. Can't beat the quality to price ratio!
 I don't get bored of the taste.<br/>Doesn't clump much.<br/>Comes with a scoop, which may get buried down deep.<br/>Mixes well with both water and milk.
 Mixes extremely well and comes as advertised. No issues whatsoever.
 Very much satisfied with the product, will definitely recommend if this is your first time buying it!
 I've been drinking protein shakes for as long as I can remember, and for the price, this is the best protein powder I've had. I've only tried two of the flavors, so can't recommend any of the others, but the double rich chocolate and vanilla are great. The powder mixes very easily just with a spoon, but I try to makes shakes in the blender when I have time. The macros on this powder are good, so can't say anything negative about the product. I'll keep buying!
 I love this protein powder! It is very tasty. Very chocolatey which I love. Great for morning shake or a nighttime snack when you want that chocolate.
 it tastes good and is a great protein! I just wish it had some volume to it rather then feeling like im drinking chocolate water. the protein that didnt have this problem was muscle tech anabolic halo, but it is not as high quality as this product and i would not go back at all!
 My son and I go through one of these in less than a month. The taste is awesome and I mix mine with skim milk.  Some people do water, but I've always done skim milk.  It takes almost like a chocolate milk shake. I use a shaker with one of those metal balls in the bottom to mix it up.  Blends nicely without the need to use a blender.
 Product is fine.  I went with coffee, but wish I went chocolate.  I now have a lot of coffee to get through until I get a chance to make the switch.
 My GOODNESS it's tasty.
 They improved the formula, as it no longer has lumps and even tastes better.
 Looks like its already open, no “rounded scoop” inside either
 I decided to try a different flavor and LOVE the cappuccino taste! I was worried to try something other than the chocolate but now that I know how good this one is I will definitely be willing to try more flavors next time
 Tastes great and perfect for a health nut or gym goer.
 One of the better whey protein powders on the market. For the gf and I both use  Double Rich Chocolate and the flavor is very good, no bitterness or chalkiness. Mixes very well, limited clumps with hand blending, spoon or shaker bottle, and cleans off glasses well. A tad bit expensive but overall very good purchase. The next competitor is the Dymatize brand, but after a formula change the taste is off putting a bit, Optimum Nutrition is a steady horse.
 This is my go to whey protein, best tasting whey i can find, 5 Stars all the WHEY ! Will buy again, thank you
 Trainer recommended I try Optimum Nutrition products stating they used quality materials in their products and I couldn't agree more!  Finally found a protein that doesn't cause me to feel bloated and weighed down.  This stuff mixes really well and has a great taste.
 All around good supplement
 Always rated this product. It speaks for itself...research it and try it for yourself
 Coffee flavor... YES
 This is my favorite flavor of whey protein. It mixes great with water, ice, and a banana. Or you could use one of those blender ball cups and bring it to the gym and just add water. Either way, it tastes great. The 5 lbs tub is a good size to buy because the container is sturdy and stands upright, as opposed to the 10 lbs sack. Makes it easier to scoop and reclose the lid. The smaller sizes are also more expensive per serving.
 I love this protein.<br/><br/>I have tried the Chocolate Mint flavor and it is amazing! With just 4-6 ounces of water, I could easily chug it like it was nothing, and left this minty freshness in my mouth.<br/><br/> The chocolate isn't strong so I didn't have to play with the amount of water to get an ideal taste.<br/><br/> I must add I had two 5 pounders I finished entirely.<br/><br/>Now I will try the Rocky Road.
 The BEST protein taste, I have ever had!!! It's really nice, and the nutrition are also very lean and healthy.<br/><br/>Definitely will recommend, and buy again!<br/><br/>I hope they do well!
 It's a great value, and it delivers quality protein.  However, it is pretty chalky and does not taste as good as some other brands I've had before.  I will probably try a smaller quantity of another brand next time to see if I like it better.
 I sent this to someone that is not able to have the nutritionally necessary food. He has lost some fats and gained muscle. He says he feels much better since drinking this. He says his energy level has improved so that he can jog and sleep much better than before. The shipping is as promised and delivery as stated.
 Chocolate mint is kinda gross. Not horrible, just not good. Get a more generic flavor.
 Good
 Very good product. Thank you!
 Formula change -- the removal of aminogen and the addition of salt in particular -- has ruined this product for me. I don't like the new taste or how it sits in my stomach. It's also disappointing that I cannot return it :/
 I am sure this is one of the best protein powder products in the market but the taste wasn't as delicious as I expected and the price was a bit high for my budget.
 A really good Whey protein at a great price.
 Love it, tastes really good.
 Good clean protein, this is my new favorite brand, priced well for what you get, will input switch up flavors next time to try something new. Blends very well with no aftertaste or weird grit
 Delicious! Will buy again!
 I swear I tasted cinnamon even though it is not listed. I just wanted plain chocolate and was turned off by the extra flavor.
 Most protein powders don't taste great but don't taste horrible either.  I can deal with that as can most people.  We're not drinking it for the taste but for the protein after all.  But what I just HATE in a protein powder is when it refuses to mix up well.  Some almost seem waterproof.  You shake and stir and shake some more and it all floats to the top.  Then you take a drink and you get dry encapsulated powder clumps chased by cloudy water.  Not good.<br/><br/>But THIS protein isn't like that.  It can be mixed with a simple spoon.  It mixes well with water or milk.  Just stir it in no different that if you were mixing up a glass of Nestle's Quik.  Even when I double the dose, it makes no difference.  That I like.<br/><br/>And it does taste quite good.  So I would agree with the "Gold Standard" label.  It's that good.
 This review is for the french vanilla creme flavor. I usually add some protein powder to my morning coffee, and this powder does dissolve very easily (usually fully dissolved within 15-30 seconds of stirring). The flavor is just okay, which is why I am only rating this 4 stars. Overall, it does not leave big clumps that other protein powders would leave, but it works nonetheless.
 Good tasting and I received it in two days after ordering. I mix it with coffee and peppermint fat bombs, which basically makes a pretty tasty mocha.
 We have tried tons of protein shakes this is by far the best tasting one!! And for the price!!!..... What? Great deal!!!
 Taste great if you mix it right. I ad some sherbet or ice cream and sometimes some peanut butter. Yummy shakes.
 Great stuff.  Taste is awesome and only flavor i would buy.
 This is the best protein powder i have ever bough, i have tasted and tried several proteins powders from different manufacturers. This one is for sure one of the best and balanced proteins in the market.
 Great taste and mixes well!
 Love it so far, can't go wrong with chocolate
 I can highly recommend this protein. I use this when I'm out of my Pro Complex. The difference between the two is the Pro Complex is a protein blend as opposed to just whey protein. Gold Standard in my opinion is one of the best on the market and I've found Amazon offers the best prices.
 Taking away 1 star as mine didn't come with a scoop.<br/>Overall great product
 Works Great!!
 This tastes amazing. I allows need a little boost after my workout if I'm heading to work and it mixes well with iced coffee and gives it a boost of flavor
 Great stuff and tastes better than other brands I have used.
 I know it's pretty expensive, but I haven't found any other whey protein that's actually all protein. Everything else comes with unnecessary carbs and fats. If I want more carbs, I'll mix it with milk. If I want more fat, I'll use 2% milk.
 After tasting the extreme milk chocolate you will never want any other. The extreme milk chocolate mixes well with a blender bottle, taste great and does not foam up from shaking.  There are some whey mixtures which taste better, but for a pure whey, this is the only way to go.  Highly recommend this flavor.  Reputable brand.  This combined with intense workouts = success.
 Great Supplement.  Got mocha cappuccino and it taste great!
 On has lots of great products and I am sure this is one of them but I can't stand the taste. I was so excited thinking it would actually taste like cookies and cream. Instead it taste like rotten milk. So, my gf drank it all since she likes the taste.
 This protein powder has a very light taste, mixes well, and doesn't have a chalky texture at all.  It also does not mess up my stomach like other protein powders do.  Great buy!
 Mix it with the right amount of whole milk and the entire thing has the consistency and taste of a chocolate milkshake: quite possibly the best protein shake I have personally tasted. It's not that bad with water either, but why would you ever mix it with water when you could a Freaking. Chocolate. Milkshake. with over 50 grams of protein?
 Love the flavor
 Love it
 Great product. I consume it twice a day both with plain water and milk. Mixes pretty well with both without lumps.<br/>Also low carb helps provide lean protein. I am a vegetarian and don’t have any lean source of protein unlike meat. Easy on digestion. I love this product!!
 My 18 yr old son is using and loves it. He is so picky about protein powder flavors and this he really likes. Mixes easily and tastes great!
 Tastes good, will make you strong if you lift weights and drink.<br/><br/>Please tape the free samples to the outside of the jar instead of putting them in with the powder. That makes a mess!
 This stuff rocks.  Tastes great, have only been using for a bit more than a week and already ready seeing results from my workouts.
 Not a single complaint here. The powder tastes great and actually tastes a lot like ice cream. It tastes good even with just water.
 Cake batter is perhaps one of the most versatile flavors they have.  A little more flavor than basic vanilla, so it stands on its own well.  But when mixed with frozen berries it complements perfectly.
 This is the most effective Protein Powder I have used to date and for what it does the flavor is actually pretty good compared to other brands.
 I wish Dymatize kept making their Chocolate Mint flavor because this one doesn't even have a hint of mint. Disappointing.
 I picked up this flavor ( rocky road ) because this is what I seen a lot of people recommending.  I mixed it with 6 ounces of water like the direction said and it tastes alright.  It tastes a lot better with 4 ounces of water.  It does have a funny aftertaste but it's pretty good for a protein drink and it mixes very well (not chunky at all).
 Always the best!
 The 15 serving is the perfect size for traveling!
 Good product, 24g of protein for a 30g scoop. Blends well but clumps in a blender bottle. Not the top of the market, but not top of the market price either. Good staple to have.
 I am very pleased with this product either mixed with water or milk. As I eat very little meat I feel that combined with eggs, cheese &amp; nuts it gives enough additional protein to meet the standard daily requirement.
 Double chocolate is the best tasting protein. Use everyday. The bag is resealable which is nice. I still dump half of it into a small 5lb tub just for convenience.
 Always a good product! Used many times and will continue to order.
 This stuff is DELICIOUS! I will buy more when i get low, thanks!
 You might find cheaper proteins but you won't find better, the double rich chocolate mixes and tastes great.
 better price, same quality from the store.
 My son uses this product and likes it.  He actually uses it for a meal supplement and for part of his physical fitness program.  He likes the product and the flavor.  He started mixing it with milk and likes it better.  Just keep out out of the hands of Little Miss Muffett.
 this baby bulk me up, I havent used it much yet but the quality and taste made more promising than I have thought.
 I like it . The best so far
 I just reordered this for my protein shakes and it is so different than the previous version.  It is so strong in scent and taste that I cannot use it at all.  I had to go to the basic vanilla and now my shakes do not taste nearly as good.  I liked the older recipe better.
 Great protein, mixed well, tastes great and you get more for your money. 💪💪
 I'll eat anything, but the big test was my wife.  I made her a shake after a morning workout (using milk and a spoonful of peanut butter) and she actually liked it.  It wasn't "gross and chalky" like other protein shakes she's tried and it's much better than her typical breakfast of mountain dew and a pop tart.
 Excellent whey protein. I bought to use after run and the difference you will feel since the first use.
 Very Nice product, fast shipping to APO address. Flavors are subjective, but very happy with this.
 Great tasting when combined with milk. It's tolerable with water, but much better with milk.<br/><br/>Dilutes well even in a blender bottle but it's ideal if processed in a Vitamix or some blender.<br/><br/>As with all whey products, it's not advised to take too much given the gassy bowel response.<br/><br/>Try it with a banana and peanut butter for a really amazing shake.
 Use it regularly.
 I love the way this protein taste. Not sweet, not chulky and just right. Perfectly dissolved in water. I will definately buy it again.
 As sold at GNC, but without the overweight salesman telling you he has been using it for 16 years and the results speak for themselves.
 No visible results, doesn't make you feel full.
 Best tasting protein I have ever had, and I have been through quite a few. Seeing great results/muscle gains in a short period of time. Can't go wrong with this!
 Good protein, but didn't get a scoop. I dumped the entire thing out and sifted through it all. No scoop.
 As a big coffee fan I was pretty disappointed with the ON Coffee flavor. It just tastes like instant coffee with a aftertaste of charcoal. I've had a lot of coffee flavored yogurts etc and this one just falls flat.<br/>Mixes great with water and/or milk and supposedly some of the best BCAA's and all that but what do I know
 Tastes pretty good.  I mix it in my smoothie with berries etc.  but this actually makes my smoothies taste better.
 Tastes delicious in any flavor and it makes u feel so healthy and ready for ur everydays!
 Well I have tried many types of protein shakes and can not stand ANY of the flavors. I gave this a 3 out of 5 stars due to some imperfections, but taste wise I would give it easy 5 out of 5.<br/><br/>Pro's:<br/>-Taste exactly like Nestle Milk Chocolate that you buy pre made in those bottles. Very good. (When mixed with milk)<br/>-This comes with a lot of powder.<br/>-Mixes Excellent with a shaker.<br/><br/>Con's:<br/>1) If you try to mix it with a spoon, fork, or any other method you get gross powder chunks that are impossible to mix.<br/>2) If not mixed with a shaker or blender, almost undrinkable due to chunks of powder.<br/>3) Does not go well with water at all.<br/><br/>If you use milk, which you can easily do. This will be a great shake for you. Water mix with the shake, I would not use this product.<br/><br/>I highly recommend you drink it in the morning with milk when you wake up, have another round of it sometime in the day, im sure your work has a fridge you can store milk or something. For me, I work out late at night after work (around midnight) so I will get home and drink it after working out.<br/><br/>Take my pro's and con's into consideration.
 Absolutely wonderful product! I've had nothing but a good experience with Optimum Nutrition's 100% Whey and the Extreme Milk Chocolate flavor is the best tasting protein powder I have ever had!
 It's good.
 The price on these seem to keep fluctuating but as long as it's competitive with the other products the flavor is great and it mixes easily.
 Great
 Very happy with this product. A little pricey, but still a better cheaper source of protein than 10 bags of chicken at the grocery store.
 Best protein in the market. I have a sensitive stomach and do not have any issues. Easy digestion, no heavy feeling of other side effect. AWESOME!
 Does what is supposed to do.
 Used it for years-- will continue.
 Good
 No scoop, taking this protein comes with risks of over flatulence. When u take it be sure to confine yourself in the solitary embankment with a constant unobstructed flow of fresh air
 Pretty good flavor, I ordered a milk chocolate one last time and I think they are both good flavor！
 Great whey and very tasty. Will buy more.
 I've been on a search for a good whey protein for some time now and I think I've found my answer. I've tried both Vanilla Ice Cream and Double Chocolate and they both taste great. They both taste much better than average in water and taste delicious in milk. They also disperse really well so you don't end up eating chunks of dry protein all the time. I can't attest to the results of the product quite yet but it's a very promising start.
 Great value for whey protein, and probably the best tasting calorie to protein ratio out there. Chocolate-y for sure but the GoldStandard casein chocolate protein tastes much richer.
 Great flavor. After getting burned out on chocolate protein powder, this was a great alternative. Plus you can't go wrong with Gold Standard.
 One of the best proteins i ever used in my 30 years of bodybuilding.
 Personally, I love protein powder. After using Shakeology, I opted to switch over to this protein. It is great by itself, but also works wonderfully using recipes for shakes (fresh fruit, spices, etc). The nutrition is great and the taste is delicious!
 Tastes great and is a really good protein supplement it does what it is supposed to do.
 Awesome product! Happy customer. Really works.
 Best flavor ...amazing shake.
 Cookies and cream? Needs an overhaul. Tastes like cardboard.  Better off going with chocolate.
 been buying this protein for over 2 years, and no complaints. Everything you're looking for, at a good price.
 This is a great protein powder, the quality is good the price per scoop is great, and the Vanilla and Chocolates flavors all taste great.
 Love this protein.  I've been using this protein exclusively for the past 10 plus years.  It taste great, has a good amount of protein and is perfect when you need something after a work out or as a meal replacement.
 Love the vanilla. I've been using ON for years and have yet to be disappointed. The price point is great and the flavors don't disappoint. I mix mine with almond milk and consume post workout. Taste like a vanilla milkshake.
 No review
 I keep buying this for my son who plays high school wrestling. It has various tastes. But my son just loves it regardless of taste.
 Great product, quick delivery!
 Great Protein. Good flavor. I mix mine in a magic bullet with milk and it's delicious.
 This smells and taste great. Never really tasted it with just water, however it taste really good as a shake. I usually do my shakes with soy milk, a banana and a few strawberries and it is delicious and fulfilling. The best so far.
 Optimum Whey Gold Standard has always been great for me through the years.  Upgrading to Prime got me to purchase through Amazon, and I was excited at seeing Chocolate Coconut as a flavor.  It did not disappoint.  Tastes fine with water, and delicious with milk.  I often look forward to having my shake.  The coconut flavor wasn't too artificial/disgusting, it just added a mellow, tropical sweetness.
 nice product
 I've been using Whey protein for the last 4-5 years and even though I've tried other brands, it's always a great pick for me. The powder is not too dense or too excessive in flavoring, which for me is a winner.
 I got the 2lb first to make sure that I liked the flavor.  This stuff is so good and way easier to drink thief other whey proteins out there
 Mixes well with water or milk. Great chocolate taste.
 the same as shown
 Before i discovered Optimum Nutrition, i hated protein drinks. They always seemed to taste nasty, clump up, and would trigger my gag reflex. Well i gotta give it to these guys, their protein tastes just like chocolate milk. I take it every day and this is the only protein i will buy from now on.
 Cookies and Cream flavor smells like coffee and has no flavor. I will never order it again.
 The Optimum Standard Whey Protein definitely lived up to my expectations for quick whey protein. The taste is great, it actually does taste like French Vanilla Creme when you mix it with skim milk, and mixing it into a smoothie gives a wonderful sweet taste. I make a very simply smoothie from a banana, some vanilla extract, skim milk, and ice, and to me this protein complements it quite well. I will note that when mixing just with milk it clumps a little initially so it'll take some good shaking to get it well mixed if you're making the effort yourself. Overall I wasn't disappointed with this is protein powder and would recommend it to anyone who likes the vanilla flavor.
 I have used  the vanilla &amp; strawberry flavors. But this is by far the best tasting one of all.  Its very rich with an awesome chocolatey taste. Best of all it is a great product it works very well. Doesn't give me gas, keeps me very lean. What  recommend this to anyone male-female hope this helps.
 I have been tis product for many years. Being a staunch vegetarian, this is a great protein source.
 Optimum Whey is the best powder on the market. For me, I look at the stuff that's in it, other than JUST the macros. It's macros are great and the ingredient label is small, so you're not getting junk or fillers. I will always buy Optimum Whey &amp; Casein. Keep doing what you're doing ON.
 One of the better flavors.  I was bored of the usual chocolates and not too impressed with the taste.  The slight hint of coconut hasn't forced me to alter any recipe and in my opinion tastes better when mixed with water or milk compared to the standard chocolates.  Will buy again.
 The mocha cappuccino tastes great and is filling.  Really impressed on how easily it mixes.  Makes protein shakes not so unbearable.
 Great product. I have been using ON's Gold standard whey for the past 3 years. I like to mix it in my smoothies.
 This protein powder has a very good taste.<br/>I use this after I workout .<br/>I have a good muscle recovery using this product.<br/>I will buy it again<br/>Gary
 I liked the strawberry flavor and it tastes good with water or milk. I would recommend to family and friends.
 Great quality, no clumps
 Great taste and dissolves really good. Not sure when will I finally see results though
 Great product so far no complaints, time will be a better judge to see how fast my muscles develop during my gym routine. Shipping was done within agreed time and as for the taste, lets say I will be buying more of this flavour when needed...
 Great tasting protein supplement. Comparable to Progenex at half the price and more flavors to choose from! Will continue to purchase over and over.
 Loved the taste disolves great. Good quality
 They say ON Gold Standard is the best, so it's what I buy. I like that it's artificially sweetened and I enjoy adding vanilla ice cream and vanilla flavors to my post-exercise smoothies.
 Good product
 Best ON product I have tried so far. The vanilla flavor mixes well with both water and milk.
 The taste is pretty good!
 Great strawberry flavor! Very similar to strawberry milk when made with almond milk!
 ON is a proven performer. I am a repeat buyer.
 Great product overall. Lots of uses if you think about it. I snort this every morning and evening and it makes my skin feel like a baby's ass. I also drink it after I lift, which is great for recovery. Hungry for sweets at night? Have half a scoop of this and 6oz of water and you'll go to bed feeling like you did nothing for your craving. Either way. It's healthy and it works. Seriously.
 This flavor has a bit of a chemical vitamin after taste. This is the first time I have strayed from the solid flavors. The double rich chocolate is my favorite. Ill choke this stuff down and stick to my regular flavor from now on. Great product all the same.
 I really like this protein.  Fewer calories than some other powders. Blends easy and it doesn't taste too sweet or half a gross artificial sweetener aftertaste.
 Best protein shake ever!
 Prefer this brand over all
 A little hard to mix (clumps up a bit) otherwise it's great!
 GOLD STANDARD is a proven product. Ive never been a fan of Protein Shakes because of the taste/after taste but GOLD STANDARD have changed all of that. This particular flavor is hands DOWN the best. Its rich and creamy. It taste so good I almost feel guilty drinking it lol
 I bought strawberry banana and the taste is terrible. It taste nothing like other Strawberry banana proteins I've had, and actually has more of a Pepto-Bismol taste. I will definitely not be buying this protein EVER again. Save yourself the trouble and don't get this. I wish I had read the reviews before buying this garbage.
 Whey is the gold standard when it comes to soluble protein, and this is the product to get. The flavor is great as well (though not the best I've had). Mixed with peanut butter and milk, it tastes just like a milkshake.
 I got the chocolate flavour but I tried the vanilla one and it is the best
 While I accidentally purchased Strawberry-Banana I did not end up regretting it.  It's good mixed with double rich chocolate, on it's own, and it's seamless in smoothies.  I still prefer chocolate flavors for stand alone drinking, this is my favorite for smoothies.  Optimum Nutrition's Gold Standard Whey line may not be first in taste, some sacrifices must be made for it's incredibly low fat content.
 I have tried many flavored proteins and this product is by far the best tasting and easiest to mix with a blender bottle.
 For the price, you can't beat the optimum line. I am a professional athlete and this keeps me going and I use it every day. It mixes well, taste great, and is perfect for either making smoothies or as a stand alone shake. Buy this!
 I bought the cake batter for a reason: because so many people seemed to love the flavor. However, I, did not. It tastes like fake old cake, very sweet, and just not good. Yuk. Yes, I am complaining and will still drink it because I am stuck with 5 pounds of it So no, its not repulsive. For the purpose of the product, it gets the job done which is why I gave it a 3/5. But flavor is very important to me since I drink it daily. I am definitely trying another flavor of the same brand as soon as I can.
 ON Gold Standard really is the gold standard for whey protein, and it's priced right. It looses a star because the vanilla ice cream flavor is terrible, even with whole milk.
 Rocky Road is easily the best flavor I've ever purchased. I don't think I need to try any more flavors, this one is great!
 This product chocolate flavor tastes good mixed with water and mixes fairly easily. I think it tastes funny mixed with milk but I don't need to use milk. It also gets consistently high ratings on lab tests of its protein level.
 This is some of the best quality protein I've found so far. It tastes very good so you don't feel like you're during a protein shake, it rates like a regular shake. I've tried other shakes but this one is probably one of the best ones.
 Okay, I will admit that the only other whey protein I've had is muscle milk, which I guess is a whey/soy blend. The two flavors of muscle milk I tried were disgusting. That is why I love 100%Whey by Optimum Nutrition. Not only does it have some great nutrients and a lot of protein for the price, but it is also a pleasure to drink. I like to put it in my shaker with some crushed ice and it comes out tasting chocolaty, delicious, and refreshing after a hard workout.<br/><br/>I have been doing the P90X workout program, and I started using this whey protein to supplement my diet. I drink it before and after workouts (if you're on a budget, just drink it after your workouts as that is when it is most effective). I went away on vacation and didn't take any whey powder, and I noticed I was more sore after workouts and became fatigued more easily. I can honestly say that I am currently in the best shape of my life right now. My flab has been shrinking and my muscles have been swelling and I have this fine product partly to thank for my success.<br/><br/>The only complaint I have ever had about this stuff is that when I ordered my last 5lb tub the scoop was buried deep inside the powder. Since I had just finished my last tub I still had that scoop to use, but if someone was ordering this for the first time, they would have had to fish it out somehow. Aside from this minor inconvenience, this product is the best bang for your buck I have found on the internet and makes a great compliment to your exercise regimen.
 this stuff really works! told my friends about it. i gave some to a friend during a workout and he really enjoyed it. he went on amazon and bough it
 This is okay because the results of shaking have produced 4 different results; two of which were tolerable for me to drink. The package came without any seal; which I provided a review and picture on but have yet to hear back from Amazon. I don't think I would buy this again; it's horribly clumps with milk poured in a glass mixed with a spoon; much better in a martini shaker (the three piece one) because it filtered the clumps, but seriously for the price, I am glad I tried the smaller because its less money I just had to throw away. I am not a bodybuilder, just looking to add some daily protein to my diet; so can't compare with other products more serious weight lifters use. I guess there is always a tradeoff that depends on your priorities.<br/>Edit: I just found the best tasting Whey protein which is not offered on Amazon: ProSource. I got the Vanilla and the Chocolate Chip Mint and both are delicious. The price was $25 for 1 2.8 lb jug. The only downer is you pay shipping and it's an independent website- but they shipped fast and I am extremely happy with it. This one is not that bad, but won't buy again.  One question, why don't they tape the scoops to the top of the bottle rather than force you to dig out of the powder?
 great supplement
 As far as protein powders go, the flavor is delicious, and it blends in a second (in a blender).  Does not dissolve incredibly well in liquid with just stirring, but it makes for a tasty way to get your protein.
 cant go wrong with this classic. good taste
 Not the best tasting, but mixes well in anything without blender. So, perfect on the go.
 the only brand I buy
 Tastes perfect! and works PERFECT! VALUABLE
 Best of the competitors. Use it with a good meal plan and you are healthy and good to go.
 I picked up ON 100% Gold Standard Whey Protein Powder just a few days ago and I love it.  I got the double rich chocolate and the taste isn't that bad.  It isn't as sweet as most other powders but its a no-nonsense powder with no extras.  I checked some of the powders I was using and was upset with all the additives such as crystalized taurine and creatine but ON is a straight and to the point powder.<br/><br/>One additional thought:  If it isn't sweet enough you can do two things, 1) decrease the amount of liquid used, or 2) add a touch of fat free or reduced fat chocolate syrup to add a bit of sweetness without too many calories!
 I liked its taste with strawberry and banana. I asked all my friends which I should prefer and all of my friends recommended this one.
 great protein for a great price!
 Nice product.
 Taste like vanilla protein
 No comments
 My go to protein!
 I love this protein powder! The best tasting I have ever had and I have tried all kinds. Mixes easily, low calories, low carbs and sugar. Double Rich Chocolate is the best.
 ON makes good products overall. With this particular flavor, I felt that the mint flavor, while definitely there, wasn't strong enough to make a difference. I prefer the Double Rich Chocolate flavor over this one.
 Used this protein for over a year. You can tell simply by the smell that this is high-quality whey. It tastes amazing and delivers great results. I will always buy this protein.
 10000% contributor to gainz
 Delicious and packed with protein. This stuff gets the job done after a good workout.
 I'm not a big meat eater, but I exercise a lot. I use this just as a protein supplement a couple of times every day. I've tried most of the other major brands and this one is my favorite.  It dissolves really well and tastes good. I usually get the banana flavor.
 This tastes amazing! I'm so surprised. It literally tastes like a smoothie you buy for 7 bucks. I don't use milk. Just the powder and ice in the blender. My version was, double chocolate.
 This is no Burger King chocolate shake, but it tastes good, probably better than most proteins out there. It has worked for me so far. There are some cheaper ones out there but not by much. I'd rather pay the extra couple of bucks and stick to this one. It goes down easy on my stomach and I have seen the difference in my body.
 high quality protien with the best possible texture and flavor.
 Boyfriend loved this protein powder. We have tried various and this is his favorite.
 Love this protein.  Mixes very well.  Buy this before any other protein.  Tastes superb too.
 Set tasting whey I've ever had and continues to Be. It has a lower sugar content and no artificial sweetners, whice makes it compatible with my migraines. Always worth it to buy the bulk ammount.
 I've read a lot of reviews and done a lot of research on protein powders. This one has always been the one to have the best balance of what I look for in a protein. Does it taste good? Does it have good macro ratio? Is it affordable? Does it mix well?<br/><br/>The answer to all of these questions is yes. Is it the best tasting? No, but for the macro ratio, affordability and solubility it is the best and by a long shot. Same thing goes for the macro ratio. You can find one that may be better but it will probably be more expensive and not taste as good.<br/><br/>Bottom line is that this protein checks all the boxes. Now.. I don't want you thinking this protein doesn't taste well. It tastes fantastic. It's amazing they are able to do it with it being so nutrient dense. My favorite is Chocolate Coconut (Tastes like an Almond Joy) and then Extreme Milk Chocolate (Tastes like Yoohoo). I've also tried White Chocolate and Cookies and Cream. White chocolate is good, but I will be sticking with either chocolate coconut or extreme milk chocolate. Cookies and Cream took some getting used to. It tastes like Cookies and Cream made with evaporated milk. Not that I added evaporated milk, I have only ever used water with my shakes, but it literally tasted like a cookies and cream made with evaporated milk. Also, I feel like it needed to be shaken to get the chocolate bits spread evenly.<br/><br/>To summarize, this is the best I have used. I can get the same results from other proteins but this makes me look forward to having a shake. There's a reason why it's a best seller at that body building website.
 If your trying to decide on a flavor, let me help you....DOUBLE RICH CHOCOLATE!!
 Not a good product. flavor is too faint, is like putting a scoop of cocoa in a litter of water.
 This product is awful.  It mixes poorly. B it tastes like their target flavor was the way old socks smell.  I'll never buy, "Amazon's choice," or opinion on things again.
 I have been using this whey protein for years - low in carbs and low in sugar!  In my opinion, the banana cream is the best flavor regardless of whether it is mixed with water, juice or milk.  Amazon seems to be the only place that sells the 5lb for cheap!
 The gold standard i have grown to trust and like over the past 4 years.
 I like it
 This product taste like quality. It doesn't feel like I'm drinking a huge a amount of sugar like the Herbalife brand. It does the trick. I think its one of the best whey proteins for women. So try it out ladies.
 Delicious.  Kasha cereal 1.5 cups add one scoop and a cup of almond mink and you'll have a high protein breakfast that will keep you full longer.  About 40 protein, 38 carb and roughly 400 calories.
 I took as directed &amp; worked out once a day for an hour. I did see decent muscle gains in less than a month.<br/>You do have to work out &amp; watch your diet though, you can't just drink it &amp; hope to get bigger.<br/><br/>My Diet:<br/>Eggs with Turkey Bacon &amp; carb master chocolate milk for breakfast.<br/>Tuna fish with fat-free provolone &amp; black forest ham sandwich.<br/>Baked chicken on top of hummus with fried peppers &amp; onions. (sometimes instead of chicken I had 2 Al Fresco chicken wraps)<br/><br/>I drank WHEY before &amp; after my workout. It worked out pretty well for me.<br/>Apples, bananas &amp; nuts in between meals.<br/><br/>The taste isn't that bad, but it's not the best. I like Muscletech better.<br/>If you mix the chocolate flavor with a low fat chocolate milk &amp; throw some bananas in, it does help.
 I love this product and I have been using it now for 2 years straight but I must say that I'm disappointed because I noticed that we have gone from 75 servings per 5lbs container to now 74, 71 and in cases like the cookies and cream flavor even 69 servings per container. How can you advertise 5lbs but only have 68 servings?????
 I really like the taste of this powder better than some of the more expensive brands.  Plus it mixes well which is a key for me.  I hate to get clumps!  To me, this is the best value whey protein out there.
 Best protein on the market
 This protein mixes up really well in both shaker cups or a blender.  It has a real chocolate flavor without being too sweet.  Plus, there are very few additional ingredient/supplements added.  If you want to make it even less sweet/more chocolatey, you can add a bit of unsweetened cocoa powder.
 Great base to make protein shakes.
 very good
 I've tried a handful of flavors and I've been pleased with just about all of them. So far, I've found that the chocolate mint tastes the best if you're mixing with water, but that cookies and cream does a better job at getting really thick and frothy like an actual shake. Either way, throwing this in a blender bottle (with the wire whisk ball) and shaking for ~15 seconds is all I've needed to get it mixed up enough to drink. This is definitely my go-to protein of choice.
 I have used this product for over a year and it is the only one I will use. Check full nutrition facts, especially sugars and additives
 I have been using this product for many years now. It works as advertised, tastes great, and doesn't upset the stomach. Easily mixes with your drink of choice.<br/><br/>Hint: try chocolate with red Gatorade. It tastes like a tootsie pop, provides post workout carbs, and rehydrates.
 I take this post-workout and sometimes in the morning too. Mixes extremely well with water and milk. The taste is as good as it gets. All in all the best protein out there.
 👍👍👍
 Best Brand of Protien to purchase.<br/>Tastes great and does the job!
 It is one of the best proteins out there. It is of fast absorption with a very low fat and cholesterol content.<br/>The only thing is that it doesn't have much of a taste. I got the chocolate flavor and I have to add stuff to my shake in order to make it taste more appealing to me.
 The best option in quality and flavor, I usually buy Double Chocolate, I like the low sweet level and not bad after taste.
 They are the Gold Standard for a reason- but it does cause me to be gassy.
 I normally buy the large tubs, but I wanted a smaller amount of vanilla to mix into oatmeal - and this works great for that. ON is my go-to for any whey products.
 Taste good
 My boyfriend, who I bought this for, says it doesn't taste very good.
 Great product with an outstanding taste. I was very impressed with how easy the powder mixed and did not clump up on tbe side of my shaker cup or blender.  Highly recommend if you want to be your monies worth.
 My wife uses this with her workouts to help with muscle preservation and recovery and likes it. When she was first getting back into the swing of things she said it really helped her soreness. She prefers this flavor much more than the Vanilla. She said it's like drinking cold hot chocolate.
 Great cutting protein. The flavor is't the best but its low-carb and overall a very quality protein. Optimum is a brand you know and trust, you can't go wrong with gold standard.
 Best tasting protein I've ever had! great price for the size too
 This stuff is delicious.  When I want the protein, and I'm in a hurry, I'll just throw some in a blender bottle with some milk.  If I want a meal replacement, I'll mix it in with milk, banana, and peanut butter and blend it with the stick blender, which is totally amazing.
 I didn't like the taste of it at first but after the first couple of days I've actually really enjoyed it. One of the motivations to go workout is that I can have this as a reward.
 no whey broooooooo
 Good product. More convenient than going to the mall to purchase. Extreme milk chocolate is probably the best flavor
 my go-to protein, mixes easily with water and tastes decent (ice cream flavor)
 I've bought this several times now and the Extreme Milk Chocolate is the best one I've tasted.
 ON Gold Whey offers the best value for whey currently except for when Costco has sales on their 100% isolate. After having bought chocolate flavored whey exclusively for years, I tried the strawberry once to change it up and now buy it exclusively, it is a much easier flavor to drink day in and day out.
 I'm a huge fan of black coffee, and I'm not a fan of overly sweet protein powders. This is the perfect combination of what I look for in a protein supplement, and the coffee flavoring isn't over powering.
 Rocky road isn't a flavor i'd care much for on a regular basis.
 Love the extreme milk chocolate!!  I will admit I wasn't impressed with the double chocolate.  I used it, but will think twice about blindly ordering a new flavor LOL.
 Tastes great and does the trick!  We mix ours with milk, but you can mix with water - just tastes better with milk.
 Love this protein powder! I bought the cake batter flavor, and have so far not found any combinations that didn't taste awesome! I've had it with water, with milk, milk and banana, milk and coffee, milk and peaches, etc. All taste fantastic, and it mixes in pretty smoothly. Will definitely re-order this product, extremely satisfied with it!
 I've been a fan of Optimum Nutrition whey for years. This will mix with a spoon when using water; milk still needs a shaker.<br/><br/>I love that this packs a lot of protein without a lot of fat. Hard to find a similar product at the same price.
 Good quality.
 The chocolate didn’t taste great. Wouldn’t get it again. The delicious strawberry is much better.
 Okay, so I've been using ON Whey for a while. I feel like it gives me a little more bang for the buck compared to the traditional store brands (especially since it includes the BCAAs).<br/><br/>My only complain--which I admit might be completely in my head--is that the chocolate/coffee/whatever flavors that ON makes don't mix anywhere near as well as the fruit flavors. Typically, the "heavier" flavors leave lots of unmixed globs no matter how well you shake up your serving. Meanwhile, the "lighter" flavors tend to mix rather well.<br/><br/>Pretty minor complaint, though. If you're trying to build some muscle, I suggest ON over any other brand. It's hard to beat for the price.
 Don't really like the taste but works well with my mass gainer and on its own.
 Bought the smaller bag and it was the perfect anount to try out the flavor. Will be purchasing the 5lb tub next.
 Great tasting protein powder. Easily mixes with a spoon or fork in about 20 seconds. To me, it's best with less water and at room temperature, rather than cold. Would definitely recommend.
 amazing protein and the best tasting i've ever had.
 Great flavor, mixes easily in bottle with a tumbler.
 This is a great product.  It tastes great and goes well with water or milk.  I typically bought these and they would taste terrible in water.  However, I can workout and just shake up the mix and it's great.
 Probably fine but I wont buy again because I'm finished with artificial sweeteners,<br/>Going with their natural chocolate with real sugar and stevia....
 Awesome protein. Extremely lean, can mix with just a spoon if need be, and tastes great with milk. Highly recommend and will be buying again.
 I love the OPTIMUM NUTRITION products.  I use the Casein and ISO protein along with their Creatine.  They all mix really well and taste great.
 taste ok
 Love it!!!!!!
 Came exactly as advertised and for a great price. 5lbs and 71 servings.
 Great value for price. Most potent protein on the market for the cost.
 Extreme Milk Chocolate, Excellent taste, my teenage son loves it.  His friends had him buy another brand and it was OK.  After some research I purchased this one and it's his favorite.
 I'm actually underwhelmed. For such great reviews the taste is not that great in my opinion. I won't be buying it again once it's gone.
 More expensive than most, true, but it's a clean protein without a ton of sugar or other additives in it that I don't want.  I've used it with great success in cutting, bulking, and maintenance.  Worth the premium price.<br/><br/>Minus one star for the new bag not zipping closed!  Arrrgh!
 very very good i love it!!!
 I usually like banana-flavored protein powders.  This has a bad smell and aftertaste.  After using a shaker bottle for my 1st serving, I thought maybe I had forgotten to wash the shaker cup.  I'm generally a fan of Optimum Nutrition but not for this one.
 One of the better protein shakes out there.
 I bought this product  as a protein supplement to help in the control of blood sugar spikes. It works well. In my opinion it has the same taste and consistency as ALL whey supplements. Price can't be beat - 5 lb container is challenging to store.
 I have a scoop every morning in my smoothie.  Good protein additive, taste great too.
 was really good
 Yummy, althought in Mocha Cappucino, I can barely taste the coffee flavor so it just tastes like chocolate. Wish they wouldve put more coffee flavoring. I had cookies and cream before which was great.
 This stuff is amazing and taste amazing. Well worth the price.  I have never tasted or felt protein powder so good and that felt like a cloud in a container
 will buy again
 Probably the easiest powder i've ever used to mix in water.  I got the French Vanilla,  it's super rich.  Taste is easy to get used to.  and if I add any flavoring (berries, Chocolate, etc) the added tastes come through the creamy base just fine.
 ON Gold Standard makes amazing products, if you're reading this you probably already know this.  the coconut chocolate flavor is amazing!  *<br/><br/>* Assuming you think chocolate and coconut are yummy.
 great. good price
 Best flavor
 This stuff got me jacked, I love it
 good stuffs. vanilla taste much better than chocolate. ice scream taste the best...now if i could sleep more with 2 lil' babies around all day?! i could easily gain some major muscle...\^^/
 This product is making me look like stud. The flavor tastes awesome as well!
 I had so much trouble finding a protein shake that will not make my stomach hurt and I've finally found the product I was looking for. Great flavor, mixes well and I light on the stomach. I would highly recommend despite its high cost.
 It tastes different from what I ordered in India (same flavor from an Authorized Distributor.)<br/>Will be able to tell if it's genuine or not, only after using for a month or two.
 Thank
 This is the best deal you can find when it comes to protein.  I have used other kinds and ION is the best hands down.  Amazon has this at a better price than you can find at GNC or anywhere else.  The protein mixes easily and is tasty.
 This stuff has always been my go to Whey protein powder. Tastes amazing compared to any other product... I usually do 2 scoops in the morning as soon as I wake up.
 This product had arrived much earlier than was expected to, props to amazon for that! And the taste for those who care I ordered the 5 Pounds of Double Milk Chocolate and it's the best mix I've yet to taste. Mix it with milk and peanut butter, practically a reeses cup shake! I'd recommend this product highly!
 Have been using it for years, tastes good, affordable, mixes easy, just works.  Nothing to fix as nothing is broken :)
 Excellent taste! Great protein powder!
 I was looking for a low sugar protein powder to build lean muscle while still having good taste. High in protein, good taste, light and filling.
 It's protein powder.  Makes a great shake.  Taste is very good.  No noticeable clumping and mixes well.
 Its good but if youre also going for taste, make sure you mix with 6oz of water or less. Its a little on the bland side. But with 24g of protein 5g of BCAAs and 4g of glutamine, id deal with it.
 Best taste I've ever had, I use this with almond milk.
 Gold standard is aptly named.  It is 100% Whey protein, produced by Glanbia (optimum nutrition and ABB parent company), based right here in the US.  It is a very reputable company, and has been routinely been one of the best selling whey protein supplements in the country.  There are multiple reasons for this.<br/>1) Affordability/cost effectiveness:  This protein likely to be well within the budgets of most fitness fanatics/gym rats/weekend warriors, and the quantity supplied for just under $60 is quite reasonable when compared to its counterparts on the shelves of your local GNC.<br/>2) Quality protein from a reputable company: It includes a modest but not insignificant amount of leucine, isoleucine, and valine in each serving in addition to the 24 grams of quality Whey.<br/>3) Taste:  Double chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry are all quite palatable.  They also mix easily in a shaker into water and/or milk without clumping.<br/>4) Tolerability:  No experience with gastrointestinal distress or the ability to clear a room after taking this product.
 5/5 Flavor with NO "cancer" sweeteners (apartame, sucralose, stevia, etc.)<br/>5/5 Cheap consistent product.<br/><br/>It is a staple for my weightlifting diet. I try to get most of my protein from foods, but the convenience of a 50+ g protein shake when my kitchen is unavailable is unbeatable. I do try to mix in other proteins, but this is always on the counter in my kitchen.
 Optimum Nutrition is by far the best brand for protein shakes. I know flavor is more of a bonus when it comes to protein powders but the chocolate flavors for Optimum Nutrition is close to that good ole' school chocolate milk.<br/><br/>This particular whey protein is easy to blend as well. If you have one of those blender bottles (shake cups), it will mix pretty good although it will leave slight few clumps (doesn't bother me much). Sometimes I throw it in my Vita-Mix and add a banana, you will get a very smooth and tasty drink.<br/><br/>Very Good!
 I am a Marathon Runner and also Born Vegetarian. People Ask me always how i get my Protein but i always tell them that i eat healthy Vege Stuff and Gold Standard Whey Protein mix with soy milk all Berry's or any fruit and i get my Proteins. So i can say this is a great product try this you will feel Batter.
 Only four stars because the scoop was not inside. Otherwise I would have rated it five stars.
 I really like this product. I bought the strawberry banana flover and it taste great with almond milk. I definatly notice when i dont drink this after a workout because i feel extra sore the next day. Its definatly worth the money.
 Excelente
 Great protein powder! Mixes great and tastes amazing as well! Def get the bang for your buck!
 The only reason i am writing a review is as a warning to others; this product RUINED my face. It took me a month to figure out what had cause the worst acne of my entire life (I am a 23 year old female) and as soon as i stopped taking it my face (only on my face!) cleared right up. So if you have sensitive skin i highly recommend not buying this product becuase it has been a horrible experience for me.
 great product, great results
 I've stopped expecting protein powder to taste like the listed "flavor".. still delicious, helped me gain weight when mixed with peanut butter and instant coffee... ON is on point.
 All protein shakes taste bad but this is the least bad tasting one. Also after much research it has the lowest price per gram of protein and the best calorie, carb, protein ratio around.
 "Milk is for babies" -Arnold Schwarzenegger
 Powder itself is fine. However the seal got stuck in the lid so when I opened it I thought it wasn't sealed. Well I'm still not sure if it was sealed before I opened it.
 I did gained good muscles !
 Excellent product.  Will help add lean muscle with exercise.
 This is the best protein powder on the market in my view. This product is great in smoothies or just mixed with water or milk! I use it everyday and am really glad Amazon carries this product. Thank you very much. I will definitely be ordering again. A plus!
 In my search for a good protein for women, I think I've found it in Op Nut. Great carb to protein ratio, it's like 1:6. The cake batter is amazing, you can mix it into anything, yogurt, oatmeal, milk, etc. I don't know if this flavor is discontinued b/c its no longer on their site and it seems that the vendors' supplies are dwindling.
 I love chocolate and this is very delicious as far as protein powder goes! I usually mix it with almond milk, ice cubes, water and PB2 for some delicious peanut butter chocolate goodness.
 The double rich chocolate is the best tasting protein I've ever tried. I love this stuff. Buy the 10lb bag on sale and you've got a bunch of protein for a great value at a lower price/lb than if you were to keep buying 2lb jugs.
 Best medium grade protein powder out there on a $ per g protein basis. Also tastes good in chocolate and the 5lb size in the one to get.
 When i opened up my protein it was unsealed. Don't think i can try it if it wasn't sealed.
 Excellent protein choice!  Less sugar.  More of what you need to recover and build.  Excellent product.  Good taste.  Can use with milk or water.  Would definitely recommend.
 Cheap and gets the job done for less calories but doesn't taste the best
 SOme people were saying it would taste bad. It is not true, I bought it and it tastes good! YES!
 Great taste. Mixes well
 I prefer other brands, but this was good.
 10/10 it's okay
 It's protein that tastes good and mixes well. You can't beat it.
 Just ok
 tastes so good and is super effective.
 Use this twice a day, very good product... best I've used so far....
 I've purchased this in the past and was pleased. The formula has definitely changed, I can't even stomach the smell of this new stuff, I've tried to choke it down a few times with water and even milk. Gross.
 This flavor is alot sweeter than the Double Rich chocolate. I only mix it with water! I have two shakes a day, one with creatine post workout and one by itself as a snack. I have gained noticeably more muscle. Love it!
 I love this protein. It is great quality protein at a relatively cheap price. I Haven't bought any other type of protein for over three years. I finally decided to buy online because I purchased prime. I bought the mocha cappuccino flavor as my first new flavor. It is the best flavor of protein that I have ever tasted. I can not wait to try some of ON's other flavors.
 tastes amazing and probably one of the best protein powders.
 imo best protein on  the market
 I cannot believe how good this tastes and how easy it mixes, way better than muscle milk.
 I'm giving this a two star rating because the flavor is absolutely awful.  It tastes like milk and black pepper.  It's not so bad that I can't drink it at all but I'm definitely never buying this flavor again.  Other flavors I've bought are milk chocolate and rocky road and both of these flavors are just fine. I would not recommend this flavor to anyone.
 It is good and tastes good. For anyone new to the lifting regiment, this will definitely help you bulk up as long as you stay committed to lifting. However, It did give me some stomach problems the first week I used it, but those all went away and I ended up putting on 15 lbs of solid muscle in just 2 months.
 Love the taste
 A decent quality protein powder.  Excellent value.
 Just a big ol bag of whey
 This is a review for the Rocky Road flavor. I ordered a 2-lb tub in case I didn't like it and didn't want to end up stuck with a 5-lb tub. Now I wish I had bought the 5-lb tub! I am basically a gym rat, I lift weights and do cardio about 4 days a week and I find it hard to eat 150+ grams of protein per day, so I supplement with whey. I've tried a variety of brands and a gym friend mentioned this one to me. I'm a huge choco-holic and usually go for the chocolate protein anyway, but this Rocky Road is great! I can actually taste marshmallows in there and the chocolate flavor is fantastic. The texture is nice, creamy, and thick, but not super frothy like some whey protein I've had. I made a shake with this today and used unsweetened almond milk and threw in some Arctic Zero in chocolate flavor... this was the BEST chocolate milk shake, and I almost felt guilty, like it was desert rather than a protein shake! Anyway, 5 stars for the product; I think I've found my new favorite protein!
 Works well. Tastes great, mixes great and this is the second one purchased.
 Good Product
 very good!!
 Picture this: You're 14 years old, and its your first boy scout retreat without your father. The temperatures are low, and the wind gust violently. You and the fellow scouts huddle together for warmth, cowering in a nearby shelter. One of the scoutmasters appears, offering hot chocolate. You cackle with joyous vigor at the idea of sweet sweet warmth. The scout master cautiously hands you the cup of cocoa which, to your dismay, is not hot but warm, perhaps even slightly cool.<br/><br/>Congrats! You now know what the extreme Milk chocolate whey protein from ON tastes like! yes,that's right, cool hot chocolate!<br/><br/>good taste,  good health value, decent price. I've tried many proteins in my days of lifting (around 8 days) and this one sure takes the cake! Although that vanilla one aint bad either. Would recommend
 Possibly my favorite protein and brand.  The double rich chocalate is one of the best flavors I've had and the Amazon price is unbeatable (I think... but I've shopped around, and it's the best I've seen).  GET IT!
 Thick large plastic bags are a pain in the butt. Price per serving you cannot go wrong. I suggest having at least 1 5lbs container and just filling it from the bag. The 5 lbs container is much better for your counters. This is purely for its price.
 I really enjoy the quality products I've ordered from optimum nutrition. Once I've used up other supplements from different companies I currently have. I'll plan to be fully transitioned over to ON's products exclusively. 👍👍
 "Delicious Strawberry" is a stretch. I end up tasting more of the sucralose then I do any strawberry flavor. Would probably not order this flavor again.
 Ordered the Extreme Milk Chocolate. Tastes like A hot Chocolate pack! very delicious!
 I wish it tasted more in line with Beverly Muscle Provider but it's hard to beat the price and honestly I chug it so fast taste isn't a factor really. A ton of protein in each serving.
 Flavor wasn't all that, but everything came sealed and as described.
 i've been using protein powder for the last 8 years and this is by far the most delicious one i've tried. the only downside is that it's high in calories compared to other flavors. but if you're trying to bulk up, that shouldn't be an issue.
 box was opened &amp; only had 5 packets inside :(
 Tastes great and there is a reason this company has received so many awards for this product.
 My opinion it's the best protein powder out there
 I have always liked optimum nutrition products they have the best flavors but the strawberry banana is something else . It's the best protein i have ever tried . 6 stars
 I'm working on gaining some muscle and trying to help my roomate lose weight. So far this is helping us both. I already ordered my second batch.<br/>Mix the powder well with hot water (not steaming!) and then mix with milk for best results.
 Great flavor, mixes well, tastes like a Thin Mint Girl Scout cookie (not as good though, obviously). I like my shakes thick but this one was always too thin and it's a smidge chalky. Love it in coffee!
 Top notch ingredients and great tasting too. This is a very good option for your protein needs at a good price. I will continue to order this product.
 Sadly this product indeed contains Sucralose, which was not stated in product information.
 Best protein on the market! Mixes well, tastes great, and doesn't make me bloat@!
 great taste. love the container.
 Nuff said.
 O.N. whey protein has worked the best for my high metabolism as far as gaining/retaining weight. I use it primarily after workouts as a calorie booster.<br/><br/>The only thing I dislike about this powder, is I can never seem to get it to fully dissolve. Not a huge problem, but it's something that bugs me about most protein powders.
 Great product. I have been buying the stuff for years. Taste is great!
 He really seems to like it. The size he gets last quite a long time.
 Tastes SOOOOO good! Its like dessert in a cup! i'll never buy another brand again!
 It tastes so bad. This is the worest double chocolate protein i have ever tasted.<br/>I tried to contact Amazon for refund but they said it is not possible.
 Got this for the same price as all of the supplement websites but without the shipping.  My friends all use BodyBuilding.com and were telling me there's no way anyone had it cheaper, and they were right, except they didn't think about the shipping costs...
 Taste like rocky road
 This has been my go to protein for a long time. The price and quality are on point. This mixes extremely well and I do enjoy the chocolate flavor.
 Chocolate/Coconut flavor is tasty. 24g of protein is a good amount for the scoop size and it includes 5g of BCAAs. It dissolves really well even in cold milk. I look forward to my recovery shake every morning!
 Absolutely the best protein I've ever had. A great substitute for anything you'd use cream and sugar in. Smooth, not chalky and the vanilla doesn't taste "chemical-y". I use it to make pancakes too. Everyone I turned on to it have either re-ordered or plan to.
 We order this frequently and think it's great.
 This is my favorite protein (I like to call it BROOOOTEEEEIIINNNNN). They have an awesome amount of variety for flavors, and it mixes well with skim milk. 18 inch arms checking in confirming this stuff is great. Will always buy Optimum Nutrition.
 Milk chocolate is sooo goood!
 Love this stuff. Has a nice taste so I look forward to drinking it after my workouts. Clean whey without all the fillers. Highly recommended. I was choosing between this and nitrotech and syntha 6 and this one came out on top.
 Received right away and the flavor is awesome.  This is the best protein out there!  Product was exactly as advertised and you cant beat the price!!  Thank you will order again soon!!!
 Mix it with milk, and boom you've got chocolate milk! It's probably one of the best tasting proteins I've found.
 Excellent taste and good protein compared to many others.
 Tastes pretty good.
 The new formula is terrible. Bad consistency.. just like drinking water, and personally makes me nauseous.. I used to love this stuff, now it’s trash.
 I use this protein on a daily basis. I like the taste and I seem to absorb the protein better than other brands. It helps in recovery and mixes easy. I would recommend it.
 Has an awful aftertaste. Eh. Pay more for better quality.
 I have been taking this product for about 2 years now and will continue to use this post workouts for the foreseeable future.
 Great taste (Vanilla Ice Cream). It taste and mixes well in both milk and water. I also use it in plain yogurt and it adds a great vanilla taste.
 There really isn't anything bad to say about the quality of ON protein.  They are ranked one of the best for a reason.  As for the 10lber, I must admit, Double Rich Chocolate does get boring after a while.  But then again, I'm not into chocolate all that much.  It was the only one I could get a good deal on.  But if you like chocolate, this is good.<br/><br/>As for Amazon, I must commend them for their super fast ridiculous shipping.  I ordered this on 9/14 late afternoon PST and it arrived early in the morning on 9/16.  This is with the free super saver shipping.  I was expecting it to come the very next week but it came so fast!  Keep it up Amazon!
 Delicious. This is a nice change from boring flavors like chocolate. I will say that this only holds true when mixed with milk. Here is a quick ranking:<br/><br/>1. Cake Batter w/ milk<br/>2. All the other flavors<br/>3. A trip to the dentist<br/>4. Cake Batter w/ water<br/><br/>Also I've put on 10 pounds in 2 months of working out with this whey after being 160lbs for as long as I can remember.
 It's protein so you know what to expect.  It taste good with water and awesome with milk.  Definitely buy again. Taste rocks!  I've tried several others that are very foamy, this one isn't.  Love it!
 With free shipping (and it was quick) cant beat this protein for the price.
 Literally the gold standard in protein. Great taste, great product. I use it religiously
 I like it
 I'm not a big critic of taste.. but this whey powder does mix very well.
 I haven't found too many whey products that didn't taste horrible...but this one taste pretty good.
 I Bought Double Rich Chocolate.  I have had Strawberry and Chocolate Mint as well and they are also very good.  Double Rich Chocolate is my favorite out of the 3 flavors I've had. This protein is great in that it's low in fat and carbs.  My trainer has me buy this brand.
 5 stars! Don't ever change the recipe for mocha cappuccino and I'll be a customer for life. Been buying this for years, very satisfied with this product.
 I figured most of you probably know the benefits ON's whey protein, and probably have done the research and read reviews on body building sites, so I won't talk about the protein itself. I'll review the flavors I have tried.<br/><br/>Vanilla - 4/5: Not bad, just plain old vanilla like you would expect. I got this so I can get a relatively neutral flavor to blend with other ingredients when making a smoothie.<br/>Double Rich Chocolate - 4/5: Tastes pretty good, but I'm not a huge fan of chocolatey drinks.<br/>Coffee - 5/5: My favorite flavor so far. I want to try as many flavors as I can, but I may have to keep getting coffee from now on. Tastes pretty close to the coffee flavor in coffee ice cream.<br/><br/>I'll update this as I try more flavors.
 Love this stuff, blends well and taste great. My favorite is the coffee flavor and mixing it with iced coffee as a pre-workout shake.
 Wast money dont buy
 Love the strawberry &amp; banana! Mixes very good with Almond milk. I will continue to buy this flavor.
 There's a reason why it's the Gold Standard. Mix-ability and taste is second to none. It also mixes well in most baking situations.
 Started a workout/diet program with wife.  Add this to our all fruit smoothies.  Great taste and price
 I have used Optimum Nutrition supplements for years.  All I can say is that this is an excellent blend.  The extreme milk chocolate flavour is my favourite.  Perfect for post-workout shakes when you need protein fast.  I really can't recommend this one highly enough.
 Great tasting and I love the results after I drink a glass. I use this product after I work out and it makes me feel good and gain my energy back.
 Great product
 optimum nutritions protein is the best, has a good blend, fast shipping, only 24 grams per serving which is somewhat dissapointing but the amino acids in the protein are top of the line
 This is our 3rd reorder of this product! Great flavor and mixes well with just water or in a shake.
 There was no freshness deal.  It had been removed.  I have no idea what is in this container.
 I use this to recover after workouts and as a protein supplement.  It really helps me recover after a workout where I am wasted.  I like the taste and the ease of preparation...although my wif does not like the taste.
 Nutrition value is ok.  Taste is 5/10.  I got this product for its value.  I am used to using ISOPURE which comapred to this is great!  I dont plan on buying this again.  I will be sticking with my ISOPURE from now on.  GOod for its value if your on a budget.
 The protein to calorie ratio with this is better than I have seen for any other protein powder. It also tastes great. It isn't too sweet like some of them are.
 I used to buy ON Gold Standard Whey regularly until two years ago, so I didn't check the reviews.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!  It is not the same, they changed the formula and it tastes like it spoiled.
 Works for me ! Taste great in my smoothies
 My husband loves it I buy it for hom
 Getting pumped!!
 No scoop came with it. All the directions and serving size say one scoop. It would be nice to know how much is a scoop if no scoop is included.
 Strawberry is my favorite flavor now.<br/><br/>I've had (from best tasting to crappiest tasting):<br/>milk chocolate<br/>banana<br/>white chocolate<br/>vanilla<br/>Rocky Road
 It taste good with milk and with water. No clumps and mixed well in the shaker cups.
 My husband says "I got super jacked in 2 days" and that it is just like drinking a chocolate milkshake. He adds "this stuff is liquid muscle".
 High quality protein for a fair price. Tastes about as good as you'd expect. Doesn't mix well when using a spoon, but mixes fine with other options. (blender / mixer ball thing)
 Great value, great drink. Milk or water, this is the first protein shake I've actually WANTED to drink<br/>--Rocky Road flavor
 A+
 Might be one of the best protein powders I've tried. Helps a lot with my daily protein intake!
 Clean, pure, no additives or junk. Other companies have random non-protein ingredients that they play off as added value.  It's not, it's filler.  Optimum Nutrition keeps it proper.  The banana cream is delicious with milk, water, or in oatmeal. I won't buy protein from any other producer.
 The best protein on the market this is a no brainier when it comes to buying powders. Quick fast release and lots of aminos! Saw great results with this.
 It okay, kinda chaulky!
 I just started lifting and all my friends who lift have always complained about how bad protein powder tastes with just water and that they need milk to make it taste better.  I'm casein intolerant (it's in milk but not in whey powder), so I can't mix it with milk.  But this stuff tastes really great just mixed with water, at least the chocolate malt flavor.  I bought a shaker bottle which makes it super easy to prep after a workout.<br/>As for physical results, I don't know because I just started.  But my taste buds are happy :))
 Gold Standard lives up to the hype. This protein powder is jam-packed with enough energy to fuel even the busiest of lives! Plus, the French Vanilla Creme flavor pairs really nicely with spinach-based green smoothies, and makes it that much easier to stomach vegetables. Looking forward to trying a new flavor when this one's used up.
 Best taste, best consistency when mixed, no lumps.  Even works great in recipes, like homemade protein bars.  And no digestive issues (i.e., gas or the runs, which has happened with lesser protein powders).
 Very good.
 Excellent quality, taste, quality and solubility.
 I chose flavor of Coffee, test good for me. Strongly suggest this.
 Taste sucks with water. Might taste better with milk, I haven't tried it.
 When a rest day isn't enough to get my muscles ready to go again I start drinking this after runs. Also makes a great breakfast on the fly.
 Wanted to increase my calorie and this most definitely help with that. Love taking this as a post workout.
 I use this protein powder before my workouts.  Great product!
 I love it!
 Although I haven't tried too many other brands of protein, I can assure you that Gold Standard is god stuff!  It is a little pricey, but I can't complain with the results that I've experienced!  Highly recommended!
 I use ON's chocolate and vanilla all the time and love them, this one sucks though. I thought it was disgusting, the ingredient list is way different from the other two I mentioned as well
 Getting great gains. Tastes fine and mixes well. Five stars.
 Good price and good product. Low carb protein powder. Legit ingredients. Compare for yourself.
 Great stuff. As usual, Optimum Nutrition delivers a great product with the best specs. Easily dissolves in water and tastes great. I'm on my third 5 pound jar and wish it was an Amazon Subscribe and Save item.
 Second time using this product. Last flavor was Choc Malt.  I work out 4 to 5 times a week along with bicycling.<br/><br/>Easy to mix, great taste, and overall great product.  I am on my second tub, this time I tried the double choc. I love it. However I wouldn't us it as a meal replacement. If you choose to use this shake as a meal replacement, mix in peanut butter or oat meal for the added calories. If your not sure if this protein is right for you get the 2 pound and try it, you wont regret it.<br/><br/>Great in water or milk.
 Love this protein. Doesn't hurt my stomach and tastes great.
 This was too sweet for my taste buds &amp; too artificial.  Prefer the plain vanilla &amp; strawberry
 Great general protein and so much for the value
 I have purchased other Optimum Nutrition products but never in the 10 lb. Wouldn't you know the first 10lb bag we order is awful tasting. Oh well, when it is gone will most diffidently go back to the other flavors in the smaller amount since they are not offered in the 10lb bag.
 22 yr old female coffee drinker (dark roast with cream) and working out five days a week.... THE COFFEE FLAVOR IS AMAZING!! Tastes like a weak iced coffee in water and like a mocha capuchino blended with banana and almond milk. Delicious!!!! But please... do not put the whey in your coffee thinking it is good as creamer... lol No
 Excellent taste. Perfect price for the quantity!
 Smooth taste. Very light chocolate flavor. Mixes well with milk or water.
 This is the best-tasting protein powder we have found.  We will continue to order it!
 This has been my favorite protein for over a year and this is my favorite flavor.  Mixes well and a great value for the price.<br/>I mix it with milk and it makes a great breakfast on the go or after the gym.
 It may just be a matter of preference but I did not like the taste at all. Don't know what they use for sweetener.
 I loved ON, but the most recent bag I bought tastes NOTHING like what it should, and I've been buying the same flavor for years. The strange new taste alarmed me, but what was more notable was that I've been losing gains out of nowhere, and I'm talking 5-10 pounds lost QUICKLY. This was the only change to my routine. I switched to a garbage drug store protein to see if I'd gain with that, and sure enough it worked, and I'm back on track. Clearly this bag was nothing but some artificial trash that isn't even protein anymore. I don't know if this particular seller is scamming people with a counterfeit ON, if ON changed a formula or if there was a factory mistake, but this isn't gold standard anymore.
 I hate protein shakes cause they always clump up and taste terrible. This is actually decent tasting and mixes 100%.
 Delicious. Used this for years. High quality protein that always mixes smooth. I recommend mixing one scoop in 8oz of milk. Use it in food recipes as well.
 Mixes easily, even with water, milk or almond milk. Tastes better than expected. Arrived on time. Pretty pleased with this product and will order again.
 I've been using this brand for a year now and don't have any complaints. Excellent source of protein and delicious going down.
 Love this stuff.  What I like the most is that it's 20 grams per scoop.  A lot of protein powders are 20 for two scoops so this stuff lasts a lot longer.  The taste is great too.
 Good price for the amount<br/>Good protein
 I love ON products, gave it a 3 because I don’t like the flavor as much as other options.
 I've been using this for years. Tried many others over the years but once I tried this brand and flavor I loved it. Dissolves in cold water easily, tastes great, has adequate amounts of proteins, BCAAs and other nutrients, etc. I am sure there are other more expensive formulas out there that can do all this, but for this price this is excellent. Also, I know it works, based on my growth curve when I am seriously gyming. My flavor is Vanilla Ice Cream. Never tried any other though. Kinda afraid to shell out big bucks on another flavor and end up not liking it. So I'll stick with tried and true.
 This by far the best tasting, most mixable protein shake you can get.  We have experimented with vast array at my house, and we always come back to this one.  The vanilla is nice too, but I'm a chocoholic.
 Coffee protein powder in my morning coffee, and I'm good to go. Delicious and surprisingly more versatile than you'd think.<br/><br/>Side note: the cake batter flavor isn't gross, and is great in smoothies. Or in coffee, too. Don't be afraid.
 Alright, I know the headline is corny.<br/><br/>I have been using Optimum Nutrition for awhile and I know the price is scary but if you are committed to exercise and getting an increased boost of protein, this is the way to go. Also use the Blender Bottle, see my review there too.
 has such a bad aftertaste
 Tastes good, nice and thick.<br/><br/>I drink this instead of eating garbage when I have a sweet tooth.
 The shipping took longer than what was expected I recieved the shaker before the protein which was sad but finally it came.  Great size, fits perfectly in my work cubby hole.  For what the box had gone through I am quite impressed the jug of protein even survived.  The flavor is exquisite and I will be buying this product again.
 Has consistently provided:<br/>- good performance(protein per dollar spent)<br/>- good taste(taste is consistent between batches)<br/>- reasonable price(sometimes the price goes up for a few weeks, but it always comes back down)<br/><br/>This is by far my favorite ON whey flavor.
 Great taste. Maybe the best protein on the market
 Flavor is pretty bland, I prefer the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor.
 I bought this for my boyfriend. I think he's bought the same thing before but in a different flavor. He opened up the container and tried and said "wow, this is amazing."
 Delicious, dissolves easily in a shaker bottle. It's very sweet, so it's perfect to mix in water, but milk will make it sweeter so be prepared if you plan to do that. Personally I think it's fine either way.
 For the price, there is not a better Whey protein. Period. Tastes great, easy to mix, doesn't clump bad, and ON means high quality. Less sugar/carb than many alternatives.
 Have tried many different brands of protein, and this is my first flavor of this brand, and obviously it has outstanding reviews and I now know why, not only does the product work amazing, you honestly cannot taste the protein it's that good. I recommend mixing with milk rather than water but you do you!
 Tastes good. I really like it.
 Tastes good. Feel full.
 It was opened already. Not sure if it was a mistake. There was no spoon either in it. Other than that, the banana flavour isn't bad at all.
 Great product!!!!!...I like the fact that it is not soaked with unnecessary sugars and fillers unlike other products out there...  Only 1 gram of sugar per serving and it taste great...
 Good stuff, pricing good compared to GNC store
 best protein powder ive ever tried!  great chocolately taste and not that powdery taste!  i love it and wish i could afford this more often!
 Excellent! Great value, great (well as great as these things get) taste, mixes well. Was buying protein powder from Target but decide to try this for a change. A decided improvement in all departments. Doesn't have a strong "artificial sweetener" taste.
 This is one of the best tasting protein powders I've come across.  All my friends are jealous, and a couple have tried to trade me their tub for mine.  I haven't tried the other flavors, but I'm sure they are good as well.
 Thanks to this product, I'm finally gaining weight.  After weighing the same for, oh, 10 years, this product has helped me achieve some gains.  I've noticed muscle improvements as well, though other reviewers will do a much better and much more informed job of educating you on the specifics of that.<br/><br/>It tastes fine, too.
 Maybe, im not putting alot of it or putting too much water but I did the exact same thing with the Chocolate Coconut and I could still taste that.
 I'm happy with it.
 Great product! Will be reordering this when it runs out.
 Simply the best. I have been a fan for years, happy I can buy it on Amazon for a great price.
 This is what I've used for years...Mixes easily and although there are better tasting products out there this is the best bang for your buck.
 Always love gold standard protein powder, can't loose with this stuff.
 Tastes great!!
 Definitely my favorite. I do a scoop every morning and the taste is still great.
 perfect ... the best
 Great tasting powdered
 In my opinion, this is the highest-quality protein for your dollar.  It doesn't upset my stomach, comes with 70ish servings, and I feel noticeably less sore for shorter periods of time after working out.
 I love this protein powder. I have tried chocolate, vanilla, and rocky road and they all taste great! The rocky road is my favorite. All are easy to just mix in milk in a shaker bottle. The powder completely dissolves and no gritty aftertaste!
 I have tried various proteins and this one is been by far the best of all I’m no mega nutritionist but I’ve gotten the best result from this one would recommend to everyone
 Loving the flavor and how well it mixes.
 Very good tasting protein that mixes well and isn't too hard on the wallet. I've yet to have clumps or lumps in my shake and can't complain about the taste at all. Might not be the absolute best tasting protein out there but for the price it will do very nicely.
 Absolutely delicious! I mixed this with 2 cups of almond milk, and it tasted exactly like chocolate milk. It blended easily without lumps, and it had a natural, non-pasty, chocolate flavor.
 This is great and perhaps I would say the best protein and bang for your buck. But the only problem is that an ingredient within this product messes my stomach up and gives me...well it's to gross to say... It liquifies "waste components" of mine
 great product!!
 excellent value
 ON Whey has been pretty consistently rated as one of the most popular brands out there for whey protein.  There's no issue with unnecessary fillers you'll find in other brands.  Regarding its usefulness, it's on the low end for carbs/fat, so it's a great option for those trying to cut weight, as it won't add many extra calories to your day.  For those trying to gain as fast as possible, there may be better options out there with additional carbs, but ON still stands as a great option for very pure and fast-absorbing protein.
 Excelente !!!
 A must have breakfast protein shake.
 Since I have no idea if this is any more or less effective than any other protein supplement all I can do is comment on my experience drinking it.<br/><br/>If you intend to mix this with fruits this is not the supplement for you as the flavoring is very strong. However, if you intend to mix this with peanut butter or other hard to mask flavors in your smoothies, this may work.
 A little pricier than other options, but I have found it's flavor and dissolvability superior
 The best protein powder I've tried.  Would definitely recommend it.
 I bought this product on the recommendation of a friend, and I have to say Yum!  Much better than some protein powders, less of an aftertaste in my BulletProof Coffee.
 My boyfriend reorders this over and over.  He really likes the chocolate flavor and the price on amazon is great for the 5 pound tub.  Definitley worth the money and we love that it ships free with prime!
 the best will buy again thanks for being honest seller
 Excelente
 It's whey protein O_o
 B aught for myself good price excellent protein powder i have no con plaints taste nice and chocolatey super fast shipping
 Hands down the best whey protein on the market. Why? I'll tell you. Yes, it's a little pricey. But a few things in life are actually worth the money. Manhattan rental property? No way. Diamonds? Yeah right. Sex? Probably not, but I won't judge. Optimum Nutrition Whey Protein? Absolutely.<br/><br/>I judge whey protein (and pretty much all supplements) on a few categories. Ingredients (and quality thereof), mixability (yeah I made that a word), and taste. This stuff is 10/10 in all categories. Just look at the nutrition facts yourself. No fluff in there. Excellent protein to fat ratio. This stuff is legit. The mixability (get used to it, it's a word) is second to none as far as I'm concerned. Water, milk, almond milk, whatever. Mixes smooth all the same. And taste? Fantastic. Even their fancypants flavors like cake batter are amazing, even though I'm partial to good old fashioned vanilla or chocolate. Can't go wrong with the classics.<br/><br/>In short, this stuff is as advertised: the Gold Standard in whey protein. Absolutely worth the money. You will not be disappointed.
 Great tasting! But, very pricey
 I'm a VERY picky eater! Just ask my girlfriend, family and friends :-)<br/>Yet I must say that this is is a good drink! That is if you like chocolate. Mix one cup of the powder (very fine) along with 8 oz of milk (skim, etc.) and it taste even better than chocolate milk!  The secret is to mix it up REAL good!  I mean for minute, or if you have a mixer or blender that's even better. But I usually (for time reasons) mix it after breakfast with a spoon then drink it up.<br/><br/>The price has gone up since a year ago.  However I think that's because it's gone up everywhere else as well.  However with having it shipped free to your house and no tax (through Amazon), you don't have to go wrong!  No lugging it home in a huge bag/box, just order and have it delivered to your door free!
 Have been using this product for many years and will continue to do so.
 This is some great tasting protein that mixes very well. I use it with water or milk and it always tastes good.  Has BCAA (Branch Chain Amino Acids) added in unlike some other proteins. Very happy overall and am on my 5th bottle. I find Double Chocolate too be the best flavor. Hated the Vanilla Ice Cream. Plain vanilla and strawberry flavors were pretty decent too.
 Very good
 great taste, great quality and good results. this is my 3rd batch and its yet to disappoint me. promptly after working out and before going to bed yielded best results for me. cheers
 Agree with the other reviews - new formulation tastes noticble worse than the previous. I think the product has gone from noticibly above average in taste to on-par or even below others in taste.
 Love this stuff for building muscle.  It tastes good a protein powders go and it mixes well.  Very economical in the 10lb bag.  Just keep your 5-lb jug and keep refilling it.
 Great! taste good and no issues like with cheaper products
 If you like the taste of coffee with cream or just instant coffee this is AMAZING.  Add some milk and it tastes like a cappuccino.  Nutrition wise, ON is always on point.
 there are enough reviews on this stuff out there, ON is always a good choice
 Look at Isopro Plus. Costs more but no sugar and more protein.
 I have to say ON is well known and it does what it states. The chocolate mint flavor tastes great! I don't even like chocolate lol. 5lbs lasted about 2 months for me as I worked out about 4 days a week and had almost 3 servings per day. I highly recommend Optimum Nutrition for any health supplements.
 It tastes better than expected, I'm buying more for sure.
 Just stick with chocolate, don't go for fruity flavors. You think it sounds good but... just save yourself the trouble and stick with what you know.
 The strong chocolate tase and smell go away rather quickly when the quantity I ordered is supposed to last me more than a month.
 I ordered this when I decided to get back in shape this summer. Mixes well in water or milk. Flavor is very good. Not chalky or gritty like some brands. Too soon to know the results.
 We've tried several different brands and flavors for whey protein powder, and the Extreme Milk Chocolate by Gold Standard is by far the best tasting.  My kids LOVE when I make a shake with Publix low fat frozen yogurt, milk and one scoop of this delicious protein boost.  This is their favorite quick breakfast during the school week.
 Tastes good, but unfortunately it contains High Fructose Corn Syrup.  Something we definitely want to avoid.
 Purchased this whey protein in the past,<br/>New and improved formula.  A five pound container is 70 scoops. I would recommend buying this product.
 Most delicious and well-mixing protein powder I’ve ever used. You’re basically drinking chocolate milk, and who doesn’t like chocolate milk?
 product is great
 Mocha cappuccino tastes great, low carbs, and mixes really well in water or milk.  I've been mixing mine in a combination of milk and coconut water.  Perfect for breakfast in the morning.  Will purchase this brand again.
 I must have received a bad batch I have previously purchased and the taste was awesome however this leaves an  aftertaste and no chocolate flavor.
 Good flavor. Dissolves well. Arrived promptly. Only downside is the high price.
 always order it
 GOOD
 This is by far the best protein shake! The taste,the ingredients, and the price. It's best with 1 frozen banana, 2 tspns of peanut butter and  8oz.unsweetened almond milk. And some crushed ice!! Just love this product. Always use a blender no matter your mixture.
 I love this stuff! It's one of the better proteins I've tried. Most leave a weird aftertaste and chalky but this one doesn't. It is very smooth. I can't wait to try the other flavors.
 I like to mix it with vanilla almond milk (sweetened or unsweetened, it doesn't matter) and it tastes soooo good, this mocha cappuccino is the best, and it provides results. I like to drink it within 30min after weight lifting or running and it helps muscle soreness and recovery! love it!
 Great taste.  I mix it with almond milk and it makes a wonderful protein shake
 Ok
 Tried and true.
 I am trying to lose the last 10 lbs and this protein mix is a big help.  I mix it with unsweetened, vanilla almond milk to make a shake - satisfies for several hours.  I love the low carbs and good protein it provides.
 It doesn’t have a chalky taste and one serving is only one scoop, unlike most protein powders that are two scoops.
 This protein powder is amazing!!! The taste is amazing, the texture is perfect, and over all it's just really good stuff.
 The best you can get!  I swear by this product line.  Good quality protein powder without the fluff some companies add.  Low carb and tastes great.  Mixes well in warm or cold water.
 Tastes pretty good, no crappy aftertaste that you might get with like cookies and cream 9/10
 Great price and coffee is the best taste
 Have used this particular brand and flavor of whey protein for several years.  Dissolves well in liquid and the chocolate is the best flavor, in fact the only flavor that I actually enjoy and don't have to simply tolerate.  I cannot say that for other brands' chocolate.
 I use this protein powder every morning in my smoothies.  It has a great texture and blends well.  When I'm in a hurry, I mix it in a shaker cup with just OJ, and it still tastes great.  I've used other protein powder that left a strange texture in my mouth, but this one does not.
 My son uses this everyday. Works well. No danger or side effects!
 Taste great. High quality. Didn't expect anything less from ON.
 It's nice and tastes good!
 Love the taste. Is it wierd that the seal on the white cover came off when I spun off the lid? The last couple I've bought, the seal didn't really seem like a seal, more like just a cover under the lid. Wasn't worried about it since he plastic wrap around the cover was in place and not tampered with.
 Worked pretty good for me!
 Very pleased with this product . Has very good taste.
 Have been buying the OP Whey for quite a while now. Mix with a bit of whole milk and water<br/>and taste is really very good.
 The best.
 always get it
 Great product. Receiving great gains, while building  lean muscle.
 good value.  may as well get the big size and save money.  less expensive than other big box store.<br/>great flavor.  useful in many recipes.
 Some of the best tasting protein out there.<br/><br/>The powder is also very soluble and doesn't leave chunks after some reasonable mixing.<br/><br/>My go to Protein supplement.
 Whey protein supplements are the most effective way to help you get muscles.
 Good quality, really effective. I recommend y'all to use it and you'll see the change in a few.
 This is a great product! In my opinion, it's one of the best out there! The ONLY reason I didn't give it five stars was because the strawberry flavor wasn't as strong as I would like it to be.
 I do not care for the chocolate malt flavor
 I've tried a lot of whey powders, and Optimum Nutrition 100% Gold Standard ranks among the top in it's price range. When considering how many flavors they offer, I think it's fair to say they might possibly be the best for this price range. It's hard to say, since I haven't tried every whey out there.<br/><br/>I typically mix my whey in water. The flavors that taste like bakery goods, or chocolate aren't the best in water, however, the fruity flavors are excellent. Banana Cream is my favorite, however, Tropical Punch and Delicious Strawberry were excellent as well. These also go great in coffee. I like them more than Coffee Mate-like products.<br/><br/>The chocolaty or bakery-good type wheys I've tried have all been great in milk. I haven't had a chance to try many of them though. Of the once I've tried, Chocolate Malt was the one I enjoyed the most.<br/><br/>If Optimum Nutrition sold sample packs of all their flavors, I would rate them all, however, as it is now, I can only review what I can afford. But from what I have tried, I don't think you can go wrong with Optimum Nutrition 100% gold standard. I've been a repeat customer for about a year, and don't foresee that changing.
 Been taking it for a few weeks and I think the taste is OK, i normally just use it to make chocolate milk for a quick 40g of protein after a workout which is pretty nice. Its definitely not NesQuik or anything and it gets chunky even when i try to mix it well but I tried making it into a shake and it was a bit tastier.<br/><br/>Still if your used to that Avg, Whey protein taste this is an amazing source of quick protein and I definitely noticed how easy it is to fill in my requirements for protein.
 As others have said, this isn't necessarily the best stuff on the market.  However I've yet to find something better on paper for value, at least something that isn't heavily reliant on soy.  It's high density of protein (24 grams per protein per roughly 30 gram serving), high levels of essential BCAA, mixes well (I prefer with a shaker but have done it with a spoon), and goes down and digests nicely.  It does have artificial sweeteners, but I'm alright with such things in moderation (but beware if that concerns you).<br/><br/>I've had Natural Chocolate (another product on Amazon), Double Rich Chocolate, Cookies and Cream, Vanilla, and Strawberry.  The Chocolate flavors, Strawberry, and Vanilla are fantastic.  I got Cookies and Cream recently to change things up and honestly, it's too sweet for me.  It goes down nicely enough but I don't enjoy it nearly as much as some other flavors I've tried.
 Great price and product, repeat order.
 My son uses this when he works out. He says the flavor is good.
 Extreme milk chocolate flavor tastes great, which is great when you're drinking this 2x day.  Easy to mix in a blender bottle/shaker, or easy to dissolve in CC or yogurt.  High quality protein from a reliable company.
 I mix the protein powder with my almond milk and a couple of ice cubes in my martini shaker...Smooth consistency and flavor is quite good. The low calories and high grams of protein make this a great product for me.
 Obsessed with the mocha cappuccino! The only protein I'm taking from now on!
 Great stuff
 I workout and I know I need a certain amount of protein each day. But I am not a big meat eater so this helps me get the amount of protein my body needs daily. I am lactose intolerant also and I find this very easy to digest. Taste great too.
 Look no further for your standard whey protein. Excellent product, price, taste. What more could you ask for? I've used this for 2 years and probably will for the rest of my active life.
 been using it for a while now. i love the taste and it helps with my skin. i just dont like how the powder can clump up.
 I mix with a few ounces of almond milk and about 5 coffee ice cubes I pre make and it tastes just like a mocha Frappuccino.
 Enjoy the taste. High in protein with less than a gm of sugar. Only downside Ive experienced is it made me gassy.
 I like the casein better, primarily because of the consistency, but this stuff is good too!
 Tastes great. Can't complain about anything.
 My favorite flavor from my favorite brand. I've been using optimum nutrition gold standard double rich chocolate for 7 years now and have no plans on switching.
 Decent flavor but didn't work for me. Upset stomach.
 One of the best proteins with a great taste
 Switched from a post workout shake of gun powder and fertilizer to ON 100% whey. I feel a lot better and save a lot of money using this protein.
 Unlike the Banana Cream which tasted awful and mixed in EVEN worse the Rocky road tastes pretty good. I think it would taste better cold than at room temperature. It works well to replace the protein that I don't get from meat because meat is too expensive most of the time. It's Protein thought so I wouldn't expect to taste perfect but I would give this a 7/10 in taste and 7/10 in how well it mixes with just plain water.
 it is so sad, because I received the product without security seal, I'm from Venezuela.
 Good. Pretty high in saturated fat compared to others that are similar in ingredients.
 This is scrum-didly-umptious. best flavor I have ever tasted.
 My new go to
 Guaranteed two day delivery. The package was delivered at around 4 pm, came home from classes, got my protein, I can hit the gym today. Overall very satisfied.
 The closest brand in terms of quality would be Metrx. However the flavor and how well it blends into fluids along with the protein amount makes it the standard for whey in my opinion. You can almost never go wrong with chocolate.
 Great stuff, I mix it with milk and drink a scoop a day. Great supplement for when you need additional protein in your diet.
 So far I've tried 3 flavors of this stuff.  Coffee is my favorite so far.  I have a hard time deciding whether I prefer ON or bsn protein, both are excellent quality and make some really good flavors.  Typically with proteins I stick to the chocolate, coffee or peanut butter flavored varieties.  I hate the fruit flavored stuff.<br/><br/>Coffee - 5 stars!  Tastes exactly like instant coffee with a bit of milk/cream.  Probably the single best tasting protein shake I've had to date.  Without a doubt the best tasting when mixed with water (I HATE using water for most shakes but don't mind with this)<br/><br/>Mochachino - 3.5/5 stars.  It tastes exactly like someone mixed the coffee flavor with the chocolate variety.  Not the best flavor but not the worst either.  Doesn't mask the protein flavor as well as the "coffee" flavored variety.  I don't even see why this exists honestly it's just a worse version of the coffee flavor.  I can't see anybody preferring this over the coffee.<br/><br/>Double chocolate - 2/5 stars.  I think this stuff is foul!  I had trouble choking it down.  It's the worst chocolate flavored protein shake I've ever had by far.  It isn't sweet enough and has just an odd nasty taste to it.  Horrible.  I'm going to try one of their other chocolate varieties next and god I hope it's not this bad!  I give this two stars because even though it's bad it doesn't come close to how bad some of the flavors from other brands I've tried are.  Not good tasting stuff though, I'd avoid this flavor if I were you!
 Tastes great! I've been using this product for a couple of years as a meal replacement for breakfast.
 I have been taking Optimum Nutrition protein powder for a two weeks now and i have never been happier. My goal was to build muscle while going on a low carb diet and this really helped me out since it suppressed my appetite. I take it twice a day with milk, one scoop before my workout and another afterwards. Oh and it tastes great!
 Best on the market.
 My FAV protein on the market today. It's not filled with crap! Barley any carbs! Straight protein. Which is what matters! THESE GUYS HAVE IT RIGHT! Mixes SO easily. Worth every penny.
 Doesn't mix very good unless you use a blender
 OK seriously, the banana flavor is disgusting and the powder have that cake feeling to it.<br/>i tried one scope and i couldn't drink it all, it have that after taste in your stomach and throat. i felt like throwing up.<br/>i have always bought ON products, and this is the first time i'm not satisfied with it.
 I LOVE the normal flavors, but beware of the more flavorful types. Cookies and Cream has like 6 less total servings that double rich chocolate.
 Great protein and high quality product. The price can't be beat for sure
 a
 best protein in market
 This has always been one of my favorite proteins to buy when the price is right...and buying on amazon the price was definitely right.  I'm interested in trying some other flavors but Chocolate always seems to work best for my shakes.
 The best Whey Protein supplement, for good pricing and value.  Buy the 5lb can.  Many great flavors to pick from.
 Great product.  Tastes pretty good when mixed with just water which is saying a lot.  Mixes perfectly with a shaker bottle.
 Almost perfect, stopped using it because it has added sugar in the formula.
 Best protein around. Repeat buyer of this product
 Great stuff
 I don't need to write about how good ON's quality is. But I do want to mention that this flavor is amazing. When mixed with milk, it literally tastes like a chocolate milkshake; there's no taste of protein. It's delicious. I even drink it when I'm having sweet cravings.
 This actually made a milkshake I made taste better when added.
 Mixes great with water or milk. Best tasting protein powder I've had so far. Well worth a few extra dollars for a quality, great tasting protein.
 Great Product; above average taste; mixes well with water. Does the trick for rebuilding muscle.  Above average profile and value for the cost.
 If you don't know what flavor to choose get the Extreme milk chocolate! You cannot go wrong with it. It is delicious! I use it with whole milk it tastes very good! Buying another one same flavor. I use this product to help me gain weight so far ive gained 20 pounds in 5 weeks. One scoop with milk comes out to be 270 calories with 32 grams of protein so it is pretty good on that end.
 ok
 Great source of protein to drink 1 hr. before going to the gym. It gives us a bit more energy and we don't get hungry as quickly while working out.This is our favorite flavor to drink.
 Great product. Always trust everything from optimum nutrition. 4 stars because double rich chocolate isn't my favorite. Would recommend cookies and cream. Tastes amazing. All of them mix extremely well and are one of the best proteins out there. You're way better off spending a little extra getting a good quality protein than a cheap tub at Walmart.
 Love this product. Taste great.
 I use this stuff nearly daily.  Tastes good and has great results.
 Excellent whey protein I take 1-2 scoops in my pre/post workout shakes. Mixes fairly well with water no clumps at the bottom best to use with a shaker bottle still than just mixing with a spoon.
 It’s the standard for a reason
 Everyone loves Optimum Nutrition. They've always been a solid supplier of all things sport nutrition. This protein powder is a staple that anyone should have. It tastes great, mixes well, and does its job. What more do you need to know?
 Tastes great in my coffee every morning. A scoop of ON Whey, a scoop of ON Casein, half cup of heavy cream in a large coffee, and even a coffee hater (I used to be) will love it.
 Got the Rocky Road.  Really like it, really sweet, I only use one scoop for 16 oz
 The flavor is fine to me. Now I am waiting to see my muscles bump up.
 I was impressed with how easy this mixes, no clumping or dry chunks. Rocky Road flavor is good, just a bit too sweet- Otherwise this is a great protein, I will purchase this brand again.
 Optimum nutrition protein tastes great
 The product came very quickly, about 3-4 days, and didn't have any problems. As for the protein itself, it definitely has a rich, pure chocolate taste. In water, it's not very sweet, but still has a rich chocolate taste. In milk, it's a little sweeter/tastes better, but still has a strong chocolate taste. I guess rich chocolate just isn't a flavor that's for me, but it's not so bad that I don't want to drink the shakes. Also, the powder mixes ok with a spoon- there's usually a few small clumps of protein left. However, if you blend it, no clumps.
 The chocolate malt tastes a lot better than the double rich chocolate.
 I ONLY ever right reviews if something is Amazing....or Horrible....This is by far the smoothest Whey I have ever tasted. Most Whey protein I have used in the past (like GNC Pro Amplified Whey Protein which I used to use) gives you a very chalky taste....and this really lived up to the Gold Standard name.<br/><br/>Will DEFINITELY purchase again.
 I have tried a few different types of whey protein and this is one of the best out there. The cookies and cream flavor taste great with milk and when shaken in a shaker the texture is nice and light unlike some heavy and thick protein shakes. After I take lift weights and drink the shake, I feel the protein getting to work. I highly recommend this product.
 My son who just dead lifted 500# (at 19 years ol swear by this.  Good flavor and high protein.  Great value compared to GNC products.
 The flavor is just excellent.  I mix 1 scoop with about 8 ounces of milk, then dump in a couple teaspoons of coffee grounds, then shake it up really well in my blender bottle.  Starbux esque with plenty of great protein to boot.
 Great deal, taste great
 Mocha Capuccino is the one to get
 tastes good, have bought this before.
 Flavors are always fantastic. They never have that powdery, nasty medicinal taste. Dissolves great. lots of yum yum protein!!
 Highly recommended. This is my go-to powder for when I need to see results quickly.
 Tastes great and great value for grams of protein per dollar spent.
 One of the best protein supplements available for almost literally the lowest price out there.  Add great shipping and service from Amazon, and you get the best possible deal for this product.
 this is the best of the best.. i love this one... i would like to live in a house made of whey
 Great whey protein the only brand we buy. I love the cookies n cream the mocha one is also good.
 Delicious!!
 Great source of protein, and for my nutritional requirements it gets the job done.<br/>The Mocha flavor is somewhere between bland and ok... nothing spectacular.
 The taste was good. It mixes well if you use one of those mixing balls that come with the shaker bottles.
 good product
 the protein to carb ratio is unbeatable. Perfect for maximizing high protein diets.
 Always tastes well and works as intended
 Best Whey out there
 Low in carbs compared to other whey protein this is great for my keto meal plan. Excellent flavor and dissolves well with water or soy milk
 It’s great.
 Tastes Good!!
 Nice protein it mixed and is easy to drink.
 Best flavor ever made
 This is probably the best protein out there with the lowest calories, fats, carbs, and highest protein per scoop.  Before buying on here, you might want to checkout other sites such as bodybuilding.com for a price comparison, might be cheaper some where else.  I feel it was too expensive on here.
 Great taste and great gains! They better get out of my whey at the gym!
 Nice consistency mixed with water. Chocolate mint is a great taste.  Filling.
 Tasted good, helped with my gym workouts.
 I have tried 3 flavored so far and the mint has been the worst of the 3. Still not the worst tasting protien I've tried
 I have tried every brand and blend out there, always come back to this one.
 tastes good, large tub, better than most brands out there in my opinion.
 This is my first tub of Extreme Milk Chocolate. I have had several tubs of the Double Chocolate and this flavor is better in every single way. It has a more natural flavor and doesn't taste stale.<br/><br/>My usual post workout shake is:<br/><br/>1/2 frozen banana<br/>2 ice cubes<br/>2 scoops WHEY extreme milk chocolate<br/>splash of milk<br/><br/>Tastes like a chocolate milkshake!
 Yum!!! This protein shake taste delicious! I got the vanilla cream. It's simple, not too many ingredients. So far so good! I'm buying again :)
 Great flavor and good product.
 This is the first protein powder I've tried that actually tastes good.  I've had no issues with it clumping either.  I will definitely buy this again.
 good nutrition
 Couldn't believe my eyes when I saw this flavor is available.  Missed it the first time I ordered, and went with Delicious Strawberry, which was also great.<br/><br/>Optimum Nutrition is considered the best bang for the buck, and I believe it's the most popular for that reason.  ProteinPowder.net ranked it 3rd behind Syntha-6 and Myotein.  Syntha-6 is almost double the calories, so that wasn't an option, and it also does not have anywhere near the amount of flavors offered.  Myotein is EXTREMELY expensive, and is almost undeniably the best formula there is, but again, the price isn't worth it to me.  I'm not hardcore--I don't even workout.  I just use this stuff to ensure I get my protein, which I've learned is extremely important for everyone, no matter the age.
 The best protein. The very best. It will give you the biggest muscles. Great!
 Love! I’m a Fat kid on the inside...I needed something that’s going to taste delicious and give me protein..  It taste just like strawberry nesquick.
 Good flavor which is important to me, you can read other reviews for the specifics.  All I can say is it works great for me and again the taste is really good.
 This product is way too expensive for the quantity given,quality of product is ofcourse gold standard,taste could be better.
 Tastes nasty.
 A good recovery drink and the delicious strawberry or strawberry banana are the best flavors I believe are available.  Compared to the other flavors, which made me want to vomit, the strawberry protein powder tastes great!
 This is some pretty good stuff. I drink with water and the taste is fine for me. Will probably have to get the malt chocolate for the wife.
 My favorite protein powder. Best price outside of Costco.
 I been taking it for quite a long time now. It works as advertised! Don't expect to reach you fitness goals by just taking the product, at the end of the day it's just a supplement which is intended to help you get to those goals. So get in the gym work hard, take your supplements, eat healthy, sleep well and you will see results. Best tasting one in my opinion is Double Rich Chocolate since I'm a chocolate type guy. If you want to have a more versatile flavor in which you could add different fruits without tasting weird, get vanilla!!! Works great with fruits!!!
 Good taste. Mixes okay. Better than Celllucor.
 Great meal replacement to cut weight. French Vanilla creme is the best flavor!!!
 The ON whey protein shakes are great. I just wanted to leave a review about the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor in particular since a lot of people have been praising it. Its really not that great. Not even good I would say. The strawberry and chocolate flavors are better. I'm going to finish out this tub of Vanilla Ice Cream but I don't think I will be buying this flavor again.
 As a busy PA student, I was looking for the best option for a morning and mid-day protein shake from a trusted company. And I have to say, this is best tasting protein powder I've tried. I was also pleasantly surprised with the price and free same day shipping! I will definitely be purchasing from them again.
 Fast Shipping!<br/><br/>After so many people telling me I need to take protein if I wanna have a good tone up I decided to buy this product. I am a 5'4" 115 pounds woman, hence I was a little skeptical at the beginning but decided to go for it.<br/><br/>First, it tastes very good, I'm gonna try to mix it with fruit in the weekends, I take it right after my workout<br/><br/>Second, It just has 120 calories, I recommend it to every woman, just try to not overdo it. But I totally love it!
 Standard whey protein that we all know and love. Chocolate tastes decent.
 Got this for my brother’s birthday present- definitely a good deal!
 Nice subtle chocolate taste and mixes so well. Cytomax is comparable in price but doesn't taste as good or mix as well.
 The taste is great no real after taste like some whey product.<br/>The value for the product was great , it last a long time. I will never go back to the small containers not worth the money.<br/>I will recommend the to friends.
 I love this stuff. I got the chocolate one and, at first, being used to the sweet muscle milk, it did not taste that great. But after just a little while I've come to love it, it tastes so good and is so much better for you than muscle milk
 Can't go wrong with the vanilla! I'd never recommend using water for any powder but it tastes great with unsweetened almond/coconut milk.
 Bought the item and in came 1) Dented and 2) The seal was broken on the inside before I could do it. Taste is underwhelming
 Favor flavor, honestly good for adding on that extra protein before and after the gym
 Great.
 I was hesitant to purchase protein powder from Amazon after having negative experiences with pre-workout powders bought on here. Previous supplement purchases through Amazon have shown up clumpy, off color, weird taste, etc. This ON Protein powder showed up perfect. Fully sealed, no powder consistency issues at all, and full taste as if it was bought at any major retailer.<br/><br/>I bought Mint Chocolate, which has great flavor if you want to mix it up from the usual chocolate or vanilla. Mixes well by stirring but a blender works best. Depending on how many scoops you use, a 5lb container will last you anywhere between 2 months (1 scoop per serving) to less than a month (2-3 scoops per serving). Optimum has been my go to brand for years.<br/><br/>Quality of powder: 10/10<br/>Taste: 10/10 (Mint chocolate...I have had cookies and cream, vanilla ice cream, french vanilla, and malt chocolate, all great taste)<br/>Nutrition: Low carb, low fat, high protein, low calorie.
 Tastes great, seeing results after 4 weeks of use.
 protein powder makes your muscles big and happy and your farts pretty gassy!
 I've tried about 4 or 5 different types of protein powder along with different flavors. I really like this flavor as it sort of tastes like an almond joy if you blend it with milk. I plan on buying this flavor for as long as it is available.
 loved it~~
 I've been using this protein for several months now and it seems to work well for me. It is low carb and doesn't taste bad (better with skim milk though). I've only tried the double chocolate, so I don't know if the other flavors are good or not. The price is very competitive compared to other brand and non-brand proteins, and the serving size of 24g per serving works well, because you can always double it if you want more, yet 1 scoop plus milk is usually good for a good 32-34g serving.
 Optimum Nutrition has, by far, the best whey protein out right now. With a simple yet effective formula, this whey powder is a crucial factor in getting gains.
 Tastes great!
 Great product
 I was kinda skeptic at first since I hate Vanilla whey, but this flavor definitely did not disappoint.
 Used this product-- frothy, not very sweet. Was effective, but not enjoyable
 It's hard to say how effective the product is so I'll rate everything else. The taste is great. I've only mixed it with fat free milk and it tastes just like chocolate milk. You WILL need a mixer. It claims you don't need one but a spoon won't cut it. Shaking in my Blender Bottle removes all clumps.<br/>The packaging is fine. I'd prefer the plastic bottle with a larger opening. This one tends to close on your hand if you're not careful and you don't want your sweaty mitt touching the inside of the bag. The scoop is fine and sturdy. Buddies have complained about leaving old empty bottles out for a couple days and then smelling like something died in them. 3 days later it still smelled like chocolate milk so that's another plus for the lazy guys like me.
 Good flavor. No wicked aftertaste like other protein shakes.
 Great tasting and great bargain!  I buy the 5lb container and it lasts me almost 3 months!
 I have tried others and this is what I will stick with.  It dissolves easily and tastes great!
 Product is aromatic and tastes great! Took a while to sift through the container with a clean utensil to find the scoop.
 Excellent
 good powder i like
 I want my Cake Cake Cake Cake! Great Flavor and as always with ON's products, you're getting what you pay for, a quality Whey.
 Tastes great less filling
 I keep buying different flavors. Inside white lid was never sealed on 4 different flavors. I will find a new product
 Any of the vanillas make great shakes. Best price i've found.
 Gold Standard really makes a great product. I don't use any other brand. there's a reason that they have received a plethora of awards for their whey. It doesn't contain all of the fillers like other brands. you also get a great value for your dollar because the amount of servings you receive from the container justify the cost by far. I've tried other brands but I constantly find myself coming back to this one time and time again. I highly recommend it.
 Good tasting protein. Mix 2 scoops w 8oz. water, handful of ice cubes, big spoonful of peanut butter, a banana, and a teaspoon of raw sugar for a great shake. Expect to have major gas afterwards.
 It was amazing, I tried vanilla ice cream for a couple months and now I switched to double chocolate and fantastic!
 Good tasting protein, need to cut down on cholesterol in this product though.  You have to buy their considerably more expensive protein to cut down on the cholesterol.
 Tastes awesome.  I had avoided ON for price reasons for years, but finally splurged and tried this, and it is amazing.
 Great price and Great flavor. Strawberry banana is delicious can’t wait to try other flavors
 Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard protein is the best whey protein I've ever purchased. The taste is reliably great, regardless of flavor and it's easily mixable.
 Optimum is my favorite protein. Cheap. Not too many ingredients. High Protein,low fat.  This flavor was a nice change, not bad at all especially with milk, my favorite is the chocolate but i recommend trying this if you like sweets.
 Best for beginner
 Optimum Nutrition is always been my go-to for nutritional supplements. The price and quality has always been attractive to me. I would say best for your buck, but it's more like best on the market.<br/><br/>I've purchased their whey protein powders in various sizes and have never been disappointed. Skimming through other reviews many have said that they've added some undesired ingredients into their formula, but with this latest batch I really haven't noticed a difference. I always drink double Scoops with very little water so that it's very thick, just so that I can chug it down quicker. Because of this, I've never noticed it be coming more water down. This method does make the chocolate taste very very intense so I can see why people wouldn't want so little water in the mix. Either way, can't go wrong with this product. Would recommend to anyone and I personally buy monthly.
 I'm satisfied so far with the taste and quality of the product. I purchased this to add some protein to my diet. I add 3/4 of a scoop to about 4 ounces of 2% milk into a blender bottle and shake. Tastes like creamy chocolate milk.
 I personally love coconut flavored anything so if you're like me, you won't mind this flavor. Don't expect to taste a lot of chocolate, though. The coconut overpowers the chocolate, making it seem more like a "Coconut with a hint of chocolate" flavor. Overall, it's got a good enough taste that I enjoy it, but it's a light enough flavor where I don't see myself getting sick of drinking this.
 New rating for redesigned formula. Good job ON... less servings and worse ingredients.
 This product has gave me gains for days.  I'm not manlet, so my frame was nicely filled in by the power of protonz.  I'm natty as natty graham, so this is very nice product to take.
 Best tasting protein ever: Rocky Road. Do yourself a flavor and try it ;)
 I didn't realize how big the 5lb version of this stuff is... This will last me at least 2 months approximately. Good thing the flavor is good!
 Great product
 Tastes pretty good. But not like Belgian street waffles good.
 Delicious!
 I bought the double chocolate flavor. I would mix it into 3/4 glass of water and then add 1/4 milk and the flavor was really good. Almost tasted like chocolate milk. Several people commented that it doesn't dissolve well. I found that it took about 20 seconds of stirring to completely dissolve the powder. Results? I can't really comment on that area. I am new to weight lifting, so it is all gains for me.
 Highly recommend this product . Only buy ON protein<br/> Triple chocolate is My favorite  flavor.
 The past couple/few tubs of this have been borderline gross tasting. I thought it was just old stock or something but skimming other reviews says its more than that. I have been using ON for almost 9yrs now faithfully, but wont be buying again.
 Best protein I ever used, this is my fifth one. do you want the best flavor? buy the natural vanilla flavor, you won't regret it.
 Seems like the formula has been redone. Love It! Dissolves easily and mixes well. Tastes super good, even with water!
 And the product itself it fantastic. I've been using this brand for 10 years, and compared to others, this has been best why I've ingested. It mixes easily, it's tasty, and I've had gains that exceed other products.
 Great protein, more chocolate than chocolate mint flavour.
 Great protein powder - mixes quickly and easily. Great value too!
 Fantastic taste, mixes well with water, milk, or coffee.
 Best tasting protein powder! The chocolates lot is great. Finally found a product that tastes good and mixes easily. and packs a lot of protein per serving!
 My husband loves this protein.  They sell it at our gym for more money so he thought Amazon might have it for cheaper and they did!  He loves it even more since it comes in a 10 pound bag and it lasts longer for him.
 Fills me up after a workout and has helped put on muscle
 Arrived in 2 days as it said. This is my second time for this product and I really like the taste.
 Tastes pretty good. Doesn't cause stomach cramps. Does mix very easy in shaker cup. Only down side, it's it didn't come in a bigger container.
 Tastes great!! Mixes very good!! Has a little bit of everything the body needs after a good workout! Decent price too. Optimum Nutrition is my "Go To".
 Best whey protein on the market. Awesome stuff
 Good I like it
 Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard is my go to protein powder for after workouts.  It provides the protein necessary, and in my experience has the best tasting powder.  I've gotten the double chocolate and mint chocolate as flavors, and both were very tasty.  Would highly recommend.
 Good quality protein, mocha flavor isn't as mocha-y as I would have hoped; tastes a lot like the chocolate.  Either way I would still recommend and will purchase again.
 Worked amazingly well added a lot of mass.
 Tastes like artificial sweetener, sweet n low or something. Not a good taste at all.
 This whey works well and it mixes well. I am not a fan of any whey taste, but mixing this with a tablespoon of peanut butter works wonders.
 I can't stand the Rocky Road flavor. The first cup tasted fine, but every subsequent batch has tasted cloyingly, artificially sweet, and the flavors just don't work for me. Back to the double chocolate next time!
 great taste. I use it at least once a day and never get tired of it.
 Love the taste been using it forever, the $ keeps going up but it is still cheaper here than any place else so........... we buy it<br/><br/>chocolate is Better<br/>vanilla is eewww<br/>Strawberry is good
 works as advertised
 If you're looking for a good protein shake after a good workout at the gym. This Whey protein is the one you're looking for.
 ...but not in a sweet way.<br/><br/>If you're fond of dark chocolate then you probably like the way this tastes.<br/><br/>I use a blender/shaker and it comes out to as a very smooth shake w/2% milk.
 The cake batter flavor is the worst tasting protein I have ever had. The vanilla ice cream and chocolate are awesome. I would stick to those.
 I have tried many different brands, but this has been the best protein I have tried. Protein mixed well and tastes awesome.
 I really enjoy this product, i Take the one scoop before and after my workouts, works well in helping to rebuild muscle tissue. i first started of with GNC products but I felt i was wasting a little too much every couple of weeks. I saw the price on the Optimum Whey Gold Standard and I knew i had to get it. This product taste awesome, it is a little light but the taste is still there, this container has lasted me way longer than that of any GNC product, a must buy.
 Do not buy this product. Everything about it is terrible. I know what you're thinking, "It's the most popular protein powder, how can it be bad?" The answer is that they recently changed their recipe in a terrible way which I will explain. I regret not doing more research before buying this and ignoring the other reviews warning about the dangers of sucralose.<br/><br/>First off, the flavor is utterly wretched. Had to add so much to my smoothies just to cover up the horrible sickly sweet fake taste, and it still made me feel like gagging. I wish I had listened to the other reviews warning of this. If this were the only downside, I could deal with it.<br/><br/>But then the stomach problems came. Turns out Optimum decided to change their recipe to include sucralose, which many studies have shown to be bad for digestion. Sucralose raises pH levels in the stomach and destroys good gut bacteria. Every time I would drink this, I would get a painful burning in my stomach within 15 minutes without fail, often followed by diarrhea. Thanks, Optimum Nutrition. Here's a study:  ...]<br/><br/>When I emailed their customer service asking for a refund or a replacement, they sent me a measly 3 servings of their sucralose-free version which, surprise surprise, didn't make me sick! Then after stringing me along over a week or two to fill out a useless form so they could analyze the batch I had purchased (despite the problem being with the recipe itself, not the batch) they told me they couldn't give me any refund or replacement.<br/><br/>So I'm out $60 for a tub of indigestible sickly sweet garbage. Do yourself a favor and check out this independent study list of far better choices (note that this product lands in 28th place!)<br/> ...]<br/> ...]<br/><br/>1/5 will never buy again and will warn all my gym buddies against purchasing this in the future.
 ON is my favourite protein. I've searched long and hard to find a protein that keeps me going and full after a good workout. My favorite flavours are the vanilla ice cream and cookies and cream but I seriously haven't found one that hasn't tasted good. Highly recommended!
 NO WHEY!!....WHEY!
 This whey has the most actual protein content of any whey on the market. I love the simplicity, I love how it mixes, and I love the low carb content.<br/><br/>Definitely the recommended whey for those looking to increase their daily protein consumption without adding too many calories.
 taste good, easy to fix
 Love this product. Cookies &amp; Cream tastes the best out of all the protein flavors I've tried.
 I almost always dislike protein flavors but this the only one i actually like a lot,  also it's whey protein so good quality stuff. Recommend
 Some of the best protein you can get. I've tried tons of brands, and I always come back to ON.
 Delicious product and amazing effects. I'm a very active athlete and enjoy my protein shakes after my runs and soccer games. This whey has been my favorite for the last year+. I recommended it to anyone looking to purchase or even try whey!
 Satisfied
 Great value and great taste. Tastes just like the chocolate milk I used to have a kid. Did you ever get tired of chocolate milk as a kid?? Exactly, I had vanilla flavor before and man!, I was counting the days to finish that thing!!<br/>Double Rich Chocolate? Wheyy better!!, (ha, get it?)
 Always loved this protien. Taste is great along with the ease of mixing it. Priced about the same if not slightly higher than other places like GNC.
 Tastes exactly like what it says. Can't say anything bad about it.
 There was no seal other than the plastic around the lid. Also no scoop. Coffee is actually an ingredient, so this flavor contains caffeine as well. Other than that, the Mocha Cappuccino flavor tastes good.
 So so tasty!
 Very nice source of protein. The vanilla flavor is great
 My husband uses this every time he does a work out.  Been using this for years.
 Strong smell, not good but a lot cheaper than at the vitamin shoppe
 This is by far the best protein for the money.  Anyone who uses protein supplements knows this is the baseline by which the others are measured.
 can never go wrong with ONGS whey protein, this flavor is quite tasty on its own, not chalky and mixes easily. goes great with my shakes and will definitely order again. 10/10
 This tastes really good! I add MCT powder to make it creamier. The only complain I have a about it is that it didn’t come with a scoop! :(
 I could have bought this from the host website but it was cheaper on her  to do so.  At first i thought it was going to be a knock off but proved to be a real deal!  It happened me with my protien in take :)
 Great product
 Best Whey protein on the market. I have seen improvements in strength tone and muscle mass. I have been using this product for more than 2 years and I keep buying when I run out.
 You will love this especially if you are a serious lifter or athlete looking to supplement your diet with protein. I am very happy with it
 Incredible stuff, will continue to use this in my workouts for the future. Absolutely marvelous when it comes to muscle recovery and helping to lose weight and stack muscle.
 Can't go wrong with Optimum Nutrition. Flavor is natural tasting and not artificial!
 Not for me
 This is good quality protein that mixes very well and tastes good but be weary of soy letchin and artificial sweeteners.
 Such an excellent choice!<br/>Delicious tasty, the ingredients are well balanced and optimizes the training and gain of lean mass!
 Wow always a good product
 I'm ordering my second tub today of Extreme Chocolate. My very first purchase was Double Rich Chocolate, but I much prefer Extreme hands down.
 Great post workout formula!
 They are the best in the protein game.
 This stuff is awesome! Much better than the six star brand. It easily mixes with a spoon as it states. Tastes great also.
 Great taste
 I have been using this product for a few months now and the results are fantastic. I feel like I can lift more weight and go more reps when using this product regularly. Don't lose faith if you don't feel or see results right away. Work hard 5 days a weeks and use after each workout and you will notice a difference after probably a week or 2. It tastes great too.
 Great
 Great taste and works great.  Able to put on pounds of muscle while keeping my workouts intense.
 mind blowing good.  even  with water.  no joke it tastes like vanilla ice cream. i'm tempted to try other flavors, but i would be devastated if it didnt taste as good as this.
 To be genuine! Whenever I open the box I feel like I'm smelling coffee. The entire room will be filled with that smell. Im a coffee addict before dieting. But this cookies and creme made me feel good and it's awesome. I recommend this for every coffee addict in this world.. You will never regret 👍🏻 best among all flavor
 GREAT flavor, mixes extremely well.  ON is the ONly whey protein I use - best results and overall product.
 Best protein powder! Tastes so good too
 Taste horrible I have been using 100% Whey protein for last couple of month but this 5LB pack I bought recently seems to me fake product. Even the container was not sealed when I received it.
 Mocha Cappuccino is the BEST! Mix with milk and ice cubes in blender. Taste like a frozen coffee.
 Optimum Nutrition is the best brand of protein for me. It has BCAA's and a good blend of ingredients. It mixes very well with water or milk using a blender ball shaker. I have tried Double Rich, Cookies n Cream, and Vanilla and all 3 were great!
 Only protein I use anymore. Easiest mixing powder I've found. Plenty of flavors. High protein content.
 strawberry is the best.  not as good as the natural one but its tasty and reliable
 Have tried several different brands of protein powder and didn't like any of them. Read the reviews on this and deceided to try. It is very good. I mix with 1 cup of milk and a couple of ice cubes in a blender. If you like chocolate you will like this.
 The first protein I've been able to drink!  Great taste... and suggested mix-in - Powdered peanut butter!
 My protein was larger than I expected for the money, tastes great (just like chocolate milk but creamier) and mixes very well in my metal ball containing blender bottle. Definitely my favorite brand and having also enjoyed vanilla I am excited to run out to try a new flavor!
 Shipped very quickly. Tastes really good. Better results than expected. Might try a different flavor but will definitely buy again.
 tastes great just doesn't mix that well as some other products
 My favorite whey since I start working out
 It's a great supplement, I love optimum nutrition products...but I purchased it for the flavor specifically and it tastes like chocolate, not chocolate mint. No mint taste whatsoever. Bummed! But still excited for gains
 I love this stuff. It works great, tons of protein, but be weary of some flavors. I have had the banana and now the coffee. The coffee I need to water down a bit more. The banana went down much easier.
 Very very easy to digest and very very good taste!
 I have been taking ON Gold Standard Whey protein for about a year now.<br/>I have nothing but high praise for the taste, quality and muscle building qualities of this product.
 You can't go wrong with the standard chocolate flavor. I've also tried the strawberry bananna, but it's a bit polarizing in taste-some days I just don't want to taste a fake fruit smoothie. Chocolate is a go-to choice.
 excellent
 Great product better price
 Good product, it is what it is...
 Best whey protein you can get
 Coffee flavor tastes like a cheap watered down coffee. Tastes just fine considering it's not actually coffee.
 My favorite brand. Tastes great, no chunks/chalky taste
 Tastes soooooo good!! If you freeze it for about a half hour or shake it thoroughly with ice, it tastes just like ice cream.
 Have been using this for years &amp; it's great. Very tasty (I like Double Chocolate) &amp; seems to have more protein per scoop than other brands. No added sugar either.
 Works great!
 I tried the regular chocolate flavor first but it didn't mix well and clumped together. this mixes very well and stays dissolved.<br/>the taste isn't bad and very good compared to other ones that I've tried.<br/>I've been ordering this for years and am very pleased with it.
 My household's all time favorite protein. I've tried gluten-free protein, plant protein, soy protein, specifically-for-women protein.. all kinds. But this stuff is consistent and has never let me down, not to mention the flavors are actually *good*. It doesn't require a 5 minute shake in the blender bottle, it actually mixes quite well compared to other proteins. The finished product (no matter if I put 3 oz of almond milk or 6 oz) is never overly thick. It's easy to drink and I love it as a midday snack to keep me going until dinner. This will always be a go-to.
 I've tried many different types of protein powders, but this one is one of the best ones, both in terms of quality and taste. You can't beat it if mixed with almond milk and a banana.
 Good product, not 5 star because taste isnt great.
 Perfect. Probably the best price point for pound per protein.
 I love this protein powder . I have two now and it's a must have. I have loss 30lbs using this powder in combination with working out and prep meals. AWESOME
 Tastes good, works good! Been using this for over a year. I usually mix in 2 scoops C4 Extreme Strawberry Margarita. This tastes great and works great.
 One of the highest quality proteins on the market for a reasonable price. Clean, with no fillers or cheap proteins.
 For the price and taste ON Whey Gold is really the best.  Have been using for 5 or 6 years and every now and then we try a small  package of a competitor and keep coming back to ON.
 My favorite protein shake!  Works for what I need.  Not a ton of added sugar.
 Great protein that tastes amazing. Every other kind I have ever tried tastes like garbage. This mixes well, settles in your stomach good, and gives you great results. I recommend buying the 5 pound because you save money and we both know you will most likely buy it again. Great company been using them for years.
 The ingredient list in the product description and images show Aminogen as being included. But not in the product I received.<br/>Why put up fake ingredient list and fool customers, when it's not really being offered?
 Great deal per oz.<br/>Great tasting<br/>Mixes quickly and doesn't clump at all<br/>Low sugar, small serving size. The scoop is tiny compared to other protein powders.
 Great product!
 It's great but the expiration date is up.  I hope next time it's good on the expiration..
 Perfect match for building muscle and really a very good product
 Taste good. I mix with bananas ice peanut butter &amp; sometimes more for after workout or just whenever
 Great product, great price!
 Skeptical at first, but after using twice a day, three times a week when i work out, I've noticed increase chest and abs definition, have more energy and feel very hydrated.
 This protein should be at the top of your list...
 Fast shipping, as expected, it takes more like vanilla bean, but it is a good flavor
 great protein supplements, I'm impressed, good result after moderate use
 Tastes great with some chocolate pudding, good for workouts or meal replacement.
 Good product, easy to mix and digest.. very weak flavor
 Great product. Tastes great, fantastic protein content and quality. Nothing not to like.
 i got the milk chocolate flavor and it tastes great. tastes a little like nesquick. very pleasant.
 This powder works great and tastes great.  Not much bad to say about it, except it can actually be too sweet at times for me when in milk.  Tastes decent in water too, which is also great for when I forget my milk.
 My hubby loves this protein powder.  He doesn't go a day without it.
 Drinking these daily now!
 I recently purchased a 5lb tub of the Extreme Milk Chocolate flavor. As I opened my package I noticed that protein powder was on the outside of the container and that the bottom of my container had a very large dent in the bottle. Upon further inspection I saw that my container had no safety seal and that my product had been opened. I always order from ON but this is the first time this is happened and I will be returning this product.
 awesome product. I dont see any side effects like other supplements. I've used celltech. But prefer this one than celltech.
 tastes fine. great price. it's protein. What else do you want?
 Flavor is fine. Not the best packaging (jars are much easier to manipulate) but adjusted fine for a beginner which only uses it a couple of times a week.
 Taste great.
 Have tried a ton of different protein powders but I always come crawling back to cake batter! It is seriously so delicious, it has a vanilla pudding taste and can be mixed with anything. I highly suggest mixing it with banana flavored Greek yogurt!
 What can I say that no one else has? Not really sure. This stuff is just awesome. Great flavor, barebone Whey that mixes well. What else can you ask for? I sandwich my workouts with this stuff and it gives me exaclty what I want. Best Whey on the market.
 Good stuff inside... but the flavor is very chemical.. and not so great.  We did not try other flavors... but I would encourage you to try much smaller bottles, or sample envelopes from your local store before buying online.
 It's a big bucket. It tastes great. It's worth buying
 I liked this item , delivered on time .<br/>Nice flavor.
 This is great quality protein. But, DO NOT order the vanilla. After so much time, I could not handle the flavor. Vomit.
 Tastes good enough and dissolves easily. NitroCore24 is also a good choice, though much more expensive, it also tastes even better. I'd recommend having this 100% Whey before/after workout and the NitroCore24 before bed and/or in the morning.
 It shows a new and improved taste. I thought that was code for, "not as good as before cuz we decided to go cheap." But that's totally not the case. I thought it was tasty before but now even better!
 Good flavor
 Flavor: Vanilla Ice Cream<br/><br/>I'm a HUGE fan of ON.  I use their BCAA, Creatine and Multi-Vitamins.  In fact, if I'm researching a supplement and I see ON has a version of it.. I almost ALWAYS choose ON.<br/><br/>The problem with the Vanilla Ice Cream is that it is just way way way too sweet.  I don't mind a little artificial sweetener in my protein powder...after all, there are options for flavorless protein powders out there, but this is a whole different level of disgusting. More than likely, any positive reviews for this flavor are of the old blend which used a different sweetener.<br/><br/>Absolutely disgusting.<br/><br/>The only pro about the protein itself is that it doesn't cause stomach upset for people who are lactose intolerant.  I'm not highly intolerant...however many protein powders have given me an upset stomach in the past which is why I mainly stayed with isolates.
 Whey protein, best of the best! Chocolate malt is amazing plain and with milk!
 Best price for good whey.  It is also one of the least caloric options too.
 Great stuff and good bang for your buck. All you really need to recover. Flavor isn't too bad either.
 Great product
 Was scared this wouldn't mix well with water based on some of the reviews, but actually tastes delicious and not gritty!
 I usually get the mint chocolate chip flavor, so I thought I would try out a new flavor. The mocha cappuccino was a little sweeter than I thought it would be, but still has great flavor.
 This protein tastes good enough to drink it by itself (no additional flavors needed).  It dissolves well enough in water that I can mix it using only a spoon.  I will continue to buy this brand.
 Best Protein powder on the market.
 I hate protein shakes usually, but this tastes like a chocolate milkshake
 EXCELLENT ARTICLE. ALL PERFECT.
 This is the best tasting protein I have purchased yet. I mix the power with almond milk and it tastes like a coffee milk shake.<br/>I'd highly reccomend this product to anybody that enjoys coffee milk or coffee flavored ice cream.
 The perfect protein powder flavor. I don't get sick of it because it is not too sweet like essentially all other flavors of major protein powder brands. I'm pretty sure it has the highest rating on bodybuilding.com, and it is justified.
 I only buy Optimum Nutrition protein and the cookies and cream flavor is one of the best I've ever had. It's not too sweet, and even taste good when mixed with water, although I use milk. You can't go wrong with cookies and cream!
 First off, I'd like to say that I'm not a nutritionist, or a health nut / fitness bro. Just a regular dude who eats right and works out / runs a few times a week. That being said, this is a great Whey Powder and I am very subscribed to this brand alone. I used to use Muscle Milk Protein Powder, but under the advice of my friend (who is a health/lifestyle adviser) I dropped the MM Brand and switched to ON. To keep it short and sweet, I will list some things to note followed by my personal experience / tips with using this great product.<br/><br/>Things I've Noticed:<br/>1. ON Brand has a much more basic ingredient list, with no nonsense or 'padding' to increase their profits. It's mostly Whey Protein, and a few other things for taste and texture.<br/>2. Speaking of taste and texture, this stuff is the real deal. I've only tried two flavors so far, Rocky Road and Strawberry, but they are both excellent. The flavor is very light and palatable, in the sense that you can go through the 5 pound tub without getting sick of the flavors and having to choke them down. It's also not sludgy at all, it mixes so easily you could probably use a spoon, though I use a Blender Bottle. The powder is extremely fine and flour-y when compared to my past protein powder choices.<br/>3. It also doesn't clump together after initial blending. For example. I'll pre-mix my drink before I leave for work at 2:00, and I store it in the cooler until 6:00 or 7:00 and it is just as new.<br/>4. The only downside I've noticed about ON is the price. It is a little pricey at just under 60 dollars for 5 pounds, but I think that with something you put in your body to support your health, it is better this way than to settle for inferiority.<br/><br/>Personal Tips:<br/>So, in my few months of using ON Brand, I've also found that it does wonders in the mornings when you need a quick protein shot but don't have the time. Often on these mornings, I will mix the whey powder into shakes / smoothies. Like I said, I've only used the two flavors, but here are the smoothies I make with them if you are interested:<br/>Strawberry -&gt; 1.5 Cups Whole Milk, 1 Banana, 4 - 6 Strawberries, 3 Ice Cubes, Strawberry ON Powder<br/>Chocolate PB Banana -&gt; 1.5 Cups Whole Milk, 1 Banana, 2 - 3 Tbsp. Peanut Butter, 3 Ice Cubes
 As pure as you can get. Your body doesn't need all the other extra stuff if your diet is good. This is a good supplemental source of protein for bulking.
 One of the best protein vs price bargains out there.
 I love the smell and flavor of this whey. It is very good, mixes well and priced right. ON makes a good product with and it does not have any extra additives. Calories almost all from protien.
 Best whey protein there is.
 Not bad. Good nutritional values, but taste of Cellucor is much better in my opinion. Solid price though so it's a tradeoff.
 This is a great protein for anyone on an exercise regimen or just for general protein needs. It is definitely the best protein on the market for its contents of amino acids and grams of protein per serving for the price. I think it is the best even disregarding price. Highly recommended. if you like banana flavoring the BANANA CREME is definitely the Best flavor I've tried by far. tastes great. I would steer clear of the vanilla ice cream flavor, unless you like the flavor of sour dry milk. Anyway, a must buy
 its pricey tho
 One of (if not) the best whey isolate. All of the flavors I have had are good, the price per scoop is great, and it ranks highly in terms of purity (low metal concentration)
 What can i say that has not been said about ON Whey. This tastes great... Doesn't mix perfectly but well enough. I continue to buy. I liked the hydrowhey a little more. It mixed better but was a few dollars more.
 This is a real treat. The taste is great. It makes a taste full shake when used with milk bananas and frozen berries. Total cal 340. Substitute for a meal filling you up.
 Got chocolate mint. Sounds better then it tastes.  Taste more like bitter chocolate. Just get plain chocolate.  Other then that, good product. Other proteins cause me stomach issues, this one doesn't.
 This stuff is whey good. Very tasty, I mix it in with almond milk. And buying here (especially with prime) is cheaper than anywhere else.
 This product is awesome but be wary of where you order it from. Mine never reached me and I'm in a deployed environment. If you're deployed (APO, FPO, etc) then stick with bodybuilding.com. FYI
 perfect
 I always look forward to drinking this after working out, so good! Mix it with milk, and it tastes like chocolate milk. If it clumps up, it tastes like fudge!
 Liked
 This is my second order...... The banana taste great but its a little foamy.. you have to let it sit for a min or 2 or all you get is foam.
 I've had the Double rich chocolate, it was pretty good. When it was time for a refill I accidentally ordered Banana Cream and it is amazing. I would highly recommend this flavor. Then to switch it up I got the extreme milk chocolate most recently.... this flavor is horrid. Don't do it. Save yourself. I guess it's not that bad if you just love chocolate milk, but for whatever reason it just doesn't work for me. I know it's the highest rated flavor on BB.com, but don't believe it. Stick with banana cream.
 I love this chocolate whey protein powder.  It is chocolate, mixes instantly into fluids, and gives me great added protein to my smoothie.  I love it!
 I've used up almost the whole 10 pounds at this point, and I'm still not sick of it. I mix it with my cereal in the morning, or with a glass of water or milk at night. It is the easiest thing to eat/drink, and I've been trying different kinds for more than 10 years now.
 Great quality! Blends very well and love the ice cream flavor
 Mixes well with anything. shaker works but i do it in a blender so there's zero chunks at all. The price on Amazon can't be beat especially when you're cranking through a 5lb jug every month or 2.
 I got this product. Very pleased. Thank you Amazon
 DO NOT BUY! Was using for the past 5 years with great results. After the reformulation, did not get the same results. Absorption decreased and some of the time I just felt bloated/felt constipated after drinking my protein shake. ON messed up a great product, and now I'm in the market for a new protein powder
 I've tried this stuff on and off for the last year. I didn't think it was doing anything but after doing my exercise routine without the stuff I noticed I was getting skinnier around the shoulders. I started to use it again and you feel stronger and you bulk up. I can't believe it really works!
 I just tried the WHITE CHOCOLATE flavor for the first time and it's pretty good. It has more of a vanilla flavor than a white chocolate flavor, but in all honesty it's good. If you like vanilla I'm sure you'll like this flavor. One thing I've noticed is that the amount of water can really change the flavor of the protein. This is my first time trying Gold Standard from ON and I enjoy it. I will definitely buy more Gold Standard from now on.
 tastes great and gets me that extra protein to balance out macros! also great for recovery after a hard workout
 As a huge fan of mint chocolate chip but a first time whey user I asked around a lot before purchasing. Although most people say chocolate over everything, I love the mint chocolate chip
 I have been using this for years (vanilla ice cream)......new and improved taste is sickening sweet.  Will not re-order.  Why re-invent the wheel when you have a good product.  Very disappointed and sooo sad.  It was a great flavor. RIP vanilla ice cream flavor :(
 You can not beat this price.  There are better tasting supplements out there, but they use more sweeteners and cost much more.  ON tastes ok, and provides the proper amount of protein, glutamine and BCAA's required for a pre and post workout shake.  Don't believe the marketing, this is the best, scientifically proven.
 Great taste, makes you feel full if combined with Milk. Great for everyday protein requirement.
 One of the best when proteins out there. Most whey proteins if you look at the ingredients labels will have whey protein concentrate or some other less form of whey as their first ingredient. Not this on first one is When Isolate!!!
 Don't buy. The powder does not even dissolve in water.<br/><br/>I had been using other brands before and recently switched to Optimum Nutrition. I got the banana cream flavor 5 pounds product. After mixing a small spoon of powder and a FULL cup of boiling water, I found that the powder does not dissolve at all. It's like blocks of plastics floating on the water.<br/><br/>Well, though it looks bad, I thought it might still taste good. So I removed the floating pieces carefully, then had a sip. Now I have to say that, IT TASTES LIKE EAR WAX! Extremely disgusting, small particles in the water still do not dissolve and feels like sands. I doubt WTF I am really drinking. Is this really protein powder? None of the other brands I tried before could taste like this. Am I the only person getting a defective product, or all products are just like this?
 Really loved this product! Saw massive results since I started using it and all my weights when up in the gym
 Love the chocolate malt! Mixes well, love it with almond coconut milk.
 ON's best flavor by far... You mix this with unsweetened almond milk... and it is the most orgasmic drink... I forget i'm drinking protein and think it's candy..
 Exactly what we wanted, a great tasting low carb protein powder.
 My favorite flavor so far.  It's not too sweet.<br/>It mixes well and easily with water.  The texture is great.<br/>Other reviews will give you all the statistics on it's nutritional value.
 Good!
 Loving this stuff. Tastes great and keeps me full for hours. No funky aftertaste from nasty artificial sweeteners
 Mixes well and tastes good but the flavor is very weak.
 Love this stuff, especially the BCAAS. Glad there is a high protein count. Mixes good and taste really good compared to other supps. Just wish it could be a little cheaper relative to that of price and lb comparison
 My favorite protein flavor! I mix it with 4 oz of milk, 1/3 cup of dry oats, and some icecubes. It makes the perfect coffee drink!
 This is my second order of this product.  Tastes very good especially when mixed with coffee and a little Hazel Nut or Irish Cream Sweetener (Torani, sugar free sweetner).  Both my wife and I are using this product for weight reduction.
 Favorite protein for flavor, quality, and price point.
 Good but after a while its a little too sweet for me.
 Huge 5 pound container will last awhile. Great flavor cookies and cream.
 This is my go to protein power. The taste is not that great, but IMO it's the best among the Optimum protein powders.
 Greate taste!! You can definitely taste the mocha!
 Great price and product for Whey Protein. The Double Rich Chocolate is my favorite out of the different varieties. It has a great flavor to it.
 After tasting musclemilk, its very hard to drink this.  Instead I mix it with my oatmeal in teh morning.  The taste and ability to dissolve are not very good.  Mixing with Milk helps, but at that point you may as well get musclemilk.<br/><br/>Overall, I would say Musclemilk light is the way to go if you are looking for low calories and good protein and taste.
 I think its fake because it tastes really bad and not the same when I bought it from bodybuilding.com. If ypu care for your health don't buy it
 Great stuff.  Works great as a meal replacement or for after workouts.
 i just started using supplements and this takes really good. it tends to clump alittle at the top but i chug the whole thing at once anyway so it doesnt matter. heard this is the best one out there and i agree with that statement
 I used Optimum Nutrition before, i think it was vanilla. It's good protein in my opinion. This particular flavor, strawberry banana is pretty inconvenient comparatively. It's much more difficult to mix or dissolve in any liquid. I don't like the taste in particular either -- it feels very artificial, but this is more subjective.
 bigboy only
 Great.
 ON Gold is my favorite protein powder, and this is my favorite flavor.
 I have been using gold standard whey for over 3 years in UK and now in USA. I was very happy with results and glad to find this brand.<br/>Last time I purchased it in costco USA and had no problem or no difference at all but this time i thought i will try amazon cuz it is way cheaper than in cosco.<br/>The double rich cocolate is very lite and its not like how it used to be, i downloaded barcode scanner app to make sure the one I recieved is original. It looks original and even the package looks and feels original but except being original feel and looks nothing is same.<br/><br/>I am loosing my muscle instead of gaining, i thought i will increase my protein intake and found out that its of no use instead m becoming more weak and thin. I have dizziness all the time, tiredness, dry throat feeling and some wierd feeling. Its a 10lbs pack and i dont want to throw it away but risking my health is not worth.<br/>I am sad to say that i am thinking to go to a different product.
 For the people who have gotten Whey Protein before, this flavor (Cookies and Cream) is pretty good. Two friends of mine got Vanilla and Strawberry and they both taste pretty bad but they both said they'd rather have my flavor.<br/>Optimum Nutrition's Whey Protein does the job- I take some with milk a few hours before my workout, a proportioned amount with water afterwards, and a little more before I sleep every night (to prevent long-term catabolism) and I've been steadily gaining weight/muscle mass.<br/><br/>This is a great buy and investment. Just be sure to get a good flavor or you'll hate drinking this.
 good stuff-- bought a couple
 I MUST ADMIT...I ADDED A LITTLE MALTED MILK FLAVOR (NOT TOO MANY CALORIES) AND IT IMPROVED THE TASTE.
 This stuff is great for post workout or a healthy bridge in between meals.  Tastes pretty good.  The Double Chocolate is a good balance - not too sweet like the Extreme Chocolate.  It mixes great in water and even better in milk.  Goes down good and my stomach agrees with it.  I have definitely added some lean mass since I began using this product 4 months ago.  The 5 pound tub lasts me right at a month.  I have no reservations when it comes time to pony up the $53 for another one.  Best whey protein I've used.<br/><br/>-Legend
 This stuff is great, mix in blender with a banana some strawberry's and 8 ounces of milk, 3 cubes of ice and you've got a treat after your workout, through in some casein and feed your body all night.
 I love it!
 You really cant beat the price per gram of protein. The taste is also very good with the extreme milk chocolate and cookies and cream
 High quality protein at an affordable price. Doesn't taste too bad either.
 Fast delivery &amp; good product with non-chalky taste - double chocolate is the only flavor I get
 Tasted good. Did not last long. Price has gone up too high. I get them cheaper in 24 Hour Fitness when they are on sale (often).
 Good taste, good ratio of calories to protein. My favorite flavor is double rich chocolate, followed by extreme milk chocolate, then French vanilla creme. I don't necessarily recommend rocky road. The price is fair given the good taste and high protein content.
 OMFG I love it
 Taste great even in water.  You need to try this bad boy.
 It's Gold standard whey &amp; one of the best on the market in my opinion...
 Gold Standard Whey by ON is great, I've been using it for years and it's never failed me. In fact, it's gotten better and better in many ways. However, the reason for writing this review is to warn others, while ON is great and I can attest to the nice taste of Extreme Chocolate Milk, and Double Rich Chocolate.<br/><br/>HOWEVER I accidentally ordered 5lbs (ugh!) of Delicious Strawberry. Yeah, I'm a bit irritated at myself and dreading drinking 5lbs of this stuff. It tastes good enough that I'm not dying drinking it (still hate it), but what's bugging me is how chemically it tastes. I get chemicals are used to make whey taste like X, Y, and Z but... ugh, I wish I had not screwed up -_-.<br/><br/>P.S. Didn't notice till after I opened it (pink powder was a big shock), so couldn't return =/.
 As described
 Love it enough that this a staple re-order for my boyfriend.
 I've tried a lot of proteins, but this is the best by far. Great macros, mixes great, and most importantly it tastes great. Not all flavors are created equal, however. Double rich chocolate is my favorite for mixing with water while on a cut.  But extreme milk chocolate is amazing with skim milk. For making fruity concoctions in the blender, vanilla ice cream works well but it's not great alone.
 Smells expired but does its job i think ...
 Just ok. We normally use Intek Protien mix. Same flavor. This Whey power left me hungry less than an hour later and is very thin and watery. Didn't care for the taste much either. Don't think we will buy again.
 Tasty
 the best mixture available; both whey isolate and concentrate for maximum benefino artificial anything!
 I love this protien powder, I dont like getting it in the mail from amazon and its rancid 2x in a row now , from now on I will get it directly from optimum nutrition.
 Wonderful and useful product.  Results are for real!
 I only use Gold Standard powder at this point because for the price it has everything I need. The BCAA's are so important. Great taste, mixes well, no reason to use anything else.
 Best tasting protein powder i have ever had!
 I've been buying this product for years, It has always been great with my workout routine...
 Easy to drink, dissolves well in water.
 I saw all the good reviews for this product and bought it, but looks like they changed the formula and it tastes so bad.
 Very smooth. Awesome taste. Can’t even tell it’s whey.
 It is delicious and blends well in smoothies.
 Tastes and mixes great. Definitely a nice step up from double rich chocolate which i have only had up until  now.
 This is my favorite Whey Protein. It wins awards annually for being one of the best protein powders out there. Also definitely one of the better tasting products in my opinion.
 Love the taste. Wish it was still on subscribe and save. The price just keeps going up however. Too bad because I don't buy it as often as I once did
 This is the brand that my son in law told me to buy,  He is a professional grade weight lifter, all muscles.
 My go to whey.  Quite simply my favorite whey product.  I use this in my pre-, post-, meal- shake. I love the flavor, mixes well, and comes from a reputable company.
 Whey Gold Coffee flavor taste great. I really like it. Mix it with water in the morning before working out or make a coffee smoothie with a shot of espresso.  This stuff is the bomb.
 As most of us semi-lazy people are, we're extremely "on-again, off-again" when it comes to working out. When it's our "off-season" we don't have much to think about when it comes to supplements, but when we finally decide to stop being terrible, lazy people, the search begins for protein powder that not only has the most accurate percentage of advertised, but something that ideally doesn't taste like chocolate flavored garbage. Enter, Optimum Nutrition.<br/><br/>Time and time again, I am proven that these guys know what they're doing when it comes to both chemistry and flavor options. There are some independent studies that have been conducted over the past few years that have compared the percentage of actual protein contained within protein powders, and Optimum Nutrition has always remained near the top.<br/><br/>As far as flavor, they obviously have a pretty huge assortment of them. While I think most of them are decent, the Coconut Chocolate variety actually tastes delicious. It's not overwhelming and the hint of coconut does an excellent job of masking the mildly unpleasant "proteiny" flavor that you normally have to endure.<br/><br/>I have tried a variety of protein products in the past, and while I'm not in the business of disparaging other products, I'm happy to stand by Optimum Nutrition for my current and future needs. Even when I inevitably stop working out, I'll at least have a healthy option for a meal replacement. Toss in some steel cut oats, mix in some milk, and you're good to go.
 All American sourced and manufactured protein sources, which is a good thing.  Good taste and consistency, which makes it 1000 times better than the library paste that was available in the old days.  Mixes well.  I can actually use one of those shaker cups, and wind up with a smooth drink.
 It's cheap per serving, it tastes good, fits perfectly in diet. What can you expect more from whey protein? You are not gonna get super-muscular in a day or a year using this product.
 I have had AMAZING results with this product.  I've always had trouble gaining muscle, but this stuff made it easy.  The best flavor I tried was plain vanilla, as it tasted the least artificial.  Highly recommended!!
 I have used this companies' whey protein shakes before while it is thick and a little lumpy, but the price is right and it does work just have to spend some extra time mixing that is all
 Very good and tastes amazing. The strawberry tastes like Nesquik
 The taste of the product was not that great which is the main knock on this product. However, this seller got the product to my house the day after ordering. Also, this product was full. There was not a lot of air sold, it is full product.
 This taste GREAT in addition to giving out the protein needed after work outs without adding too much junk. Gold Standard has set the standard for post drink workouts.
 Amazing as usual
 Was satisfied with product. Came as ordered and taste great.
 I've tried a few other brands of protein powders and this is by far the best tasting.  My doctor wanted me to increase my protein consumption and this is perfect and did the trick.
 Best whey I've tried to date.  Flavor and ext lo-cal.  Good for lo-carb dieters.
 Came quickly and as described. Creamy taste and love the smell. Makes my morning Blueberry Green Vanilla smoothie great for my post workout breakfast! Comes with scooper so it is easy to distribute and know calorie count of how much you add.
 Just what my son wanted. Mixes well with milk or juice and it tastes good. Pleased with the purchase
 Pretty good stuff
 The only kind I use after years of going to the gym now. ON is where it's at! Love this stuff, and I can actually bare the taste of it.
 Excellent mixing and tasting. I have pre and post workout. Helps me get the additional protein needed through the day. Quick and easy would def. recommend.
 This is the best whey protein I have tasted and seen results with. Buy it, you will not regret it! It even tastes great with H2O! I use 2 scoops and about 12-16oz H2O, and then use a hand blender and it is awesome! I love it. I use it after every workout.
 ive used this product numerous times... always liked it... not the best on the market, but the price is reasonable...
 I bought it to use when I go to gym but it doesn't taste that great.<br/>I threw half of it after it expired.
 taste kind of funny the strawberry flavor
 Good protein. Contains good amount of BCAAs per serving. I had couple instances of upset stomach so I recommend drinking it with some food like a nutty protein bar.
 I have been using whey for pre and post workout and it does an amazing job. I have tried Extreme Milk Chocolate, Double Chocolate and White Chocolate. I like the Extreme Milk Chocolate the best.<br/>A great supplement for anyone trying to put on muscle.
 Tried cookies and Cream for the first time, wasn’t even close to other bands cookies and cream. This had more of a cardboard taste than anything. If you’re looking for a Great tasting Cookies and Cream try Muscle Pharms it’s way better.
 LOVE THE BANANA CREAM FLAVOR AND ITS BEEN HELPING A LOT!!!
 Tastes good and mixes easy with either milk or water.  Cant ask for much more.
 I really enjoy the flavor of the Cookies and Cream. I was kind of skeptical because I have had a different brand of cookies and cream flavored protein that was very good.  I was afraid this might not be as good.  I was wrong, because this is awesome!  Like all of the ON Gold Standard whey proteins I have tried it mixes easily in a Blender Bottle.
 Great product ....also available at Vitamin Shoppe, but if you need to meet the minimum for free S&amp;H it might. E better to big it here.
 Perfect quality
 Great product. Great taste. Economical.
 The quality of protein may be good but it has a really bad taste for me.  Perhaps I'm spoiled after using syhtna-6 for so long. I bought the vanilla version of gold standard.
 This stuff is great, I've only been using for a few days and already see an improvement. Definitely would recommend
 Love mixing this in with my strawberry banana smoothies.
 Their product always taste great. Keep up the good work.
 This is legit product and was delivered on time! it was packaged carefully. I'm so satisfied.
 Bit of an artificial taste, I am switching back to unflavored
 I love this flavor. It is by far my favorite protein powder. great deal for the price; it will last a cery long time. Tastes great with almond milk and banana or by itself.
 Good deal.
 Tastes absolutely terrible.  I bought the rocky road, and it is awful.  I like Muscle Milk much better.
 Next time I will get a different chocolate flavor, I didn't know you could select different flavors till a friend pointed it out. Otherwise perfect product.
 I buy it al the time....
 the Optimum Nutrition series is the best whey I've had, and now I use it exclusively. My favorite flavor is the double chocolate. Some days I work out just so that I can justify drinking a shake!
 Gold Standard is still the best. I usually stuck w the coffee flavored powder so I wanted to switch it up a little and get something a little more basic -- vanilla. The flavor was....AIGHT, but I tapped into my adult mindset and was like "whateva...I'm a big boy. The protein is still here. It still taste good. " So besides the so-so vanilla flavor, this protein is still bae.
 love this stuff!
 I have been nomming this protein for some time now. It still tastes good, and fills me with the muscle stuffs.
 GREAT.
 Used this to do my weight loss. Works just make it fit with your calorie intake. 100% usefull and tasty with milk or watter. Plus some stevia you would love it.
 Exactly what I wanted and very pleased and happy! I can't wait to order another one soon
 Just what I wanted and shipped fast
 I need to become a lean, mean, destroying machine and this stuff will do the trick.
 It tastes pretty bad but I guess it did the job. It gave me protein but all my usual recipes that I use vanilla protein in were tainted by the taste of this protein.
 Pretty good, not sure it could get better without sugar :)
 Great protein powder. There's a reason why its so popular. It mixes very easily with just water and a little shaking (I just use ice in a mason jar).<br/><br/>I got the extreme milk chocolate, which is definitely one of my favorite flavors of protein powder. Mixing it with milk makes it taste even better, but if you don't want the extra calories, it tastes just fine in water too. I'd recommend keeping on the low side for the recommended amount of water so that it stays thicker. Its also great for a quick meal/snack if you toss it in a blender with ice, a banana and some peanut butter.<br/><br/>I'd definitely recommend this and would buy it again. Amazon had the cheapest price I could find and it came in two days, which is great.
 I ordered Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey as a protein supplement for a diet I went on before surgery.  It did exactly what I hoped it would, helped me build muscle, and shrink fat at the same time.  My surgeon was impressed and commented thy it made the procedure easier and less risky.  I use a blender to mix mine.  It taste delicious and goes down smooth.
 This product was wonderfull the first time i purchaced it. They changed the recipe and now I have moved on to Now Foods protein. Bottom line they should have kept the original recipe. It's still protein and it doesn't make me gag but the original flavor was so much better.
 High quality protein powder. Compared to other brands, this stuff really dissolves and makes your drink not as thick. The French vanilla creme is pretty good if you want a flexible protein flavor.
 I am surprised this product is not the same as Chocolate available at Costco! I am cancelling my subscription!
 Thank you....
 Tastes great. Mixes well. I mix a scoop of Mocha with half a scoop of Chocolate and a cup of milk. So good. High in Protein not bad on calories and good price.
 excelente
 Exactly what I wanted for extra energy and protein.
 I always get ON whey. I love it and trust it and will probably never switch.
 One of the best proteins ive had.
 Best flavor ever(coffee). His is my go to for snacks during the day.
 love it
 Let me start by saying that I bought a 5 lb tub of this suff(chocolate) for college without ever trying it.  The reviews and ratings seemed good enough for me to try it, and it is amazing.  It mixes very well and it tastes great(like chocolate milk, without the protein aftertaste).  Another thing that drew me to this product was the low fat levels.  I had bought four different brands of protein powder before this, and ALL of them had more fat, and tasted worse.  I am extremely pleased with this purchase, and i would recommend this to ANYONE.
 Do not buy Naturally Tasted Chocolate....Taste like NOTHING.....EWEW flavor
 I got the double rich chocolate, and it's very watery/lite flavored...like drinking faintly chocolate flavored water.  Pretty gross really.  Try a different flavor!
 The chocolate malt flavor is so yummy.  Actually meant to order the plain chocolate flavor so I was upset when the chocolate malt came but it tastes great!
 Very good whey, not cut with anything
 Great deal on awesome protein.  Cheaper here than bb.com and other online supplement sites.  You can get it at Costco for a little bit cheaper per serving, but I wasn't around one and the Prime shipping got it to me quickly.  Only minor complaint was the ziplock seal broke after the 4th time I opened it so I had to roll it up and clip it like a bag of chips.  Great deal though.
 Good quality protein. Unfortunately I didn't care for the double chocolate flavor. I will stick with French vanilla.
 Great product. Highly recommended if you want to lose grass, and gain muscle.
 Good!
 I love I am doing great in my workout routine, I am also taking nitric oxide and creatine. I recover easily, can push more more and do more reps! use wisely.
 This tastes so good with almond milk. I love it and drink it every morning after my workout. It works great and the price is great. I couldn't be happier.
 This is pretty much your basic vanilla protein. I like that the calorie count is actually pretty decent as protein powders go. Lately I've been mixing with OJ to make a creamsicle kind of shake, yumm!
 Great tasting, easy to dissolve. Not to pricy.
 Happy with my purchase.
 Shipping on time. Product as described.
 good
 This is by far the best protein on the market and at a great price!
 Great company with good quality. The flavor is nice with no odd after taste or tingle on the tongue. Price point is on the spot per serving no reason to complain.
 Delicious flavor.  Highly recommended, preferred over any other flavor.  Also good as background flavor when mixing in other ingredients like fruit.
 I'm currently following a strength training program and have been looking for a quality protein powder to supplement my diet. Before asking for opinions, I tried several brands at our local Walmart and GNC. Some of them were hard to stand, smelling terrible, tasting chalky and were just plain nasty.<br/><br/>My trainer recommended this brand so I went for it. I love how easy it blends (doesn't clump) and the powder tastes great with either water or milk. I've ordered several containers, over and over, and my favorite flavors are the extreme milk chocolate and the mocha cappucino.<br/><br/>I tried the salted caramel and it was really bad tasting. The smell and taste both reminded me of pancake syrup. I also tried the rocky road and it wasn't bad, but the taste is very very sweet.<br/><br/>My daily intake is 2-3 scoops, starting with 1 in the early morning, and it's been a great product to have. This hasn't caused any bathroom problems for me, no upset stomach issues and I feel great. It appears that some people are bothered, so you might try a smaller container for your first purchase. If you continue with OP, consider the 5lb tub as it is a great value for long term product use.
 This is the good stuff, if it wasn't so expensive I could probably live on it.
 Tastes good!  Excellent in smoothies.
 Such a good flavor. Shipment came quickly.
 Tastes amazing for protein. Mocha Cappuccino, Rocky Road, Cake Batter, Coffee, basically any chocolate flavor is delicious. I drink 2 scoops with 8 oz of skim milk and the rest water, and it tastes like desert.
 Awesome Product. The Double Rich chocolate flavor is really tasty. I find it to be better than Rocky Roads flavor.
 Great stuff, taste good and good results
 Very convenient to be able to get this size of protein while saving money as well. My husband uses this twice a day and it lasts us a couple of months!
 PROS:<br/>Optimum Nutrition is a great brand with lots of flavors.<br/>Tastes decent in milk.<br/>Mixes pretty well.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>This is my first time trying the strawberry banana flavor and I don't like the taste.<br/>To me, it tastes like a strawberry cough medicine.<br/>Tastes bad with water.<br/><br/>I wont buy this flavor again, but I will buy another flavor from Optimum Nutrition.
 Best tasting whey around. Not a great alternative for talcum power though.
 Good product, as ON always is. I loved the mocha cappuccino flavor and had to try this coffee flavor. I cannot complain. Would definitely get again.
 i took this stuff and didnt workout superhardcore. i did see a bit of improvement with it. and any noticable change is better than none. i mix it with milk cause it just seems a little thin. also put it on my generic grape nuts from kroger. good stuff i could eat it all day. or mix it with that and yogurt and a scoop here and there. i'm sure i would see more dramatic improvement if i worked out harder but it did what i wanted it to.
 It does its purpose, and does not taste bad, but I am sure there are better flavors than cake batter.
 Great protein with a sweet taste
 taste great and great addition to my diet.
 No better whey protein out there than Gold Standard. I really love the double chocolate and it is easily mixed with a shaker bottle!
 Best taste and easy to mix.
 <div class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block" id="video-block-R1VRY5J5TDGQDS"></div><input class="video-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81AGik9XJ2S.mp4"/><input class="video-slate-img-url" name="" type="hidden" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/916Q2-PDC7S.png"/> I wonder how that got in there anyways the taste was okay not much of coconut.
 After you get a bag of this whey, get yourself some creatine. Follow a strict, disciplined regiment and you WILL get bigger.
 Yum yum. I would recommend getting a shake mixer. Like the containers with the little ball inside? This formula boasts that you don't need to blend it and can "stir for 30 seconds", but honestly that will still leave you with gooey chunks of undissolved powder.
 This protein powder gave my stomach a bit of trouble, so 1-star deducted for that. Ultimate Nutrition doesn't do this to me.
 First off, I'm a creature of habit. I assume most of the people using GS Whey are used to a routine and like to keep things simple to maximize efficiency. GS Whey used to do that for me. The taste was good and the powder was pretty affordable. That all came to an end when I recieved 5 lbs of what was supposed to be Chocolate Mint protein powder. I have had double rich chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, and more that have always been pretty good overall. Chocolate Mint, however, was absolutely intolerable. I was in shock and even forced my fellow protein junky friends to try it. They agreed it was disgusting and refused to drink anymore. I don't know what happened, but something went wrong with this batch and it turned out terrible. But I did enjoy their other products so I maintained the 3 star rating because it was likely a fluke. My advice? Be weary of trying new flavors. Keep it simple, stick to what you know.
 Dissolves easily compared to all other brands of Whey that I used.  Other Whey protein gives me terrible Gas &amp; sometimes Diarrhea.  But I never had those problems with Gold Standard.
 Been using this for a while now and must say the BEST tasting protein powder in the marketplace. My favorite shake is banana, ice, water, 2 scoops of PB, and 2 scoops of this bad boy and you'll have the best post-workout drink!
 My husband mixes this with water. He has used others and this one before  but for some reason it does not taste as well as I he remembered. Most people mix it with milk though.
 This is my favorite whey.  The strawberry tastes awesome and its very cheap per serving.
 Couldn't be better, love me some protein!!
 Taste good, Easy to mix. I'm not super happy about results, but I understand it depends on overal diet and work out plan. I just started so  maybe some results will be visible later on.
 The taste is really good and it's really enjoyable with water as well. Since some powders are not drinkable with water I think this is a plus. I would recommend everyone who's drinking protein shakes to take it with water anyway. The effect is indisputable existent.
 Fast shipping and no hassles. The chocolate mint is probably the flavor I've enjoyed the least so far, hence the 4 stars. Still good, just definitely not up to par with ON's usual flavor.
 The straw berry flavor is one of the best flavors of protein I've had. Unlike a lot of other protein flavors including some other ON flavors this protein does not have a bad after taste and it tastes like strawberry ice cream or strawberry milk. Overall very pleased with product and plan on buying again.
 70+ servings with 25 grams of protein, low in calories, low in carbs, and sugar for each serving. Also, for 70+ servings this protein is very affordable too, compared to GNC brands, Muscletech, and BSN brands which offer less servings for the same price.
 Tastes great, recover is good, and helps with muscle development.
 for my sons
 Just wanted to give a shoutout for the Chocolate Coconut flavor since I've not seen anyone else write about it.  It used to be more expensive than the other flavors but now seems to be around the same price.  It blends superbly with water and tastes great just like that.  The other flavor I tried is Chocolate Mint and that one I had to mix it with milk or gag trying to drink it.  Hope this helps anyone looking for a new flavor.
 good
 This is only the second flavor I've tried (Mint Chocolate was the first which wasn't that bad) and maybe it's because I mix it with unsweetened almond milk, but WOW! DELICIOUS! I'm so glad I bought the big barrel of this! I also mix in 2 T of wheat germ, which I don't *think* changes the flavor. This is like drinking an almond shortbread cookie! It's not too sweet, as I am not partial to sweet tastes usually. I highly recommend!
 It's a great product, good price through Amazon and it tastes very good.
 Taste is too terrible. I’ll never purchase again, and don’t recomment any one buy it. I’m so up set about it.
 Son has been buying this over and over again , so it must work. He works out almost everyday.
 Probably the worst tasting protein shake I have tried. Awful!
 This stuff mixes well with milk or water and tastes great.
 ive tried other companies but i keep coming back to ON. the chocolate flavors are the best ive had.
 I really like it, and it actually tastes pretty good. I mix it in with nonfat milk and it tastes amazing.
 Love it so far. Costco has this beat on price though. Only reason I did not give it 5 stars.
 I always look forward to making this after working out.
 A good quality easy mixable protein powder.  Can't go wrong with Optimum Nutrition.
 Diarrhea. Can’t use this anymore and need to return. How do I contact the seller?
 Best value, great tasting especially when mixed with peanut butter in the blender.... I tried many different proteins, and this one is the best bang for the buck
 The whey protein inside is great, but these giant bags are a pain to deal with. They're tough to open, store, and don't really have any cost difference when compared to the 5-LB tub.
 Best flavor Whey in my opinions, break with 1% milk
 As a certified trainer with degrees in biology and exercise physiology nI have never been happier with a protein supplemnent. Best on the market for men or women.
 My husband loves this protein it helps him when he excersize to feel energized and he loves the flavor. Is the 2 time buying it here on amazon...
 Tastes better than Double chocolate.
 Pretty good.  We had gotten a whey protein drink from our health club that was made with Stevia instead of sugar and<br/>it was way too sweet, this is much better.  I'd rather have it have sugar in it than be too sweet with an artificial sweetener.
 Tastes great and dissolves easily and completely.
 Tastes great
 Best flavor out there.
 EXCELENT PRODUCT. I KEEP BUYING IT, SINCE I STARTED USING IT TWO YEARS AGO.
 amazing good
 Great value protein powder.
 I've been using this protein powder for years. It has a great taste with few ingredients and isn't loaded with a bunch of sweeteners or sugar. I would recommend this product to everyone!
 This is the only protein shake I can drink without getting a stomach ache, or making me gag. The taste is all right, but I dilute it with lots of water to get it down easier.
 Amazing flavor.
 Mixes easy and for protein powder it tastes good. I have tried a variety and the Optimum brand is by far one of the best tasting. Very easy to mix 8oz of water and two scoops for a quick tasty 48g of protein.
 Love this protein powder. Vanilla is delicious and goes pretty much with any fruit or berries. High quality.
 You know a great tasting protein powder when you just mix water with it and it tastes great. It tastes just like chocolate milk to me. Sometimes I will drop a scoop of this in my morning coffee after it has cooled slightly. It takes a bit of stiring but tastes great. Mix-ability is great with a shaker cup.
 Great source of protein at a great price. This is a real big 5 gal jug which saves you some mula.
 Dissolves well in water, great taste. Definitely recommended
 Great flavor and mixes easily!
 I drink this ALL THE TIME. If it weren't totally delicious, I would have gotten sick of it in the last 10 buckets...but I haven't.
 It tastes great.
 Was content with this product - delivers as explained in the description.  Gotta love high protein!
 This is one of the best whey proteins that I have ever used. It mixes clean and has little to no clump. It comes in several delicious flavors and does not contain a lot of additives and sugars.
 Excellent product. Will buy again.
 Mocha Cap is by far my favorite flavor of protein shake. No clumps, overall amazing product. You do pay for it however with this being one of the more expensive wheys. Currently on muscletech milk chocolate for the price, but the flavor is non-comparable.
 If I had to review ON Whey with one word it would be "Awesome"<br/><br/>Best Whey I have ever used by far. Me being into MMA and Crossfit, I look for a quality protein/meal supplement, and ON is by far the best. I'm not going to say "oh this stuff will get you jacked or that you will get massive gains" because as a fighter I'm not looking for that in any way, But I will say if you are looking for a quality protein supplement ON sets the bar for me and my training. But that's just one mans opinion.<br/><br/>Using Coffee flavor right now and man its SoOoOoOooo Good
 DO NOT BUY! Tastes like garbage. I should have listened to the recent top reviews. Don't make my mistake!
 This flavor is really delicious. I really enjoy this with milk shakes and general protein shakes.<br/>Also this protein is a good balanced protein which includes all the nutrition.<br/>This is moderately sweet which makes it perfect to drink unlike Muscletech protein which is too sweet to handle.
 You get what you pay for...so I look for the best bang for the buck. This is great quality and comes in multiple flavors. Some better than others.
 I bought double rich chocolate flavor by mistake. It tastes bad and the after taste is worse. The extreme milk chocolate tastes so much better. I won't make this mistake again.
 Chocolate Mint Taste 9/10. I have tried about 20 flavors and this is my favorite
 Buying again
 Bought the double chocolate and this stuff is delicious. It has protein in it which is what I want, but the flavor is soooo good. I dont write many reviews, but this stuff is great, especially if you add some milk and Greek yogurt to it. Tastes better than a Steak n Shake milkshake
 Just use it for one week, one significant change is it help u maintaining good body status that not easy to get feeling tired, I do work out every day, hope it works for improving the muscle
 bomb.
 Hands down best protein at an affordable price too! I drink this 2-3 times a day which helps me build muscle and maintain it as well
 A++++++
 Works great.
 Great tasting, good pricing. Not too many crazy things in the ingredients. Doesn't dissolve well in cold drinks but doesn't bother me.
 This Whey is outstanding.
 This protien powder taste delicious.  It has great nutritional value. Pop it in the blender with ice and it is a refreshing ice coffee drink!
 Absolutely the best Whey mix in my opinion. The taste is amazing (chocolate) and mixes so perfectly along with my other supplements I just couldn't ask for more!
 This is a great protein food. Flavor is good and mixes easily with any liquid. I especially like it with orange juice or milk. This has high protein with little calories so you can gain muscle without gaining fat.
 It was recommended by a friend who is a personal trainer and also knows a lot about nutrition. Soyfree and delicious! Easily mixes with coconut or almond milk or water and is never gritty. I use it at least 4 times a week in my breakfast smoothie.
 I'm pleased
 I would give it a five but I personally did not like the taste of the double rich chocolate flavor
 Mocha flavor tasts great hot or cold.  In the morning ill heat up the water before its mixed tastes just like coffee. After workout ill throw a few ice cubes in it and BAM! iced coffee
 ON is a great product! Thanks
 Everyone knows this is the champion!
 It says it all, Gold Standard!
 Product is great. Normally gold standard comes with the scooper to match their serving size but this one didnt.
 mixes really quickly and easily, even just with water, and one of the better tasting of the options i've tried
 This is way too sweet. I really like coconut flavor stuff but this was just too much for me
 Great taste and mixes well.  Sits well with my stomach as well.  Great product.
 I was 130 lb and after Taking this I have bulked up so much, I will be working as the mountain in the next season of game of thrones.
 I have always used this product whenever i started to get back into the gym again. I never was a fan of mixing protein with milk etc. I would highly recommend mixing this with JET BLENDED BEVERAGE BASE. That is the mix they use at X-Sport if you get a protein "shake". Tastes amazing... Go to corainc.com. They have the best deal for the mix.
 GNC Pro Performance Chocolate Supreme tastes better but has more carbs (6 grams in GNC vs. 3 grams in ON).  Other than than, you're just paying for protein.
 Best protein I have ever used so far and I've been taking protein powders since 1973. Just wish a subscription was offered with this one.
 +great+++
 The ON Gold Standard is amongst the best whey protein powders and they have a ton of flavors to suit just about anyone. It mixes very easily in just a shaker. I love coconut, so the choco/coconut is my favorite.
 I love the effectiveness of this product but I don't like the taste. I will however keep purchasing it. I will just try the other flavor.
 Best protein supplement I've ever tried. Highly recommended
 I bought this from amazon and found a great price here. The local store is much more expensive. I have tried both chocolate and vanilla, both are good when mixed with milk instead of water.
 The favor was not great but it's protein
 Great price.
 My go to Whey. High quality product with grear taste.  Amazon shipped it quick.
 I've been using ON products for years, and had moved to some of their other whey offerings lately. I decided to go back and use some Gold Standard for a while. Upon returning I (now) remember two important things:<br/><br/>- Gold Standard is a much better value vs. the higher priced ON whey offerings like hydrowhey/hydrobuilder<br/>- Gold Standard doesn't mix quite as well as the hydrowhey/hydrobuilder (and because you use less of it per serving, tastes less creamy)<br/><br/>There are many times I'll mix one scoop gold standard whey (chocolate or strawberry) with one scoop gold standard casein (vanilla or banana). The casein mixes a bit thicker than the whey, and the combination results in a pleasing blend/texture/taste.<br/><br/>In any event, if you're looking for a good value, high quality product - this is it.
 Taste good and mixes with milk easily.
 This gives me the energy I need when I can't make food in the mornings it fills u up to the point were ur stomach isn't making those embarrassing noises while your at school or work
 Great price
 Great taste, blends well.
 I bought the 5lb tub of Double Chocolate after reading all the recommendations here.  I'm glad I did cause the taste is very good.  I use 1 cup of Lactaid 1% milk and a scoop of powder in a blender and it's perfect.  Tried mixing some vanilla yogurt but that ruined the taste.
 Good job, Help tremendously for post workout. Keep up the good work..
 Fast shipping and good price
 By far the best flavor on the market
 Good stuff, just wish they had a version without artificial sweatners. Even there 'natural' version does.
 I love this protein product, however I ordered cookies and cream, the container says "cookies and cream" , It smells and tastes like coffee, or cappuccino... so there's that...
 A good-tasting protein powder, without a lot of extra junk in it.
 I have being using this stuff for years now. Its a great source of clean protein that should be a cornerstone of any workout.
 coffee flavor makes it more enjoyable in the AM!
 good stuff
 The taste was horrible. I wanted mint chocolate and tasted even worse than just regular chocolate .
 High quality, excellent taste and there is a measuring cup, you have to dig it out though. Mixes well with a spoon,  I have used it in water and milk, milk is better
 Very tasteful in shakes.<br/>I will definitely buy this brand again.
 Its basic protein and you cant go wrong with basic
 This is a good quality whey protein with no added fluff. It tastes good and mixes easy even without a special mixing bottle. I've used it for a long time and it has always served me well.
 Solid results from this product.  It is consistent and priced to sell!  This is our "GO-TO" protein.  HIghly recommended by this 46 year old fitness minded Dad with two athletic high-schoolers!  Great product.
 My favorite protein to use. And banana is by far my favorite flavor.
 I'm a big fan of this product. Banana cream is by far the best I've tried. Strawberry banana is also good. You can never go wrong with the double dark chocolate. The vanila ice-cream is not that good. Tastes like doo doo vanila protein with this weird little sweet aftertaste. Stick with the first three I mentioned, and you'll be good. Waiting to try cookies and cream.
 I am new to using protein supplements, but I am not at all disappointed with this product. It tastes so good I want to drink it just for the taste, not because of the protein!
 Great product as aways !
 This whey protein does not upset my stomach like other brands do. Good price. I will continue to buy.
 I'm very happy with this protein powder. I have never tried any before and the review if the flavors prompted me to buy the Rocky Road flavor. I think it tastes great with almond milk.
 Tasty and easy to mix, I have been turning to Optimum Nutrition's Gold Standard 100% Whey for quite some time now. I've mixed it up and purchased other proteins when I see some very good deals and invariably, I am not as happy with any of the others I've tried (EAS, Olly, GNC, etc) and am glad I returned to ON w/my latest purchase of Rocky Road.  Rocky Road is a bit more sweet than Double-Rich Choco which is my go-to, and a nice change-up. I can't say a bad thing about either of them really. For the calorie content I feel like I'm getting some quality protein and recovery each time. Great product, I'll buy more.
 Tastes pretty good and seems to cut my carb cravings.  Just what it was advertised to be.
 French Vanilla tastes great and mixes easily with water.
 Mocha Cappuccino is so delicious! I can drink it with water, milk, or coffee. It's just amazing any way. It's definitely my new favorite.
 Highly recommended. Great taste and it mixes very well. I tend to use warm water
 The ten pound bag is about the best deal on whey protein you can find.  I originally gave this 4 stars because I didn't think the taste was as good as some other chocolate whey proteins I have had.  The more I used it the more the taste grew on me.  I now love the taste so I edited my review to 5 stars.<br/><br/>I will definitely buy again.
 Very good product.  Good taste.  Mixes easliy.
 Good flavor
 this product is amazing with enriched soymilk and tastes just like a milkshake when cold, mmm!<br/><br/>within a week of hard workouts i noticed results, great product will buy more!
 works
 Great product and delicious taste ^_^ I recommend this to the girls who have recently started their weight training... only make sure that you are drinking the right amount. I say Go for this product (Y)
 This is one of the best powder protein products I have used.  It easily shakes/stirs to mix with water, juice or milk and leaves no clumps!!  An athlete's dream!!!  Thanks Optimum for the easy mix product....
 Made me muscles huge wood buy again.
 Great quality; great results.  Chocolate flavor is so delicious I haven't tried anything else!
 Best in the market . It has the best labor
 Solid deal. Beats body buildings price at the time.
 Love it!
 This tastes a million times better than any other protein powder I have tried.
 If you're a coffee person, this helps make for a great coffee protein shake.
 I dont know about results, since i am inconsistent. But I love the taste and it seems to be giving the extra energy (protein) i need in the morning in my shake. i do feel its a quality product.
 I began to weight lift with a friend not too long ago simply to bulk up. I searched online, all of them will surely mention Optimum Nutrition Whey on their top choices. Considering the price is only about $5 more than other brands, I decided to give it a shot.<br/><br/>I picked the coffee taste since it is an easier flavor to be blended into milk, soy milk or even water. With a mixer cup and some vigorous shaking, the powder dissolves quite well. To me, the taste is better than the usual chocolate or strawberry flabors.<br/><br/>I managed to gain 5 pounds in the first 2 weeks of lifting (3 days per week, about one hour each session). However, that's just me, YMMV.
 I recibe my goldstandard proteín (10 pounds) scratches on a side, Also that Make that my protein is droping away.
 Probably the best protein that I have used. Love the results when using this brand!!!
 Great product!
 One of the best whey's you can buy for the price. I've been using it for years.
 I've been buying this brand and flavor for years!! It is delicious! Extreme milk chocolate is the best flavor I have had.
 We've been buying this protein for years now, my favorite are the cookies n cream, vanilla, rocky road, banana, they are all yummy;) can't go wrong with this brand and the nutritional numbers are on point!
 Came with no seal! Can’t use.  And won’t be ordering again.
 Been using Gold Standard for a while. It is my daily morning shake and is amazing, never have any digestion or stomach problems. Tastes very good in the chocolate flavor and mixes well.<br/>Buy it in the big 5 pound quantities and has a good number of servings, low fat and carbs.<br/><br/>ON has always delivered good results and quality product so I trust them.
 Good protein
 Excellent
 60+ servings for a $60..most affordable, best tasting quality protein on the market.
 good product
 Super good and my husband has gained 20lbs in one month :) He is exercising 4-5 times a week but no more than an hr. Really recommend it!!
 French vanilla is about the worst thing i have ever tasted i regret assisting money on it.
 This is the best stuff on the market
 Great tasting protein, mixes well with water or milk and great price for the size....vanilla ice cream is also a great mixtures with fruits or PB
 I've always been a fan of this product since I first tried it
 This stuff was SO BAD. It made me want to vomit very time I tried to drink it. My husband had the same reaction, so it wasn't just me. We bought the 5lb container and had to throw the entire thing away. It smells horrific (spoiled milk mixed with chemicals anyone?). It's very thin (regardless of how much water I used, it was still thin) and was just gross. The ingredients on this product are good but I wouldn't recommend the double rich chocolate. Maybe If I had mixed it with milk, it would have worked, but I'm allergic to milk. That being said, it might work for you. Not for me. I'm going to try another flavor. I'll keep you updated.<br/><br/>UPDATE: Okay so the double chocolate was really gross. Knowing that it is a very popular flavor, I might have gotten on e that was bad, I'm not sure. I purchased the strawberry delicious flavor from GNC and it is REALLY good. Just as I was expecting the first time haha. It is creamy, thick, doesn't smell bad and doesn't leave a weird after taste. Really good!
 While I have previously reviewed Synth-6 and loved it, that was when I was first trying out different types of protein drinks.  I must say after doing much research and speaking with a few physical trainers, ON seems to be the best for packing on muscle.  It is lower in calories than a lot of others and includes glutamine and a lot of BCAA's which is very essential if you are hitting the gym hard.  I'm on my third bottle now.  The taste isn't nearly as good as synth-6 or muscle milk.  But the protein, glutamine, and BCAA's that you are receiving with each scoop are well worth it!  I'd highly recommend this product.
 This is a tasty protein powder that I use for protein shakes and my girlfriend uses in her breakfast smoothies.  It's yummy.  I usually mix it with half skim milk and half water.
 This is very good for just a whey protein mix. It is low in fat and carbs, so there is no way it's going to taste like Muscle Milk or anything, but this is lightyears ahead of other low carb, low fat whey mixes I've had. It mixed VERY well, and it actually tastes pretty good, downright tasty when mixed in milk! It even includes a healthy dose of glutamine, aminos, and other complexes. And with Subscribe and Save and Super Saver shipping, I really couldn't be happier! I've heard good things about the vanilla flavor too, I'll have to give that a shot next...
 yummy
 Came on time, taste great doesn't expire for 3 or so years, well mine at least.<br/>You can never go wrong with Gold Standard whey!
 This is the only protein I get now. Truly the gold standard.
 I am very happy with ON Whey; they supply a great product for a great price. As any whey user knows, it can be hard to get a good protein powder that doesn't cost an arm and a leg. "Extreme Milk Chocolate" powder mixes very well and offers great nutritional content. I must say though, for chocolate whey powders, the ON "Double Rich Chocolate" tastes better to me.
 Only protein we buy. Great taste, mixes well and delivers results.
 This product taste great but causes me to have severe stomach discomfort and flu like effects almost immediately after drinking it.  I have taken many protein supplements and never had a problem but I have had a very bad reaction to this one.  I had my wife try it and she had the same effect.  It may just be a bad batch or the particular flavor.
 The taste is really good with a dairy product. With water not so much. It doesn't mix very well when making a smoothie with fresh fruits. Other than that, great product.
 Always the go-to for protein. Most affordable is right here on amazon.
 this was maybe my 3rd or 4th time purchasing this same product from the same seller. very good value! always arrived before estimated shipping date. i use 4-5 scoops a week, and the 5-lb package lasts me about 5 months. IMPORTANT - please note that this whey protein is one of the ONLY by Optimum Nutrition that does NOT contain sucralose, AKA aspartame (which i highly advise against and can pose a serious health risk) - and it's flavored artificially instead. if you do not prefer anything with sucralose OR artificial sweetener, check out the "natural" whey protein like by Optimum Nutrition (chocolate, vanilla and strawberry flavors, last time i checked) :)
 DO NOT BUY THE DOUBLE CHOCOLATE ONE.<br/>All those one star reviews are soooo true. It tastes extremely diluted.
 Tastes good, mixes easily. My skin broke out after starting taking this supplement, so I had to switch back to my old brand. My sister took the leftovers and likes it just fine. No skin problems
 Love this protein. This flavor, Cookies &amp; Cream was WAYY too sweet for my liking and chalky. I love the Chocolate flavor. This has been crucial in my weight loss. Works incredibly well in a blender bottle.
 What can you say that they're not, it's the "gold standard" Shakes/mixes fast, tastes good, low fat and it works.
 Taste good. Has glutamine and bcaa's in it. I like it.
 Best protein supplement I have used. Price is reasonable and much less than many other products om the market.
 Superb taste, mix it WELL with water or milk....
 I love the flavor and the energy boost!
 Opened package to find that the container was already open and the box was full of protein powder and spilled all over my living area.
 Replacement order.  My son got me started using whey protein to supplement my workouts and running activities.  This makes a great, refreshing shake now that the summer weather is with us.  Thanks!
 Tastes delicious, although there is some debate about how accurate the nutritional facts are. Still probably my favorite.
 This flavour is awful. The protein itself is good, but the taste isn't.
 Seems like a fairly priced, good tasting whey protein without any fillers. ON doesn't waste their money on fancy packaging, which I like. Just seems like a more legitimate product than many of the other flashy brands out there.
 EXCELLENT PRODUCT, I recommend it, after  You drink the milkshake, you feel the power and you inmediatly feel better. It's a great complement.
 On Whey is high quality protein without all the added junk at a fair price.
 Best protein out there!
 I've used this brand for a while and I love it. The vanilla ice-cream is my go to flavor, it mixes well and is not chalky at all.
 Tastes great,
 Once you taste this whey protein, there is no going back.
 Great shake, I do notice that it is SLIGHTY less sweet than other brands though. It also seem to not thicken up as much as other brands as well, I have the cookies and cream flavor and whenever I want a nice thick shake to curb ice cream or milkshake cravings, I find myself mixing this with my syntha-6 to get the desired thickness. I do use 2% milk and some ice for the bases of all my shakes.
 The coffee flavor is really really ridiculously good. i'll often buy the bottled coffee drinks at gas stations, and this stuff is just as good. Mixes perfectly, tastes awesome!!
 Five stars, however price for it is not as low as it can be. You can definitely find better flavor and pricing for you amount you pay.
 good
 Best tasting and cost effective protein on the market.  When you compare the per pound or per ounce price it's actually one of the best and the taste just cant be beat
 Excellent
 great brand, great quality
 Love it!!
 I have been using this product for about 8 months.  Seems to work.  I am pretty cut for a 54 year old guy.  I would have a six pack if I didn't drink a case a week.
 great product and great taste I mix it with ON unflavored creatine powder.
 Great Taste.  One observation is in mixing in a silver bullet.  We use ice, equal and water, and this WHEY expands more than others.  Not a big deal just to use a little less ice; still tasted great.
 Alright let's be honest here: most supplements taste terrible. The double rich chocolate mixed with milk is actually not bad. I'm not saying I'd drink this straight up all the time. I'm just saying that I used to avoid taking some whey powders because they tasted that bad that you'd have to choke it down - which is not a desirable experience. I've been getting strictly ON products for about 4-5 years now and they work.<br/><br/>Last thing, I would highly recommend getting these products online. It's way cheaper than driving all the way to a store like GNC and paying more (even with my Gold Card discount). Go with the larger 10 lb size too. You can just scoop it from the bag into your old 5 lb jar.
 I was using a different whey protein product before going back to ON and for some reason I feel as if it's not as sweet or flavorful as it used to be.
 For starters I don't drink coffee...as in I drink it maybe once a year if that. I don't  mind the taste, I just haven't ever been addicted or felt the need to drink it. I chose to try out the Mocha Cappuccino because of the high marks I found on the internet that had it ranked the highest among all the flavors this protein powder comes in ( more flavors than anyother protein powder out there).<br/><br/>I mix one scoop or so with about 8oz of whole milk in a shaker and the taste is a creamy, sweet, coffee to me. Exactly a mocha cappuccino flavor which is anything but coffee once you add all the frilly stuff to it.  If you like cappuccino then you will love this powder.
 I don't usually rate products because everybody has their own brand or product they like. But for me whose looking to become lean and maintain a good muscle mass this is fantastic choice. In addition of taking Optimum Nutrition Pro Complex and 100 % casein.  It provides a 24 g of protein and with 5 grams of BCAA. You can take it before workout, after workout or even when you need some Protein in your system. Overall, great product, great taste and if you want to make it better add milk and slice of banana for even greater taste.
 After using this every day for over a month it's still delicious! The chocolate flavor seems a little better than the cookies and cream so I think I'll be going back to that next time.
 the material in the container had a different consistency than i have ever seen. I have been using this product for years and was concerned about the storage practices of this vendor.  also took way too long to deliver.
 I use this protein all the time. Tastes good.
 This is the only protein I trust.  This product definitely helped my gains.
 this stuff is great. i have tried many types of protein powders, i think this one has the best chocolate flavor.
 The cake batter was not as good as everyone says. From a pure flavor perspective I prefer musclepharm!
 MIXES WELL, GREAT TASTE, 24GR OF PROTEIN, GLUTAMINE AND BCAAS INCLUDED. AMAZING PRODUCT VERY HAPPY, A MUST FOR ANY PERSON IN SPORTS!
 My favorite protein powder
 Rocky Road flavor is best when combining with Dextrose- not too sweet like other flavors.
 This flavor taste real good!  It digests really well ... no gas problems ...  I just started using it and  already am noticing  improvements (mass/strength) ...  This is a good choice &amp; the price is right !
 Excellent product especially for the price range. Have used it for over 3 years going, and still find it to be my favorite even after trying up to 6 other brands.
 the taste is not good at all, only able to take it with milk with water its super bad the smell is horrible
 great price and taste great.
 this i by far the best protein powder I've ever tried. i have gone through countless tubs of powder to help my "lean mass" look, but no other protein powder has made as much of a difference as gold standard. it only has 24g which is perfect! don't be fooled by other protein powders claiming 50g because anymore then 25 and you will just shit it out. Like most protein you won't see an immediate change, but it will bring consistent results and make you feel great! tastes amazing too!!
 After buying white chocolate flavor twice in a row, I kind of get tired of it, even though initially I had loved it. Then I tried this Extreme Milk Chocolate (and I was prejudiced since I don't like the chocolate flavor much). This extreme milk flavor is simply AMAZING. It is super delicious. Today I had it three times even though I didn't work out. I know it is not good to use that much and I never use the days I don't work out but I simply couldnt stop myself. It is super delicious with milk, and very good with water too. It mixes well as well. So far it is the best flavor I tried (I had tried chocolate (6/10), white chocolate (8/10), banana (7/10), banana &amp; strawberry (7/10) and vanilla (3/10)). I give this 9/10 but taste is 10/10 for sure. 1 point is gone because of the bad smell when it is in powder form. Yet, once it meets milk or water the smell is great too!<br/><br/>Lastly, shipping was very fast too.<br/>I recommend this to everyone!
 tastey
 I've tried a lot of protein powders throughout the years and nothing compares to the quality found in ON products. Mixes easily with water, milk, or whatever else you want to add it to using a spoon or a shaker cup.
 I tried quite a few different whey protein powders until I found the Gold Standard.  The flavor is awesome and I'm already on my third container.
 good stuff
 Works Great
 I love this protein, it mixes well and tastes good.  This came highly recommended by my personal trainer
 Just for info :My brother lost half of his liver in war.After 9 months of consuming organic cheese and drinking whey protein (leftover water  when making  cheese) his liver grew back to the original size completely healthy.Therefore if you have liver problems you should make your own.<br/>In meantime after consuming this product i started to use organic (safety) i still am thankful to this product as it was my first to help me with liver issues.This is a great supplement for anyone not only intended for body builders.<br/><br/>Calories: 120<br/>-Calories from Fat: 10<br/>Total Fat: 1g<br/>-Saturated Fat: 0.5g<br/>Cholesterol: 30mg<br/>Total Carbohydrates: 3g<br/>-Sugars: 1g<br/>Protein: 24g<br/>Calcium: 140mg<br/>Sodium: 60mg<br/>Potassium: 220mg<br/>Enzyme Blend: 25mg<br/>-Aminogen --<br/>-Lactase --
 Love this product...not sure what happened, but I definitely ordered the Cookies and Cream flavor and received "Delicious" Strawberry. I would give 3 stars, but this flavor is just terrible....so bad...but thumbs up for Whey
 This is a very great product. Totally worth the price for its great quality and taste. All flavors are great but my favorite so far is chocolate. Will purchase again.
 Amazing flavor!!
 Can't argue with results. The Double Rich Chocolate is the flavor I always get
 Best brand by far for your after workout protein needs. Flavors are easy to drink with no bad after taste.
 Great product. I would buy it again
 Horrible tasting product. Will never buy again.
 Great price and great product!
 excelent
 Chocolate Coconut is a winner.. love the taste
 Good protein at a good price. Tastes good, mixes well and the price is right. Definitely recommended.
 Vanilla gets very old after a while. Tastes tons better if you add a couple tablespoons of honey.  Great product not to drink, but to add to pancakes and different recipes.
 Good taste
 One of my favorite proteins. Wonderful flavor and a very good quality as well. This and Elite Gourmet are the best proteins on the market IMO.
 After consuming this, I feel the effects of a stimulant.
 Great favorite.  My husband's favorite so far.
 The best Whey protein on the market. Blends and tastes great.
 Good!
 Great Product, shipped fast and in condition expected. Thank you! Would definitely recommend to others!
 For me, protein has to meet these 3 criteria:<br/>1) actually has protein (and enough of it, kind I want, etc.)<br/>2) tastes good (otherwise I'm not gonna drink it)<br/>3) affordable<br/><br/>I've done the Wal-Mart brands and they did fine mixed with nonfat milk and were a teeny-tiny bit less on the dollar.  Same with shopping at Target, but only if I watched the deals.  But I could never make the switch to water instead of milk.  They didn't mix well and taste good.<br/><br/>Going with this ON stuff, I can mix it with water and I'm good.<br/>Plus my cost went down as I'm not buying a ton of milk<br/>Plus I'm not taking in a bunch of milk that I'd rather not (though I like milk..just cutting it more)<br/>And mixing with water, now I can easily just have ON at work midday, I don't have to have milk refrigerated with me and all
 Great quality, great taste.
 I liked it very much. I work out almost everyday and take a scoop after each workout. It has help me prevent weight loss dramatically which is very good for me. I wanted to keep me weight pretty constant.
 Tastes great, woooooo
 Good taste and a great price!
 Love it
 First time buying optimum nutrition whey, I have used many other brands but I am probably sticking with this brand now, mixes instantly, taste is awesome, cost effective, and the macro nutrients are very well balanced. I also ordered the Optimum Nutrition Extreme Milk Chocolate Whey, and what I do is, I take 1 scoop of Mocha Cappuccino and 1 scoop of the Extreme Milk Chocolate, it taste amazing, like a chocolate iced coffe
 Took my breakfast fruit smoothie to another level! Strawberry is the best by far for taste.
 This is my favorite protein shake. Mostly because of the flavor (Double Rich Chocolate) and because it's relatively easy to mix. It comes in many different sizes, but this 10lb one is my favorite, because I don't have to order as often saving me shipping and handling costs, unless of course you have Prime.
 I mix mine with Skim milk makes it taste a whole lot better than water.
 hubbie loves
 Now Im not Overreacting or Overselling this Product.<br/>But you really get what you pay for.<br/>It's Pricy,If I say so myself.<br/>Wish it was cheaper.<br/>But I don't see myself in taking any other Protein Supplement.<br/>This One does the Job,It taste Great.<br/>I literally look Forward to Have a glass of this each night I work out.<br/>Whole Milk + ON Protein = Scrumptious Beverage.<br/>Buy it. You won't Regret it.
 Great product
 This is the best protein out there. The double chocolate is the best tasting and the 5 pound jar is the most economical way to go. Amazon price with free shipping is always competitive and delivery never has been a problem. Longtime happy customer of Optinum Nutrition.
 Good old protein. Beware of monster s***s.
 only whey brand i drink, it tastes great. love the mocha cappuccino flavor.  i bought this product since it has great reviews and the product didnt disappoint me
 Blends easily, smooth texture :) got a 2lb to try and got 5lb this time!
 I don't really have much to compare ON whey protein to because it is the only protein that I have used since starting to workout a year ago. It tastes great. It can be a little difficult to dissolve sometimes but like I said, I don't have a basis for comparison. I recommend the double rich chocholate because it isnt quite as sweet and I add dextrose to my post workout shake, which sweetens it up quite a bit.
 Recommended by our trainer . . . have used for years . . . not the cheapest but one of the best protein supplements.
 OG whey. Always works.
 Been buying this for years now.  Favorite brand and the only flavor I'll use anymore!
 YUM!<br/><br/>In a personal ninja:<br/>  1 scoop of this whey protein,<br/>  1 tbs of peanut butter,<br/>  a banana,<br/>  a handful of ice,<br/>  add almond milk to the "max fill" line<br/>  blend<br/>  enjoy!<br/><br/>It's sooo good. I also like it blended with Ice, coffee, and a little milk and honey. --I'm a barista.<br/>Try it!
 Best flavor regardless if you use milk or water as your base
 Good expiration date.
 Just as the headline states the overall taste of the strawberry banana is terrible. It has a chemical like aftertaste that I did not experience with the other ON 100% Whey flavors I had previously purchased (French Vanilla &amp; Chocolate Mint) - the product line itself if just fine and I will continue to purchase it since gaspari nutrition changed the protein blend of Myofusion to an inferior mix but I will not buy the strawberry banana flavor again.
 Jeez I never expected the bottle to be this big. So far the protein is great as well!
 awesome.  taste great
 I'm glad I found something that is affordable.
 The tastes its ok.
 Repeat customer here! Both strawberry/banana and banana cream are awesome!
 Excellent Whey protein.  Recommended by my gym.
 Has a better taste than some other brands of whey protein.
 You forget this is a protein supplement, it's as good as a trip to St*rbucks.
 Great product thus far
 good taste
 The best protein shake I have ever had. Mixes really well and tastes great. Super expensive though.
 great price but not so good on the taste .  I just put 2 scoops post workout and down it.
 good price, mixes well, a little thin at recommended dilution. less water or using milk helps.
 This is by far, the best flavor they can offer. I have tried the vanilla ice cream, milk chocolate, and cookies and cream, and so far, this flavor is theeee best! I can always drink it and never get tired of it. Taste great with my lactose free milk or Almond milk (requires more shaking though, since it doesnt break down easily in almond milk).
 The French vanilla is amazing just for the best experience ever use soy almond milk vanilla flavor
 Low sugars and all the amino acids required. The test is great as well. It also doesn't contain too much cholesterol, which I have noticed in other brands.
 Cheap. Efficient. Lasts a while. Mixes and tastes great. Ive stuck with this protein for the past 3 years but never wavered from chocolate. Every time I say im going to get a different flavor but I always go with classic dr chocolate. My favorite shake to use with this protein... scoop of c. protein, 1/4 c. oats, 6 oz skim milk, cup of ice, tb peanut butter, half of a banana. Enjoy.<br/>Calories 436<br/>Protein 39g<br/>Carbs 47g<br/>Fat  11g<br/>Sugar 21g
 Tastes great, priced right.
 Good quality whey protein at a good price. The flavor is great. Only thing I don't like is its use of artificial sweeteners, but it checks out in terms of quality in every other area.
 My lunch includes this protein powder virtually every day.  I mix 8oz of almond milk, 1 scoop of protein powder, 1 tablespoon of flaxseed meal, some kale (don't really like the taste), 1 tablespoon of peanut butter, 1 frozen banana and 7 ice cubes.  It is blended until it is the consistency of a milk shake.  It actually tastes pretty good and it is very healthy.  Try it!
 Really tastes good. I use this for after the gym......if u are looking for something low calories (120) and tastes good....this is for you
 Best tasting protein powder, and much cheaper than at the local supermarket.
 I was looking for a more vanilla taste but instead this was pretty bitter and not a lot of vanilla flavor.
 This is a great tasking protein supplement. It mixes easily and smoothly with water, milk or almond milk.  Hi quality protein with relatively low calories and nothing extra.
 Good stuff...Taste really good. I got the extreme milk chocolate flavor
 Good stuff
 Rocky Road tastes awesome even with water!!!!
 Taste good
 Best protein out there I recommend buying this 100%
 I bought this to add more protein to my daily diet because I've been working out more lately. The chocolate mint flavor is actually really good. It tastes a lot better than any other protein powder I've tried; it basically tastes like thin mints. I definitely would only mix with milk, though.
 Getting swole!
 Good value.  Nice flavor.  Easy to mix.  I'm lactose intolerant and this is one of the few brands of whey protein that doesn't upset my stomach.
 Been using this stuff for over 10 years - easily dissolves and tastes amaze balls!
 Great value for a very good quality product that my son uses.  Shipped directly to our home for no charge, we didn't even need to go out!
 Good price. Tastes great (coffee flavored is excellent)
 This flavor is more chocolate then minty.. don t order if you want a more mint flavor product
 Have been buying for years.
 It dissolves well and the flavor was above average for me but obviously flavor is a personal choice.  I'd buy it again.
 I get the mint chocolate flavor because it seems like it is the only one without a lot of artificial ingredients
 Tastes great, my favorite whey protein option. Highly recommend!
 This flavor - Strawberry Banana - is my least favorite of the 6-7 flavors I have tried by ON.  More importantly however; for some reason this whey flavor clumps a bit like casein does.  Understand that I have been using the same shaker cup as well.  I will not purchase again.  My other favorites without any issues by ON are Extreme Milk Chocolate and Rock road.  There was another Amazon reviewer that mentioned their favorites and mine closely resemble those as well.<br/><br/>I gave this 5 gallon drum of whey away after about 4 servings to a friend and I will patiently watch to see how long he can tolerate it.
 Ordered Multiple times, great taste, doesn't wad you up. Great Protein to sugar ratio and great for the money.
 Good but overpriced
 Been using the product for years. Love the flavor...especially when chilled.
 The best.
 Its ON Gold Standard. Need I say more? Consistently effective and tasty protein shake
 Great nutrition facts but not that good on the taste. Mix it up with milk and taste improved. It blends fine with water but the taste will be strong. If some one needs a proteine powder to mix with fruits or milk this is a good one but if you need to just dissolve it in water stick to chocolate.<br/><br/>Hope this help.
 Works as expected, highly recommend it.
 Price is right and quality product.
 Best protein I've found, and buying it through amazon is about 5 dollars cheaper than with a GNC gold card.
 I like the optimum Nutrition Gold standard Whey protein because it has everything I need in the powder.
 I have been using this stuff for years, and its the best one for the money.
 tastes great, it is protein powder...
 Now this is a real chocolate protein powder. Delicious and I can't wait until these are on special again.
 The least bad tasting of all the whey powders, and provides good quality protein.  Dissolves well.  Tastes OK.
 I use this as a post workout mix. The taste is fine with some cold water from the gym water cooler. Taste and texture improve with thicker liquid like milk or my favorite - almond milk. I am pleased with my experience.
 I saw other reviews saying that white chocolate is very good.<br/><br/>Excited as I was, I bought it instantly. However it doesn't taste all that great.<br/><br/>I guess it really depends on the person, but I would not recommend this favor.
 Taste is perfect!
 Best tasting protein I've ever used; I'll never switch.
 The product arrived on the expected date, as to the quality of it, well, it is ON, one of the best brands in the market, all their products are good, and this is not the exception.
 Everything is good but too sweet....
 yey
 First time buying any whey protein product. ON was recommended. I got a disturbing surprise inside the container while getting a scoop. I'm no expert but I don't think this is normal. Some kind of membrane filled with liquid chocolate. Now I'm wondering what was I consuming!
 Will definitely buy again as the protein by weight is 83%.
 Always a great product. Tastes great, mixes well, and satisfies my protein needs.
 This protein tasted very good, mixed well with water or milk, and was a great addition to my oatmeal each morning. And was priced very competitively per pound when compared to lower quality proteins.
 I've been using optimum whey protein for a number of years.  It's the best protein powder I've ever used. Great taste and easily dissolves in whatever you mix it with. I use it with oatmeal every morning to start the day off right !!
 Tastes horrible!!!!!!!
 Best protein quality/taste/mixability/nutrition facts for the price that I have ever found.  I've played around with some other proteins, but this really is the best bang for the buck I have found.
 Nice flavor.
 Best protein you can buy, period. Pure whey, no "weigh gaining" junk. A lot of servings.
 This was about the best deal I could find on Protein by the gram online, and it beats a lot of stores by far. I have no complaints about the product, tastes about as good as you can expect for a whey mix. There's a lot of servings per container and that helps keep me stocked up for a while. Overall I think it's a great deal.
 Best Protein
 This the same stuff on Bodybuilder.com and GNV
 This brand has been my go to for a long time!  Flavor is great, mixability is great and results are great.  Just wish it was a tad cheaper (but who doesn't :))
 My go to protein! Mixes well, low carbs, high protein.  Such a reliable source of protein.
 I've had some protein powders that are truly nasty.  I actually enjoy the taste of this one.  It also mixes well with water without having to use a blender or special mixing device.
 Delicious! Especially with some milk!
 great
 Great
 This tastes nothing like it's described. For a brand so highly touted, I'm very disappointed.
 This tastes great, has extraordinarily little grittiness and mixes well with water or milk. I wish they offered more variety packs, but the coffee, chocolate and vanilla ice cream have all been fine.
 I already use this Whey and I'm just in love!<br/>The price is very good for the size and to not get old I split with a friend and we can have good whey for a nice price.<br/>Came on the time.
 Nobody in this world will convince me to not 100% love this protein.
 Awesome 👏 taste good and arrived on time.
 I've been using ON Gold Whey for over 6 years now and it really is the best protein.  Mixes well, tastes great with milk. Price is hard to beat on Amazon too with the subscribe and save feature.
 Good 👌🏻
 I've been using this brand for quite awhile and I'm very happy with it!
 used to be skinny now I'm thick
 love the chocolate flavor of this one
 too sweet for my taste and impossible to tell what good it is doing
 This product will give you what your after...protein. I ordered the mint chocolate and it definitely fell short on taste. It tastes the way my socks smell after a good workout
 The flavor when mixed with water is not the best but goes good with milk/in a shake
 easily disolves in cold milk, and the taste is pretty good!
 The zipper on this bag absolutely sucks.  The taste is OK, MuscleTech is better but I guess you have to account for the additional carbs in the muscle Tech power.
 Great taste to it, and this is the perfect size to buy in bulk, at least in my opinion. I lift five times a week and this is plenty.
 I have tried numerous protein supplements through many years of weight training. Of all the powders, ready-to-drink, and bars this is the best product available!<br/>Not only do I see great results, I love the taste!
 I received this item, the lid is not completely closed and I think it's not used to be the new one.
 If you are looking for a all around protein, postworkout, preworkout, early in the morning, this is the one, tastes great, price is great, about 3 grams of carbs per serving for those cutting, if you are bulking you can add simple carbs, anyway, this and more makes this protein the actual gold standard in the market to which other proteins get compared, been using this for almost 3 years now and I am not looking back at the competition, because there is none.
 Best tasting protein I've had. I love this white chocolate flavor and wish they'd lower the price back down and it wasn't a limited edition.<br/><br/>I've tried several other flavors, too. This is a good brand.
 Just want I wanted, fast delivery.  Thank you.  I will continue to order from Amazon.
 I fine when we have this drink for breakfast we are full still lunch. Best part is that it taste good. :)
 Best whey protein out there. Double rich chocolate is great tasting and mixes easy. Have ordered several tubs and it is always fresh and consistant.
 I like the product in general, but there is very little taste.  I prefer the rocky road to this.
 Excellent product - totally smooth texture and tasty. Consistent quality.
 It is very good and the price is also affordable. The taste is good. It will become bad if you leave it for a long time therefore it is real protein. I love this product and if I would buy protein powder again, I will definitely choose this.
 Tastes delicious! No clumping or grittiness and can be used with any number of fresh fruits and still taste great.
 I will continue to purchase this item. I like the taste, and it’s working for me.
 I've been taking this protein for some time now and I like it. I plan to keep reordering it on Amazon because the price is the best here.
 Coffee flavor is not ideal if taken prior to going to sleep.
 Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard Whey - Strawberry<br/><br/>I had the chocolate before this. They both are great. I will say after some workouts I just don't feel like the sweetness of these. They aren't too sweet, like I said, some workouts (crossfit) I'm just exhausted and want water I guess.<br/><br/>I do wish they had less sodium. But all the other ingredients are on par for you. It just so happens that my crossfit coaches happen to recommend ON Gold Standard Whey.  The sodium adds to the taste I guess and I do like the taste.<br/><br/>This is my second bucket and would buy again; exploring more flavors. They do have a lot of flavors but I think most are of the sweeter/tastier variety. You just have to read the label as some will have more or less sodium or sugar.
 Great product, works for what I need!
 Great taste, although a bit weak compared to other flavors.  Mixes very well with just a shaker.  Can't go wrong with ON.
 Tastes delicious !
 Still the Gold Standard for me. Amazing flavor with very little sugar. For an added chocolate fix I like to mix it with dark chocolate almond milk in my shaker bottle. Talk about delicious!!
 Great product. The strawberry banana flavor is delicious. I usually blend smoothies with whey, frozen fruit and bananas, after working out. Also good to have for breakfast first thing in the morning.
 I am not a scientist but I love this protein.
 Delicious, 10/10 going to buy again
 I've tried double chocolate, mocha, and cake batter. Cake batter seems to go down easier than other flavors.<br/><br/>But the cake batter container came with the inside paper seal broken. The container had powder all around the top from leaking. It tastes fine but I want to let everyone know about this. And optimum nutrition should seal them better.
 All I can is hands down the best!!!
 Taste good with milk but was actually tolerable with water
 The price wasn't that good
 There's nothing more irritating than my gym trying to sell me protein powder for way more then I can find it when I shop around. This is by far the best price I've found for my favorite flavor of protein!
 I do not buy anything other than ON
 We order this all the time.  There are a lot of flavors and it is a big quantity and lasts a long time.  My friend who used to be a body builder and has tried every protein out there said this is the best.
 What is there to say about ON Whey that hasn't already been said about me...it's amazing and works like a charm.
 Good
 Best protein I have ever used. Great taste and mixes extremely well.
 This review is for the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor. I find it to be palitable, but not the best. This is only the second flavor I've tried, but I prefer the chocolate.
 Tastes nasty yuck
 Great product and had used it previously. Only draw back was it took two weeks to get delivered.
 Great all around protein. Mixes well with water, taste is good and the price is very reasonable for the serving size!
 I love this lroduct, but the chocolate is very bland.  Will not buy this flavor again.  The vanilla was very creamy and delicious.  I give it a 5 star.
 The flavor is good, most of the calories come from the protein.
 So far, so good!<br/>Loving this protein!! I got the cookies and cream flavor and it is absolutely delicious!<br/><br/>The jar it comes is is HUGE, i was very pleasantly surprised whwn i opened the box. It also comes filled (almost)  all the way to the very top with protein powder which I loved!<br/><br/>Definitely recommend!
 awesome nutrition
 Has a terrible aftertaste! Would not recommend.
 Taste good and it really helps my body recover from my workouts.
 I like the cake batter flavor so much!
 Product Seal was broken. Instructions said, seal must be intact.
 My favorite whey protein; the flavor isn't too strong and it tastes great.
 I ordered French vanilla.  It's the only flavor I've tried and I like it.  I use a bullet mixer and it takes about 15 seconds and mixes well.
 Always enjoyed Optimum Nutrition's line of proteins and supplements and their Whey Gold line definitely gives you a great amount of quality product for your dollar.  However, I can only give this flavor 4 out of 5 stars since it almost has no flavor at all, let alone any hint of Vanilla.  I'll be going back to the Delicious Strawberry and Mocha Cappuccino flavor once I'm done with the flavor.
 Bought the Double Chocolate. Tastes bad. It's like a bad medical milk drink with for kids.
 This was recommended to me by a personal trainer. I find it to be a great way to start my day..I'm not much of a breakfast person....
 Such a great taste
 You can never go wrong with this one.
 You can't go wrong with optimum nutrition. I typically go with chocolate malt or vanilla ice cream. Best Whey powder.
 Taste great, mixes up well.  (I used a shaker cup not a blender) and digests easily.
 I've tried all of the flavors, and this one is by far my favorite.
 The chocolate malt is a very good flavor, but not one you want to drink all of the time. It is also usually a lot more expensive than the other flavors, and the taste is not worth the additional cost.
 They changed the formula. It tastes a lot different than the previous version.
 Rated in the top 5 on many websites for lean protein. Low caloires, lots of protein, go for it.
 Solid Protein:Fat:Carb ratio for a quick protein shake on the go.  The flavor goes with anything from water, to greek yogurt, to coffee.  It's super light and gets the job done without making you feel as bloated as some of the other products out there do.
 Mmmmm. This is by far the best tasting protein mix I've ever had. I'm not a body builder (at all) so I can't attest to the muscle build aspect. I'm just a very busy working mom who needed a quick and easy breakfast. I mix with 4 oz of 2% Lactaid Milk and 4 oz of Trop50 Orange Juice, drink it while is cold - tastes just like an Orange Dreamcicle! Keeps calories and sugar down as well. I also have Celiac (gluten allergy) and have no problems with this mix.
 This is probably the best whey protein you can currently buy. 73 servings in a 5lb container is really impressive without uncompromising taste. Great for a post workout shake!
 I have been using this product for several years.... good taste, mixes well.  I like it.  Good value....this is a 10 lb bag not 5lb like most of the others
 taste good and easy to blend with water or milk
 Very good produt
 Great product at a good price. Mixes very well with water and has a very pleasant flavor. I am somewhat lactose intolerant, and this product has never given me any issues. Quality protein.
 I don't much about protein powders but this does seem to help. Ive put on some muscles using it in the past months, with exercise, you cant expect it to do all the work for you. Though I will warn you, this does not taste good as is. You will have to mix it in with a smoothie or do what I do and add it to your coffee in the mornings.
 mixes really well and taste good too.
 My husband loves this. Good protein shake for replacement meals and when he works out! Tastes great! He also adds frozen fruit.
 Good flavor, great price and rated very high by fitness magazines.
 Great taste.
 This stuff tastes good and mixes well unlike most protein. I use 2% milk with it maybe over kill but I like it better than with just water.
 Great for after a heavy workout.
 didnt taste as expected but its alright
 Best protein powder out there  Tastes just like chocolate milk.
 Taste great!
 Mixed it with low carb oj for a fantastic protein shake
 Great taste (even in water) and dissolves so easily that I don't have to drink 20+ oz of liquid every time I have a shake. Great product!
 Good supplement
 I rotate between this and NOW foods' product. NOW is quality but flavorless. ON is quality AND yummy!
 Excellent
 Good protein is hard to find. There are a lot of choices but I've heard good things about this brand before I even purchased it...and I'm glad I did.<br/><br/>Price is great and the taste is better than most protein products I've tried. The Mint Chocolate tastes like a Thin Mint shake. Musclemilk tastes a little better but it's not a pure whey protein product like this is.<br/><br/>Back to ON. It mixes really well so you won't get too many protein chunks floating in your shake.
 Optimum Nutrition is a reputable and well respected company. This product is very affordable compared to other protein supplements. It is high in quality, containing 24 grams of protein out of 29 grams(5.5g of which is BCAAs), and will satisfy your protein needs. This product has an acceptional taste. Mixing this product is easy and conveniet. I recommend this product to anyone whose purpose is to add in additional protein content or for weight training. Overall this product is a great protein supplemnt for its price, quality, and quantity. Great buy!
 The taste is great and the whey mixes so well with anything you throw at it. There's a reason they call this the Gold Standard.
 Tastes fine, mixes well, no issues. I have been a repeat customer.
 taste great !
 I bought this because of the low calories and high content of protein and other supplements. I was rather shocked at how bland it tasted coming from syntha 6 (best tasting I've ever tried) and syntha 6 isolate (not great but way better than this). I have been using 6oz of water to mix it and just have to down it quickly, tastes like I mixed chocolate syrup with water. Its much better if you mix it with milk, even skim boosts the flavor a bunch.<br/>You get a good value for your money, and the cap screws off with about a 1/2 turn! That's always been one of my pet peeves with protein buckets. I will be ordering again.
 Greater tast, but for me rocky road always has been my favorite chocolate bar and this flavor got that taste.
 Happy with the taste
 I love this protein. It's not quite as silky as some, but it taste great, has lower calories, and more servings per container than others.
 Great taste.  High quality protein.
 Of all of the protein powders I've used, this one is by far the best.  I don't get tired of drinking it every day like others with an odd taste.  Even if you like chocolate or other flavors, I'd recommend this flavor.  I prefer chocolate, but just add a tablespoon of Ovaltine to the mix and voilah ....chocolate!  ...and it tastes much better than the actual chocolate.
 Just got my brand new protein and did not have seal under lid like it had been opened
 Amazing taste as well as good calories to protein ratio!
 Great product. Great taste !!
 It stirs fine, and tastes fine.
 Tastes great in all types of shakes. It also stirs in very easily. Solid Protein powder from a solid brand.
 This product has become a major part of my supplement regiment.  Sometimes it is too hard to meet the protein macro number every day and this protein supplement is not only one of the best whey proteins out on the market but it makes hitting your protein macro for the day even easier.  The double chocolate tastes great and would recommend it to anyone else that works out or could use this properly in their diet.
 I'm loving this whey protein. It tastes great and mixes easily in a shaker bottle. The best one I tried yet. And the price point is great.
 Best protein on the market at a good price
 Easy to dissolve. Strawberry tastes good. Chocolate and vanilla are not good. french vanilla is gross.
 The best!
 part of my breakfast and post work-out regiment. the BCAA and protein profile in this product is dynamite for it's price! a good value!
 great
 I been drinking this for over 20 years and its the best protein drink I've ever used.
 I never had a whey product taste this good. I look forward to drinking it instead of feeling like it's a chore. Highly recommend this, oh yeah... it works too!
 I really love this product it really fulfills my hunger and very taste satisfy.
 I take it in the morning right away so it helps keep me feeling full.
 I like the high protein content, and the taste is great, not overly sweet. It mixes really well.
 Best protein ever, taste great and easy on the stomach.
 Exactly what you need if you're looking for protein powder. Tastes better than regular chocolate shakes if you make a shake out of it; peanut butter, a scoop of this, milk and bananas and it tastes 100x than a high sugar milkshake. I haven't tried any other flavor other than the double chocolate so I don't have much to compare to, but it does taste just fine in regular water too. Dissolved just fine in water as well. 70 servings for 40 dollars, can't go wrong with that! I've been buying them every month now, have two shakes a day. Works out fantastic!
 I received 5lb of French Vanilla Creme. The taste is absolutely disgusting!
 DELICIOUS and Healthy!  Can it be possible for these 2 words to be used together?  YES!  I am new to protein drinks, but this flavor knocked the protein blended shake out of the park!  My simple recipe is as follows:  1.5 scoops of this ON Banana Creme protein, 1 cup of water, 1/2 cup of frozen mixed berries, 1/2 cup of frozen strawberries and blend for 8 seconds.  Tastes AMAZING.  Healthwise - Calories 245, Fat 1.5g, Cholesterol 75mg, Sodium 210mg, Carbohydrates 23g (Dietary Fiber 6g &amp; Sugars 10.5g), Protein 36g.  Carbs 37%, Fat 5%, Protein 58%.<br/><br/>I use this between meals to increase my percentage of protein to carb for the day.  Fends off munchies and again, tastes delicious.  Feels like I am cheating every time I enjoy this frozen treat.
 Good taste, a little pricey, wish it were cheaper.
 No seal and no mesuring cup. Is it normal ?
 Received as described
 This is by far the best tasting and best ingredient wise protein I have ever tried. No regrets purchasing this tub!
 You don't need to take glutamine and BCAAs seperately in case you are using this product. Helps great with the recovery process as a post workout shake.
 Best product so far, I gonna stick with chocolate mint for awhile
 I have used this product in the past and have always found it to be as good as the ads and literature say it is.  This Optimum Nutrition product comes in several flavors and I have tried several but the Double Rich Chocolate is my favorite.  It is easy to mix with skim milk "my favorite" even if all you have is a shaker.  I would highly recommend this ON product to anyone seeking a high protein powdered drink mix.
 Probably the single best Whey out there. Mixes very well. Smooth to drink....if you've never had Gold Standard, buy a tub. You'll never want to have any other brand.
 This stuff is great! It's my go-to for protein. Tastes great and blends well.
 Great product. Results in progress. Feel full after drinking, so I think it is using its purpose. Would recommend.
 Tastes bad.
 Love it.  I ordered the French Vanilla Creme.  It's quite tasty.  Definitely recommend.  Mixes great for smoothies.
 Expensive but works for the purpose
 I order double rich chocolate but I received cookies and cream instead, I like the protein but I really disappointed with the favor that I got. So disappointed
 Optimum Nutrition is the only way to go.  Pure protein that gets you results.  Highly recommend it.
 Formula has been recently changed. Will not order again.
 Works as described.  Tastes great, even better with a little coco syrup.
 I have used alot of different proteins and this is the best for the money. This is a good protein if you want to maitain, gain or loose weight. Depending on what you want either increase or decrease the about of protein.
 Great protein I have purchased 4 of the 5 pound mocha
 This is my favorite protein to use if you haven't used it you must be new to protein powders it's the most popular one and for good reason.
 Strawberry flavor does not taste very good, but received product with no damage and as advertised!
 Great value. Great product. Taste is great and it isnt too high in carbs either. Im looking forward to trying new flavors soon.
 Ok but I don't like the taste
 I was using some cheaper crap prior to this, and found that this product mixes much more easily. Not sure how nutrition and quality of ingredients compare to cheaper brands, but it tastes fine and you don't have to shake it for 5 minutes just to get it to blend.
 Great taste. great product
 I order this all the time for our smoothies. Great flavor and price.
 Female here chiming in.  I am using protein powders post work out, not trying to build muscle yet, just trying to lose fat without losing muscle.  I have a hard time getting enough protein in my diet.  I love the protein to calorie ratio.  I don't eat red meat or pork (health reasons) and well...a person can only eat so much chicken and fish.  After much research I landed on protein shakes.  Cost of Optimum powder drove me to Sams where I bought, the very highly rated, 5# bag competitor brand and started my protein shake journey.  Some days they were breakfast (chocolate powder, chocolate almond milk, carrots, spinach, and ice.  or vanilla ice cream powder, strawberries, vanilla almond milk, carrots, spinach, and ice..all whirred up in my blender), some days they were just a quick after gym protein. I loved it.<br/><br/>Less than a month in I started experiencing extreme stomach pains.  I actually thought it was from my new coffee syrup flavor so I ditched it.  Pains continued.  I happened to mention it to the hubs and HE was also experiencing pains.  Didn't take long to realize it was from the protein powder.  That is when I bit the bullet and went for the Gold.<br/><br/>Worth every penny!  I for one will not chance another brand (man those stomach pains HURT).  This powder tastes great.  I've tried the vanilla ice cream flavor, the double chocolate, and the extreme milk chocolate...all wins.  Best summer treat; vanilla ice cream powder, milk of choice (a little half and half doesn't hurt), frozen strawberries, and ice.  Mix that all up in your blender and you have a strawberry shake.  I like the vanilla, it can be changed up in many ways; strawberries, blueberries, pineapple and coconut, banana and mango...add ice and milk of choice and the possibilities are endless.
 Great product as always, recommend 100%!
 Good product.  Slightly cheaper than other places.
 Banana cream tastes awesome! Give major gainz to those who consume it
 have bought many times. great value
 Love this protein powder. Making great gains. Cake Batter taste great for what the nutrition facts say. It may not be all natural or whatever we call it these days, but it mixes great and doesn't make me feel bloated and generally uncomfortable.
 Well I have been lifting for a couple of years now and optimum has a great product. I have always gone to walmart and grabbed whatever whey protein they sold. The biggest difference I noticed was the quality of the product. Optimum whey protein mixes very well and is easy to drink. The brands at walmart had more calories and were very hard to swallow. If your like me and trying to lose weight this product is great because of the low calories, compared to other brands.
 We all know ON gets consistently rated #1 whey, so thought I'd try for myself.  The ingredients in this protein are good, i.e BCAA's, glutamine and whey blend, so it really comes down to taste.  This double rich chocolate was delicious and mixed well.  I had it with milk but think it will be pretty good with water too.
 Love this stuff. Dissolves easily and tastes amazing. Got it on sale for $45/5lb, which is a great deal. Can't wait to try some other flavors.
 Great price, great product. Almost anyone you ask will tell you this is a quality protein suppliment.
 Great taste for the chocolate flavor.  Note that the consistency is slightly thinner than other proteins i have used leading to a thinner protein mix.  Not a bad thing since it mixes easier and doesn't clump like other proteins i have used.  I buy this again and again in the 5lb mix
 I love ON whey, it mixes well and the results are evident.
 Ok -- a little too sweet for me, though.
 Good taste. Lasts a while. The best value for protein that I can find.
 I'm not much fan of this particular flavor. Like any of the other ON whey protein powders I've tried, they dissolve great in water, and they seem to produce less "gastronomical events" than the other protein powders I've tried.
 Don't get cappuccino, get double chocolate.
 Good stuff.  Great flavor.  The auto-shipment works great so I never run out
 Great product. Would buy again
 This is my second time buying this product... The "Double Rich Chocolate" has a milkshake like taste that cant be beat... I have already begun to see my arms and chest grow... I have gained 7 pounds in the past month of pure muscle... I am a skinny guy 6' 163 pounds previously 155 pounds...<br/>My Process:<br/>2 scoops in the morning with vitamin d milk and two pills of Kre-Alkalyn<br/>2 scoops after workout with vitamin 2 milk<br/>2 Scoop during dinner and two pills of Kre-Alkalyn
 LOVE IT....it mixes easily, tastes great and no tummy irritation.
 Tastes great, I blend it with one frozen banana, a spoonful of peanut butter and milk. It's smooth and creamy and I actually crave it during the day.The chocolate isn't overpowering or overly sweet and as always with ON the ingredients are simple and understandable.
 Delicious
 I just tried this after several years of being a Muscle Milk user. The taste and texture are both great, and mix easy in my shaker with ball cup from GNC.
 When you decide to take whey, you already figured out that you need it. Therefore, I only cover the taste here.<br/><br/>I tried to mix it with strawberry and milk, I don't like the taste at all.<br/><br/>Banana makes a completely different experience in a good way.<br/><br/>Milk and banana are key ingredients in my protein shake.
 I've used for 3 months now - Great taste and one of the easiest products to mix with water. It's a little more money then other whey proteins - but well  worth the few dollars extra. I'll be purchasing again.
 I get it for the flavor. I can’t stand it when I can taste the whey. This one tastes just like hot chocolate.
 This is a great protein source, but the Muscle Pharm banana cream flavor tastes 100x better. This one is delicious too, just not as creamy. Otherwise this product is 10/10.
 This product is an excellent protein source and dissolve quickly in either water or milk.  I prefer the banana cream flavor and have ordered this product twice.  The second time I ordered the product, I tried a less expensive protein powder, but it didn't dissolve as well and left a funny taste.<br/><br/>At first I thought it was going to be like other protein powders, but I found that this particular powder to be refined and consistent.  I would definitely recommend this product.  I've been taking this with a low carb diet and it does provide a good low calorie source of protein.  I put a scoop with apple, carrot, kale and spinach in my nutri-bullet after working out.
 Good taste and mixes well.
 I love the taste, it's not cloying. Both water and milk are digested quite well. I take it in the morning and after my training.
 it's dissolves quickly and doesn't taste bad but at the same times it's not what i expected from it i guess it's okay, tried a lot of Whey but this is definitely the best so far
 WoW Excellent~~ Thank You so much! A++++-+
 Have been using this for three months now and I absolutely love it.  Been using it before and after my workouts and I see muscle gain after about 3 months. I've always been one of those people who has too fast of a metabolism so I don't gain much except around my stomach. My arms and shoulders are gaining muscle mass I notice now after using this, working out, and following a sensible balanced diet. I finally gained 5 pounds too always being around 140-145.  It always seems to be a top choice when I look at the reviews on various sites for different brands of whey protein supplement.  I've only tried the Double Rich Chocolate and the Extreme Chocolate, but I prefer the Double Rich Chocolate. It tastes like real chocolate milk when mixed with milk. Mixing it with water, doesn't taste bad at all either.  Extreme Chocolate has too much of a chocolate taste and has a weird after taste.  Everybody's taste buds are different so try the smaller version first before splurging on the larger bottle.  You might get some protein gas if you consume too much so make sure to supplement your intake with fiber. Some have had success using Activia yogurt to cut down on your gas or Gas-X from what I've read.
 One of the best protein powder supplements I've tasted. Mixes and tastes great. Probably the leader in this field! You wont be disappointed.
 Tastes great, price is good (still really expensive!) I run track in college. I am very happy with purchase.
 Tastes great, affordable and visible results, I am already getting my 3rd 5lbs tub, I have tried double chocolate and extreme milk chocolate.... white chocolate will be my next one.......I trust Optimum Nutrition brand and I take whey protein with Creatine........
 It's the best whey out there.  In results and taste.
 You wont go wrong with this. I have been using this for more than 6 years. Best protein out there.
 its ok....
 good stuff. great to have on hand at work if I work out for lunch and need an afternoon boost
 Cookies flavor tastes delicious.
 Everything as expected.  Great taste!
 shouldve trusted the reviews. I read that the formula somehow changed and I ordered the double rich chocolate formula and it indeed changed. WHAT THE HELL ON?!?!?! you just lost long time customers. it used to be so thick and rich, now it feels like im drinking swamp water.First time using the one i bought two weeks ago. July 2018. i usually do 2 scoops 4oz h20 and its really different. EVEN FOR THE DOUBLE RICH CHOCOLATE FLAVOR. others say the formula didnt with this flavor NO, SOMETHING IS DEFINITELY DIFFERENT.<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Optimum-Nutrition-Gold-Standard-100-Whey-Protein-Powder-Double-Rich-Chocolate-5-Pound/dp/B000QSNYGI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Whey Protein Powder, Double Rich Chocolate, 5 Pound</a>
 Both chocolate and vanilla taste good.  Dump this in your smoothie and get your hulk on.
 Great taste and excellent source of protein!
 Great Taste.  I prefer Isopure however, this is far more budget friendly.
 Good stuff
 I have been buying optimum nutrition whey and casein protein for quite some time.  My last order of whey smells like spoiled milk and vanilla!  I don't know if whey goes bad but I'm afraid to eat it.  Suggestions?
 This has been a staple in my diet for the last ten years and the price just cant be beat. Always consistent with flavor. No complaints.
 does the job
 Great product. Quality protein. I highly recommend it (been using it for the last year and a half
 This one of the highest customer rated protein powders out there, and it gives you the best bang for your buck.  It tastes good, and mixes well.  If you want a protein supplement without a lot of other crap in it, buy this.
 Quality matters most when you are taking protein supplements. Some inferior whey protein isolates have metal ingredients and they may not mix well, making your job harder. This powder mixes so well that you can mix it in a glass with a spoon. You dont even need a shaker. And this flavor is amazing.
 First off it was an off brand of Whey protein, secondly I had no return address and it tasted faker than water from a melted plastic water bottle.
 Did my research and found this to be the best on the market.
 Is it normal that the seal was already detach from the container it self?, i have never use this bran before,i just though it was a lil odd.
 Blends well, smooth, filling. Would recommend.
 Dissolves easier than any other protein powder I've had.<br/>The taste is great. Definitely prefer chocolate for ON Gold flavors.
 I use On's Whey daily.  The taste is great and the consistency and quality is the best I have seen from 5 different brands.
 Great combination of quality, price and taste!
 The best taste ever!! I Will be getting for of this!
 best protein out there
 It has a great mild coffee taste which is good for drinking on its own or mixing with other flavored. Also, the powder has a good consistency representative of the quality of the product.
 Taste is good.  Good source of protein.  Good price per ounce.
 Mixes easily and tastes great.
 Best whey protein on the market.
 Great taste
 got me some gains
 Great tasting, low carb, great value protein.
 Love this chocolate flavore,and its a pretty big container.I sure will purchase it again.
 Protein is great and mixes well. Lid came busted open. I assume this happened in shipping but was still disappointed.
 The best tasting protein powder I have ever tried  mix with almond milk for delicious milkshakes :)
 Tasted great, lasted over a month, mixed well with milk. I'd buy again if I had more money to splurge on monthly.
 Tastes good. No aftertaste
 Taste better, and mixes easier
 Yum
 I REALLY LIKE THE TASTE OF THIS PRODUCT, AND AFTER TRYING MANY OF THEM, THIS ONE SEEMS TO BE THE BEST ON THE MARKET.
 Fast shipping, great product but, I wasn't crazy about the flavor, it's okay but not good. I will not be ordering this flavor again.
 The protein itself is amazing, but the container was destroyed during shipping.. otherwise would be 5 stars.
 Wow price has really increased from the last time I bought it. But anyways you really don't need it. The most important thing is that you get your calories in. Second, eat at least 50% of what you weigh in kcal. and you WILL grow. I've stopped using it might as well be nesquik. A very expensive form of nesquik. Eat REAL food like whole eggs and chicken.<br/><br/>This is the best protein powder though in that it tastes the best and mixes the easiest. But I still want to stress- waste of money.I suggest you google the Consumer Reports article on protein powders to see how protein powders are a waste of money. Most of them have toxic contaminants such as lead too.
 the product is actually really loved it. arrived at the right time and not had any problems. I recommend to everyone.
 Normally love this whey protein, but for some reason there was basically no taste to this batch. I was very disappointed.
 I have been using this product for over a year now with great satisfaction and the milk chocolate is delicious!
 tasty
 Tastes great, mix's well, is more natural, what more can you ask for.
 Have been using this brand for a while. This is probably my favorite flavor.
 Great taste. Perfect in Shake, coffee or mixed alone
 Taste great! I believe I see results, but would like to use it for a year to be sure. I think it does give me a little energy if I take it about 30 mins before my workout.
 Tastes great, good price for the quantity, and good protein content.
 This product is perfect for daily protein needs!!! I love this product...
 The number one thing I like about Gold Standard versus other protein supplements I have tried is that it breaks up and dissolves into the water you put it in very nicely. I'm not eating clumps of protein with this supplement unlike other brands I've tried. I got the white chocolate flavor and it's not the greatest, but it works. It's a tad watered-down tasting even with little water in it.
 (to me) the best value, taste, and quality for Whey protein powder.
 Good
 It helps me build my muscles. It also tastes good, not that sweet.
 Tastes great!
 This is my favorite protein powder with a great taste, great profile, lean recipe. It's not the cheapest powder but to me it is the best quality for the price
 Chocolate malt is the best flavor.
 Excellent taste and easily dissolves. Best protein powder I have tried. Now my permanent choice!
 Best tasting ive ever had and doesnt upset my stomach.  This is real quality protein.
 I received my protein with no scoop :)
 this is a great product. great results and tastes good too
 So good. Mixed it with coffee, even better
 I got the "Delicious Strawberry." Saw lots of reviews saying ON protein isn't very good taste wise but I was pleasantly surprised when I tried it. Tastes very similar to Nesquick strawberry milk.
 Best protein on the market, just put a scoop with some milk and shake for 10-15 seconds and it is already mixed in really well.  My favorite flavor is coffee, strawberry, and vanilla in that order.  I would say I was slightly disappointed with the vanilla flavor but it is more of an acquired taste.  Still, if you're in doubt about which flavor I highly recommend coffee!
 Great product, cheaper than the supplement stores !
 Mixes really well. Great taste. Will order again.
 Good value, but too sweet for me.
 I use this whey protein as part of my daily diet, it is great tasting as I mix it with water or milk.  In my opinion this is the best whey protein on the market.
 Just as it says, it's whey...the muscle builders standby.<br/><br/>5 lbs is quite a bit, so make sure you have some space set aside to store it when you order.
 Product was as described.  Great Price. Fast shipping.  Would order again.
 Minimal flavor
 Product came as described and on time. This protein tastes good and mixes well.
 This has great taste for a protein powder. It's given me very good results. One of the best I've found.
 This is without a doubt the best tasting protein I have found. ON is a reputable company and amazon generally has the best prices available.
 Great price. Great taste. Great results
 Taste isn't bad.  I prefer the peanut butter chocolate.
 Tastes pretty good for being protein powder. I mix it with Almond milk, PB2, and ice. DELICIOUS!
 Taste good and works great. Can't wait to try other flavors. Mixes with water or milk if you want to change it up.
 Great product. Great taste
 Yes this is great !!  Will order again!
 Enough said.
 Dissolves really well. Taste is acceptable.
 I ve been using Optimum whey since november and i don't have anything to complain about. I recommend for all people who want to buy it.
 Cake batter and almond milk with some ice. Post workout never tasted so good! Even my son wants some lol
 Great product. Excellent flavor. Worth the price.
 good product
 I've always ordered this brand and have tried multiple flavors, it's a good brand. Just, stay away from the "Coffee" flavor. Smells better than it tastes.
 Been using Dr Phil's 20/20 meal plan and this fits in great for my breakfast.
 great product.....as described.
 This is the best protein powder. It mixes up really well. It's not chalky or gritty in the least. I knocked off one star because I ordered vanilla ice cream but was shipped the coffee flavor. I opened it without realizing the error do I will finish it, but I would have preferred vanilla.
 My fiancé loves this product.  He has tried many different brands but this is a definite winner! It tastes great, gives energy, gives him the amount of protein he needs daily!
 Chocolate malt flavor is great, I look forward to my dose of whey after my workouts.
 Can see a difference since i started using it.10/10
 Muy buen sabor excelente
 I mean, it works.
 muy bueno
 I love gold standard whey. I have always used it. I have always bought it at GNC and had no problems. I figured I'd order it on here and have it shipped to my house since it's easier for me. Yet, this product made me and my boyfriend sick to our stomachs. I've never had an issue until now. I will never order this here again
 A couple of tips I have found useful<br/>- do not drink with water as it tastes horrendous<br/>- do drink with milk or even better soy milk as it thickens it up and makes it kind of like a milkshake.
 Delivered as you would expect. Great taste.
 Excellent Product  and fast shipping.
 One of my favorite Proteins! I highly recommend. I don't like the strawberry but that's just my opinion.
 My favorite protein powder by far. It mixes well and tastes delicious (I buy the cookies n cream flavor). I often mix it with my morning coffee and a bit of milk which is a good way to start the day.
 My son like it.
 So far I really like it
 Good stuff, good price. It's a shame that it went up from 53 dollars though. So I guess now it's good stuff, alright price.
 Good product, fast service
 I just finished my first container of this and wow, the results are amazing. Would highly recommend if you want good lean results without the large amounts of fat that other protein complexes have.
 This is the best protein I've ever gotten. Easiest to mic and it tastes very good very good taste
 Best protein
 Good tasting, good price for protein. Nice buy.
 I love Chocolate flavor but this is my first time trying the vanilla one I absolutely love the taste of it too infact more than the chocolate one at this time!!
 This is one of the best chocolate availavle in market. I ordered this on my wife's request and altough i prefer plain protein powder so that we can add any thing with it. But after having it, i like it. The does not have off flavor and it comess with portion size meurment cup. Me and my wife use it during our diet week just to have this only and it's good for our own need. Using this powder, we both developed some muscles which we did after workout.
 Fantastic
 Love the mocha one great flavor!
 Perfect meal replacement
 The best protein for me! Love the banana flavor in skim milk with a couple ice cubes.
 I gained weight by using this brand- Need to careful when you by protein powder and what exactly you needed
 Great product and helps with muscle recovery.
 Exactly what I wanted and expected, and the product got to my house quickly.
 Good
 im not a huge gym rat but this stuff has been great and its the only supplement i use. take it 30 mins after working out with some milk and fruit
 Good tasting whey protein which lasted me for months and is priced well. Mixes easily with water and other ingredients
 HIGH QUALITY WILL BUY AGAIN!!!
 I love this stuff!  It tastes great, blends very easily with water and totally hits the spot post workout. I also will just have a protein shake as a snack when I get cravings and it does the trick.
 Really does smell like cake batter - the taste is closer to a very sweet vanilla. Has been delicious either straight or mixed with strawberry protein, and even in baked goods. Haven't found a stinker Optimum Nutrition flavor yet, though, so it's to be expected.
 Hands down best whey protein. Tastes great and has BCAAs and glutamine.
 Excellent.
 nice
 Best tasting protein I've ever tried, and it dissolves in water quickly.  Been getting great growth results drinking this after my workouts.
 There was no tamper seal around the container, nor was it sealed after removing the lid.
 Price keeps going up but nothing better/price on market.
 I got vanilla and it tastes great when with milk, with water it tastes awful and really gross. I'd recommend only using it with milk and adding peanut butter and bananas as it is more of a smoothie than a nutrition shake.
 Tastes like Vanilla ice cream.
 Cant go wrong with ON
 Delicious and easy to mix. Doesn't clump like some other brands. I like the low sugar and carb counts, which really help when cutting or counting macros.
 I absolutely swear by Optimum Nutrition! This protein powder is amazing, and it's definitely helped my muscle building and recovery. I've tried a few of the flavors, all on other people's advice, and I didn't care for most of them. That being said, I recently decided I'd go against the warnings about strawberry flavored protein powders and try Delicious Strawberry. WOW! Anyone who said this flavor was gross is absolutely mad! The name says it all! It tastes like strawberry milk, but with a hint of strawberry candy flavor. It's honestly the best flavor I've tried and I'm completely in love with it. I've tried Cookies and Cream, and yuck, the cream flavor is WAY too strong and it tastes more like a really sweet cream and mocha flavor? I had to hold my nose while drinking it. I've also tried Extreme Milk Chocolate, which I also didn't care for but it was more tolerable in milk. Vanilla was good for it's mix-ability, but it tastes more like sugar cookies than vanilla. And it sort of makes everything you mix with it taste like sugar cookies, unless you mix it with something strong like orange juice (which actually does taste good). However, I was unable to drink any of these with just water without gagging. With Delicious Strawberry it's PERFECT in a nice cold glass of water! So refreshing and yummy! If you like strawberry milk and have a sweet tooth, DO NOT be put off by what other people say! Try it!
 Doesn't taste like coffee to me :(
 I love this protein powder. This is by far my favorite flavor and is great mixed with a chocolate soy milk.
 WHEY WHEY WHEY too expensive - I used to buy this product and it has almost doubled in price!  Greed Greed Greed
 I wish they had Chocolate Fudge Flavored
 The banana cream flavor tastes quite good with 1% milk.  I am truly surprised by how good it tastes.  Highly recommend!<br/><br/>The Chocolate Malt was quite disappointing.  It's drinkable, but not enjoyable by any stretch of the imagination.  If I had a way to exchange it for a Banana Cream, I would do so in a heartbeat.<br/><br/>Average score of 4 stars: 5 for banana cream, 3 for chocolate malt.
 The only protein powder I will use.  Delicious.
 great product
 Great deal and not a bad flavor. Should last several months hopefully.
 tastes great...about to need another one! mixes well too which is nice. ill probably look into more flavors but im loving the chocolate.
 tastes great in my morning smoothy.
 It tastes really good.  This and the chocolate mint are my favorite ON Gold Standard Whey flavors.  Would buy again.
 Best protein out there!
 I like the taste and it mixes very well. It id more expensive because of the brand's name, but I think itd worth it because it's safe. I pay more but I know I'm getting something good.
 I had high hopes for this product based on the reviews.  So much protein so little calories!  Too good to be true.  I was using Muscle Milk and my stomach was fine on that.  Switched to this stuff and ouch!  can't do it.  Every time I tried it bad bad things happened.  Bad things.  I truly hate this stuff.<br/><br/>Obviously, a lot of people don't experience this reaction.<br/><br/>So here's my advice:  Buy a small amount of this and give it a trial run.  Don't waste 60 bucks like I did only to find you can't tolerate the stuff.<br/><br/>Also, regarding the taste: not bad.  I got the double chocolate.  Not nearly as good as the muscle milk, but not terrible.
 Nice clean protein powder.
 Tastes great with water. Mixes easy no clumps, tastes kind of like a light or diet oveltine. Try it with goats milk it's the best taste.
 My go to protein powder. I've tried a lot of flavors, but Chocolate Malt is my favorite so far.
 Really like this protein. It does what protein is suppose to. I actually see the results
 It's tasty and it doesn't clump up. It's like having a desert when you mix fruit with it.
 I like this banana fast more than chocolate bought before.
 This is by far my favorite flavor of the ON brand, I drink 5-6 shakes a day and order the 10 pounds bags. I ordered the Strawberry in January 2014 and found it to clearly be a different mix than previous orders. This version is simply nasty. It does not mix well, leaving a layer of "chunks" on the surface and the flavor is very weak. In fact the flavor is so nasty I will not even try to drink this again. Unfortunately I was past the return window so I will have to live with eating the cost of 10 pounds of nasty, I mix mine in both skim mild as well as water, depending on the time of day. It typically mixes without a blender, I just use a common household butter knife and it works great (except in this case)<br/><br/>I have not had this experience with any other flavor and am really disappointed as I loved the strawberry. I also use Double RIch Chocolate, Banana Cream and Vanilla Ice Cream. These flavors continue to be very good. Just don;t buy the strawberry or if you do make sure you test it within the return window.<br/><br/>Optimum Nutrition, this is a big letdown for people like me who are loyal users. Now I will look to another source for a strawberry flavor and take my dollars with me.
 Much more palatable than the chocolate flavor that I've ordered for years.
 Top quality whey. Great taste, easy to mix. I won't buy anything else.
 Everything is simple and make me happy
 Delicious and works wonders after a tough workout.
 Fantastic product, affordable and provides astounding results. Amazing taste, i prefer extreme milk chocolate over any other flavor.
 Great stuff and a good price!
 Great Shipment and Great Product!!
 Favorite by far.
 Seriously the best protein I have ever had! I keep buying more and more! Very affordable and lasts a long time!
 What can I say? It's ON Whey Protein and works great, love all of their products and this flavor is great for shakes and making ice cream.
 I bought this stuff because I saw that it had the best ratio of protein to calories to carbs. Turns out it is the absolute gym person go-to, and I can see why. It tastes good (I put extra cocoa powder in almost every time, so I can't attest to its taste too vigorously), and has an incredible amount of protein for the carbs/calories (24g protein, 3 carbs, 120 cals), which is whey better (sorry) than the other protein powder I started with (20g/11g/140c). In the morning, I mix it with cold coffee and milk (almond or cow), and it not only gives me a breakfast with caffeine in it, but it saves me from calorie-costly creamers (about 70-100 cal every day). When I run out, I will absolutely be buying another one of these- no question.
 good taste , like it 5 star for me, buy it
 great product
 This is one of the few flavors that goes really well with water. I don't drink milk very much so I've been searching around, and I found my new favorite flavor. The stronger I want the taste, the less water I use. Mixes very well, no clumps or foam after shaking!
 Go to product for me.  Easy to mix and tastes as good as protein powder can tase.  I've bought cheaper and always regretted it, and I could drink motor oil if I had to.
 Good taste
 I like this protein powder it mixes relatively easy and tastes good. It's not the best chocolate shake I've tasted but really good. It's specially good when mixed with milk.<br/>I have a very sensitive stomach so it sometimes can be a little heavy but for the most part it's ok
 My boyfriend takes his Whey every single day and was devastated when he was about to run out. So as a early Christmas gift I bought him some, and it arrived super fast! My boyfriend makes his with water due to the fact milk hurts his stomach, but I like mine with milk. Either way it's tasty and does the trick! Would recommend the milk chocolate for sure if you like a better tasting Whey.
 Cheap price, good for growing muscles.
 Got it quickly and as described. I got vanilla ice cream flavor. It has a super fake sweet taste....so I'll get another flavor next time... but it does the job
 Value and solid taste (not great, but gets job done).
 IMHO this is the best tasting and overall best protein powder available.  I mix it with whole grain cheerios after a workout and it's delicious.  :-)
 Tastes good
 The first whey I ever bought was the ON Gold Vanilla.  That stuff was disgusting.  I had to mix it in a smoothie to be able to drink it.  This mint chocolate though is heaven!  I look forward to my protein now.  Do yourself a favor.  If you are looking for protein and you normally like mint chocolate, get this.  With water it almost tastes like a mint chocolate milkshake.  I'm not kidding, it's that good.  Now, keep in mind that it only has 2g of sugar per serving so it isn't very sweet.  That's okay.  It still tastes great.  I want to try their other flavors, but this stuff is tops.  Definitely go with a chocolate base.  You won't be disappointed.  Well, unless you don't like chocolate.
 Ok, so i NEVER write reviews, just because i dont have a lot of time. But i had to write one on the Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Whey. I got the the Double Rich Chocolate flavor, because many reviews i read said it was the best. And... It is great! Tastes just like chocolate milk. I could drink it as a dessert, but its really good for you. Ive been blending it with 8 oz of milk, 3 ice cubes and a banana. Sooooo good. Anyway, thats it. Ive tried a lot of different protein powders and shakes and this is by FAR the best. Thanks!
 Are my muscles getting bigger? IDK, I'm no scientist and can't really tell to be honest. But it sure does taste great after a workout and could be a placebo effect that my muscles are indeed growing.
 Usually amazing, but horrible off flavor!
 Tastes great in our morning smoothies, and carries that little extra kick
 After sampling the majority of the leading protein powders on the market, such as those offed by, Target, Costco, and Health shops, I have landed on Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard.<br/>-It has the best consistency, mixes quickly and evenly with water or milk<br/>-Has the best flavor and many to choose from<br/>-Has the best ingredients, virtually no sugar or additives.<br/><br/>Very satisfied
 I retract my previous review. It mixes great in cold water, horrible in hot water.
 My son loves this protein blend, especially with chocolate milk.
 tastes great. not too sweet.
 Excellent cost benefit ratio
 Great tasting! And lasts a long time. I put in fridge...
 Its okay, nothing special.
 Good tasty product. Money well spend.
 Great protein that really can't be beat. Double chocolate is the standard. 2 scoops tastes great and is a great protein supplement.
 A non thick protein that last quite a long time. My wife and I are totally sold on it. I've tried many other kinds of protein but there is no better high quality protein for the price.
 Dissolves easily, and tastes decent even with water. Can't beat it!
 I am not sure about the product the sealing cap was already open when I received the product. It test OK, still I am not sure if this product is 100% genuine as test sweat, considering only 1 gram of sugar.
 It tastes good
 Sometime it is hard to find this flavor, having two at a time makes life easy.
 Tastes great on its own and mixes well with fruits for smoothies or shakes.
 High quality and surprisingly tasty! The double chocolate flavor doesn't have any funky sweetener tastes and mixes easily with room temperature water.
 Great protein powder but maybe received a bad batch. Will try to buy again. Taste was off
 Came as advertised. My personal favorite brand of whey.
 Very tasty. Easy to make chocolate smoothies and milkshakes with but also good when just mixing with water after a workout.
 I'm not one to get all scientific so here goes......  I mix one scoop with about 8oz of skim milk.  It tastes great and does what you would expect it to do like any other drink.  Great product...............
 Hands down my favorite favor, tastes like a vanilla milkshake when you mix with milk.
 Excellent product, loved the flavor
 I have been using this product for over a year and more consistently in the last four weeks.  Use it about twice a day and I have seen massive gains in my muscle mass.  Great product to use as a snack mid day or for your pre and post-workout shake.
 Whats not to like. Its popular for a reason.
 This is not my first OP protein powder,  I have bought double rich chocolate and vanilla flavor before,they are both taste good, but this one is literally horrible, pretty disappointed. when I open it, It smells like something already expired. especially the after taste, which is like some kind of artificial chemical stuff. just disgusting. I dont even know how could I finish this.  Don't choose this flavor!!!!!!!
 Mixes very well and tastes good. I have already purchased the 5lb. chocolate mint variety after I finished this one. Great product for the price.
 It's pretty good stuff; goes down easily but doesn't have to be so sweet.  (pity there's artificial sweeteners in it)
 Unlike some powders this one does not have a strong flavor, which is good,  so you won't hate it too fast.
 as far as protein powder goes, this is pretty darn delicious.
 This whey is yummy...it mixes easily with water or milk and the taste is better than any other protein I have had. I highly recommend it!
 Delicious! Better than I was expecting.<br/><br/>Make iced coffee with a scoop and it's some of the best I tasting protein I've had.
 Delicious and is a good substitution for a meal.
 Doesn't clump or give me gas. somewhat of a funny alcohol/chemical like smell after mixing but not bad tasting. Not a bad amount for the price. A friend recommended it and now I see why.
 Great taste and mixes well
 My standard - dissolves well and digest easily
 Good tasting, effective whey protein.
 Awesome, thank you very much!
 Rockyroad is a pretty good taste, I'd say the only gold standard whey I like more than it is cappuccino.  I say this as 80-90% of what I ingest in my daily diet is protein shakes for my fitness routine.
 This stuff is so fine that it doesnt take a ton of shaking to mix it. It works great and taste wonderful.
 Tastes good with water, Tastes good with milk.. I'm excited to get my run done so I can have a milkshake!!!
 Arrived on time with prime. No issues. Would buy again.
 Great protein! Easy to digest!
 I usually get the chocolate flavor protein powder and it taste just fine to me. I have been using Gold Standard for years. No complaints.
 It's a lot of protein, bruh
 I used to swear by ON for supplements.  I have been using their products for 10 years.  The prices continue to go up and the quality continues to get beat by the competition.  The taste is awful and I can barely choke down a shake anymore.  I am now a MusclePharm customer all the way.
 I've bought it dozens of times great product but the last three times I bought the protein I have not received the scooper can be quite annoying so keep the scoop if you have one to reuse
 Good Protein.Great price and fast shipment. This protein is the best tasting protein I have had so far. The price is right as well.
 Great value, been using it for years.
 Good taste, not as good as the chocolate, but still good. I mix it with chocolate soy milk and low fat yogurt for breakfast. This helped me to drop 22 pounds in 5 weeks.
 This protein powder is delicious! I've tried tons of different protein powders and most are gross. I love the flavor of this one. I usually make my breakfast shake with a little almond milk, a teaspoon of all natural peanut butter, and a half of a frozen banana. It takes like dessert and it's healthy. I would definitely recommend this protein powder to anyone but, especially to the people starting out trying protein powders. This stuff is delicious!
 It’s a very good portien, mixes well, and great flavor, highly recommended!!
 Tasty with milk not bad with water either and not too sweet
 ON is great, but the taste leaves much to be desired.
 Chocolate flavor is great.<br/><br/>Cookie and cream flavor is disgusting.
 Best protein out there.
 Good taste for the nutitional value.
 My go to.  Always good flavors and good price.  Quality product.
 It's great by itself as a beverage, and also sprinkled on Fiber One cereal for added protein.  Will definitely purchase again.
 Taste great
 I use this stuff everyday.  It makes a great protein shake, and really fills you up.  I think it is a very high quality product.
 It's great by itself as a beverage, and also sprinkled on Fiber One cereal for added protein.  Will definitely purchase again.
 My brother recommended this protein powder to me. 1 dozens that I thought would be most important to me is that the protein powder and to be very clean no extra sugar specifically. So far so good, it is pretty good, not too sweet, but that's fine I just mix it up with almond milk and it's going down fairly smoothly it can get pretty thick if you use an electronic mixer but otherwise just an overall good product. About the vanilla but I'm excited to try the chocolate I hear that the strawberry is not necessarily as good but still pretty good. I've only been using it for a little while but my brother uses it constantly and he's not very clean diet or seen him go from kind of chubby to really lean so I knew that one it was something he recommended and something he used to transform there's probably going to work well for me as well.
 I bought this before and really loved it! It has a great taste that isn't too strong and washes out easily with water. I think it's great for those who casually work out and want to get a little bigger without having to spend tons of money.
 Love the cookies and cream flavor, tastes so yummy
 one of my favorite flavors
 Chocolate by far the best flavor and goes down easy.
 have taken it for one day and i feel 1000x stronger (TO BE EXACT)
 While searching Amazon for some general wellness products, I came across this Whey protein and ordered it to supplement my diet as I rarely eat meat. The first thing I noticed about the product is that the packaging is extremely professional-looking and high quality. I can attest that the contents are, as well. The protein tasted great in skim milk and it helped aid in suppressing my hunger late at night and in between meals.<br/><br/>I don't think that there's anything particularly different about this protein compared to others. However, unlike some others...I am convinced that this product is of very high quality and purity. I do plan on purchasing again.<br/><br/>Do I recommend this product? Yes
 I like this because it's a high quality protein, and it mixes easily. You can stir it up with a spoon and skip the blender. The Double Rich Chocolate flavor goes well with bananas and/or most pre-workout supplements. I like to get a raspberry flavored pre-workout and stir them together. It tastes like dessert (pretty much), and gets the job done.
 So yummy!!
 Best chocolate protein I've ever tasted.  I LOVE it mixed with a cup of vanilla soy milk.
 Love the strawberry.
 Good stuff, as described
 Tastes delicious in soylent.
 Excellent quality protein with a better taste than the vast majority of whey protein products available!
 Great stuff, drink it every day after the gym
 This protein has excellent flavor, like a strawberry banana smoothie! Dissolves well. Large size lasts a long time, good deal compared to prices at chain stores!
 Good product, great taste, good value.
 Tastes great.  Most whey are probably the same, but the taste is what makes it better than others.  will buy again.
 This is the best price I could find for this product.  Would buy again here.  No problems and I love the taste with milk and a bananna
 Very good.<br/>The taste is excellent very effective in promoting muscle faster absorption.
 Great product.  I've been buying it for years without disappointment.
 Great product, it provides that extra burst of energy needed for a great workout!
 Don't get me wrong, I love this product. Some of the flavors are just terrible. Stick to chocolate and extra chocolate.
 Taste good and has low sugar and high protein.  I make my shakes every morning with it.
 Larger than I expected. POWDER IS very fine that's good.  Does not clump up.  Very nasty without milk lol.use skimmed milk if u don't want fat. Also I recommend blender Bottle with loop
 I like it. Taste is right. Price is right. I'm happy.
 I purchased the double rich chocolate because some reviews said it was good, however I was disappointed with the taste. The double rich chocolate that I got tastes very bland and weird. It also does not smell like real chocolate which is what I wanted.
 Good product but Vanilla flavor is not as good a chocolate.
 The Taste is really good and mixes well on cold water
 I normally buy Double Rich Chocolate flavor ON but decided to give this a shot since it was cheaper. It doesn't taste as good as chocolate but its not too bad either. Mixes really well in water, juice, or milk.
 I have bought this product before and have enjoyed it. This time the flavor was off.
 Good for growth!
 I have been using this protein mixture for years. It has the best flavor and mixability.
 One of the better tasting flavors I have tried!
 what can i say...its the best and i've been using it
 Ez gains
 It tastes so good I want to work out more just so I can have more of this protein shake. It goes great with water (I haven't tried it with milk yet). My previous experience was with the regular chocolate flavor. This flavor is WAY BETTER!
 I usually get chocolate mint because it was my favorite flavor to add with just water however I decided to try out chocolate coconut and it tastes exactly like an almond joy.
 Made a switch from a Walmart brand of Whey, which will remain nameless to Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard and I've honestly seen a huge improvement. Prior to picking up this Whey I did not pay attention to an important little notice on the sides of these types of products, it is the "Protein by Weight". The Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold comes in at 77%, 24g of Protein per 31 serving size, which is higher than my old supplement and still packs in some of the beneficial aminos that I need too.<br/><br/>Not only do I get a better supplement from ON than I previously had, but it tastes pretty decent too. I picked up the Delicious Strawberry despite it containing Sucralose... I'll pick up more when this runs out, I've been satisfied.
 👍
 This is my second bag. Taste is great quality rich chocolatey flavor. Highly recommended  bag will last At least five months.
 This is my first experience i m using protien powder but i cant tell u right now bcz this is my 2nd week of using...after a month i can tell u about result..thanx.
 Product accurate.  Great product.
 Good Protein.. Cheapest way to get it
 Good product.
 Delicious
 Went through many of these already.  Best taste out there
 Optimum Nurtrition 100% Whey is the way to go!!
 The product got here in three days. It does not have a scoop, or its buried somewhere in there. The banana cream flavor tastes just like a banana cream pie. So im happy with it. And its alot cheaper then going to GNC. Plus this company uses good manufacturing practices so i feel safer knowing there isnt a bunch of bad stuff in there
 It dissolves very well and I love the Chocolate-Mint flavor.
 i've been used this protein for couple of years now
 Tastes great.  Great pick me up after a good workout.
 Protein
 This is great stuff. Price could be more competitive as I can buy it at Costco same price.  Might want to check into it.
 great!
 So TASTY! Easy! Love love love!
 I always got this on time and it helps me with my health. Thanks.for the good servixce that I got with this product.
 The reviews and purchase numbers speak for them selfs. Love this product
 Great taste.
 Great product. Tastes good. Seems to have effect
 Well i orderd strawberyy-banana and I first tried it with water and honestly wasnt the way to go but when i tried it with milk it was soo delicious. Muscle gain level. Well been taking this product for about 2 months and the change is exteemly significant. The bcaas are very helpful because i recover quicker meaning kore workouts. No negative comments on this product
 Always my go to protein. There's a reason its the gold standard and buying through Amazon makes it easy and affordable!
 Cool beans were found with this item.
 Gold Standard of power. Good taste, does the job every time.
 This is such a high quality item for such a reasonable price that we get all our whey protein this way. Great taste, easily digested, great price, fast delivery. Couldn't ask for anything else!
 Nice
 One of my favorite proteins!
 I bought this in May of 2014, it is now September 2014 and I still have some left. I will be ordering this again when I am almost through with what is left. Great protein!!! I have used other chocolate proteins and this one by far tastes really good, and it has helped me recover from my workouts. I will be ordering a new one when I run out. It has lasted me a very long time.
 Tastes great!
 Great quality product. Tastes Great as well. Recommend it highly. Great quality for the price. Will continue to by this brand once this is finished.
 Repeat buyer, return type and again because of their quality and price.
 Ir is a good protein , post work ir a excelent way to drink
 This product is amazing! Although I wont recommend the cookies and cream flavor. The powder dissolves nicely for a smooth drink even when I forgot my blender at home (I drink it at work and hit the gym afterwards). I highly recommend it.
 Good stuff, great deal. Strawberry banana is not so good though.
 Great taste, good price ( compared to most powders) , low calorie , low sugar. I drink this with water or in smoothies. I've been buying this powder exclusively for several years now .
 Favorite protein, doesn't hurt my stomach.
 I drink one of these blended with some peanut butter and a banana after workouts. Tastes good, doesn't cost too much, and lasts a long time.
 Not great taste..
 mixes great compared to cheaper brands, I just use cold water in a shaker and I never have any problems with chunks.  taste is also decent.
 Good Stuff
 Best protein on the market, will buy again
 Works amazing! I can feel a huge difference with my workouts! This stuff is the best!
 Great buy!!!
 I order vanilla ice cream and it is so very good!
 I've tried many different flavors and this by far is my favorite.  Same exact brand of protein sold at the major nutrition stores for $15 less. Also came with free samples.  Would highly recommend this product!
 Product just as described. Great buy.
 Best flavor of any protein I've tried!
 my son loves this product.
 It works
 Upon opening the bottle, the powder had a medicinal smell and was already in chunks as if there was moisture inside before the seal was even broken. The expiration date says otherwise, but the protein is clearly spoiled.
 Great taste, mixes well, and is becoming my favorite brand of protein of taste. Great brand I trust because the protein content per serving is really great and true
 Good stuff
 Ordered this for my bro and law and he loved it. It's the first time I've ordered this particular flavor but Optimum Nutrition products are always well made and excellent products. He says the flavor was excellent and absolutely loves the product.
 Excellent product I have used for years.
 Awful taste.
 This tastes so good!!
 Very good taste and most importantly, it completely dissolves. No gritty clumps. I love it!
 I love Extreme Chocolate Milk<br/><br/>But Strawberry Banana tastes like Pepto.
 Second order of this. Tastes great.
 Been using ON whey protein for 3+ years now.  For me I've enjoyed all the flavors except Rocky Road (not a fan of artificial almond flavoring.)  Typically I take two servings immediately after a workout prior to breakfast.  I sometimes will take a serving before bed if my protein intake during the day from normal food was low.<br/><br/>As with any protein don't except huge gains for taking down a couple protein shakes after a workout.  The key is using this in conjunction with a balanced diet, disciplined workout schedule and getting enough sleep.<br/><br/>Best results take time!
 Vanilla Ice Cream taste awful in water but really great with milk. I've increased my lean muscle mass with the extra protein and I have more energy at the gym.
 good tasting, fast and easy mix with liquid, and convenient anywhere.
 awesome taste, not my nr. 1, but definitely in the top 3.<br/>It is of a good quality, as expected, and will definitely but ON gold again.
 I've tried a few other brands, and the day I had my first scoop of Gold standard, I just knew that this is the best. Even before tasting it, just the texture of the whey is wayy better than a few other brands and is almost certainly the best I've known. It tastes good too. I started off with 2 lb strawberry, loved it. Got a 5 lb strawberry and then this 10 lb double rich chocolate, which is great too.
 It's huge and tastes fairly well. Definitely has enough protein to help me meet my macros at the end of the day.
 Too sweet :)
 I love this protein powder! It mixes well with any liquids, and it is easily mixed into baked goods as well. It has no chalky taste AT ALL, I have one scoop every day.
 Great product but I will not buy mint chocolate again. Not enough flavor/poor flavor. Have had the vanilla from ON and liked it much better
 Well, what can I say. It's a well-priced whey protein powder. It's not going to work any miracles, but it provides some nourishment.<br/><br/>It's been my experience that whey protein isn't as good as protein blends, but hey that's just what works for me.<br/><br/>Oh, and this sometimes gives me cramps and gas if I drink it on a completely empty stomach.
 My wife and son both think this is the best.
 Love it, but too expensive. I have changed to Dymatize for a cheaper price.
 Best tasting chocolate protein one ever found other than gnc wheybolic
 Have been using this for many many years. Great.
 I been using this protein for almost a year and so far I'm loving it! Best standard PROTEIN with reasonable price.
 Tastes great. I add frozen berries, plain Greek yogurt, either almond, cashew or peanut butter.
 I've been getting the Optimum Nutrition 100% Gold Whey Standard Protein Powder in the chocolate flavor for a few years now, so I decided to try Vanilla.<br/><br/>Same great taste, same great value. One five-pound tub lasts a little over two months, so it costs about $25 bucks a month, or less than a dollar a day (if you take one a day, like I do).<br/><br/>And with Amazon Prime, there's free two-day delivery, which would cost 15 bucks (because of the weight and size) if I didn't have Amazon Prime.<br/><br/>To me, buying this protein powder thought Amazon Prime is a no-brainer.<br/> ...]
 My bf loves this brand and this flavor is excellent. Shakes up well with cold water or almond milk.
 Somewhat pricey but tastes great, mixes well, and has good macros. Will be buying again, but probably going to wait for a sale...
 Tasty, low cal, plenty of protein
 Great results, thanks.
 Love the taste, no bloating, after taste, premium protein.  Good stuff!!
 I tried other whey proteins before but this one is the best
 Started using this about two weeks ago and I love it. I was using serious mass for a while and once i switched to this, my muscles feel super solid. Tastes awesome (strawberry) and mixes super easy.
 LIke the product.
 Loved it until it gave me horrible acne breakouts. HORRIBLE! It makes sense since is extracted from milk and dairy products tend to cause acne. So, if you have acne prone skin, DO NOT BUY IT! What a shame. I loved it. It is convenient, tastes good, and really helps with my muscle growth. It had made my life so much easier until I started to have an acne face. I guess nothing good comes easy. I will go back to regular food that contains protein. I'm eating salmon for dinner. I'm going to quit drinking this and see if my face clears up.<br/>Update：It's been four days since the last time I drank this product. My face is already clearing up.
 The taste is great! I got the vanilla. Also great shipping!
 the taste is terrible. I am going to return it.
 This protein shake taste great and Ever since I started drinking it .. I have more strength and my workouts are more effective .. I would recommend it
 Very good product but the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor does not taste good at all. I would recommend the double chocolate.
 good taste my brother love it
 Has good results but doesn't taste nearly as good as the whey isolate ON sells. The taste is tolerable but not great but the results seem to be great
 ...but it's getting too expensive.
 Great protein and taste is good!
 Luv the flavor
 Everything as expected!
 I've been using their whey protein product for years.  Does the trick.  Decent flavor too, and easy to mix (I use water).
 Hands best protein on the market right now. Getting great results after 3 weeks of usage so far.
 This review is really just for the banana cream flavor, as I have no issue with the quality of the protein.  Did you ever have to take oral amoxicillin as a kid, the thick pink liquid?  Well, this tastes exactly like it.  So I guess the makers of the medicine were going for banana flavor.  I actually liked the taste of the medicine as a kid; for a medicine it's a good flavor, but I don't want my protein shake to taste like medicine.  I bought 5 pounds of this stuff based off of all the positive reviews of the banana cream flavor, and my general liking of things banana flavored, but in two or three months I've only made two shakes.  I'm hoping that adding some other ingredients might cut the unnatural bubble-gum/ fake chemical banana taste, but just thinking about downing a whole glass of oral amoxicillin, no matter what is mixed into it, is very unappetizing so I haven't been motivated to try.
 Still using but good so far. Taste is good and 1.5 of serving size still mixes great.
 This stuff is the best, the taste is great, it mixes great with milk and water. I've tried 2 other brands, one being the GNC brand, and Optimum Nutrition is leaps and bounds better. Also has one of the highest percentage of protein per serving, so you get your moneys worth as well.<br/><br/>10/10, will buy again... when I run out of this in like a year haha
 great product
 Awesome, the tast is super light. Meaning, i have to look for the vanilla ice cream. But yeah,  i see gane and recover time is good so yeah. I like it.
 Mix this with milk and ice and it takes like cold chocolate milk. Yum.
 This is an excellent product to help you control your weight.
 Not as tasty as what the gym sells but good quality and great price. Doesn't leave any artificial sweetner taste like some!
 great price, but this stuff just tastes atrocious.  work on the flavor guys.  either that or you're pretty much stuck throwing in other ingredients to improve the taste.
 Excellent, very tasty and cheap.
 Nothing to complaint. I gain real muscles after using this.
 Amazing product, definitely recommend.
 good product
 Good stuff millions of reviews. Try it you'll like it.
 Excellent taste (I buy the flavor of vanilla ice cream), it dissolves easily.
 My husband drinks this Whey protein almost everyday.  It gives him the energy he needs, and he likes the chocolate flavor.
 Good protein.
 Have used product for a long time and does the job I was looking for
 Been ON protein user for years... great product.Awesome taste!
 best protein for the price
 Thank you
 Got It for a friend and they seem pretty happy with it, best warm with milk or just with milk from what he says
 Bought this for the usual reasons....seem to be a great product at a great price. I am not disappointed. I am making strength and lean muscle mass gains with ON Whey and will keep buying this product indefinitely. I found I did prefer the Rocky Road flavor over the chocolate mint, which surprised me. The mint isn't bad, just wasn't as good as the Rocky Road. I got some banana flavor On this week and I like it too. It has the same flavor as the Laffy Taffy banana candy you may have tried as a kid. If you liked that taste, you like the banana flavor too.
 Forget about protein shake, this was the most delicious shake I've ever had. Blender bottle w/ some milk... made me wanna race through the workout just to have it.
 I use this in our smoothies and it is excellent!
 I saw extremely fast results. I will definitally be ordering more. I've been using it for about 3 weeks and have already put on more than 5 pounds. The strawberry flavor is great. I like using slightly less than the recommended amount of water when i'm at the gym to get a few good swallows of thick protein.
 Great low carb protein, but it does have a small after taste. It mixes well with water or milk
 as advertised
 Great Tast
 Great results fair price
 Good Supplement, bad flavor, should stick to double chocolate. This one is too sweet for me
 Very good and good price.
 Yummy &amp; mixes well. But we ended up trying their "natural gold chocolate" flavor because the "natural" flavors are eligible for Subscribe &amp; Save, and like the savings and flavor of that other one much better.
 Wow, this flavor is amazing.  Mint chocolate chip ice cream is my favorite ice cream, and low and behold, this is my favorite flavor protein.  It mixes great, does not clump and tastes fantastic.
 Good
 good not much different than vanilla for flavor
 One of the best whey protein I ever drink perfect for great flavor and it disolve really quick and easy  I take before workout an it work great how the say i gain almost 4 pound of muscles after drink this just awesome
 ON Whey is basically the best I've been able to find, and I've done A LOT of research. It seems to have less of the nasty chemicals/heavy metals of other brands, and has a lot of protein per scoop compared to calories/fat. It does cost a little extra, but I think it is well worth it. Every flavor I've had has tasted great, and it mixes very well.<br/><br/>One tip: click each flavor and look at the price. Some flavors are randomly $10+ cheaper than others for the same size.<br/><br/>My flavor ratings:<br/>Chocolate Coconut: 4.5/5 - My favorite. Tastes almost like an almond joy bar.<br/>Rocky Road - 4/5 - Pretty good, but just a TAD too sweet for my tastes.<br/>Double Rich Chocolate - 4/5 - Okay on it's own, but my favorite for mixing in things like banana and other fruits. Not overly sweet like some of the flavored ones.
 Taste well and great protein supplement.
 It taste good and has a sweet flavor. I had no problems.I am a vegetarian and it was easy to digest.
 Not delicious.. barely strawberry. Did not hold..<br/>I am on a protein shake program currently. I wanted to get additional flavors to have variety. This faux strawberry is not a keeper. It isn't tasty and that strawberry quick flavor is not palatable. Also, a 16oz shake w/non daily milk and a tbsp of fiber should hold off hunger for 5-6 hours.. this one didn't make it 3.  I went to GNC and even they advised Isopure over Gold Standard.
 Awesome prouct, great price! I've tried several brands but In my opinion this is the best whey protein on the market by far!
 S*** tastes like Strawberry cake. F'n Delicious! Don't know why others are complaining, must've gotten a bad batch. Thank You!
 best protien powder i have ever used.
 The only issue i had was the package was damaged when i opened it but they sent me a new one very quickly! great protein powder, mixes up easy in shaker cup ... prices use to be a lot cheaper but they have been raising them for the last 8 months, its went up by 30 - 40 % so buy now or they might raise again! I will be looking other places until they drop there prices back down. It still beats GNC !!!!!
 very good taste
 Its all good, kind expensive 57$..In my gym its only 49.99
 Just as described and good price.
 Tastes great and you know you're getting a quality product. No uncomfortable side effects. Mixes okay with hot liquids and very well with cold liquids. Have used it in baked goods with some success, albeit a strange dry texture in the good.
 Good protein overall , it has more servings than any other brand. Never get cookies and cream trust me I had to go through hell trying to drink it for a month
 Its protein. What can go wrong?...
 I prefer the vanilla, but this formula mixes easy and tastes ok.
 Great quality.
 Product tastes great and mixes very well (no clumps)....
 The gold standard. Bonus is that it blends well, tastes great, and comes with BCAAs.
 Great tasting, great mixing and no excess calories!
 This is just white noise as it falls in line with hundreds of other positive reviews, if you are using a different whey (that isn't made by ON) you are wasting money.
 I ordered a small size in case I didn't like it. I tried it with milk and it's very similar in taste to strawberry Nesquik. I'll keep it and order it again in the future.
 Tastes great in a smoothie made of frozen strawberries and milk. Tastes decent; plenty of protein per serving.
 I like this powder.<br/><br/>It tastes very good.  I mix it with almond milk and have a Blender bottle to mix.<br/><br/>Is it working:  I think so.
 I did not enjoy whatever food I was eating (i.e. yogurt, oatmeal, etc...) mixed with strawberry banana whey. I did not like the texture. The yogurt was too thick and the oatmeal was not appetizing. However, when I ate everything separate and drank the whey instead, it was much better.
 If you mix Strawberry with milk it tastes like a strawberry milkshake. Mix it with water and it tastes good as well!
 Just bought this protein and have already used it in numerous recipes and have been very pleased with the result. It tastes delicious (just like chocolate!) and I like that I can make more than just a protein shake with it.
 Tastes amazing mixed with light vanilla almond milk and half of a banana. Yum!
 Mint Chocolate is delicious, and the mint is very subtle. Way easier to down compared to French Vanilla.
 Great taste and shipped quickly.
 This is the best tasting whey protein I have ever tried!  I will only buy this brand from now on.  I have tried several brands and flavors over the years and this one beat them all.  Amazing.  Dissolves great in water or milk.  I use in water and it still tastes AWESOME.  Very very pleased.  I bought the chocolate malt flavor.
 Best whey proteins ever. Been using it for years and it is my go-to whey protein brand.
 This flavor is by far the best we have tried. I eat unsweetened cereal in the mornings and put about a third of a scoop in my cereal - sounds weird - but you have to try it! Great taste, and my kids love it too.
 Pretty good, worth its value but unfortunately has been giving me acne outbreaks.
 Always a go to protein
 Its a good item this one!<br/>The quality is very good and works perfect for me!<br/>The shipment was very good too!
 I liked it. Mixes well and when I mixed it with silk milk dark chocolate it was great. Decent gains.
 Good experience<br/>Quick shopping tricks on amazon.com<br/> ...]
 Good experience<br/>Quick shopping tricks on amazon.com<br/> ...]
 Tastes amazing!
 Great taste
 Good product but taste could be better
 Very tasty.
 FYI, this is unsweetened.  Tastes like cocoa.
 The extreme milk chocolate flavor is the best! I highly recommend this product to anyone, especially anyone new to protein powder because it doesn't have the expected chalky taste I assumed I would have to deal with when taking this. High quality and best value for your money on the market.
 I tried the Chocolate flavor stuff and I have to plug my nose to even get it down. It tasted so bad. But I read that a lot of people were liking the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor so I gave that a try.<br/>Best Protein powder (That's not extremely fatty) that I have ever had. I can easily drink it will water, milk, or whatever.<br/>My only complaint (about most powders) is they need to package the scoop on the outside. I hate spending 10 mins to dig through the powder to find that thing.
 This is my most favorite protein powder, and I have tried many. It dissolves well, doesn't have a gritty, mouthy feel, and tastes great too. Amazon also has the cheapest prices anywhere I've looked.
 Best protein out there with least amount of fat. Perfect for anyone looking to supplement their protein levels. Best taste banana cream!
 ON SIMPLY NEVER FAILS<br/><br/>Quality - Consistency -
 I have played around with other proteins and my body reacts differently to them all. This is by far my favorite. The taste is good with water and even better with milk. When you consider all the extras as far as the amino acids it provides on top of the protein it is the best value for your money.<br/>Men's health magazine I read rated it the best protein out there.
 Hands down the best protein I have ever had, Double Rich Choc !! Awesome, I will not go with anything esle
 I am having hard time dissolving properly the powder.
 I love this stuff.  It's a low calorie protein powder that tastes great.  I usually get the milk chocolate flavor and it tastes exactly like chocolate milk.
 Best chocolate protein powder
 Excellent.  My wife makes an ice coffee with it and loves it.
 Best out there!
 This so far best protein powder on the market
 The chocolate has a good flavor.
 Good stuff, the best!
 One of the best proteins out there. Great bang for your buck. Trusted company.
 my sons love this product
 Great tasting, good performance, fills you up and controls cravings. I highly recommend!
 Good but now drinking whey isolate.
 good
 Taste is alright when mixed in water. I prefer double chocolate over this.
 Great product if you get it on line. Just don't get it from Costco, its a different formula.
 I use this for my breakfast smoothies and it tastes great.  I'll probably try some other flavors as well but would definitely recommend this one.
 Mixes well, tastes good
 I'm a frequent user of this protein. It is an amazing product. Tastes great, mixes well, even smells good. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a powder form protein supplement.
 Yum best flavor yet
 Good quality, tastes great, mixes well... I love it!
 It (coffee flavor) is easily mixed with water. So easy that it surprises me every time. The chocolate and other flavors usually stick together and very difficult to mix completely. BTW, after talking to their customer service I was able to verify that The Gold Standard 100% Whey Protein is suitable for Lacto-Vegetarians as this product does not contain meat, fish, poultry, or eggs.  Also they say coffee, double rich chocolate, chocolate mint, and cake donut has no alcohol in their flavoring system.<br/>I hope this helps.
 I am sold on the quality of this product
 Quality protein with good taste.  Have tasted better., but not at this quality level.<br/>mixes well with a hand blended and price to protein is excellent
 Love this protein and i love the flavor as well. this is my second time purchasing. I mix it with coffee before my workouts.
 SuPerb
 Cupcake flavor tastes like a vanilla milkshake. Don't mix with water though, then it tastes awful.
 Fast shipping and taste great.
 Very good and a good price for the amount.
 Great. Third so far
 I love the product, however I was actually trying to get the Cake Battery flavor but it never changed and that's my fault for not double checking before placing the order.
 This is the best protein supplement I have ever used. Not only do I feel better, but this stuff really works. I've been told that Optimum Nutrition isn't know for it's great flavor, but this one actually tastes good. I wasn't sure which flavor to go with because they have so many. I went with the mocha cappuccino because of the caffeine. I'm glad I chose this because I had to use it to water a few times and it actually didn't taste that bad. When it is mixed with milk, it tastes really good. If you need a protein supplement, get ON. The 5 pound container is huge, but if you use it regularly, it goes quick. You can save a good deal of money by getting the 5 pound.
 I have tried lots of brands, to me the Milk Choc. tasted bad, Syntha6 much better taste, oh well maybe another flavor better.........
 Great price for the amount of product.  The taste is excellent.
 Creat tasting, easy to mix product at a fair price...
 Cool
 Taste is good. However the scoop is not included in the can.
 way over priced, but I like the taste.
 My wife and have bought three tubs now and the flavors, not to mention the effectiveness of the formula is awesome.  I have had Double chocolate, Mocha Cappuccino and now Banana cream.  I prefer Banana cream, but they all tasted really good.
 it taste so good.
 Great taste, great mixing, great product.
 The taste was a little funky at first but now I love it. I put it in a glass of water and just drink it straight. Not entirely sure how much it's doing for me but I always have it after a work out and don't usually wind up sore the next day.
 I just started taking protein shakes.along with working out and chill diet I have noticed small results. I have tried several different protein shakes and this one tastes really good.
 Taste great, devolves perfectly, high quality protein great deal. I don't think there is a better whey protein out yet.
 Great taste. Mixes well.
 No scoop inside the jar. Disappointed. I have purchased these many times earlier and always had a scoop inside the jar.
 Great product.  Awesome taste when mixed with water and 1/2 of one banana (3 scoops of whey).  I will continue to purchase ON products as results are superb to other products I've tried.
 great product, used it all.
 My son only wants this brand as the taste and dissolvability are superior. He wants no other brand any more
 Stick with regular chocolate flavors. This one does not taste good unless mixed with milk. Even then it, to me, tastes like it has cinnamon in it. I bought other chocolate flavors in the past that were much better. Overall product is good though.
 I love this protein. Gives me good results from my workout. Also the one day delivery is just perfect for me. Saves me a trip to GNC store.
 the taste is very very bad i hope i can change it
 Horrible flavor; triggered my gag reflex immediately after consumption. Do not recommend.
 Great flavor, and easy to mix.  I use milk and a banana with the mix.
 She seems to appreciate the mass I've added since I switched to this protein powder. Thanks, ON, for these pecs.
 Good price. Good protein. Fast shipping. Convenient buying online. Thanks.
 Good quality compared to a lot of other protein powders. Rocky road tastes great.
 very good recommended
 Delicious!  1 scoop with water for a light afternoon shake or 1 scoop to make a thicker shake with almond milk and still delicious!
 Best protein powder that I have tried in my 5+ years of weight training. Great taste (Double Chocolate), excellent mixability, quality product. Makes it so easy to hit my macros without sacrificing taste or quality. 5 stars.
 We buy this so often it's silly. Great chocolate flavor and mixes well.
 Great protein  great taste!
 This Whey protein mixes VERY easily (without the need for a blender or shaker) and tastes great!  No issues, whatsoever!
 I have been using Gold Standard Whey for 5 years now, and I love it. The only flavors I've had are Chocolate Malt and Chocolate Coconut. I love both! I would give both 5 star, however, Cookies and Cream is just OK. Thus the 3 stars.
 In my opinion after years of constant use, Optimum Nutrition is the best protein for the price. Its super high-quality Whey protein, the taste is about the best it can be (for having under 3g of sugar), and the price is fair for its value. Whether your goals are to burn fat &amp; gain some muscle or your goals are to pack on pounds of muscle (and you don't want a bloating, weight gainer) THIS is the protein for you.
 I really do like this protein and I've been using it for a little over a year now. Now when I ran out and went to go buy some more; I realized they increased their prices by 15$! I was getting this protein at 10$/lb; and now that it's summer time and people care about fitness apparently they decided to raise their prices. I may be looking for new proteins now at this rate.
 I am very happy for that kind thing. It is very nice and very good quality. Also very good priece
 will buy again
 taste great in smoothies. Banana flavor taste artificial on its own.
 Easiest protein shake to drink in my opinion.
 I bought the double rich chocolate and it is delicious. It mixes so easily I can take double the amount of protein than if I were to use a different brand.
 Mixes easily with water, I have double chocolate and with water it tastes exactly like chocolate milk, much better than my old protien powder which was clumpy. The 5pm
 I've ONLY gone with Optimum Nutrition, and they have the most amazing flavors that make it seem like you're just drinking a Milk Shake.  I would highly recommend a blender instead of a shaker bottle, because it can be difficult to get the powder to completely dissolve.  I absolutely love this stuff.  Great source of amino acids, proteins, and other nutrients.<br/><br/>I've heard of other brands tasting like garbage, I am glad I went with ON, because they all taste like milk shakes to me!<br/>(Strawberry banana is my favorite!)
 I have tried some other whey proteins.  This has a great flavor and mixes very well with water.  This is just what I was looking for.
 I have been buying Optimum Nutrition Double Chocolate Whey for 10 years! I love their product, they are widely recognized as the best in the business, and Amazon offers a great deal.
 Always my protein powder of choice. Tastes great
 I've set new PRs in Squat and Deadlift since taking this stuff.  That's only correlation, but there you have it , it's true.
 Be careful...it will cause you to gain weight.
 I liked it!
 Good dissolvability, good taste, no complaints whatsoever! Been using this product for years
 ALL the promotional product photos for this item show the Informed Choice logo, however, the item sent to me does NOT have that logo. It seems as though Informed Choice no longer certifies this product and therefore collegiate athletes and others who may be tested for banned substances should avoid this product.
 Best protein that i ever drink, is so good
 Not as tasty as Extreme Milk Chocolate but not bad either.
 Best whey protein on the planet.
 Good buy for the money. Great amount of servings per container. Has helped me greatly with maintaining my mass overall.
 I love it with milk. Healthy cocoa!
 I believe it is helpful to my health but I don't know how to give comment. I take it everyday which maybe the best comment.
 Fast delivery. good product. good price. although my mom prefer less sweet flavor
 Love and it takes only 3 days on normal delivery
 Mixes well with water and tastes great with Milk. The taste is that of whey but the smell is chocolaty and good.
 Your whey protein is only as good as your workout!
 I love this whey protein. It is the only flavor and brand I buy. You can mix anything with it and it is amazing.
 I had tried many flavors before. To give you an idea about my taste, for me vanilla was the worst, chocolate was ok, strawberry, banana (or their mixture) was good. However, none of these flavors were good with water and I had to mix with milk even though I am trying to avoid milk. This time I tried white chocolate flavor. It is very good even with water! And when you mix it with milk, it turns to something like a milk shake, super delicios, the only problem (?) being lots of bubbles it makes.<br/><br/>Regarding the seller, everything was great and I received it super fast, even though I didn't pay for any shipping (it was standard shipping but  got it in 3 days).
 I have used it before and just as expected.  I use with milk to add calories for breakfast.
 Tastes ok.. It can get a little clumpy, but not too bad.
 By far the best one. I use then twice a day .. early morning and after workout.
 Although it has a rich chocolate taste, but I could still feel the after taste, not sure how to describe it but would prefer not to have that sense in my mouth. it is better if mixed coconut milk, but did not like mix with plain water at all.
 Taste Great! This size is great of you are looking for two to three workouts a week.
 Will buy again, but the flavor isn't the greatest.
 Awesome. I've been using Optimum Nutrition Whey protein for years. This stuff is the best nutrition, taste, and priced protein powder there is.
 I've been using this product for years and i will not buy another bottle!!!
 Great with milk and not so great with water. I would recommend that you take this with milk if you're looking for that mocha taste, otherwise it is kind of flat.
 I bought this for my boyfriend as a present. So far he seems to like it! I've tried it myself, and as protein powder shakes go, this one tastes pretty good. Evidently the chocolate flavor is the best (according to my boyfriend). I also believe this size at this price is one of the best deals out there.
 i just didnt like that flavor, but its one of the best protein.
 As good as it gets, top quality and good product
 Third time I've ordered this ten pound bag, protein is great but this time the bag came to me with a hole. The hole isn't huge but just big enough for powder to leak out if you're not careful.
 Amazing!! Tastes like a chocolate shake
 I bought it for DH, he likes it, says based on his research its the best protein shake powder out there...likes the flavor, recommend! price is not bad either
 Great taste
 I gained 20 Pounds as I took this after working out.
 Delicious! I use it every morning for healthy smoothies
 Mixes well, tastes good, and has quality ingredients.
 Tastes great, high in sugar but otherwise good.
 I am not a nutritionist, so I will leave the comments and facts up to those qualified people, but on the subject matter of Taste, this is great. I went with extreme milk chocolate and liked it a lot!
 Good taste.
 This is probably the best as far as a protein supplement. It has a lot of extra vitamins and amino acids that a lot of other protein shakes do not have. The taste is bland when you mix it with water, but it is not too bland when mixed with milk. Not a bad taste, but not the greatest. I will buy it again..
 I like to try different flavors. The mocha is disgusting. Take my word for it. I gotta finish it but im never buying this flavor again.
 Simple review this is a good supplement and the flavors are good
 The best product for the money.
 great price, good quality whey!
 Great!
 It is okay, but there are better tasting protein powders on the market.
 Great product at a great price
 This flavor of protein tastes much much better than the normal chocolate and vanilla. NICE protein healthier than other brands.... If you can't find the scoop don't panic, shake the tub its at the bottom.
 My boyfriend loves this stuff! He makes protein shakes with it after the gym and it keeps him full until dinner!
 I've always liked Optimum Nutrition protein, it's definitely my favorite. I ordered 5lbs of the Mocha Capuccino flavor and it's the best stuff I've ever had! Doesn't even taste like protein, more like a delicious shake!
 I like the taste. I mix a half gallon of water at a time up with it. I use a <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Green-Birdseed-Funnel/dp/B000E45N0O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Green Birdseed Funnel</a> to fill a one gallon milk bottle. Shake and serve.
 this stuff works great, Ive been drinking anywhere from 2-3 shakes a day for a month now and still have a ton left. You CANNOT deny the value of this product.. at GNC the same amount of this stuff is almost $100 not kidding you, thank you Amazon!
 Just perfect for what i needed it for.
 Great taste and results
 A very good product. I mix it with water and my creatine. It dissolves well and tastes great. I recommend this product.
 BEST WHEY PROTEIN ON THE MARKET.
 good
 ON is a trusted brand because they actually put what they say they put in this product. A lot of other products don't have as much protein as the label says.<br/>Tastes good<br/>Doesn't make my breath smell bad like other proteins.
 Awesome Flavor!
 Can't go wrong with the milk chocolate.  I mix it in water and it can get a bit plain sometimes but it's very tolerable and you don't get sick of it.
 Love it!
 Flavor tastes so freaking bad...
 Tastes really good
 Love this stuff!  Competitive price.
 I love the brand but cake batter flavor is actually nasty and it's basically vanilla flavor. I would not recommend that flavor. Strawberry banana is the best. Good in milk or water.
 I normally use progenex but was trying to find something in a more budget friendly price range. This taste pretty good. No complaints
 Excellent
 The only Whey I will use. I love Optimum Nutrition, and use many of their products.
 This stuff tastes really good, pretty much exactly like Nesquik if I remember right from childhood. Mixing a scoop with a cup of almond milk and a banana makes for a delicious shake.
 not a bad protein
 I was glad this tasted as good as it does. I decided to take a chance on another flavor since I normally just drink chocolate.
 Double choclatey delicious lean gains.
 Good protein. Mixes well in shaker. I have vanilla ice cream now, but i will try a different flavor next time.
 It's protein :)
 Tastes delicious
 Works well
 Best protein out there.
 Great protein supp. taste is delicious and has exactly the right ingredients I want in my protein powered.
 Finally a protein powder I will buy over and over again! Great quality and quantity. Also, the flavor is delicious.
 I got the 'Extreme Milk Chocolate' flavor and am surprisingly happy with the product. I'm not that big of a fan of changing products after finding one I like. However, my old protein powder was starting to add up a lot. Not only does this shake actually taste like chocolate milk when you use milk, but it has more protein than my last, more expensive protein powder. It also mixes fairly well when shaken. I recommend this to everyone.
 Good gains, three shakes a day with optimum nutrition creatine, good natural gains.
 Great product, great delivery, great price.
 Great supplement for beginners.
 Best protein shake flavor HANDS DOWN!!<br/><br/>I recommend this ON Whey Protein 100%<br/><br/>The taste is amazing! I mix it up with 1% Chocolate Milk and you don't even know you have protein in there.<br/><br/>Very Smooth after-taste almost unnoticeable!
 It is the best protein.  I love the taste and it is very filling.
 Tastes fine and its a pretty decent price. I recommend this to anyone who works out or needs mor eprotien in their system
 Can get any better than this! Love it!
 Always buy this, repeat orders, great protein
 Tried lots of different protein powders but this one has the most protein with least amount of sugar.
 tastes great mixed with coffee. works as advertised
 Love this stuff. Lasts about three months which makes the hefty price tag seem less steep. The powder mixes easily and you don't get clumps like with other powders.
 I like this product taste is fine and seems as listed.
 rocky road is the shiz
 This flavor is chalky tasting
 Tastes great!!  Ordering more next week (when this one runs out).  I'm glad I tried it.
 It smells weird dry, tastes decent after being mixed.
 Mixes well and taste good.
 Tastes like crap, but gets me gains.
 simply the best
 Great flavor!
 Quality protien. I use it to add protien to certain foods I cook. I trust the name.
 Tastes as described. Perhaps a bit too sweet though (usually mixed with water). Will try a new flavor next time.
 Would not buy this again. The taste is bad. Leaves a bad after taste in your mouth. This product gives my wife a headache after 2 different tries. Will switch back to iso 100.
 This stuff is excellent, great taste without the grittyness of typical whey products
 I like this protein, but still expensive. I hope they would lower the price.
 Rocky Road taste like coffee and i would not buy again cause I don't like cofee.
 The only protein I use.
 Solid product at a good price.
 Still one of the best tasting (Vanilla Ice Cream) and mixing whey protein powder out there!!
 Extreme milk is not a very good flavor. Would recommend double rich instead
 best product out there
 Great tasting, dissolves completely.
 Delicious, smooth, can drink it plain with water and it does the job! I won't be switching products any time soon.
 Excellent product..
 Arrived on time. And i have a lot of good things to say. It took me to try out a couple other brands to really realize how good this stuff is. THey arent kidding when they call it the "gold Standard"<br/><br/>First off the consistency of the shake. No matter how much you use, the shake is generally the same consistency. its never thicker then Eggnog. and it shakes up really fast. This is really easy to get the flavor just the way you like, if it isnt strong enough i just throw another scoop in and shake that bad boy up. Its the same consistency, but the flavor is suddenly exploding.<br/><br/>THE FLAVOR. Double Rich Chocolate is where its at. Absolutely delicious.<br/><br/>As far as results: If my metabolism wasnt as fast as a bugatti veyron i would have gained ten pounds in 2 months. Not joking around. But I worked my A$$ off. Every day, sometimes twice a day and i was always dead and miserable after my workouts. I went on winter break and didnt have gym access.every day i literally watched my muscles wither away like and old piece of fruit. So sad.  maybe I'll try "serious Mass" next. who knows, i got money to blow.<br/><br/>Probably going to buy this and "Serious Mass" after I finish my tub of Phase 8. I loved this product.
 Awesome taste great
 Great flavor, very smooth taste overall.  I have tried a lot of protein powders and this is my favorite for the price.  Not gritty like many protein powders can be...
 the package and taste and price are great...63 dollars ...doesnt get cheaper than this...and doesnt taste likee met rx products which give u a sachharine like taste...
 The only name I trust when purchasing whey protein is ON.  Excellent product, and has never failed me yet.
 Tastes great and mixes smoothly
 Best whey out there for the price.
 This is the second order and thus far I like. I will continue ordering this product.
 My favorite protein power delivered to my door!
 Thank You!
 Good Taste.
 Loved it. I use this every day and you will love the taste. I would 100% recommend this product to my friends.
 To grannie and hard to dissolve. You stir and stir and when you drink you need a spoon to get the product out of the bottom of the glass
 This is the secret to my strength, the hair to my sampson. I have achieved what the elders call "huge". I am swollen. I am bloated, like a corpse. Children point to me in the street and their mothers cover their eyes and usher them away. People look at me and say "that man must be really sick, look how swollen he is". I can now only fit through doorways sideways. I don't really speak anymore, I just grunt the word "massif" again and again.<br/><br/>Also, it tastes like chocolate, which is pretty great
 Good product
 This is one of the best tasting  protein's out there... This chocolate mint flavor taste like strait up Andes candies, omg so good!<br/><br/>Try it out guys!<br/><br/>They never have this flavor in stores so your going to have to pull the trigger and give it a try for yourself! It's so worth it!
 It was delivered before than expected! GREAT!
 Good. My husband loves it. Thank you.
 5 stars because it kept me full! Other than that I dont like the smell and I dont care for the taste! Ill suck it up though especially since I did get the 5lb tub lol<br/><br/>-Cookies and Cream
 It taste great
 Fast and easy A++
 Best tasting Protien
 The only protein I use other than ON casein!
 I have been using this product for years. It stays fresh and blends smooth. I like the taste and only mix it with water.
 Smells like coffee, the taste not so much
 Usually protein shakes taste like crap. But this is like chocolate milk, but with PROTEIN!!! It's hella good.
 This is one of the easier to mix and better tasting whey protein powders out there. I use a Blender Ball, and it mixes in seconds.
 Perfect
 When you use milk it tastes like nesquick. Pretty awesome.
 Optimum Gold Is the best tasting and always highest rated whey you can get. Stick with what works.
 nice product thanks.
 The best product out there. Look for their purest whey at costco. About a pound less and 5 more grams of protein per scoop. Also tastes better. Overall a good deal if you are using your points.
 Whey Protein EXCELLENT!!!!  No need to say more
 Not bad. It's not as flavorful as some of the others but gets the job done
 very good
 Good taste.  Use with V8 Fusion.
 Delicious!
 Great flavor....no complaints.
 I am extremely picky when it comes to protein powder but I love the flavor of the Double Rich Chocolate!
 Great
 I like it.
 ok
 Simply the best!
 Great
 Love , Love , Love it !
 Great love it
 This is the only protein I use, pound for price, I love it. As always they are always trying to increase the efficiency of the protein and avoid the waste, that's where hydro whey comes in but entirely to exspensive to take daily
 Good product!
 this powder mixes easily, tastes great! I remember back in the 80s, the stuff that was around, did not mix well, or taste as good, as this product.
 Best protein on the market.
 My boyfriend bought this and loves this product. We have tried several protein shakes and this by far tastes the best and is SO easy to mix- no clumps! We've only tried the Rocky Road because that is what was recommended to us, but we will venture to try the other flavors as well. I love that this product is low in carbs and calories as well.
 Definitely satisfied with fast this was shipped and how much whey I got for the price! Way better than any price I would find in a brick &amp; mortar store.
 When looking at proteins powders there are many things you should take into consideration. Serving size, servings per container, protein per serving, calories per serving, fat per serving, sugar per serving, carbs per serving and taste are some of the most important. I have compiled a run down of some of these things in my review.<br/><br/>Quality:<br/>This protein has been carefully comprised to be the best for your nutrition needs. It has a great balance of calories, protein, fat and carbs. It might not be the best product for those looking to gain lots of weight fast but it is very good a supplementing a diet to add a little more protein to it without adding too many carbs. It is also made from high quality weigh from Glanbia. Glanbia is the manufacturer that owns ON; this makes the whole operation in house leaving little room for quality issues.<br/><br/>Frugality:<br/>This product is hands down one of the highest quality and most economical proteins on the market. After searching through multiple similar product some by Optimum and some by other brands none where able to beat the cost per serving of protein that ON Gold standard offers. Though ON’s Gold Standard protein is not the cheapest protein on the market. I made multiple comparison charts trying to find a product that beat ON nutrition in a cost analysis of the categories listed above with some discrepancy.  The cost per serving of carbs I did a little differently as it was not something I was looking for a high value in as I’m currently trying to slim down on carbs at the moment.<br/><br/>Taste:<br/>I purchased the “Double Rich Chocolate” as my flavor of choice. And I think anyone will love how this protein tastes. ON has found the perfect balance between the “overly sweet” candy protein powders and the “gross chalky” tasting powders that clump together. Bringing me to my next point, this is one of the easiest to dissolve proteins that you can buy. You will never experience any clumping when using ON Gold Standard protein. I have used this powder with both a nutribullet and a shaker bottle and have never experienced problems of clumping with either.<br/><br/>In my opinion this is by far the best well rounded protein powder on the market. Thanks to its great taste, exceptional quality and great cost per serving of nutrition categories. Defiantly give it a try you will not regret it!
 Tub was not sealed and half-empty, no scoop.
 Good
 Good and genuine product
 Great protein
 great
 Double Rich Chocolate still has the original formula!!
 Delicious, as expected, shipping came quick and nothing damaged. Do you lift bro?
 Delicious.
 Good value for a shake with the supplements I was looking for. It mixes well, even when I forget my shaker bottle. The taste is also great - not like many of the fake sweeteners in similar brands. Highly recommend!
 The taste is terrible - but he the pain for the gain baby!
 Biggest bang for the buck.
 Amazing. I don't even feel sore after workouts if I take this stuff right after. Found my protein brand for sure.
 I love the French Vanilla Creme flavor. It's tasty with water and do joke with milk. A convenient way to hit my daily protein requirements. I definitely recover faster when I'm taking in adequate protein, and this makes it easy and painless.
 very good
 thanks ,love it
 Tasty and blends well
 Quality protein at a fair price and it tastes delicious. Have 2 scoops twice a day and I'm loving every single gulp.<br/>Add peanutbutter, blueberries, 2scoops of whey in a blender with ice and you have a delicious nutricious smoothie!
 GAINS GAINS GAINS. Alright, enough bro talk. Purchased the strawberry flavor one and oh boy does it taste good. :) Can't complain.
 Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard is "THE REAL DEAL" !!! My Husband and I love it. My Man's Result's Are "WOW...The Man Of Steel Return's" !!!
 Best on the market
 👌🏻
 Tastes decent with both milk and water.  ON has been shown to have pretty close to the advertised amount of protein while many other brands are much less.
 I am working on my second bag of this.  I think it tastes great and its an excuse to drink chocolate milk 3 times a day.  I use it because I started lifting weights several months ago and I want to make sure that I am taking in enough protein.  Seems inexpensive to me as well. I will continue to buy this product...especially if the price goes down further.  wink wink.
 It tastes really good and mixes better than most brands.  Haven't used it enough to tell how "quality" it is, but I know a couple fitness freaks that swear by it.
 Didnt have the scooper cup.
 Awesome flavor, mixes very well. Would purchase again in a heartbeat
 Purchased this after trying Isopure Creamy Vanilla. While the consistency here is comparable, I found the Extreme Milk Chocolate flavor to be much sweeter in comparison. You definitely get more powder per dollar, though I'm not entirely sure whether the actual protein per dollar is that much different. All in all, it was okay, nothing special.<br/><br/>I might purchase another flavor if I want to mix things up, but for now I'll try a different brand and see what the market has to offer.
 Head and shoulders above the rest of the other Whey Proteins out there.
 Very good nutrition  for sport
 Excellent product.  Great price.
 love it
 Good flavor blends good. This a good post workout because it is a fast acting protein. Will definitely buy this again.
 Too sweet
 The vanilla ice cream flavor is so sweet you can't eat it!  Other flavors are good, but don't waste your money on this one.
 Taste great, exactly like banana.  Use it every morning in my shake
 Tastes great and mixes well. Does what it says. I like that its protein powder and not much else mixed in, which helps if you only want to increase protein intake and not vitamin intake. Excellent for muscle building.
 This is really good weight, really good taste, really good price.
 This product arrived on the date it was promised, Kudo's to Amazon! It is one of the better tasting Whey products on tne market and time will tell if the results are as expected.
 Last forever GREAT QUALITY
 Use this to make Frappes. Good chocolatey flavor.
 As per other reviews--giving 1 star due to a change in recipe and decrease in quality.
 Can't live without it! Perfect in taste and in its benefits! 5 stars! Will definitely buy it again and again!
 An excellent protein powder for a very good price. It is not as chocolatey as other protein powders I have tried but it is good enough. I would highly recommend it.
 delicious and it works !!
 Love Optimum Nutrition supplements!! Cookies and cream mixes well and taste great!
 Rich wonderful flavor!!  Delicious as a stand alone shake!!
 Wasn't sure if I would like this flavor but took a chance. It was delicious and tasted better in water than the the chocolate I normally buy.
 Good, extreme milk chocolate is a little weird. You get used to it in a good way
 Tastes amazing, no stomach aches, no need to eat before, and mixes well with water. I love it, and will designate it as my go-to protein mix for my workouts.
 Gains
 This is the best whey isolate on the market period! Great price and taste.  Great with  frozen fruit and  cashew milk buzzed up in my ninja blender.... a little peanut butter too!
 It’s fake it’s taste is too bad and you can see white dots inside oh my god it’s too bad
 Delicious and almost no carbs!
 i've always bought this product, and was disappointed in this purchase. it did not come with a scoop inside and there was not a seal.
 This tasted terrible.
 Great Product ..AAAAA ++++++
 taste good and blends well
 Product came with no seal on outside or inside
 Great quality, and less expensive than other options.
 Best stuff out there, flavors are awesome. Been an ON user for a few years now, tried a few in between...always end up coming back!
 Great nutritional value, low carbs and sugars, high quality protein content, and a huge variety of flavors. This protein mixes well and doesn't clump up. Also tastes great with water. My favorite is the double chocolate.
 Tastes great!  Take this protein supplement daily.  Favorite product.
 It's a great and useful for us to do good by
 Rocky road is delicious.  The plain chocolate was okay, too.  Mixed with almond milk.
 I am new to the protein supplement market and checked out all of the rating sites before choosing.  I have tried several products all were rated well, but this one tastes the best.  For the cost on Amazon I will continue to buy it.
 Easy to use
 Best protein on the market by far. Great taste wether mixed in milk or water.
 Protein... Not a bad taste.  It does its job.
 Love it! Tastes great!
 Yum. Double Chocolate.
 Extreme Milk Chocolate tastes disgustingly fake. I found out sucralose has an awful taste and it gives me a headache.
 Orgasmic, seriously, I'm in the middle of the mentioned orgasm at the moment and I cannot continue with my review. Oh god, ughnnnn.
 love it...
 Great protein, definitely seeing my gains. Cookies n Cream, to me tastes pretty good, better with water than with milk actually. I like the flavor, but not my favorite.
 5 stars
 Good game product
 great taste!
 I have used this protein for over 10 years and it is the only one I buy. Great taste. It mixes fairly well in a shaker cup with 8oz of 2% milk.  I normally mix 1 1/2 scoops with 8 oz of 2% milk, raspberries &amp; oats, with an immersion blender. I have mixed with other fruits and chocolate syrup and what not. Great value!
 This stuff is always great tasting. I have tryed the other flavors and by far this one tastes the best. And taste great mixed with strawberries and some ice tast like icecream.
 Fantastic.  It's cheaper than Body Fortress Whey Isolate locally, and it tastes better, too.  I'll be buying this frequently.
 Love it. With only Kale and water this stuff makes it taste amazing. For most people and fitness goals whey is all you need.<br/><br/>This is milk based so it you're lactose intolerant you may experience gas.
 Excellent tasting source of whey protein and price per oz. is very good. I would buy this again and will buy more soon as I am almost out.
 As advertised. I've been using this Whey for about a year now. Taste great!
 Banana cream... what more can I say. It's perfect!
 Worth every cent. Taste is great, and dissolves easily. Product arrived a day early and was very neatly packed.
 It's good buy it
 Best protien powder in taste and easy to digest
 Great for after gym workouts.
 No scoop
 Do not be afraid and just buy it . Very useful and effective. The cost worth its quality. Peace )))
 Love that it is whey based without significant soy!
 A+
 Needs more flavor
 If you use this product to supplement your current(healthy) diet, it will work. You will definitely see gains. I personally love the chocolate flavors best.
 Tastey!
 Really good! On time delivery!!
 This is the best whey protein you can buy.  It is top quality, it has BCAAs for post-workout recovery, glutamine-it's all there.  Just take a scoop after lifting weights and in the morning for some added protein.  The taste is also super great.  I like banana cream the best, but strawberry banana is good as well.  It goes great in shakes.  My special recipe:  about 4-5 oz milk, one scoop of this, some nonfat yogurt (I like to use Greek), some oatmeal (try it!), some flax seed (very healthy), some frozen fruit, two egg whites, and a splash of pomegranite juice.  It tastes amazing and is very healthy and packed with protein.
 Just got this as of today. Ordered it last friday, said it will come in 3 days but it came a day earlier so tht was awesome. Like everyone says here easy to mix in a blender bottle. I mix with whole milk and it taste good. Cant wait to see results with creatine and my gain weight supplement (Serious Mass).
 aaa
 Good product. Taste a little too much sugar... I will not buy again. Double chocolate taste much better!
 Great product at a fabulous price.
 Really good in smoothes
 The best test ever Double Chocolate
 teats great
 Very good!
 high quality protein with a great price
 I always buy this product when it's time to restock on protein. The flavor is always great and mixes easy with anything.
 Great product
 Good chocolate taste without being too strong and has no aftertaste. Dissolves well in cold water. Would order this product again.
 5 stars for this product. Thank you.
 Love it! Better than muscle milk powder shake. The taste and protien count is amazing. Im a daily user of this and im hooked.
 Very good
 Where is my spoon??? TERRIBLE
 Good stuff
 Like the taste,and don't feel full,bloated!
 Great price! Highly recommend
 Great Product. Shipped new.
 This shake doesn't taste like a normal protein powder drink, it tastes like strawberry flavored nestle quick
 Had it with water in a shaker and half of it became bubbles. It felt quite disgusting to drink them down.
 My go-to whey. Tastes great and mixes great.
 great taste
 Sempli dalishus. The tastyness of the chocolate milk one is making me go nuts!
 i do fasting cardio every morning and day dream about this shake the entire time!!!! its better than dessert. Too delicious i almost feel like its a sin!
 Great protein. great price
 I would recommend this flavor to anybody. There is usually a huge stigma that all protein blended with water will taste "meh" at best and "God this is the worst thing ever" at worst. Not the case with Mocha Cappuccino. Either with Milk or Water, I genuinely look forward to drinking my shake. Excellent job by ON on this one.
 Purchased this a long time ago when it was still going for sub-$100. Nowadays I don't think this stuff is worth the price tag. You can find cheaper per lb.
 Tastes great
 I like the flavor
 This was suppose to be vanilla.
 First time I've ever left a review, and I've been using Amazon for many years. I was using poverty whey (Body Fortress), and now I'm using this, and it tastes wonderful. I had to talk my Mom out of eating it because I don't like sharing my protein with the unaware. Tastes delightful. This is for the extreme milk chocolate by the way.
 Have been using this for couple of years now. Consume this almost everyday post workout. Tastes great and blends well with milk.
 great taste and works very well
 What a bargain this is! Im at about a quarter left since i've bought this product and i will be re-ordering soon!<br/><br/>thanks,<br/><br/>dario
 I bought Double chocolate, because everyone recommended it. So it tastes really bad with water, I can't even drink it.<br/>Than i tryed with milk, it's better but after drinking it leaves, like idk sweet taste which i don't like.<br/><br/>I dont know about other flavors but, Double chocolate is't tastes good.
 The best flavor and most pure whey
 Cookies and cream tastes so gross and fake. The smell of it alone makes me sick especially in the morning when I workout.
 Tastes good.
 this protein is the best you can get and it tastes amazing! its been the best selling protein for years because it works
 My preference, but, this mint just doesn't come off that good.  Mocha or double chocolate is better.
 I've tried many protein powders and this one tastes about the best. According to consumer reports magazine many protein powders contain toxins such as arsenic, lead, and cadmium. This one does not. Another important factor in choosing it.
 Good protein, without the bad taste.
 This stuff mixes great and tastes great!
 This is the perfect whey protein mix.  Tasty and loaded with muscle building protein!  LOVE IT!  I have found my new mix!
 Great quality!
 Great product. Will buy it again!
 Best tasting protein I've had hands down. Also tried optimum's mocha cappuccino and one of the vanilla flavors; light years difference from EMC.
 I decided to try this brand of chocolate protein powder because 1st Phorm wasn't sold on Amazon and I was too lazy to drive to my local Supplement Superstore, and also because I wanted to purchase a smaller quantity.  I haven't tried any other brands, just those two.  After using 1st Phorm, I found Gold Standard to be very watery tasting on its own.  There is nothing to look forward to whatsoever about drinking it; it's purely sustenance.  I think it would be fine to add to shake recipes, though (for example, combined with a banana, peanut butter, and milk).  And it seems pretty comparable nutrition-wise.
 Well the firts star is for the nice flavor like vanilla ice cream it is, also the quickly shipment to my PO BOX, I think this is the best protein wieght/price that you can buy really feels the diferent when you are trainning with this Golden Whey Protein in your head pumping out that arms and chess. Remember drink it whit water before and after go gym for best results
 good s***
 Coffee is an excellent flavor, one of the best I've had. One thing to be aware of, though, is that they flavored it with actual coffee, so it does contain caffeine. Be careful including it in meals near bed time.
 Great taste. Super price. Been buying for a while, cheapest price I've seen.
 Good flavor
 Great protein for muscle recovery and it also taste good.
 My favorite Protein shake
 great product
 Love this stuff. Tastes good, mixes well in most liquids, nice easy way to supplement protein intake.
 I swear I was shipped hot cocoa. This tased nothing like ON whey. I was a loyal consumer before this. Now I'm on that MTS Machine Whey... Best Whey out there.
 Does not taste like protein powder!
 It's my 2nd favorite
 Optimum has continued to make the best proteins on the market today. I have never been dissatisfied with their proteins ever.  This particular product is great, been using it for a good while now. The taste is great not bad at all.  I have defineatly seen gains using whey protein along with hard work in the gym.  Also helps with the recovery process tremendously as well.  Optimum totally gets two thumbs up from me, hands down by far the best out there.
 Again as my review for Casein I take this in the morning and Casein after work out for a week then I flip the following week.<br/>Good stuff, really works specially for someone after 50. I'm 56 YO and work out is my passion however building muscle after 50 is not easy. This staff has really help me together with other supplements
 Received unsealed protein. Had to put it in the trash as it's unsafe to consume that kind of products.
 on son's wish list...
 My 26 year old son recommended this for post-workout nutrition.  It tastes great and provides the needed extra protein for muscle re-modeling.
 Really tasty
 tastes pretty good and fills me up
 So far I've had the Rocky road, mocha cappuccino, vanilla ice cream, and extreme milk chocolate.<br/>Personally, I really enjoyed the mocha cappuccino. It has both a hint of coffee flavor and chocolate flavor, it's not too sweet and mixes well with both water and milk. If you like coffee, then you will love this. Secondly, Rocky road is a good flavor as well. However, it is very sweet. On hot days after workouts, near the end of the container of this powder, I was starting to get sick of it. But all in all its a good and safe flavor choice.  Thirdly, the vanilla ice cream (improved flavor version). This flavor is super sweet and taste like melted vanilla ice cream. I found this flavor to be terrible and too thick to mix with milk, so I started mixing with water and it's the consistency of a normal protein shake mixed with milk. This wasn't terrible, but I wouldn't buy again.<br/>Lastly, the extreme milk chocolate powder. This was my least favorite. I felt like I got less powder in this then the other 2lb containers of protein I had bought. This flavor has a bad after taste when mixed with water and had a weak chocolate taste.
 This flavor is very delicious if it's mixed with milk. It tastes like chocolate milk and I enjoy drinking it. While I have mixed it with water, it isn't an exactly pleasant experience so I would recommend Vanilla if you don't want to use milk
 Excellent thank you
 No scoop inside but the product is goood!
 Great protein and recommend
 Tasty with mild and chilled! The chocolate flavor is the only one to buy.  We tried some others and blech...
 Can't go wrong with ON. Something to note that isn't clear from the listing - this product (the coffee flavor) does contain caffeine.
 Only the best why protein on the market.
 Best protien powder I've ever used. I noticed a big jump in my gains when i switched to ON.
 Fantastic product with amazing flavor. Really blends well with everything from smoothies, post workout shakes and  oatmeal in the morning. It also shipped to me incredibly fast. I was extremely pleased with that!
 Great tasting as always!!!
 A great deal, solid product, and fast shipping. Have ordered several times and would order again.
 Second order .  Great product
 Taste: 8/10  Mix's well: 5/10 results:8/10, I liked this product and I'm still using it. Although I might buy a blender.
 Addicted to the taste!
 really good.
 My favorite protein. Extreme Milk Chocolate is probably one of the best protein flavors I have tried. With water, with milk or mixed into a shake, this protein tastes great while packing in about 24g of protein per serving.
 I have been using this product for 5 years now and I absolutely love this one.
 Use it every day
 I have gotten Whey protein multiple times.  Amazon always has it on sale, and so far its the best protein powder I've found.<br/><br/>The taste is great and I have gained 15 pounds of muscle in the last year while using this supplement in addition to a good diet.<br/><br/>Great product, good deal = good buy.<br/><br/>Would recommend this to anyone looking to get stronger and build muscle.
 Regular flavor, i prefer SYNTHA-6 so much tasty!!!
 Delicious!
 Works just as described, highly recommend!!
 Not a single complaint!  Love the taste too.
 I'm only giving 4 stars because this is HUGE. HUGE. Seriously. You can't imagine by looking at it. And at first I thought it was coming in a plastic bag, but it is a huge plastic bottle.
 It's helpful,I love it
 Great product. Tastes really good, mixes well and no gas pains typically experienced with protein powders. Highly recommend to anyone on a strenuous workout program.
 Just tried the coffee flavored and love it!
 get swole!!!
 This is definately the best whey protein i have ever used. First time using the strawberry flavour and to my surprise it tastes gr8.<br/>5 stars!!
 Its the real deal, taste great, it has everything the body needs, its a great source of protein and has all the naturally occurring Amino Acids but you will have to eat a healthy protein and carbohydrade diet to support this supplrment.
 I keep coming back for this position, best I've had and great mixture.
 Great tasting but warning if you mix with water it will make a thicker protein drink then most other proteins i have tried.
 Good taste.
 Great product
 Great taste, quick protein!
 I just got this less than a month go. I go to the gym about 4 times a week, and use this after every workout. This is the first protein shake that is actually enjoyable and tasty. Everything I have ever drank has tasted terrible, and part of the reason I stopped taking protein shakes. I also can see a huge difference if I take this drink or if I dont after working out. The muscle recovery is very quick. Generally I will wait every couple of days working out the same muscle groups, but its not un common after I have been taking this to work out the same muscle groups 2 days in a row! It is on the higher end for cost, however its completely worth it. Good for 71 work outs! Dont forget your shaker cup and I like it best with Milk! Taste just like chocolate Milk very easy to drink. Enjoy!
 Getting me jacked just as I wished, awesome.
 this powder is delicious and gives a good boost in the morning before I go out for a few miles ride.
 THANKS!!!
 Love the Rocky Road flavor!
 Mixes well, tastes fine, and is a good value for being a quality product.  I've been taking ON Whey for years now.
 best protein I've had
 GREAT STUFF !!!
 Good taste and shows results
 I love this protein. Good Quality.
 Great! Love it!
 This is the smoothest whey in the market in my opinion. You can tell the quality from the powder to how its stirs to the taste to how ift feels in your stomach. Unlike other brands I have no doubts that im getting good clean protein and leaves a peace of mind, especially if your looking to put some high quality right after your work outs.
 The good thing about this Whey is that you know what you are getting. If you aren't into a specific kind of workout plan this is a good baseline of your average gym rat. :)
 Great price for good value!.
 Arrived as expected! Thank you!
 best tasting and mixing protein
 it's ok.
 This is the lowest cost protein powder I could find and I liked that it was mostly protein with very little fat and cholesterol. The double rich chocolate tastes really good. I usually add a banana to it too, but it's fine on its own too. Haven't tried it in water, only with milk. Added a scoop of peanut butter with the banana makes this taste like a treat.
 This the protein powder you want. It's the most popular for a reason. Affordable and tasty.
 As good as protein powder is going to be.
 this has a great taste and it blends easy i will be ordering from this person again in the near future
 Great taste!
 Whey Protein does not get any better than this. I use this product for breakfast, as a meal replacement (smoothie), pre/post workout. Amazing stuff.
 This product is part of my daily diet.  It is also a treat as I like the flavor A LOT!!!
 My favorite protein
 Good product
 I have always liked gold standards protein and I try to mix up the flavors. I decided to buy the white chocolate and give it a try. The fact is, the white chocolate tastes just like the vanilla. It literally tastes like they just slapped a white chocolate label on the vanilla flavor. The taste is not bad tho, its just not white chocolate.
 Best protein out there..
 the taste of the cake batter was not as good as i expected. I would not suggest this flavor a
 DO NOT GET ROCKY ROAD!!! Unless you really like the taste of pepto bismol. I got it because a lot of people here said it was the best but honestly, it is terrible. Only gave it five stars because i love Gold Standard whey, but definitely dont like rocky road.
 i drink one every morning since im not much of a breakfast guy - 110 for 2 months of breakfast - deal !
 Blends very good. Taste like a light chocolate milk with water. Good quality protein for $50 whey.
 Great for the intermediate lifter who is looking for an overall package for protein, Glutamine and branched amino acid supplements
 I'm not a fan of the artificial ingredients, but it's still a great supplement and has helped me build muscle in the past 5-6 months.
 The best
 Great product!
 Love it 5 Stars****
 exc trans a!!!!
 I like it, the flavor isn't much delicious but is ok. i have taken with a banana and almonds everyday and you only need 1 scoop, no more !
 great product
 It taste good and there is no stevia in it or sucralose.
 Good deal!
 Love the protien
 The expiration date was erased
 Great product!
 ON 100% whey has been my go-to standard since i first started working out consistently. after stumbling through a few brands, this was the greatest price/taste/mixing one i found and i never felt the need to look any farther. for me, using a blender is a necessity as nothing else will really mix it finely enough. i also always use milk, the thought of mixing with water is not appealing to me so i've never tried it.<br/>i always got the chocolate flavor before and decided to try cake batter this time, it really does taste like cake which is A+ for them, though i'm not sure i like it as much as the plain old rich chocolate flavor
 I hate the taste..
 I actually bought this for my lil brother, he loves it, it was a great gift for him.<br/><br/>He says he wanted the best, so that is whatbI gave him.
 Good
 I liked the product very much and it is useful to me. Daily iam taking twice and planning to order more in future.<br/><br/>Thanks for the Product<br/><br/>Thanks<br/>Chandra Konduru
 shipped quick and was exactly as described.
 mixes perfect got mine on time (:
 We enjoy this product quite a bit. Been buying it for a couple years now. We use it for after workout protein and the occasional meal replacement.
 Delicious and mixes up well
 This is a very good protein powder and my boys love the taste!  It is not chalky like many are.
 Great product
 Taste delicious
 I like the taste but haven't gained any pounds at all
 Tastes like Ice Cream!
 good stuff
 flavor isn't the greatest and did not come with scooper
 This is the best tasting protein powder I can find. It also happens to be the best as far as sugars/carbs/calories/BCAAs.
 Great taste. Easy to mix in a blender cup.
 Amazing
 I've used all sorts of different types of whey proteins for post workout recovery, and this is by far the best quality whey I have had. Mixes amazing, all flavor tastes great, and provides tired muscles the fuel they need to grow!
 A lot of other whey and whey isolate protein powders have additives and trace metals that are very dangerous to your health. ON is just whey isolate and cocoa. Some other whey isolates aren't even FDA approved! Tastes great and I'm putting on muscle.
 Old faithful. As the name says its a Standard in bodybuilding.
 The bag that the product comes in is HORIBLE! will not reseal.  The product however is AWESOME
 Great product, I use it almost daily.
 i found the flavor kinda thin and lacking in satisfaction after drinking this product . the double rich chocolate flavor was defineitly not there
 this is the best flavor
 I'm really happy with this product. It has really affected my body and my workout strength.<br/><br/>One issues was that, you usually get a scoop with the protein box. In my box there wasn't any scoop. Thanks.
 THANK YOU.
 The best protein.
 Can't go wrong with ON
 So mild and smoot
 Good price and a awesome product
 Blech tasting, and I've got 5 lbs to get rid of.
 Use it when I do my landscaping project. I feel like it helps my muscle development. Nice and toned, cause I'm usually not really a workout person. Everything about it is good, but the taste! Ugh! I dunno about y'all, but it just makes me want to retch. Even with milk it's no good. I just drink it without breathing through my nose, and then chase it with something pleasant, like warm vodka. Any-hoo, please change the fact that I feel like I'm drinking concentrated sweet 'n low.
 Tastes Great &amp; Easy To Mix!
 The product was as described by the previous reviewers.  Easily dispersed, no clumps and tastes good
 Just awesome
 Taste great.  Good value!
 Always delicious flavors.
 WIth milk its awesome. Trust me get this. I know its expensive but it is def worth it. Its okay with water but use milk!!!
 Tastes good!
 Item as described.
 Great Flavor!
 Excelent
 Works for me
 This is probably one of the only protein powders on the market that not only tastes like its advertised flavor, it actually tastes good as well.  It also isn't over-sweetened like some mixes are.  In water the flavor is good, in unsweetened vanilla almond milk (to avoid carbs) it tastes really good, and in lowfat milk it starts to border on too sweet but it still tastes great.  Actually with both almond milk and lowfat milk it tastes good enough to drink as a beverage.
 Great taste, love it.
 Very tasty!
 Great product.
 thanks
 I've tried many, many flavors of Optimum Nutrition protein powder.  Chocolate Malt is my favorite for the last few years.
 Thumbs-up
 This is my go to protein power. It tastes amazing especially in Mocha Cappuccino and I have and will continue to recommend it to my friends.
 tastes great
 Perfect. It was exactly what I wanted and came on time
 I've had the milk chocolate, vanilla ice cream, and now the rocky road so far. The rocky road flavor is hands down the best one so far. Mixes easy and doesn't upset my stomach. Solid product.
 Best protein on the market hands down. Mixes very easily and tastes very good as well. 1 scoop in my morning shake and 1.5 scoops post workout. Stick to this brand if you want results.
 Good stuff not too sweet
 I bought the white chocolate flavor. Very disappointed in the flavor. Not what I was expecting. Really no flavor at all
 Mixes well and tastes good. High end quality, low price.
 My son loves the new protein and I don't feel near as bloated when I take it.
 This stuff is so good I cant believe its a protein shake! It is really low on carbs so its perfect. Tons of protein too!!
 This is a great product, taste okay for a protiene and I will keep you updated on my progress! Also the packaging was great as well, there was no escaped powder from the bottle or anything came in a box with bubble wrap in it and taped close
 The best protein you can buy. Rapid absortion, very high quality protein, fair price, good flavor, best for use postworkout
 Not bad for the price
 Very good tasting
 Good!
 Only protein powder i use
 ON had to be the best tasting whey protein on the market. I've never tasted a flavor that I didn't like!
 Excellent product!
 helpful
 Taste good, looking forward to the effect
 Great tasting, low sugar and helps with that additional energy. Plus the quality and amount you get for the price is phenomenal!
 A little to sweet for me.
 The price is really reasonable and it blends well. The protein to fat ratio is nice too. I would recommend this to beginners and serious athletes alike.
 I can't speak for the efficacy of this supplement in terms of muscle growth (yet). However, it's flavor is tasty and the powder dissolves easily in water and dairy. It's pretty filling.
 Pretty happy with this product, I will buy a different flavor next time. Not a huge fan of the vanilla ice cream, doesn't go well in fruit smoothies.
 What is good for me is good for you.
 I gave this product a 4 star because let's face it, it's not a piece of chocolate cake! :) However I can drink it all pretty fast and not have to choke it down so that is a plus in my book. I like a ratio of 1 full scoop to about a half cup of cold water or little less and it tastes just fine. I also like the fact that the deliver was fairly fast as well.
 Great stuff!! Mixes quickly!
 Good product. High quality. Effective.
 Excelente producto
 Super😊
 The product was damaged and dented.
 I like it
 Really good
 Great protein, great price, taste like crap when i mixed it with water subbed it with almond milk taste great and still good for a cut
 Cookies and cream flavor whey protein by Optimum Nutrition is the worst tasting powder that I have ever tried to drink. It taste like sweet spoiled coffee. I wish that I could return this product but after it is open you can not. I read all the reviews on this and thought I was making the right decision but was I ever wrong. Don't waste your time and money on this flavor. The other flavors might be ok but this one try of this flavor ruined me from trying any other flavor. It is terrible that I have to through $60.00 dollars away because I can not stomach the taste. Good luck!
 Excellent product. Taste just like a chocolate milkshake.
 Great price delivered quick
 Great value for a no-frills product. Definitely helps with recovery time. The Double Chocolate is good, while not as "tasty" as the Cookies and Cream flavor I've tried in the past from Syntha-6, but it does the job.
 Basic Whey protein without extra questionable ingredients.
 Package shipped on time and the item was as described.
 Protein serving is on point (per scoop) with this product. I have only tasted Rocky Road so far but the taste is great and there is absolutely no aftertaste which is a major plus
 I love how it dissolves so easy and the great chocolate taste! It would be nice to see some  L-Ornithine added to complete the amino acid list.
 My go to protein shake.  Love to mix the chocolate protein with frozen bananas.
 Tastes really good with milk. It's okay in water if you are trying to keep your intake of calories to a minimum, but it's kind of like chocolatey water. It's not bad, but there's is no need to savor the flavor so the fact that it's smooth makes it easy to chug.
 The best protein out there, and a bargain purchased from Amazon vs your local supplement retailer.
 Tastes awesome! I got the chocolate malt and it tastes just like a chocolate malted milkshake. Mixes really well so far
 good
 Exactly what you'd expect.
 Taste bad and is chalky Nitrowhey is whey better
 this is the best flavor in protein shake that i've ever tasted
 Great Product!
 As always great product but high price lol
 This is the only protein I have been buying for several years now. Fantastic quality and Vanilla Ice Cream flavor has only 1 gram of sugar.
 Excellent product quick recovery and good taste. I've tried many protein drinks through the years but have always found Optimum Nutrition to be very effective and affordable.
 Tastes good and good for you. I love it and highly recommend it. I drink protein shakes to ensure I'm getting adequate protein.
 love this flavor
 My package came within the time promised however there was no seal between the protein and the cap like there typically is. This is unsafe and I didn't use any of it. Was not worth the hassle of a return so just threw it away.
 Tastes great.
 Tastes delicious way better in milk. In water tastes like watered down icecream
 This whey protein is very delicious!  Some people may complain about the mix being clumpy or the powder not mixing well but this issue can be remedied by using a basic cup with no edges and mixing with a spoon until all of the powder is dissolved.  I usually have a shake at night with Fairlife milk for around 35 grams a serving and I sprinkle a half serving in my morning Oatmeal Square cereal.<br/>It is very important to know what kind of protein you need.  This product contains whey protein which is a fast acting protein, meaning it is quickly digested into your body.  This product is ideal for a pre or post workout but you can also have some throughout the day.  The reason a body builder or someone working out or starting to workout needs protein is for muscle recovery and muscle maintenance.  Muscle recovery is what builds muscle and muscle maintenance is what keeps your muscles from shrinking.<br/>If you don't get enough protein in your diet, you essentially starve your body and muscles and lose all of the work you put in at the gym.  The more muscle you have, the more calories one burns at rest so it is important to build muscle!  This product is a good "starter protein" meaning once you like the taste of whey and get into a routine of taking it you can branch out and buy other kinds of blends, flavors and from other manufacturers.
 It’s taste is disgusting
 ON gold standard whey is some of the best. I decided to experiment and go with a different flavor than the usual chocolate that I get and went with this one. It's a bit too sweet for my taste and doesn't mix well with other things like fruit etc. Still a great deal and product just not a big fan of the flavor.
 I got the coffee flavor, and while it tastes more like melted ice-cream, it's still enjoyable to drink. I drink it for recovery after work outs and whenever I need some extra protein for my daily intake, and so far my body seems to like it as much as my taste buds do.
 I got the product and was exactly as the description.
 I recently ordered this and the expiration date is conveniently "rubbed off" I don't know , but it looks like it expired 7/13 ... i could be misreading it but i'm pretty sure that's what it says ....... I bought it off amazon feeling it would be a better deal because I am a full time college student . This is pretty upsetting
 Great tasting protein powder. It has everything I need, and it comes at a great price!
 Excellent!!!
 Whey protein however includes a Sweet tasting additive Sucralose
 It does the job as far as protein powder goes, but the flavor just wasn't for me.
 Great tasting, fine ingretients, mixes well, bargain price!<br/>I use frozen banannas, mix with ice cubes, flax seed oil, and Bananna flavored whey.<br/>Taste great!!!<br/><br/>I've tried many other whey products over the years, ON is by far the best.
 Great product... I would totally recommend it, I gained about 20 pounds half way thru the bag and my metabolism is a rocket! I usually use 20 Oz of milk and 3 scoops of amazing strawberry ON whey protein!
 Tatse good.
 The only protein that I’ll take with water
 I like the chocolate the better than vanilla
 Tastes great and mixes well with milk.
 tastes great, been using this for awhile now
 I really this protein powder. It help me gain 10 pounds in past 4 month.
 Bien
 Not a single negative thing to say. It shakes and fully dissolves, and it tastes great too.
 Despite being a really good protein supplement, the vanilla ice cream flavor is practically flavorless and just leaves water tasting chalky. This is definitely the worst tasting protein I've tried. It's a great supplement, however ON is a good brand so hopefully they have better flavors. Adding a banana helps a lot too.
 GOOD PROTEIN
 Taste amazing and gets the job done. Although nothing competes with the chocolate mint.
 10 pounds of this lasts a very long time, given the small serving size.
 I used to drink this religiously with no second thought. Always make shakes with bananas strawberries and blueberries, milk or  rice drink. After testing out some other options, I have found that this powder is just low quality. It gets the job done, but not without bubble guts and other side effects. Do yourself a favor and look into "clean gainers". There are a lot better protein powder mixes out there rather than just whey, and a lot better quality.
 Nice
 Product was as promised and arrived the next day!  I even ordered this item on a Sunday.  Very impressive...  I know where I'm getting every supplement I buy from now one.  Can't beat the pricing and the speedy delivery.  Chocolate whey is a pretty good flavor as well, the best I've tasted so far, and I've tasted a lot of their flavors.
 I definitely love the optimum nutrition whey protein definitely makes a difference!!
 Great taste.
 I enjoyed the flavor of the Double Chocolate!  As expected from a product by Optimum Nutrition.  One tip I recommend is to add some type of milk when drinking to add a "rich" flavor.
 Good product with a reasonable price.
 Love this product.
 For the price I'm not too sure anything can compete.
 Very good product
 Good taste (I got the banana flavor), mixes easily and well with cold milk.
 good
 The taste is ok.  I would have like it better if it was thicker after blending.
 The chocolate flavor in this isn't overpowering. The texture remains thin and smooth. It's very easy to drink, which is the deciding factor for me with protein.
 great flavor!
 Good but expensive; I suppose it's a solid value compared to its competitors, though.
 clean protein and tastey in daily smoothies
 You might think this protein is expensive, but know this: a serving size for 26g is "one heaping scoop."  I've had cheaper protein but the serving was two scoops.  So this isn't really as expensive on a per gram basis.  Plus, it disolves easily and doesn't clump up like some cheaper ones do and it tastes as good as can be expected.  (I suggest a little bit of cinnamon to sweeten it up.)  And I like that it doesn't come in a big, half-empty, hard plastic drum. If you pour some into a tupperware container you can stash the big zip-lock bag somewhere out of the way.
 so far im alive and it seems to satisfy me
 This stuff tastes great. I take it with water post workout and the powder mixes really well in a blender bottle. No lumps! Best Whey I've tried by far. The price is reasonable too.
 Great Quality
 Good tasting from a company you can trust!
 It is delicious mixed with water and ice in a blender. Tastes more like ice cream when mixed with milk.
 I did alot of research on powders before i purchased this, and i found not only did it satisfy my requirements, but it was the easiest protein powder to drink that ive tried...and ive tried ALLOT. Great stuff
 My fiancé and I are OBCESSED with this protein! GREAT DEAL!
 White Chocolate is a terrible flavor.
 I wouldn't get any other type of protein. This stuff in incredible. Been using it for over 4 years.
 I am
 Have been using on whey for a while, usually the double chocolate. Decided to change it up and get the chocolate mint because i love mint chocolate chip ice cream. This taste more like light chocolate with a slight after taste of mint, not good at all. Would recommend this product , but in a different flavor.
 Gives all the protein you need without all of the unnecessary added sugars and garbage other powders add.
 I have been buying and using Gold Standard Whey by ON for years.  By far the best tasting, best nutritional value and most importantly best blending protein powder I have used!
 I like the product but it seems a little pricey.
 great whey, tastes awesome
 The best protein
 Too sweet!
 Tastes good.  Fills me up after a workout.
 The coffee flavor 100% Whey Protein tastes good, dissolves fairly easy and has been a good complement for my diet.  It is too early to notice any changes in my body but it appears to me that I am beginning to look thinner.  The price was reasonable and delivery was quick.
 Coffee flavor takes like coffee flavored milk, but good.  Dissolves real well with a shaker bottle
 awesome product and good results! the flavor is not that great
 good
 Great stuff.
 Great product
 waow, gr8 a1
 Terrible gas, burps, twisting stomach, and general unpleasantness for my entire family to endure.  I do not recommend.  Spend the extra money on a higher quality product.
 I've tried numerous different whey proteins and this is probably the best tasting, most affordable, easily mixed, highly rated whey protein that I have ever used. Another friend of mine also feels the same way. This may not be THE BEST whey protein but it is my favorite and although I will still occasionally try different products, this will always have a place in my home, regardless of what other products I try.
 ON Whey Protein mixes well with water and tastes great. If you mix double rich chocolate with milk you get creamy chocolate milk.
 Awesome
 very good
 This flavor isn't great. When missed it has a faint chocolate taste.
 Great Value
 First time trying this product. Wasn't sure how the taste was since a lot of protein shakes taste nasty. This one tastes like vanilla whip cream when mixed with milk.
 Weird aftertaste.
 Like all ON products it tastes great, mixes well and performs as advertised.
 A+++
 Great protein for the price. Low in sugar which was the biggest concern for me. Low sugar total for the price your paying make it a great buy.
 Good Stuff
 I use my magic bullet and milk and it tastes exactly like chocolate milk.  Gets me through the early morning at work as well following my workouts.  Based of of taste and consistency, definitely a good buy.
 Love it
 Taste good nothing bad to say all good
 This is the best protein available. My bro told me. Taste just like a chocolate milkshake when you make it with milk and some ice, but maintains low sugar compared to other protein sups that have a lot of sugar.
 good taste and delivers what you need from it.
 Good
 Just like any other ON product...great.
 Best product for customers new to body building, to get them in the groove.<br/>Great taste! Hopefully this flavor is not a novelty one.<br/>Almost instantaneous results. Visible results in a week!
 My husband loves it!
 Mix well for me very tasty with unsweetened almond milk
 Arrived in a timely fashion. This product is really good, low on sugar and taste great with just a mixture of water
 The best. Buying it everytime. Cant beat it for the price.
 This protein is too delicious!
 Soooooooo yummy!
 The best protein powder out there. I like the mochachino flavor the best.
 Good product, best price
 great
 Great
 This was an awesome product for anyone looking for a great protein powder and is a dedicated exercise enthusiast. It mizes perfectly and taste amazing especially if you use some milk(I used almond milk). I would definately recommend and purchase again
 Great!
 I have an custom web search created to search many of the largest sites (ebay, amazon, google, bing shopping etc..) and amazon had this at the best price including shipping. Shipping was fast.
 This thing was bigger than my head. Now I'm making all kinds of gains!!! =D<br/>And it saves me money from buying the 2 pounder over and over again.
 Some of the best tasting powder I have tried.
 Nice product
 The taste of Mocha Cappuccino is okay, but I will most likely go back to chocolate for my next one.
 Delicious with good nutrition, with milk it tastes like Nesquik!
 Flavor was ten times better than expected, after I had expected it to be good to begin with.
 Best protein drink as a first meal in then morning, its taste is good . I like the milk chocolate one
 Delicious
 I was not a fan of the taste at all.
 Just what I needed
 absolute awful taste.  Taste nothing like the flavor it is labeled.
 Torn packet. Otherwise it was good.
 Tastes like a malt, don't know if I'll ever run out...Good thing for the price.
 I have been using this product for over a year. During that time I have had the opportunity to try other brands. I have stayed with this product because for me, it has provided the best results for the best price and the flavor is definitely better than others I have tried.
 item was on time and as expected
 Love this.
 Tastes great and does the job
 Mixes good in a shaker bottle and tastes great with milk or water. Also best value for the quality
 chocolate tastes good
 Best protein shake out there! I love the flavor and the amount of protein per serving. Low carb and fat content as well. Only problem is it tastes nasty in water. Only tastes good in milk. Came fast and was exactly as ordered! Thank you.
 Like it but didn't come with a scoop so I have to manually weigh out 31g with a scale. Bit of a pain.
 Best flavor out there
 Good product
 Best tasting protein out there.
 I would definitely buy this again.
 Great price.
 Not chocolaty enough with a weak or diluted chocolate flavor  Prefer the Vanilla!
 74 yrs old going for the world record bench. probably into my 40th 5# container. taste great and as good as any thing out there.
 The container was not 100% sealed so there was powder all over the inside of the box.Thankfully not an excessive amount of product was lost.
 Love this stuff. Tastes great and blends super easy.
 It does not get delivered it got cancelled.
 Great Supplement. I keep a container in my truck just in case I need a good protein drink between meals.
 Great protein, so-so flavor.
 The product is easy to digest. No clumps when mixed or after taste/odor. A great value at the price. I would recommend.
 Great taste, goes great with frozen fruits or even peanut butter.
 It was a great drink. It has a good deal of protein given the calories and it dissolves very readily. I was surprised by the reasonable price. I hope they get more supply.
 Taste great and results for muscle development awesome
 The protein is of high quality, especially for its price. It tastes good, very easy to mix, and it's good whey protein overall.
 it's 100% whey gold standard sold by ON, it's pretty much what you see what you get :D
 Couldn't ask for a better protein
 The best flavor ever. Especially when you mix it with water.
 I got the Rocky Road because that seemed to be the most popular flavor, but it's hard  to taste anything other than the artificial sweetener which they deemed wise to put in their product in overwhelming amounts! I'm not used to my taste buds getting so saturated with sweetness . . . this was hard to swallow! I wish they had left out the sucralose altogether and left it up to the consumer to sweeten it according to their own preferences. I would've used 2 drops of organic stevia for one serving and been very happy.
 just shake it in water or milk or any other drink you like and it taste also great.<br/>Nice to have in your gym kit
 My staple protein, you can't go wrong with any gold standard whey
 Awesome!
 Tastes really good
 Great.
 great price
 no sugar, taste good, so far so good.
 It tastes more like maple syrup.
 The lid is already broken.
 Couldn't have ordered a better product!! Excellent came with a 2 serving sample pre-workout inside as well
 By far my favorite flavor &amp; protein!
 Good product
 The taste gets old after a while, but I think I've just gotten used to it. Would recommended
 great taste, great product
 Great
 Too sweet!
 It's SO VERSATILE I can put it in most anything i make! Be sure to add it to things youve already cooked though as overheating the whey will turn it into ricotta cheese and vanilla-flavored ricotta is not exactly pleasant
 Always fan of this product. Shows result. Can't get better deal than this. Would recommend to buy this. Try taking creatine along with this.
 Very happy
 Ordered the 5lb. Chocolate Mint.  Not too minty but very easy to mix and drink.  Love it, great whey protein!
 The Double Rich Chocolate is the only flavor that I've found that doesn't have Sucralose.
 Good tasting
 Great price and will be trying it again. Love the strawberry flavor. Would recommend it to others that are using protein powder.
 Tasty and work
 Great product, good price, lots of flavor choices really not much else to say. low cal high protein and tastes good to boot.
 Delicious and satisfying!
 I open and the taste is so weird... I guess it is spoiled.
 Cheap, effective, reliable, and great tasting.  It's one of the only high quality protein in a 10lbs bag.  Love it.
 The protein just doesn't suit my tastes. It mixes fine with milk, but it upsets my stomach every time i use it.
 Great pre-workout breakfast.
 Love this protein powder!
 Excellent product. Getting serious goans
 I recently started to become "health conscious" and a friend recommended this product to me.  She actually tried to fool me with the unsweetened version (seriously -- not sure how she thought she could get away with that given she was dealing with a major junk food eater), and when she found out I was putting in Equal to help it taste better, she revealed there was an artificially sweetened version.<br/><br/>I love it this product.  Sure,it could be a little chocolaty-er (I'd like to think me using a little less skim milk helps with getting more of the flavor) but all in all, with the help of milk &amp; a couple of ice cubes, I've come to view it as a frozen treat that I really look forward to every day. Like a little chocolate shake. Which is really saying something because I don't think there's anything that I love to eat/drink that is healthy for me, other than blueberries.... but I digress..  this stuff is really good.  As good as a Haagen Dazs chocolate milkshake?  Absolutely not.  But for someone trying to shift gears, trying to get away from the dark side of foods...and trying to eat healthier &amp; lose weight, the taste (and a little bit of mind games) can fool me into thinking I'm having a Haagen Dazs shake (ok, maybe a lot of mind games but still -- I view it as my healthy Haagen Dazs shake).<br/><br/>Big clue -- the unsweetened version has the word "natural" in there.  I've read complaints about this one having artificial sweeteners -- sure, that should be in the description/review of the product so maybe that's what the complaints are about because if otherwise, the solution is simple -- buy the unsweetened one.<br/><br/>As for me, dare I say a former junk food junkie who has a big sweet tooth -- I'm happy there is something out there that can satisfy my sweet cravings without me having to add anything else (besides the milk &amp; ice of course) and without me having to eat anything else.
 best nutri
 Great! Would order again.
 Thank you!
 Nice taste and blends well with a variety of fruits, vegetables, and fluids.
 Overall great product, very filling, and tastes great
 great value
 Great!
 Good powder and the cappuccino flavor is delicious.
 Great taste and mixes well with water and my favorite almond milk. Very large container. Defiantly would purchase again. Good stuff.
 Use this daily!
 Yum, no grit. I like to mix peanut butter powder and a bananas.
 I LOVE IT! AWESOME PRICE! DEFINITELY BUYING MORE!
 Great as always
 Taste good. But Chocolate flavor is better.
 the best stuff.  It's the Gold Standard!
 This was delivered on time<br/>After trying 4 other flavors the extreme milk chocolate my favorite flavor
 This helped my muscles grow, which in turn helped my confidence grow. I was suddenly getting so much positive attention I was finally able to leave my heavyset wife for a much fitter woman!
 Great product !!
 Love the taste
 Taste like ovaltine so it good bro
 Great product. It's difficult to find a powder without any artificial sweeteners.
 Takes a few drinks to get acquainted to the taste, but after that... amazing! Add in 2% milk and you have yourself a delicious milkshake. Has had a noticeable effect on reducing my recovery time/soreness. Highly recommend!
 Solid product
 Good source of protein in the morning and also after the gym.
 Best whey protein. Good flavor
 Some of the best protein on the market, is an amazing "treat" for yourself after a workout.
 Very happy with product. Shipped quick, mixes well and tastes fine for  a protien drink. Still a bit expensive. If I find something comparable for less I will switch.
 The title says it all. Strawberry Banana is definitely the way to go, haven't had a better shake yet! Work hard train hard.
 Doesn't really taste like cookies and cream, more like coffee, but I like whey and what it does, so I just ignore the taste
 This has a great taste and one of the best proteins out there.Good price thru Amazon too.
 Good stuff. Tastes great in water or milk, mixes easily
 Awesome product, lasts a long time!
 Hello<br/><br/>yes, second time I order this, from overseas.<br/><br/>Almost finish with the first one, but the second one arrived<br/><br/>so far so good<br/><br/>tks
 Delivered on time, great protein. Thanks!
 Im not sure about the gains etc but for taste, it tastes amazing..
 Good quality protein, will continue to buy it.
 Great taste and satisfies hunger well.
 Tastes Amazing and really helps you build muscle!
 good stuff
 My favorite protein powder. Tastes great and works great
 Best Protein Powder!!!!! I have tried several of powders, whether from milk or vegan. This one is my favorite, due to the fact that the double rich chocolate has Sucralose added to it!!!! All the flavor with no potentially harmful sweeteners Then it also has the added bonus of the BCAAs already in it. I have done endless research with the different kinds, and for pretty much an all in one supplement it has it!!!!
 it's an amazing product.
 Perfect for use but taste like vanilla to me
 Just one of the best proteins you can buy it love it
 Always great!
 ON is always good.
 Works very well I like to work out for an hour, hour and a half and sometimes I get very, very sore working out 5 days a week so this Optimum worked very well it goes straight to the muscle.
 Nasty flavor
 Not bad for the money and taste good with milk.Mix with water not so great. I give it a B+ .thank you
 A great source of protein with low calories as well as low carbs. Perfect for me trying build muscle and shed the lbs. I use un-sweet almond milk, ice and a small handful of honey roasted peanuts. So good, I feel like I'm cheating when I drink it!
 I've been using this for a long time. Like the taste, like what it does, and like the economical large package.
 Highly recommend Coffee flavor, one of the best!
 I've been using this product for more than one year and it's done great things. The quality of the protein is really good and the taste is great. If you want it to work for you, just make sure to know how many grams of protein you need each day, substract those you get from meals, and have the rest with whey protein. I take 5 servings a day and I don't gain any fat, just pure muscle.
 great taste
 This protein is awesome and taste great.  Amazon delivered this almost the next day.  If you are looking for a good protein powder no need to look any further.
 Tastes good for whey.
 Arrived on time. very good quality protein
 I really like the taste of this mix. Wish it would mix with milk just a little better but still a great option.
 Works well. Helps recover after a heavy lifting session very well. I went a day without taking it after working out and was so sore. Protein helps rebuild quickly. Best if used within 1 hr period.  A bit pricey but worth it considering you get 24g of protein out of every scoop. If you calculate the cheaper protein brands, what you get in relation to a scoop, it doesn't even come close. Prices used to be in the 40s but this is still reasonable per pound
 Great value.
 Done buying products from overpriced GNC
 It mixed well, has good nutrition value, and you get more bang for your buck.  I definitely would recommend this product.
 Huge! Love the taste. Exactly as described!
 I've bought this multiple times. I enjoy the taste and it's a great price!
 YUM YUM
 Ideal for maintenance the condition in the gym.
 GAINS
 Great for recovery and post workout.
 The coffee flavor is awesome
 Leaves me feeling bloated
 Good Tasting And Easy To Blend Protein.! Lean Gains Guaranteed.
 Great
 Always a reliable choice for protein. Works great in fruit smoothies, blends well.
 just Perfect! great changes!
 Product is great, however, rather than two 2.5 lb. containers it came in one 5 lb. container which is a little harder to handle and store.  Delivery was super fast and price was quite competitive.  Will be back!
 Best flavor taste easy going down love this stuff
 Exactly what I wanted
 good
 Good product but the taste ehhh not so great.
 Been using this for years, taste great got it before expected delivery date.
 Seems to mix with water than my GNC brand, also seems to taste better.  As for the protein, i'm no expert
 I just keep reordering this stuff.  The taste is great and I use it to blend with my frozen blueberries and unsweetened almond milk.
 For a protein drink, this double chocolate stuff tastes great!
 Fair price and very good suplement. Have been using it for two months.
 This protein works really well mixed with water in a shaker bottle. I like to do two scoops in a big bottle. The double chocolate flavor is delicious. Cookies and cream has little chunks in it, which I personally do not like.
 Have tried the French Vanilla and the double Chocolate.  I would suggest the Chocolate as the Vanilla is pretty bland tasting.
 ION 100% whey is great and deceptively low priced compared to competetion. I've tried a number of protien powders and this one is the best, max out the size to get the best deal.<br/>The Delicious Strawberry is a mild strawberry taste that mixes well with most fruit and goes great with water.
 Really good stuff. Recommending!
 Dissolves great, lots of protein, low in calorie and carbs. And - it's isolate. WOO.
 Great flavor, great quality, great price!
 Quality protein from Optimum Nutrition as always but the French Vanilla flavor is very weak. It has a very watery taste when mixed into a shake and the french vanilla flavor is barely noticeable at all. I mixed some in with my coffee and it just made the coffee taste bland and watered down. I certainly will not order this particular flavor again.
 Simply put: this protein mix has a great, mild taste that is easy to drink. The best protein I've had.
 If you've found yourself here, you've probably gone through the science part so I'll spare you the "this is some of the best whey out there" and why you should use whey. This is just to comment on flavors.<br/>The two that I've tried so far are the caramel toffee and the chocolate coconut. I love caramel in general and chose to ignore another reviewer who thought that it wasn't great. They were right; it's not that great. Not disgusting by any means. Just not great. However I just got the chocolate coconut flavor and I love it! Highly recommend it if you're ok with the two main flavors (you guessed it, chocolate and coconut).<br/><br/>Here's my recipe: 2 scoops, 8 oz unsweetened almond milk, 4 oz water, three drops of honey<br/><br/>Definitely 5 stars for the product in general. Just recently started using protein supplements and l've seen the difference in strength and weight (~ 4 lbs in 1 month).
 Very good tasty
 Love this product!! No other protein I'll ever use.
 I love mint chocolate and this is a great flavor to ingest after a workout. You have to love mint though!
 I like this one but the product I received wasn't sealed! however it tastes the same.
 Excellent value .great tasting easy to mix
 great taste and mixes very easily.
 Wouldn't work out without this stuff. This is a necessity for any fitness freak.
 It met all of my expectations. It is relatively inexpensive (&lt; $1/scoop). It mixes very easily and has a good flavor. It is not as sweet as others that I've tried but that is because it is not packed full of artificial sweeteners. I would definitely recommend to friends.
 Hands down best protein available.
 great stuff and love the 5lb size
 You can always tell good protein by its Protein to Serving size ratios(and of course what kind of protein).<br/><br/>Always a good tub of protein for people looking for a meal replacement or those looking to gain muscle/weight.<br/><br/>Would recommend
 I purchased the extreme milk chocolate.  I use milk and a blender cup and it mixes very easily with no clumps.  Taste is better than I expected.  Reminds me of nesquick but obviously not as good with only a slight aftertaste. I will definitely be buying again.  Would definitely recommend
 Love Optimum Nutrition products.  Fast shipping and quality protein
 Liking this stuff! Loving the price per serving! The grams of protein/grams per serving is really good. You know a good supplement when you can feel the difference and see good results.
 Great price great service
 This is a good protein, There are very little added carbs and includes fiber and sugar. My main negative for this product is the taste. I've have much better tasting protein with similar ingredients mix. I probably wouldn't buy this again because of the taste.
 Despite the taste, it does however yield good results.  Been using it for a week now and already noticed significant increases in mass. Especially in my chest and back. Definitely worth the price,  and I would use again.
 LOVE getting my product here!!<br/>Comes so fast. GREAT price.<br/>Thanks :-)
 Delivery took longer but product very good
 Only whey protein powder I buy.
 It's the heavyweight champion of protein shakes. Easy to dissolve, and the taste of vainilla ice cream (with milk) is great! Packing up dem gainz
 Sweet but good.  Just add a little instant coffee to make it less sweet tasting.
 Not bad
 best product of its kind out there
 This why tastes great.  I wake up and have a glass full everyday without mixing it into anything other than water.  It mixes really well. It keeps me full for 4 hours in the morning.  Also try mixing it with plain yogurt or oatmeal.
 Great tasting protein gold standard is the best as far as whey protein I've used
 Great Taste and great price!
 Real gains, worth it.
 This was a gift for my son, the product is ok, it's just that there are just some stomachs that aren't met for this product.
 Get big 👍
 I usually buy chocolate and tried this for the first time. It is way too sweet for my liking and did not taste at all like the cake batter I expected.
 Love the product just not this flavor
 Great protein. well made. great price
 gracias
 Review is about the Rocky Road Flavor.<br/><br/>From the 4 different proteins that I have had in the past, this one is by far the best tasting. I have tried Isopure Vanilla, Myofusion Delicious Vanilla, and Banana Perfection. The taste seems more natural, though not perfect, but still pretty close. It doesn't have the creamy texture at all like the above brands.
 çok iyi ürün mükemmel
 Great
 product is authentic and of good quality. Go for it
 Good suplement and new fast always on time
 The best..product speaks 4 itself!!
 As advertised. Great quality protein powder for a great price. You can look at other protein powders but this is as good if not better than any other.
 Great flavor
 Awesome protein good cheap and had great ingredients as starting my bodybuilding career this is a great protein to use in my everyday consumption. Has almost all the essential needs in a protein!!
 Love it
 Good
 Best tasting powdered protien on the market. Amazon had the lowest price with free super saving shipping.
 Good
 Mixes well great flavor
 Awesome product. Always get this and will continue to do so.
 Goes with everything, all of the flavors are good. Shakes well with water too if you have a good cup
 great whey nothing bad with it
 it was real good.
 This is by far the best flavor from "ON". It taste incredible with milk or water. I have been buying this flavor for about a year now.
 For a coffee lover, this protein is so good! It tastes just like a cappuccino if you mix it with almond milk. If I mix it with water, it just tastes a little watered down, but great for me because I love my coffee :) Thank you!
 Weigh to go!
 its very good, just too sweet for me.
 One of the few whey drink without junk like Sucralose or artificial creamers added,  Work with warm water, cold milk (if blended) or even blended in your morning coffee with a splash of milk.  I use my Ninja bullet and it take a few seconds to blend.  Tastes a lot like a hot chocolate on its own.  Probably even makes a decent chocolate smoothie but I have not tried that yet.
 Best on the market.
 I love this stuff it taste great and mixes up very easy! I have tried many different protein powders and this was by far the best I have tried, I have only had the French Vanilla so I can't speak for the other flavors. I recommend it to all my friends!
 Like anyone else, I'd had my fair share of protein shakes. "Just chug it down", says my personal trainer. But I recently purchased this ON protein in Rocky Road flavor, and I can't explain how much I enjoy it. Mixed with cold water, I look forward to drinking it.
 Always a quality protein powder
 Some top-grade swole powder. We're all gonna make it, but this stuff certainly helps.
 Great price and good flavor
 If you're a muscle head (or wannabe muscle head like me) and need to take a shortcut around the vast amounts of protein required to put on muscle, then you're going to need to use supplements.  So thank God for Gold Standard.  Look, most of this stuff isn't going to taste good.  Gym rats know this.  But it doesn't mean it doesn't have to taste like chalk, either.  With plenty of flavors and sizes (this is like a half barrel's worth of powder), ON really gets this stuff right.  And the price is fantastic.  No wonder everyone's using this brand.
 Ok, this stuff is great. Simple, and perfect for the high schooler. The first thing I learned though was that THIS WILL NOT MAKE YOU RIPPED, only HARD WORK can do that, it will only make the proccess quicker and bigger. Great taste, i put in chocolate syrup and it tastes phenomenal. Great all around product, my first whey purchase and i couldnt be happier.
 Absolutely love this protein. Great taste and great value.
 Great! Package arrive as expected!
 Great product came on time
 Exactly what I needed
 I'm not even sure what the point of this review is. Everyone says the same thing. Best protein per serving per price (this doesn't make sense the way I phrased it but you know what I mean). The only thing I can add that may be helpful is the fact that I'm lactose intolerant and other than some slight bloating (no discomfort) this protein is the only one that I don't have stomach issues with. If you need protein in your life, buy it.
 This is hands down their best flavor I've tasted. Mixes well with water, tastes amazing with milk.
 The best.
 The product came as advertised and very quickly. The only issue with the product I have to say is the taste. I have had other ON whey products such as Extreme Milk Chocolate and it definitely had a better taste.
 Very good taste!
 Excellent!
 It is easy absorption and flavor, and it last couple of months, easy to digest, Price is very reasonable compare to other proteins
 Tastes great, works great, cheep.
 I love the vanilla ice cream flavor! I am completely satisifed with how well this blends.
 One of the best protein powder out there. Only downside is that it does not include a scooper
 Great taste!
 Great macros as always with ON, but it just doesn't taste very good.  I wish ON would offer all of their flavors in smaller sizes so that people could sample them and find the taste that they prefer.
 if you want real protein, buy this one. don't look around cheaper one and don't look at your wallet.just look your future.
 Actually tastes like chocolate.  Even when using water to mix with.  I use two scoops in my coffee in the morning and it's awesome, almost mocha like.  Super easy to mix, doesnt need a blender.  I put it in a nalgene with water and just shake it and it mixes fine with no clumps.  Gives me heartburn though, but then again everything else does too so I cant really blame the powder.
 Best protein ive tried ... quality stuff
 The ON whey is very helpful whether you are on a weight loss diet or your goal is to gian lean muscle. Recommended!
 Great taste!
 thank you
 Great product.  Used as stable for diet.
 Great product for a reasonable price.  I've been getting this for years and I've always loved it.
 If you like the smell of sweaty socks, then buy this. I have been a long time buyer of this brand, but this is the last time I am buying this. They are using some new chemical flavors that are unbelievable. When I bought the blueberry one I got blue spot in my nails and it took me months to figure out where they came from. Now I bought strawberry banana and when mixed it has this strange smell of rotten cheese or sweaty clothes, I cannot even describe it. Very disappointed.
 Best whey protein money can buy
 Amazing taste!
 Great
 I had tried 6 or seven different whey protein mixes (looking for my favorite) until I decided to give this one a shot. It mixes easily and smoothly, as well as having a great taste, even with just water (as I commonly take it). I've recommended it to all of my friends.
 Gold standard ... Enough said.
 The best....end of story. Why are you bothering to read anything else. Its 100% whey. No BS. Done.
 It arrived on time. It doesn't taste that bad; however, I was expecting it to taste a little better. I would still recommend this flavor though.
 Best protein powder I've had. Amazing flavor (would recommend over other gold standard ON flavors), and is lean like all other gold standard wheys.
 Taste great, and never formed lumps while mixing
 Is the best brand for nutricion. The product came in good conditions. I will buy again in a new opportunity
 I have been adding this protein powder to my shake for over a year now, I would never switch brands!
 Is awesome! Exactly what I ordered, taste like ice cream!!!
 Great taste and dissolved surprisingly well in water.
 Good product
 Really good protein for the average builder, nice and tasty and is pretty clean. There are better and more clean proteins out there for cutting and toning if you want to look around though.
 Taste- amazing compared to most on the market. Not for you if you like the super sweet saturated fake sugar proteins. High in BCAA's and glutamine for recovery. Best protein for the price I have tried, and I have tried almost every major brand. Only down side is cholesterol as with most whey proteins.
 Good
 Good sale good product
 the box was not full. About 1/5 of it was not filled and I am sure it is not 5 lbs.I feel like I want my money back.
 As always i love this protien!
 The best whey out there. Might not taste like a chocolate shake but at least it is not packed with sugar
 Best tasting protein ever, love this one. Ive consumed well over 20 lbs this year
 I love the price/quantity, but this protein powder is seriously lacking flavor. I bought double rich chocolate and you can barely taste any chocolate at all. Besides that it's great!
 Great price, great protein. Best price is on amazon for sure! by some $30.
 I have a good experience with this protein specially by its flavor, this cookie and cream transforms any juice in a fruit cookie flavor shake, it is excelent and have develop my muscles, my strength and recovery... great product for the value!
 I have continually purchased this product for two years.  Good taste.  No digestion problems.  I will continue to purchase.
 taste is not that good
 Lasted me for quite a while. Good taste. good quality protein whey. Good macros. Mixes easily with milk. Overall great product.
 Great protein powder!
 Excellent source of protein. Mixes very well. I usually have to use my NutriBullet blender for my protein, but this stuff mixes well with just a spoon and tastes descent.
 Great timing. Ordered on dec. 24th before christmas and it arrived quickly by the 29th. I was surprised as I don't expect packages to come quickly during the holidays. Also- Came right before my last batch of whey was finished- Now I can continue to bulk during the new year =]<br/><br/>Thanks herballoveshop.
 really good product
 Better price than the stores.  Great product
 I use water with my proteins and this product is just so-so. PVL Whey Gourmet is much better as far as taste.
 Good nutrient value in this power... However the taste and texture leaves much to be expected. When compared to Syntha-6 this powder tastes fake and the texture is super thin. Will still occasionally have this, but it's nothing I enjoy.
 The sugar substitute Sucralose tastes awful!  After 1 serving the bad taste stayed with me the entire day!
 Not the greatest taste mixed with water. Stick to chocolate or vanilla if you do mix your protein with water.
 Amazon.com is the best place to buy Optimum Nutrition Gold. It saves you money in a BIG way. The only down side is the shipping wait but that is only a few days.
 I was comparing this Extreme Milk Chocolate flavor to other chocolate flavors by Optimum Nutrition, and after reading a review that gave this 5/5 compared to other flavors, I was sold. This tastes fantastic even by just mixing it with water or milk.
 standard whey product sold elsewhere. Not an imitation.
 Protein powder mixes well and tastes great, which is pretty rare for protein powder.  I mix one scoop in a glass of water (or milk... although it doesn't mix as well in milk) each morning and/or after a workout and it gives me sustained energy.  I am already a repeat customer.
 This is a great product that delivers as described. It dissolves readily in water even if you stir it. I usually mix in a blender with a banana and ice. Believe it or not, it tastes like a chocolate/banana milkshake.
 Great+++
 When you open this product it smells like a frango mint but does not taste as delicious.  Still got them gainz though.
 It is a bit more expensive than other alternatives, but a much better product.  It mixes well with a shaker and tastes great.  I am not a huge chocolate fan, but the extreme milk chocolate tastes more like a mild milk chocolate.  Not too heavy/rich at all.
 I'm a pretty serious lifter and have done tons of research on protein. It is pretty agreed upon that this stuff is the best bang for your buck. It gives you some of the best quality at an affordable price.
 Probably some of the best protein powder I have tasted.
 everyone loves it
 Awesome buy!
 Tastes like salted caramel
 good to very good
 This product has a great taste but only when mixed with milk, soy milk, or almond milk.<br/><br/>It clumps unless a shaker or blender is used but that's how all protein powder is.<br/><br/>Good price for this King Kong tub that's lasting me for months.<br/><br/>I always wonder how effective supplements are but this one seems very good. I'm a vegetarian and feel that hit of protein almost immediately after drinking it. I feel calm and healthy when I use this whey protein.
 Great; doesn't taste the best though.
 Great product
 Great protein supplement. I have been using it last one year and results are amazing!
 good
 Tastes great and ON has very high product quality standards! It doesn't upset my stomach like a lot of other cheaper protein supplements.
 Mixes well with milk, Great taste, I have tried almost all the flavors and Mocha and strawberry banana are the best of the lot, i have been using it for past 5 years and have not a single complain about this product, premium protein..
 Best protein for the price.
 best tasting choc protein powder yet
 Blends smoothly in my shaker bottle with milk, not clumpy, tastes great! 10/10 would recommend.
 great
 Love It, great taste, great product, no bad smell in the shaker, the best protein powder I've had!!!
 This is overall my favorite protein on the market. It tastes great (I prefer strawberry flavor), mixes well, and works. I mix 3 to 4 scoops in one glass with milk and it is still not too thick and tastes great. I have tried many brands of protein and Optimum Nutrition has delivered the best everytime.
 I do recommend, my favorite brand so far
 I was recommended this by a friend and this stuff works
 Tastes great and is great for workouts at a reasonable price. You can get protein powder for a lot cheaper, but whey does a great job of making it taste great.
 Cheap and easy with no frills. Best stuff ever. Taste great.
 Great product. Mixes easily with minimal clumps.
 Tastes reallly good. Chocolate flavor is not overpowering. Very smooth with milk and great for milkshakes.
 Whey protein...as expected
 Great product. delicious taste . noticeable gains from use of the product. Great for mixing in oatmeal, coffee, shakes you name it. Tastes great with water or milk
 I bought the strawberry flavor not terrible but not the best it definitely tastes better with milk then it does with water. it goes down pretty easily so i have no problem with it.
 It helps a lot after work out
 Absolutely love this protein powder! Tastes great &amp; only 120 calories!! I add 1 tsp. coconut oil and 6oz. Water - delish!!
 Great tasting protein from a really good company. Very pure powder with little extra ingredients. Low calorie shakes will help you recover from intense workouts.
 Good Standard Product, but didn't come with scoop. Had difficulty in keeping measure of exact amount needed.
 Taste bomb
 this vanilla ice-cream flavor is okay, but this powder gives a really bad creamy texture to my smoothies and I won't use it anymore.
 Optimum Nutrition products are the best.
 No problems at all with seller, came a week early :). Taste amazing compared to several other brands I've had in the past. I would definitely order this again.
 Great product but it shrunk my buns
 This is what they use and rec at Premier Fitness Camp at La Costa! Excellent source of protein before workouts and tastes good too!
 Best Protein Ever
 Favorite protien and Ive tried a bunch.  Double Rich Chocolate is the best, can go with milk, almond milk, or water well.
 It is good
 The vanilla ice  cream flavor was really good with protein pancakes and French toast. I'm finishing the last of it and I've had it for about a month.
 💪💪
 The best protein. I've been using this for years!
 It's a little on the sweet side, but it really tastes great!  It mixes really well and is not lumpy at all.  I have no complaints with my purchase.
 Good
 I originally used Monster Milk to get my whey protein but switched to this stuff about 2 weeks ago and let me tell you, this is fantastic. It's relatively inexpensive (per serving) compared to other whey products and it's got a great taste! I drink one after every single workout and pair it with the ON Gold Standard Casein Protein before I go to bed each night. I can already tell that this protein pair is working. Do yourself a favor and do the duo, you won't regret it.
 Tasty and nutritious.
 Great!
 Double-rich chocolate all the whey
 One of the best protein powders hands down. And the flavored are great too!
 Good calorie vs grams of protein ratio. But not much flavor or taste.
 Mixes very well. I wouldn't describe the flavor as "double rich," but it's not bad. Actually, I prefer it over most other chocolates because it's not nearly as sweet. It almost tastes slightly bitter, like pure cocoa powder without nearly as much sugar, which suits me just fine. All that said, I'll try vanilla next time...
 Chocolate Coconut such an amazing flavor, I just love it.
 Good taste
 Didn't enjoy the taste as much as I thought. More mint than chocolate.
 The whey protein mixes easily in water.  I earlier used to use a shaker but now mix with a spoon as its much more hassle free.  The strawberry flavor tastes good.  I take it regularly (3 times a day) and along with regular workout, I am seeing positive results in terms of building muscle.
 Good stuff....
 I tried two flavors, rocky road and rich double chocolate. The first one tastes terrible, the latter is much better, but make me have more gas. I guess I have to take longer to get used to it.
 good gainz
 Amazing! Normally I have to choke down protein but this was incredibly enjoyable, I found myself looking forward to drinking it. The flavor was enjoyable and went down smoothly.
 Love the taste!
 On a reorder I complained I had been shipped the wrong item. No, the flavor description had been relocated<br/>on product label and taste changed completely, and sugar went from 1gram per serving to 2 grams.<br/> I will be sampling other brands for better flavor.
 It arrived in a timely fashion.  It's whey protein as advertised.
 Great product! Great product! Great Product! Great product! Great product! Great Product! Great product! Great product! Great Product! Great product! Great product! Great Product! Great product! Great product! Great Product! Great product! Great product! Great Product! I enjoy it a lot and I'm glad I ordered it. My friend recommended this product to me as well. So I'm glad I ordered it. It's great that's all can I please stop typing now?
 The best product
 Definitely got results by using it regularly
 Nice small and taste is awesome
 The only protein you will ever need.
 Perfectly described
 Tastes good and mixes easy. Good stuff
 one of the best protein powder.
 Pretty good tasting which is rare low calorie and high protein what else can you want from a protein.... It dissolves pretty easily.
 Delicious.
 Great protien powder with great taste and mixability. Shaker cup mixes it up just fine, no clumps or anything! Which has been a first for me. Seen great results off of it as well. Again, taste is great. You don't have to chug it just to get through it. It's actually a good tasting shake.
 So I paid $53.99 thinking I would get my best protein but this protein sucks in taste and the BIGGEST issue is; it cant be well mixed with liquid but it all remains like clogs! I have friends who paid much less for other qualities but got much better than mine! Im SO disappointed with that!
 PERFECT VERY GOOD BUY
 I've tried double rich chocolate and cake batter.  I wasn't a fan of the double rich chocolate.  I've had much better tasting chocolate whey powders.<br/><br/>I love the cake batter flavor.  I use 4 oz water, 2 TBSP heavy cream, 1 raw egg, 1 scoop ON cake batter whey, and a dash of cinnamon and it tastes just like you're licking the spatula after stirring a cake mix.  That being said I'm not sure if it's a flavor I could stand for multiple tubs in a row.  It's definitely a flavor I'll try again but probably not until I try 3-4 other flavors first.
 Good product.  Mix very well with water.  Taste is okay, not bad considering I had worse tasting vanilla protein shakes.
 I use to buy this product every month, with a taste of Vanilla Ice Cream. And I use to love it, the best protein I ever had. But now they added some kind of NEW improved great taste. And from now on it taste like a complete s***, it taste like a some kind sweet plastic, and nothing like a protein powder.<br/>Sorry for language.
 Good Value
 best protein out there hands down
 Very good as always
 The 5 pound container has a wide opening that permits easy 'scoopage' for anyone with big hands. The Vanilla Ice Cream flavor is a favorite in our house.
 The taste is a little funny, but it's fine if you doctor it up with some cinnamon and frozen blueberries or whatever you like. Not great with plain water. It does mix really well, even in a shaker; this makes it great for travel. I noticed an increase an muscle mass almost right away after switching to this brand. It's also very digestible. I'm still on my first jar, but am very happy with this product so far!
 Shipping was slow bc I am non-Prime, but I can't complain about the product!
 Flavor is fine with milk, but too bland with water.
 Tastes great
 excellent protein powder
 Tastes great.
 I've been using this product since 2 years ago, introduced by a friend of mine. Biggest selling point for me is the taste and the protein content.
 Compared to Muscle Milk, I like this one better as it is not as sweet and contains less fat per scoop. The flavor is not great but still good, however that's just me, i can't really drink any other flavor other than chocolate.
 Taste is ok not reach  but easy mix with water and who doesn't like much flavor it a perfect deal.
 Not a big fan of this flavor.
 Best flavored protein, period. I've tried other brands to find horrible after taste, but this stuff has no aftertaste and is packed with great flavor.  Stay away from vanilla!
 Received the wrong flavor-- great product but be weary..
 Optimum Nutrition definitely makes the best protein powder. It has just what you need and not much else. I switched over from double chocolate and I love the chocolate malt flavor. It might be a little too sweet for some but I think it's delicious!
 Good stuff.
 Great
 Excellent
 There's not much I can say. Protein is protein and this is really good quality whey protein. Friendly tip, use milk instead of water because water makes it taste terrrible.
 The flavor is sort of like Nesquik, so it's pretty good. It mixes very easily, and it mixes well with milk too. I have no qualms.
 I will say first, with milk, it taste awesome! And in my blender bottle it mixes, going in second and first, pretty well just the slightest tiny clumps that can easily be over looked.
 whey protien is food, and this does the trick.  flavor is fine, though maybe not THAT much better than the regular chocolate.  Ok with water, great with milk.
 Great flavor and doesn't have chalky aftertaste that most protein powders do.
 For those of you that dont like thick shakes, this one is for you. It is a very thin shake when mixed. Like drinking chocolate milk.
 I like it because it dissolves in the milk/soy milk vs others which always have little chunks of power that's don't dissolve.
 Great product
 Great
 Mixes really well, tastes great, nothing to hate.
 In the first three days of using this product I gained 10 pounds of lean muscle tissue.  I  grew more chest hair, added 50 pounds to my squat and over 100 pounds to my bench press. I also got a girlfriend  and my dad finally told me he loves me.
 A few years ago, you were able to pick this product up in the lower 20's.<br/>The price keeps increasing with no real improvements to the product.
 Its called gold standard for a reason, its great whey.  The only down side is that i hoped to find it cheaper than i did here.
 Tried this a while back, but from what I could remember, it is not the most preferred, but not the worst either.
 Excelente
 Optimum nutrition whey - coffee flavor<br/>This is the best flavor IMO , it really give a coffee flavor with a hint of milk. Reminds me of a caramel frap from Starbucks. I would highly recommend if you like Starbucks
 We bought this to include in smoothies for the family, mainly to get our kids additional protein and fruit. They still won't eat the fruit, but like the chocolate. We use WHEY as a daily protein supplement.
 It's a 10lb bag of protein... Enough said. Awesome and at a cheap price. Mixes well and doesn't taste like cardboard coated with sand paper. Great buy.
 easy to mix, taste is good, blends well with juice or soymilk.  provide high protein content. great for ppl to build muscle.
 Súper good cookies and cream
 Good taste and dissolves easily.
 Love this stuff. Best tasting and best quality protein powder I've ever had and I've tried 5 or 6 top brands. Also it mixes great with water.
 This tastes great and is really easy to mix.
 It is awesome as always
 For nutrition, it's the gold standard. Lots of whey, not a lot of sugar. And it still tastes pretty good but doesn't cost an arm and a leg. Every now and then I don't prepare enough good food and this supplements the lack-luster nutritional value of a hurried meal. Awesome!
 Best Whey i've ever used. Great blend of Whey Isolate, Concentrate, and ON's hydrowhey peptides. Not to mention that the protein count is high (24g) with only 3g carbs. Completely eliminates need for BCAA and/or glutamine, because this whey has 5.5g of BCAA and 4g of glutamine. Also one of the best tasting when I mix it in shakes or just with milk/water. Great for Bulking, Cutting, or just adding protein to your everyday diet. Great Value at around $11.50 per pound (71 servings)<br/><br/>Double Rich Chocolate and Extreme Milk Chocolate are my favorites.
 I would best compare this to the taste of ovaltine, that kids chocolate milk that is supposed to be good for you. I really do like this it has a good sweetest factor and doesn't have a chemical flavor to it, as opposed to the other drinks I tried before this (Click espresso drink for one)
 I have tried many protien shakes but always come back to this one. Great price and quality.
 It's great! I love it! The flavor is amazing!!
 Product received in the time specified! Great product!<br/><br/>Will most definitely purchase again!
 Delivery was super fast only 2 days and also free. Product was sealed on the out site and in site. Mix ability is 100% and you don t have to use to much shaking around. Taste is in the perfect line, not too sugary but not too plain. I like strawberry cause is less polluting than chocolate or banana that makes me sleepy. Strawberry is more energetic for me and my taste buds. Digestion is almost un noticed. If you will take too much you may get your lungs to work faster and you can start to fill restless ( your respiratory system will try to help stomach to move excess protein that doesn't fit anymore in your cells}. So is better to go with servings designed to use this product correctly. You don't want to look like PIG. ,!!!
 This mixes really well and tastes good but the Strawberry Banana is a little on the sweet side.  I should've stuck to chocolate or vanilla.  But as far as quality, it's amazing.
 Delicious and effective. Nothing more needs to be said.
 I really don't like the taste of whey protein and the thought of drinking another shake makes me sick - this, when mixed with water or milk stays a liquid and doesn't turn into a thick shake like some of the other products.  Definitely will continue to buy!
 Best ever.
 Couldn't be happier with this protein! Defintaly works well. 24g of protein is a great ammout. And the added BCAAS and other stuff is a great addition to the protein, best of all it dosent taste like cardboard like most proteins! The taste is actually really good, Esp with some added Peanut butter! I defintaly highly recommend this product.
 5 lbs of good protein for 50 bucks a sweet deal.  Much better protein then Walmart brand and for less
 Good price, good taste
 Great product<br/>Delivered on time
 I've tried several different brands and types of protein powder. ON seems to have the best powder with the factors that I look for. I look for lower calories, low sugar, lower carb count, lower fat, and higher protein.<br/><br/>This mixes well in my shaker cup with unsweetened almond milk, taste is pretty good, but almost tastes too sweet.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a good product and would buy again.<br/><br/>This is my honest review, and I even paid full price (what a concept)!
 Great.
 This stuff is amazing
 Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard has been an extremely effective tool in putting on muscle weight. Having only used this product for a month, I have had remarkable results. Definitely worth the price, mixes easily with water or milk, and tastes great.
 really goof
 It tastes good
 One of the best tasting and working proteins I have tried. Would definitely recommend to everyone. Good rich proteins. Good taste. Cant get better :)
 I like it very much and use it daily.  Have been using this protein powder in a morning shake now for almost two years.
 If you are looking for an easy to ship product, this worked for travelling overseas. Requested by a soldier as a "best" supplement. Malleable packaging, didn't have to re-pack.Shipped flat rate. Recommend!
 Good product. I like the vanila ice cream flavor, it tastes better when I blend other fruit and chia seeds in.
 The most popular by far
 Straight forward protein source. Taste is decent, mixes well and is on the low side of artificial ingredients and processing. The taste wasn't chocolatey enough so I paired it with Ghirardelli hot cocoa mix and it was grrreatt.
 This Banana Cream, so far, is way better than the chocolate. Soooo tasty. I love it! I drink this for breakfast and in the evening right after work out.
 This was a good deal for the 5 lb tub. Taste isn't that great but the ingredients and nutritional value make up for it.
 I've been using ON whey gold standard for a while now and I think it's great, but my latest flavor choice (mint chocolate) was a mistake. Don't cheap out and get the least expensive flavor - it's that way for a reason. Great value as always, and transparent ingredients.
 Great product, great taste as always.  Arrived on time and works as advertised.  Very intense chocolate taste.  No "medicine taste" like other brands.  Will buy again.
 Mocha cappuccino tastes great and mixes easily without lumps.
 Taste has hint of coffee
 Best protein supplement on market
 Very good product, very complete and balanced protein, recommend it. You can buy additional supplements to maximize benefits, like glutamine or BCAA's.
 I really feel so helpful to my body. I already ate 1, so u decide to buy 2nd one. It makes me look more stronger , for course based on work out!
 Me like to be beefy.  Me like to be strong.  Me like whey protein to be beefy and strong.
 Exactly what I wanted. Price was right and it came early.
 This stuff really works. It fills you up, satisfies your protein needs, and is some of the most affordable protein on the market. Highly recommend for those wanting to put on lean muscle mass. Its low carbohydrate content makes it harder to gain weight however so not as effective in that regard. Other than that, tastes great and highly recommend!
 Perfect
 good
 I really like this protein powder.  It taste good and it mixes well by hand.  I think for the price, it's a good buy.
 Tastes great. Great product.
 Possibly the best tasting Optimum Nutrition whey.
 This, along with the creatine powder and working out like a madman, helped me gain 15 pounds in less than 3 months! It also mixes really easily and works with all kinds of liquids.
 tasty and works
 I would have given this product 5 stars given the high quality of the protein and how easy and quick it desolves, but the cookies and cream one is just terrible. I always mix it into my smoothies and obviously cookies and cream doesn't sound like it will mix good but even by itself in water or milk, it is just disgusting. I will will purchase this product again; only in vanilla or chocolate.
 good stuff here. Tastes good and you get a lot of bang for your buck
 Great taste.
 Chocolaty
 delicious and nutritious
 As always great.
 excellent
 Excellent product, great brand, quick delivery.
 Quite surprised at how good it is. I'll definitely buy more. Haven't tried it with just milk or water but I have been using it with yogurt, frozen fruit and milk as a smoothie. Very tasty. I may venture on to try the casein protein powder that they make.
 Great product gives you all what your body needs..
 High quality protein, low sugars. Love it.
 great product great customer service, fast shipping will order again.
 It's amazing and I love it
 Best absorption of Amino Acids
 Good amount for my wife and I to get when we are just getting back into our exercise routine.  This is a must try flavor especially with whole milk ( ; (more of a dessert at that point tho lol).  Great price, great taste, and 100% Whey ?WHY NOT?
 Great Protein. The ONLY problem I had was the taste. Don't get me wrong at first it was delicious. As time went on and 20 so shakes later i couldn't stand the taste any more.
 Amazing and the price is just right!
 GREAT TASTE!!!!!
 Its okay, has the.banana candy flavor, in the first sips taste okay the last drops are more nasty
 Arrived quickly. Keeps my gains
 Taste really good
 Just like the reviews that I read before purchasing product: It's a great product for a great price! Order it and you won't be disappointed!
 Get swole.
 Absolutely the best protein I've tasted.  I gave it a 4 star because I was disappointed that the price went up $10 whereas every other flavor did not.
 Not good used
 Great taste... less filling :-). I've benefited greatly from this whey protein. I think it is the best value of all the powders out there. I'm thinking of adding branch chain aminos next to my routine for that extra kick.
 Excellent product
 I'm really happy with this product so far.. I make my shakes with unsweetened almond milk and it tastes pretty good, like hot chocolate. I can still taste the artificial sweetener a bit but it's no where near as bad as some. Overall, really liking this product.
 I love the flavor i really didn't know much about Whey when i made this purchase but i use it as a meal replacement and it keepS me full for hours.. i mix 2 scoops with 16 oz of Silk Vanilla for breakfast!
 Been taking whey a few years now, on and off. Back on to be more consistent. I don't really eat that much meat, more chicken and fish, so this helps give me the boost I need to up the amount of protein I consume in a day. In the summer I like to add a scoop to my fruit smoothies. Other than that, I miss it with milk,it mixes well, unlike the casein version. I drink one serving in the morning and one late in the afternoon after my workout. Flavor is pretty good too. Highly recommend.
 My favorite
 I've had Optimjum Nutrition's protein powder in several flavors<br/>Double Rich Chocolate- my favorite<br/>Strawberry Banana- Pretty good, especially when blended with strawberries and bananas<br/>Cookies N Creme- OK, better when blended with a couple oreo type cookies<br/>Peanut butter chocolate- God awful<br/>Natural vanilla-pretty bad, I even tried blended with Pineapple- still bad
 Although I prefer the vanilla flavor over the double rich chocolate it had the same desired effects and is a great way to promote muscle growth after a workout.  Highly suggest using this and other optimum nutrition products they are reliable and dont get too fancy.
 awesome taste
 Good taste.
 Excellent
 Great stuff
 It's protein that doesn't taste like flaked-off dead skin cells.  You can't go wrong with chocolate although the cookies and cream wasn't terribad.
 Not that great of a taste
 This protein powder mixes well and has a tolerable taste. Taste may be personal preference, but I found Muscle Milk and Body Fortress tasted better in a comparison of chocolate flavors.
 Tastes great and dissolves entirely
 Never tried this flavor before, but I'm really impressed.  Kinda hard to wait to drink my next shake.  Don't get it if you don't like bananas of course, but otherwise it's awesome.
 Love this whey protein
 Rich double chocolate is the best tasting (especially with milk)<br/><br/>Fruit punch tastes good, but is a little harder to mix with water
 good
 We have ordered this every couple months for the last few years for my husband to add to his fruit smoothie!  He absolutely loves it!
 Thank-you, Brodin, for blessing us with such protein. Many gains are to be made with this product<br/><br/>wheymen
 Excellent product
 good price good product
 Best protein powder you can get in my opinion.  High protein to calorie ratio.  No junk fillers.  Mixes without clumps.  More more could you want?
 Add milk if it turns out the best result. Awesome taste, which wants to try again and again
 Who knew cake batter protein mix could be so food.
 Perfect!
 I have used this protein for over 3 years and it has been a key component to my success in the gym! By far it is the best tasting protein powder I have used besides Muscle Milk and the price is great. If you work hard in the gym and give it all you have each time then you owe it to yourself to use this protein.
 Only the best!
 Good as good can be
 Taste great in a smoothie.
 The best protein on the market by price and flavor -- hands down.
 Rocky Road is definitely the best tasting so far from what I've had. It tastes the same to me whether I add milk or not. Besides the amazing taste, it's an amazing product. ON delivers the best in my opinion. Next is Strawberry/Banana.
 It is OK...
 It keeps me full and i get the protein i need
 I like it
 Great taste. Sweeter than rich chocolate flavor.
 Flavour is good, previously I have tasted banana and initially I felt taste very mild but after one month I started liking this and results are good.<br/>Thanks amazon for the quick delivery...
 One of the best tasting and easiest drinking proteins I have ever had.
 Does what it advertises.  Blah blah blah. The best tasting whey protein available. Breaks down great as well. TASTE GREAT!!!!!!
 I was skeptical about getting any protein powder. I always heard it was really expensive and tasted terrible. But got it for a good price here, and the Extreme Milk Chocolate flavor tastes great. I recommend it to everyone I know.
 Picked up Rocky Road flavor.<br/>Day 1 - This isn't great but not bad.  I think maybe milk will help.<br/>Day 2 - Milk helped but its not great...I can drink this.<br/>Day 4 - This is not good....I don't want to drink it but I should<br/>Day 6 - Please don't make me...please!  Plug my nose, Close my eyes and Chug.  Get the shakes but manage to keep it down.<br/>Day 10 - ... Tomorrow...please no, please - http://mrwgifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Dumbledore-Shakes-His-Head-Reaction-Gif.gif
 I have tried some of the other flavors but I think this one is by far the best.
 Many protein powders taste horrible. The Extreme Milk Chocolate actually tastes good. I will definitely purchase this product again! Even my wife liked it!
 We ordered Cake Batter and it tastes NOTHING like Cake Batter-Hopefully we can exchange for a different flavor.
 Good quality
 Great taste, amazing product.  High amino's great buy.
 Thanks to this product I will get quicker results, is so effective
 I stopped using this product due to containing artificial sweeteners and some other questionable ingredients.
 Taste great! Love it! stir it well, can be clumpy if you don't!
 Optimum Nutrition has always done well in the whey protein category. Now, with the addition of the hydrowhey peptides, this just made the industry standard that much better!<br/>Great recovery protein at (considering the price jump in protein as of late) an amazing price.
 So extremely sweet to the point it becomes unpleasant to your taste. Since ON's Gold Standard Whey protein generally are good product this would be a near 5 stars product if it weren't for the extreme amount of sugar on it. ON should learn this isn't a minor thing, since people taking your Whey are into the pursuit of fitness and health --sounds obviuos-- and many of them are diabetic or extremely high sugar levels in blood they want to control.<br/><br/>This is when a healthy quality product becomes harmful. Learn you aren't a candy shop for kids.<br/><br/>Note: have to say this is the Cookies &amp; Cream flavor.
 The scoop was not inside and it did not bring the top cover.
 Can't go wrong with ON Whey Gold Standard.
 Best protein powder
 My son can dunk now!!!
 Best protein blend on the market.
 probably some of the best protein on the market. It taste great I personally enjoy the extreme milk chocolate. Great thing about this product is it doesn't have as much sugar as other brands such as muscle milk
 The title says it all. I keep coming back to Optimum Nutrition because I know what to expect. The protein powder has limited fillers compared to it's competitors, and ingredients are relatively straightforward and not something to be concerned about. I've bought four different flavors in the past (Mocha, Rocky Road, Double Chocolate, and Ice Cream), and with the exception of Ice Cream I've enjoyed everyone. Even Ice Cream has it's merits, it's just not suitable to my tastes.<br/><br/>I can see how cost could be a deterrent for some, as it's a little more expensive then some of it's main stream competitors and  a lot more expensive then the off brands. However, I wholeheartedly believe you pay for what you get. Their may be cheaper or better alternatives out their, but Gold Standard is "Old Reliable". You know it'll taste good and you know that it works.
 A Very good product
 GOLD, this product is absolute gold. The last few times I've used this product i have been lazy to buy when the product is empty. I notice that when im out of product and working out, my recovery takes longer, but not only that, my body is more sore the next day. If you use this product as intended( use with milk, better for you, and helps bones recover), then you will see the results i do. And if their is any reviewer you should be listening to, it's me. I have been on the skinny side my whole life, and this product still works wonders with me. It doesn't matter how big or small you are, this product is for everybody. DO NOT buy the serious mass, it's a waste of money, this is where your money should be invested.
 powder mixes well, especially with a shaker. I like it as a smoothie base for lunch or breakfast. Good value for  your money. No diet excuses when it's delivered right to your door!<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Optimum-Nutrition-100-Whey-Gold-Standard-Double-Rich-Chocolate-5-Pound/dp/B000QSNYGI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard, Double Rich Chocolate, 5 Pound</a>
 Many protein powders taste chalky and artificially sweet.  Not this one.
 After trying this i loved it. Taste great mix well and has good stuff in it. With 77 servings the price is good too. Buying lot more of this stuff.
 It's better value buying 5 pounds instead of 2 pounds. I gave 4 stars because the taste is just OK.
 You get the best bang for your buck with this Whey.  The sales consultants at GNC have also admitted it.  This Whey tastes great, dissolves well and is relatively low calorie.  After trying many different brands, both my wife and I have stuck with Gold Standard for the past year.
 I love this product. It is priced amazingly and is effective. NOt too many sugars or fats, tastes great and high quality protein. I am an intermediate weight lifter and have been training for 16 years. Supplements have come a long way and I choose O.N.
 Assuming its doing what it supposed to be doing, this product is excellent. Throw in some ice cubes, ice cream, a banana, a mango and a scoop of this in a blender and you have a very nice smoothie.
 Nothing to complain
 Favorite flavor!
 Good protein, but don't get the double rich chocolate, tastes awful and nothing like chocolate.
 This whey powder tastes so good.
 Great protein but the vanilla shake flavor is way too sweet
 Favorite whey product.
 There is nothing I can say about this product that has not already been said.<br/>Great protein count per serving. Great taste. Dissolves with no issues.<br/>ON is the best in the business for a reason.
 I love the Flavor
 I love this product. I take 20 grams at a time with 8 oz. of water or milk and it tastes great either way. I use it right when I wake up with water to get ready for the day and it really helps with not getting that mid morning hunger before lunch. Then I also take 20 g immediately before a game, running, or lifting along with an apple or banana and I think it's perfect. I have plenty of energy for the workout and there is no caffeine! Then I also take 20 g with 2 bananas post workout for recovery. This is a great protein and it will promote lean muscle growth. I totally recommend it for anyone looking for a powder. Also, this flavor is by far the best. I've tried the strawberry, chocolate, and a few other flavors and I feel this is the best with water. I actually look forward to drinking it. Much better than muscle milk. I recommend it, but do more research to make sure it's what you want.
 Excellent!
 I LOVE this flavor, best whey protein...females don't be afraid. great price with free shipping too (can't find that anywhere else online to my knoweldge--so this is the best deal!)
 Taste pretty good.
 I love the taste of this with my almond vanilla milk because it taste just like a strawberry and banana smoothie. adding water is alright but it just doesn't taste as great. The powder blended really well you don't really need a shaker and i didn't feel bloated after. low on carb and fat so overall best protein shake i ever had.
 Fast and simple. The taste could be a whole lot better.
 Love ON will always buy this brand
 This is one of best whey proteins which I like. It dissolves well in water or milk and it does not gives the funny after taste like other whey products. This comes in many different flavours. I have tried Vanilla and Strawberry Banana. Highly recommended.
 The flavor description says extreme milk chocolate. It's definitely not extreme and not milk chocolate. It tastes more like cinnamon than chocolate. Amazon won't allow a return on this product so I will use it. I will just have to add my own cocoa powder to cover up the bad taste. I'm going back to buying EAS from Sam's club.
 I love ON protein but this flavor is not good at all and doesn't mix well.
 This my favorite flavor.  Shipping was fast.  Optimum Nutrition is the best protein powder I have ever purchased!
 Best tasting protein powder I've found, for a very good price, and it mixes into water very quickly. Will buy again.
 I LOVE THIS PROTEIN POWDER! It's super delicious and mixes well.
 Great taste, good nutrition.
 Best tasting protein ever - I've tried double chocolate and Mocha Cappuccino, both are great. Blends easy. Quality protein.
 Excellent product.
 Well I just ordered this the other day and I ordered the 6lb tub of it but now all of a sudden when I go to track the package it says 5lbs.
 Gold standard has always been my go- to whey protein. My package arrived on time and I've been very pleased with my results
 This protein is awesome and I love this size cause I live in Brazil and I can actually fit the bag in my suitcase. The bad part was the delay in delivering it to me in Miami even though I paid the fast shipping. It took than more than 6 days.
 excellent product
 The product works great as protein, but the flavor is a little ehhh.<br/>i originally tried the Double Rich Chocolate and it was really good.<br/>The Mocha Cappuccino is really sweet compared to the DRC.<br/>Great protein, but flavor is okay.
 This is my third purchase of this protein powder, so I decided to try something new.  This flavor isn't unbearable but not nearly as good as the french vanilla creme.
 Showed up unsealed and powder everywhere.
 Been using it for years.  It works.
 Thanks
 I always go with this flavor. Safe and tasty choice
 This is by far the best tasting and the best quality protein for the buck! I know other people are saying stay away because the changed the formula. I will say it still has the aminogen in it but they did add sucralose ( artificial sweetener). I not a fan of it but I only use one serving per day. My flavor of choice is the extreme milk chocolate.
 Great product
 GREAT DEAL FOR THE PRICE. IT IS BETWEEN $25-$30 MORE EVERYWHERE AND I WAS SURPRISE TO RECEIVE IT FOR LESS PRICE FROM OTHER STORES.<br/><br/>I AM SATISFIED AND RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT AND SELLER TO ANYONE WHO IS INTERESTED TO BUY.
 Keeps me full longer.  I use it in the morning and after my workout in the evening.  I buy vanilla ice cream.  It has a good taste to it.
 I've had good experience with ON's other flavors, but Cookies and Cream is poison. It's loaded up with corn syrup and other nasty stuff you don't want in your protein, totally different ingredients from their other whey flavors.<br/><br/>Now if you'll excuse me, I'll be on the toilet.
 Exactly what I expected!
 Excellent
 Great Product.  Tastes Great!
 It's too sweet. I'll stick to chocolate.
 The taste is almost good as syntha 6, without all the sugar/carbs.
 What I Expected
 Love it.  Drink a protein-packed smoothie most mornings.  Hard to beat!
 Great product but the package was a little bit ripped on the front cover. The product i would give 5 stars.
 I like using this product..Bought this item by watching the reviews and I even recommended this product to my friends.
 Very good! Recommend 100%!
 Good content
 This Gold Standard was good as usual but the Vanilla didn't really taste as good as some of the others flavors I have had.
 I have been using this product since 1 year . This is my first choice protein powder
 mocha flavor  sucks
 Best quality and taste
 Bamb
 It's a great protein that tastes great, period. What else are you looking for?<br/><br/>No but really it blends really well, my shakes meet my sweet tooth almost in how delicious the chocolate of it is. Will be buying again
 I've been using Optimum protein for years, but now it's just too damn expensive.  Sure it mixes well with water or milk. Taste is okay. There are cheaper options out there and I could just add a small meal to replace this protein shake that I use once a day. If I stop using it, I save over $60 per month...$720 per year.
 This is the best whey protein powder I've ever tried! I've tried several and none compare. While I wish they didn't add the artificial sweeteners, they seem to use a lot less than their competitors.
 Got it in cookies and cream flavor. Yum.
 Love the product for its price and variety of flavors, fully recommend it.
 I've tried plenty of protein shakes, but this is most tolerable. It does have a watery taste it's not all chalky and clumpy like most shakes. It did have a chocolate taste aside to the wateryness but great overall. It's also chuggable :)
 This product is great! I bought the strawberry flavor, and it tastes great! Amazon delivered it really quick. This brand of whey protein is a lot better than any other brands out there. In my opinion, this product works the best for me, but I think some people may prefer others. This product is affordable, it's not very cheap or very expensive. If you are a serious weight lifter, I would recommend buying a bigger package, and save more money.
 Taste is good with water or milk . Mixes well not gritty .
 Holy mackerel! That's a lot of whey! Great product and well worth it. Arrived on time. Thank you!
 Top top top
 I like ON Whey, it tastes much better than other brands I've used in the past. My favorite flavors are the Rocky Road and Cookies and Cream I alternate between the two. Double rich chocolate is also pretty good.
 Excellent product! Good price.
 I bought this 10lb bag of chocolate whey because I'm SERIOUS about some SERIOUS GAINZ! A few gym sessions after I ordered, my doorbell rang and there was the UPS guy, struggling to hold up my massive bag of whey. I was all like "DYEL, BRO?". I opened the bag up, mixed 2 scoops with some whole milk, and I've been a JACKED MUSCLE TAXI ever since!!!
 It tastes great!  I will definitelly be purchasing this product again.  The price is better than any of the grocery stores where I live.
 Bought this for my fiance who recently started working out/diet etc and this is one of the best ones that he could find in his hunt for the best and most affordable why protein powder! He's only been taking it for a few weeks so it's a little early to see if it is beneficial or not but he is happy with it! I did not that the container was only literally half way full but he was reassured by other reviewers that you still get the 5 lbs of powder.
 My husband said it doesn't have an overwhelming vanilla taste. It blends in with milk great and he's really happy with it and the results.
 If you're going to use a protein powder this is the one to buy. The container is ridiculously large but the value &amp; flavor are there.
 Great taste, makes me feel full which is why I wanted Whey. Add a dash of sea salt for a stronger coffee taste.
 Great taste and received in 2 days.. only con is that mine didn't bring a scoop but other than that i have no complains
 👍👍👍👌👌👌
 Buy bulk! It's cheaper than what you'd get at a supplement store, and you can get weird flavors like this one (which tasted awesome).
 It tastes good. fast delivery.
 When selecting whey I found ON to be the best ratio of protein content and price based on a few different reviews/sources.  Since then I've tried a few flavors, and have found the French Vanilla Creme to be the best.
 Take this daily and not just on my workout days.
 Best protein out there, also shipped to my house VERY quick!!
 The best flavor is rocky road hands down!?!? Second best is extreme milk chocolate!? Yaaaass
 Excellent product.  I only use the best and this is most certainly it.
 Best tasting protein powder on the market!
 I have double chocolate  and taste great  and this banana cream taste great as well just not as sweet or creamier.. As for the protein it got great profiles.
 When I first started lifting seriously a couple years ago I experimented a great deal with different protein supplements. While I liked many, I always found myself returning to ON Gold Standard. For a reasonable price you receive a high protein, low calorie drink that is great for those on the run who are looking for a quality supplement after working out. I have never tried a flavor I haven't liked, and for those who are pickier than me there are a ton of flavors to choose from. Overall, a fantastic protein supplement that is great for starters and the more advanced alike.
 The protein powder as a whole is great except for one thing, the taste! I would recommend the chocolate over this by far! Optimum Nutrition is the best brand out there by a wide mile though!
 Works great!!!
 Is everything I,expected. Great flavor
 Easy to use
 Trash. Don't consume whey.
 Good price and not a lot of calories or other additives.
 The best tasting whey for the best per-pound price. Can you ask more?
 Great taste and the bottle was full! Very content with my purchase, making gains already!
 This is the highest quality protein powder for this price. The protein is high quality, and with 24 g protein for 120 calories, it calculates out to 80% pure whey protein, with only 24 calories of non-protein stuff per serving. If you buy the 5-lb tub at $58, it comes out to about $0.82/serving, or $0.03 per gram of protein, which is more bang for your buck than any other protein powder I could find.<br/><br/>I'd originally started with a 1-lb bottle of the double rich chocolate flavor, and it was surprisingly drinkable-- mild, chocolatey, not too sweet, and didn't taste too chalky or artificial. (I'd never used protein shakes before so I didn't know what to expect.) I decided to go up to the 5-lb size, and after reading all the rave reviews for extreme milk chocolate being so much better than double chocolate, bought the large bottle of extreme milk chocolate. It's not terrible, but man do I regret it. The milk chocolate flavor has far more artificial sweetener than double chocolate, to the point where it leaves a weird aftertaste. I was surprised there could be so much of a difference in sweetness between two flavors from the same brand. I can see how some may prefer the additional sucralose, but I'm not a fan.<br/><br/>double rich chocolate: not too sweet, like a mild chocolate milk<br/>extreme milk chocolate: tastes like chocolate milk with a bunch of chocolate syrup and 4 packets of splenda
 good product, highly recommended
 Tastes decent and I've noticed considerable gains in muscle mass in just the first month and a half.
 GOOD
 Amazing taste, this product tops all others that I have tried. I am very happy with all Optimum Nutrition products! Highly recommend.
 So disappointed that ON would change the vanilla ice cream formula. As others have mentioned, the new version is disgusting and undrinkable.
 Came on time and as advertised. Great product! I'll definitely be purchasing it again
 Great product!! Great sellers
 One of the best whey proteins available in the market
 Love love this great taste light on the stomach dissolve within seconds
 This is the best whey protein in the market. I wanted lean muscle gains because I play soccer and cricket. working out and including this in my diet proved really helpful. I packed muscle within 3 weeks of having this great baby!
 Mixes well, doesn't taste nasty and artificial like most other protein brands. ON's Gold Standard is great for people looking to keep lean with its low carbs and fat. I've tried other proteins from ON, and other brands and ON Gold Standard is my go to.
 Love this product
 Great taste!
 Good stuff
 Love it
 Great protein tastes aweful
 It doesnt tastes as great as everybody claims it does. I found Muscle Milk tastes better. In terms of results, I dont see much of it, mainly because i am still in the first month of using it? Everything else ok right now. If I have a better opinion than just the taste, I will drop by later.
 Rocky road tastes amazing!
 Love the flavor
 Tastes great and mixes well. Exactly what I wanted.
 Best product for muscle building. I am using this product from the last 7 years
 Tastes great with milk if you get Cookies n' Cream
 I love it! Tastes and smells like dessert which is exactly what I needed. Third time I've used this brand and got a container this large! I would buy again !!
 Its a great product!  The company ships its products in a great time frame.  Would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a good supplement of protein.
 Authentic product and timely delivery. Best whey protein.
 Its good ... but I just hate the aftertaste of proteins.
 Its good, but not great. All ON products have a desirable flavor and consistency and this one is an excellent value. However, I have found for a more rapid recovery, ON pro complex is the best.
 Tastes good
 This chocolate flavor is bland and chalky but the shakes don't upset my stomach and they help me recover from my more strenuous workouts. U may want to consider another flavor but ON has a great product.
 This is probably my favorite brand of whey protein and the strawberry flavor is very good. I gave this 4 stars only because it wasn't a super value. I would recommend this to anyone who, like me, takes whey protein daily.
 Good quality protein. Loved the cookies and cream. Can't beat the price.
 Love this protein powder. It has great flavor and mixes easily.
 Perffect
 Mixes really well. Tastes great. Will buy again.
 I'm rating this 5 star's because the product really does work. My bicep's have grown an inch in three week's. Before taking any supplement's for month's, my arm's had no difference in size whatsoever. This is one of the top product's out today and it fairly cheap and affordable. It's also the best tasting protein i've ever had as well. For anyone asking if it's a good, i would tell them no because it's better than good. It's an excellent top of the line great tasting product. I would recommend it to anyone looking to grow mass to buy it now and work hard.
 Great taste, great price, but next time I will order vanilla...
 The taste for one and gaining muscle during workouts.
 good product
 Mixes extremely well in a small amount of water. In order to achieve the "double chocolate" taste, only about 6 ounces of water should be used. Quicker delivery to the muscles.
 Shipped fast.<br/>But flavor wasn't as good as I thought it would be. Still gets the job done. Will buy from again, just a different flavor.
 Thanks
 This stuff is amazing, love it. Best flavor is Rocky Road for sure.
 great product, best protein powder for the price. as for the banana flavor it got to become a chore to drink it. I had the chocolate before and i drank it everyday without any problem. I would recomend getting vanilla and maybe adding a banana to it. the banana flavoring just wasn't very appealing day after day.
 great product
 buen sabor.... se mezcla bien...no deja grumos y  se mezcla bien con frutas y otros alimentos..<br/>buena proteina para todos
 I'm a protein fiend.  I love protein, especially whey, and have tried many different products.  For the past year or so, I was quite happy with the whey protein sold at my local Meijer grocery store...then all of the sudden they changed the formula and it now tastes horrible, like there's soap in it.<br/><br/>This led me to search for a new protein powder.  So I searched Amazon to see what had the best reviews, and ordered Whey Gold Standard, Double Rich Chocolate, 5 Pound jar.  Thanks to Amazon Prime (which I absolutely LOVE), I had the jar two days later.<br/><br/>Let me say this, THIS IS THE BEST FRIGGIN PROTEIN POWDER I'VE EVER TASTED!!!  Ridiculously good.  Could not be more pleased.  Thank you to the manufacturer for creating such an awesome product.  It's easy to mix, has 25 grams of protein, only one gram of fat, and the taste is fantastic.
 Protein powder. Stuff has been around for a while and for a reason. Good quality and does the trick.<br/><br/>People have rated the flavors on here, but lets be honest.... they all taste like protein. I have found that the less water you use, the better tasting. Weird I know, but it's true. It doesn't taste like Rocky Road, it taste like chocolate protein.
 It is good for my objectives.
 it works as it should and it breaks down easily in milk, water, and juices without a blender or a shaker bottle.
 If price was a little better i would have given a 5 star review .
 taste like a marshmellowy vanilla flavor kinda
 The taste of extreme milk chocolate is awesome even if you take it with water.<br/>Guys...If you wanna have a good taste,go for this flavour.
 5 out of 5 stars.
 Price keeps going up because it is a great product. I have been using it for years and have nothing negative to say.
 Tastes Great, mixes well, Fills you up.  Good meal replacement and you don't get hungry.
 Only thing wrong with it is the disgusting flavor.
 A++
 I tried couple of ther whey proteins and this is the one that had the best taste.
 Loved the product, liked the taste of this one. Highly recommended to all interested in buying it!
 By far the best manufacture of protein shakes. The quality is always consistent and works well in all of recipes I use in "The Shredded Chef" book.
 The price a the quantity were a very good value.
 It tastes like regular vanilla protein, so I'm disappointed for that fact. But it mixes well, so that's a plus. Will try other flavors next time...
 I recieved my item quick i am really satisfied ..I  would recomend to anyone.Thankz for your bussines
 Best tasting protein out tehre!
 tastes great, good bang for buck for proteins
 will never buy it again at any price.
 Tastes great!
 Have just enough protein I need. No chalky after-taste. I ordered the vanilla so I could add fruits or other flavors in it and won't get stuck with the same flavor. It still tastes good. Great deal.
 So good! I got the extreme milk chocolate and mix it with 1/2 cup of cold coffee, 1/2 cup of almond milk and a handful of ice! Love it
 Very good!!
 Good price for a good product
 Good product shipping was fast
 Taste amazing by far the best flavor.
 Best whey on the market if you are one a diet!
 How can I find the scoop? Using my hand  and groping in the jar?
 Hell yea gainz ! Flavor 8/10 ... Better than mint but worse then mocha
 Fast shipping and a good protein powder, but don't really like the French Vanilla flavor. Going to stick with chocolate...
 Best whey one can buy. Great taste, not too thick, perfect.
 Best protein on the market, bar none.
 Shipped quickly. Works great!
 Great product!
 Just started taking it, taste (Rich chocolate) is not so good but you will get used to it.<br/>Definitely better than those expensive Monster Milk and Muscle Milk having more calories and fat.<br/>Optimum Nutrition Whey has very less fat and calories, but more protein.
 Great taste!
 Tastep good and delivery fast
 Excellent product, very useful!! highly recommended
 It is really good taste.
 I'm happy with my purchases.
 I have tried other products, but I have to say that this product really shows results. I recommend it to anyone who is looking for that extra protein supplement.
 Tastes good, works for me
 Excellent product, highly recommended.
 Very Good product. I have been enjoying it a lot. I drink it for breakfast mixed with fruits and then after a workout usually for dinner. I love it !!!
 Good protein if you wanna burn fat and get muscle
 I received this product the day after I ordered it. The product has been fantastic. It tastes great and I have already began to see results in just a couple weeks. Definitely recommend the Extreme Milk Chocolate.
 Awesome stuff
 exceptionally satisfied with this product. One of the most cheap and popular whey protein out there. I take it whenever and 45 mins after working out.
 YES!!!!!
 Great tasting and easily mixes with water. The two most important aspects of any whey powder.
 Best Protein supplement out there-great flavor and mixes really well
 Love this stuff. Glad I can get this size bag.
 I've tried rich double chocolate, the java flavor and this. I would definitely recommend this if you plan on mixing in fruits or other stuff into your shake. My favorite combination so far is a banana, peanut butter, and milk. It tastes like amazing.
 it came on time, the only thing is that the protein came in a box with styrofoam why do you need this? you don't! The other annoying thing is the company started sending me all this junk mail, I hate junk mail advertising their vitamins. Please don't send me stuff I don't want. Overall good.
 I've been a customer of Optimum Nutrition for quite some time now and I have always been trying new flavors. I have to say that I've tried at least 7 different flavors now and this one has been the WORST. It tastes absolutely horrible. The only good thing about it was the fact that it was optimum nutrition so I knew it was good protein and it mixed really well...Or was it? When I received my package the plastic wrap was sealed but when I opened the jar the stay fresh seal was slightly open.EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE TASTE. Had to force myself to drink this one when I was MORE that happy to drink all the others.
 The best tasting chocolate protein! Great macros as well
 My go-to protein for years.  Tastes good and mixes well.
 Was extremely satisfied with this product. Mainly use it after exercise.
 Great protein!
 Good
 Tastes great!
 May be I'm writing this review too early.  So far, I haven't really seen any change.  I know it will take a while for my muscles to grow, so i'll modify this review in a couple of months.  For now, all  I can say is that the product tastes great!
 Great value, awesome taste and mixes well for smooth shakes.
 100%
 First protein mix I've bought and I think it's great.  Tastes pretty good, though I mix with milk instead of water.  I'll probably buy it again.
 Best tasting whey powder on the market. Best ingredients too.
 Great tasting, good with either water, milk or both
 Is there any protein out there better than this? Delicious and breaks up nicely. Tastes like one of those bottled lattes in milk. 5's all around.
 Great taste and mixes well.  Love mixing with almond milk much better than water.  Probably the best protein I have ever bought. Much better numbers than other hyped proteins.
 Best quality protein powder I've used and mixes very well
 Delicious.  Would buy again.
 Exactly what I expected. Will buy again.
 It was very upsetting to my stomach.  Didn't like the way  it affected  me.  Would do some research if I was considering buying  whey protien supplements.
 This flavor was so delicious that I was afraid to try another. I ended up taking the risk for the highly rated Rocky Road and it was worth it! These two flavors will make you look forward to your protein shake every day! Also gainzzzzzz!
 I love it
 Tastes good, works good
 Great product
 Great
 This is my go-to protein brand, and I love it. I purchased Extreme Milk Chocolate and it tastes similar to chocolate milk! No complaints here.
 Taste great
 Awesome product and quick delivery
 This stuff is great. It has a great taste and generally has more protein per scoop than most other brands. This is just a great value.
 same great taste of chocolate, tastes better with milk
 I recommend the Extreme milk chocolate flavor
 I like it so far.
 One of the highest quality whey proteins you can purchase at a reasonable price.
 I would have preferred to take my protein with water, like I did with EAS powder but, Gold Standard is disgusting that way.
 Made all kinds of gains
 works great good flavor.
 Tastes a lot better than most competitors and a steal for this price considering the quality of active ingredients used.
 Good taste need good blender to mix well.
 Great quality and taste
 Been using this protein for almost 2 years, I have made tremendous muscle gains with this supplement. Proper dieting and good protein powder will take you there.
 I have been a long time customer of Optimum Nutrition's Gold Standard Whey Protein.  I just spent ~$110 on my latest batch of 10 lbs and I am very disappointed with the change in flavor.  Their chocolate flavor was always very creamy and chocolatey prior to this most recent batch.  Evidently the formula has changed dramatically and now it just tastes super super sweet.  Frankly it is hard to drink and I have to choke it down.  Comparing the ingredients from my last batch it appears they have added a bunch of Sucralose... well thats all I taste now... yuck.
 Perfect.
 Delicious tasting protein product! I've tried other protein products which are absolutely disgusting. This product is the best I've tried. I look forward to my work outs because I can drink this after. :)
 I love this product...banana cream is my favorite flavor. Super easy to dissolve. I love it mixed into 1/2 cup low fat chocolate milk first thing in the morning...keeps me out of the donuts.
 price is good and paper bag is more flexible than the giant bottle.<br/>find out costco has different brand name product with same size.<br/>This big size should have more discount.<br/>After all, this is good product.
 I'm pleased with the overall quality of this product. Double Rich Chocolate tastes good with peanut butter, almond breeze, and heavy cream - tastes much better than just water, keeps the carbs low while delivering a good amount of protein.
 Great protein, low calorie. Tastes pretty good!
 I've tried a few protein shakes on the market. I've heard great things about ON Gold Standard and their quality. I had been taking some Intek Evolution protein, which has great ingredients, and tastes amazing (I look forward to my post-workout shake). However, at $60/5lb jug, it was getting pretty pricey.<br/><br/>I accidentally ordered two jugs in the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor (wanted the Double Chocolate which i hear is decent). It's not that the ingredients aren't good, I can't STAND the flavor. It's by far the worst tasting whey protein I have ever had. I've tried everything, water, milk, almond milk, soy milk, even adding a bit of cocoa powder to it. Nothing. I now dread my post-work out shake. I cry to myself every time I see the unopened jug sitting there, waiting for me to reluctantly open it and consume the hellish powder that lurks inside. I'd give it away to someone but that's just plain cruel.<br/><br/>If you don't care about flavor, or simply have some sort of strange, mutilated taste buds, go ahead and get the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor. It's cheap. However, i'd rather spend double the price for something I can stand. With Intek Protein, I found myself enjoying it to satisfy my sweet tooth, it was the perfect desert drink. Not so much of Gold Standard. Very Sad.
 Love the taste!
 The only protein powder I've used that easily mixes with cold milk and doesn't clump up into disgusting balls of goo.
 Good easy way to get protein
 excellent
 great for bodybuilding, not for people without exercise.
 Good stuff. Best price.
 I was a little skeptical about chocolate mint flavored protein powder.  Boy was I wrong.  This stuff is delicious.  Mixes well.  I can't think of anything bad to say about it.  I highly recommend.
 High quality excellent taste.
 Love this product. Taste great too. I was skeptical at first because I didn't want to bulk up,  but after doing some research on the topic, I learned that wasn't true.
 THIS is what protein was meant to be. I was using a Sams Club 5 lb bag of chocolate protein for a while, and let me say, this stuff is a million times better. The Sams Club protein mixed "syrupey" and thick, whereas ON Gold Standard mixed SMOOTH and "loose," like a good protein shake should be. It even mixes easier. The taste is phenomenal, just a great quality protein overall.<br/><br/>I still have yet to see it's after-workout effects, but I believe it's gonna be good news.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this protein to a friend, and this is the only protein I'll be buying from now on! Very happy I decided to try ON.
 Excellent stuff it was a great price and showed up quickly definitely cheaper than GNC if the scoop would stay on top it would be even better
 Good price. Good taste. Good macros.
 Its everything I wanted out my  protein supplement  great flavor quality ingredients and easy to read labeling so i know what I'm putting into my body. The only down side to this product  was trying to find the scoop in 10 pounds of protein :-)
 Good tasting and really easy to mix.
 I got the vanilla ice cream flavor and it tastes awesome!
 No seal and it taste like water, completely different, I been buying this flavor for a while be aware ...
 Good
 Great protein powder! It's a steal for the price, and I've never had any issues with it. Been buying this brand of protein powder from amazon for years.
 i keep using it,it bring me convience.it arrived at china just ten days after i bought it,i have become stronger
 well it helped me to gain a little muscle mass I used it only once will continue to use it and see further results
 Love it
 Need smaller containers since it's a lot of product to use! Wish you could add it to hot liquid for delicious coffee beverage.
 It's good. Easy on the stomach and tastes good too.
 Tastes good and mixes great with water. I have seen great results. I highly recommend it to anyone.
 Of all flavors and brands Whey proteins I've tested, Double Rich Chocolate ON Whey stands on top. Normally taste is inversely proportional to its health benefits. Not true for this product. Mixes well with water and milk. Works great as pre, post and intra workout. For regular workout-aholics there, this becomes a staple after some time for its taste and convenience. Wish I can buy a larger amount(e.g. 10 lb) at a lower than current price point. At present ON has reached at a point, where they can easily skimp on marketing and packaging and purely rely on customer reviews and deliver quality product at a lower price(e.g. Bulk Supplements)
 This stuff tastes good and is an easy way to meet my protein intake goals.
 It really works.<br/>Tip: don't drink it at night before sleeping, it takes a time to absorb all the proteins
 Excellent product repeat customer
 The taste is great! So smooth and it tastes like chocolate milk!
 Only protein that I buy and very easy to hit my macros with. Tastes good and mixes well.
 this is basically the go to budget protein. the tub is a little bit more than the standard 5 lb tub but this is also 72 servings instead of the normal 48 in most 5 lb tubs. if i don't have the extra money to buy something a little more tasty like syntha 6, i go with this one. i only get the chocolate because i dont know about the other flavors and dont want to try them, but i know all the chocolate variations are great.
 tastes bad and hard to digest.
 This is the only protein I use. Great taste and mixes well
 Both my wife and I have been using this product at least for the last four years. We like the fact that they have a great variety of flavors and it mixes well in water without the clumping.
 Great taste, and gives me the protein boost I need for my workouts!
 by my mistake, i ordered strawberry instead of chocolate haha but it tastes fine. all~~~good
 Perfect!
 I highly regret puchasing the chocolate flavor, to me it's chalky, and doesn't dissolve or taste as well as the rocky road flavor.<br/><br/>That said, it's a good product, the packaging is great, it's a good enough value, and it's as good as any powder.<br/><br/>Buy the rocky road flavor, you won't regret it.
 Very good supplement, tastes good, and easily dissolves. The only downside is it's very sweet flavor- almost too sugary. Would buy again.
 Awesome
 Great taste specially with papaya yumm.  It improved my recovery from doing insanity and heavy lifting.  Love the chocolate flavor.
 Been getting 100% ON Whey for 15 years. Have tried many between but this is the most reliable. ALWAYS recommend.
 Tastes bad
 Tastes great, I can really feel the protein digesting and my muscles pumping
 Good flavor!
 So far I can't review how effective it is, but taste is just GREAT! The best tasting protein whey I've ever tried!
 I bought this Whey every month.
 The only brand I buy. Highly recommend
 Using this as a supplement to my P90X3 workouts, starting to see some great results. This is a great shake for post workout recovery. Will be buying this again.
 Best protein ,, and delivery was fast,, i<br/>Am very happy,, i will<br/>Continue to buy this product feom amazon
 Makes my protein shakes taste fantastic!  Definitely would reccommend.
 Excellent taste. Easily mixed In shaker.
 Good product and good flavor
 Good taste, mixes consistently well, great after a workout
 I never write reviews but I had to make an exception this time: I could not be more HAPPY with this protein! I have tried many different brands and flavors and this one is by far the BEST one I have had!
 I saw the price and the amount and i thought it would be too good to be true, but when the order arrived within three days, i couldnt believe how good and how massive the product is. I recommend this product to anyone who wants quality protein for post workouts
 So I went from cardio to weight lifting because i got bored on the treadmilll and stairmaster. So i started doing heavy compound movements. And i thought this would help with recovery, but it really failed in that regard maybe i push my body far above 1 day recovery but i thought it would be better. But half ways through the bottle i started stacking it with creatine after my workouts oh man next day after heavy squats and deadlifts i feel great. Little soreness.
 Best protein out there
 Great product! The milk chocolate tastes pretty good and mixes incredibly smoothly!
 This is the best tasting whey protein on the market.  I make it with Skim Milk and have three shakes per day.  This is ideal for people who have undergone bariatric surgery *gastric sleeve* and need to maintain their protein intake.
 I love the taste of this protein, much better than the platinum product from ON.  Mixes well in a milk filled shaker cup, with a blender ball.  I've gained about 15 lbs of muscle in the last 3 months, so in my opinion it's working.
 Great product
 Great product with great results.
 Love this stuff! I always get the vanilla ice cream flavor:) It doesn't clump up like most protein powders and is top quality protein.
 Been using this protein for 8 years now! Definitely the BEST there is.
 I have tried nearly every kind of whey protein supplements out there and, in my experience, Optimum nutritions is the best. It tastes like an actual milk shake and its one of the most pure isolates i have ever tried. Very effective and highly reccomended.
 First of all this protien tastes great. I thought it was going to be too rich but its not, infact it has a mild chocolate flavor. It dissolves quickly into water and doesnt give the water a grainy texture. I plan on buying it again.
 Mixes great and taste is good on chocolate brownie flavor I think it is called.  Best deal found here on Amazon.  Better than GNC pricing even with gold card
 Not the real product.  The product i received had filler in the container when compared to the same product purchased at GNC.
 Tasted great with milk, won't try it with water. Extreme milk chocolate is my go to flavor now. It shipped pretty quick as well.
 Great quality,Good tasting, mixes extremely well, prefect macros. The only protein I drink.
 Powder dissolves easily, tastes great, and has the right proportion of protein per scoop. Have been consistently using this product with my workouts. Has helped me to obtain great results.
 Best protein for the money.  Will buy again.  Tastes great too.
 This is OK to use as some replacement for some foods. I worked out and exercised a lot and used this as a recovery but after a couple of days it felt as if my body and bones were screaming from none existent pain. I tried a different protein powder with the same schedule of work outs and my body felt better and it felt as if it was properly recovering. So I recommend to not use this powder for exercise but instead to use as a replacement for food.
 mixed with water very good. Great flavor 5 star's
 Wrong content.  Ordered Strawberry flavor and although container had strawberry on outside, the container was filled with vanilla.
 Doesnt taste like it used to earlier. Tastes very bland.
 ON is the best supplement. Highly recommended by everyone, everywhere.
 Price for this product has gone up almost every year, but worth every penny. Mixes easily and taste great with milk!
 very nice
 Good product !!! Flavor is not so good!!!! But worth buying.
 Used to use gnc pro performance, this is definitely a step or two above in my opinion. Instantly mixes in a shaker and tastes amazing.
 Arrived in 2 days with prime. It's the real thing not misrepresented
 This is the first and only protein powder I have tried. I am not a body builder or even a heavy lifter, just an average woman trying to eat nutritiously and this helps me get my protein in. I use it in a smoothie every morning and it keeps me full for hours. This powder tastes great, blends beautifully in smoothies but it is also not bad just mixed into milk with a spoon. I would love to try other flavors but the chocolate is where it's at for me. The price here is great, too.
 This is the best protien I've tried. Tastes pretty good and mixes very well. This is now the only whey I buy
 Tastes great, mixes well. Would recommend!
 Tastes good, and doesn't have all of the filler ingredients contained in inferior products.  Worth the money if you are serious about nutrition.
 This is my favorite flavor of protein powder so far. Its chocolate taste is strong and doesn't taste/smell like weird preservatives the way some others do.
 no, it is not. but, great when you don't feel like eating a full meal or when you are in a hurry. good snack. quick. goes down easy. provides nutrition for your muscles.
 Great product definitely will buy again
 good product
 Ordered this item Saturday and got it Sunday morning...  No joke.  This was in the U.S mind you.  Amazing product.  Whole bag is resealable to keep protein fresh.  SUPER HAPPY
 One of the best and most tasty protein shakes that I have had. Being whey it is also a safe one and has good results.
 it's the flattest weak tasting protein drink of this type that I've tried. almost like they forgot to put the  chocolate and protein in.
 Having tried several other protein brands, I have to say that this one is my favorite so far. The powder actually mixes easily with water without leaving annoying clumps like in most cheaper brands. Taste-wise, I prefered Double Rich Chocolate over the 'Extreme Milk Chocolate' flavor (both mixed with water). It's hard to doubt the quality of the protein coming from this brand, they seem to know what they're doing in all aspects of their products, hence 5 stars.
 Clean low carb high protein Good stuff  not bad on taste will buy again for sure lasts a couple months
 love the protein, hate the bag. The zip lock didn't work on the bag, so had to keep something over it to ensure it was closed at all times.
 Worked as advertised.
 The double rich chocolate is amazing
 Great product!
 Amazing flavor and texture. One of the best I've tasted to date. Easy to mix with no clumping. Little on the sweet side but love it!
 Tastes great, high protein content, mixes quickly without clumping
 My regular protein.  Good quality.  No issues with digestion.  Taste is sometimes inconsistent but always decent in taste.
 Fair price.  Great tasting and low in cholesterol and sodium compared to competitors.  Great for smoothies/shakes.  You can also tastes better then competitors when drinking straight with water.
 Great product
 This product was good for two days but after that caused severe stomach pain, bowl irritation. I do not recommend this flavor to any one.
 Optimum nutrition is the best whey protein on the market. Overall great ingredients and tastes wonderful.
 it seems not that great,but it is good and tasty
 Ordered on Thursday and it was delivered Friday!  Excellent product
 Good flavor, price was  right. ON products  are the best!
 it is ok.
 Taste amazing
 too sweet! I'll try 2 chocolate next time@
 Upon opening the package, the protective seal was broken, lid was unscrewed, and protein powder was spilled all over! I attempted to fill out a request to return the product and was denied.
 After taking gold standard whey after my workout i've been taking 2 scoops after each workout and i have noticed the gains i've been making in my chest, arms, legs and stomach
 Mixes easily in shaker.
 It does help...
 best protein I've had yet
 Taste good with milk! Water is a little rough but if you do milk, cinnamon, peanut butter and chocolate  syrup it tastes incredible
 it last forever and it is good for working out. I had no problems with it, I just recommend chocolate because this one isnt good with just water, it is better with milk
 It mixes well and it tastes great!
 Does what it's says, and French Vanilla tastes great!
 I've been buying this whey protein mocha cappuccino for more than a year. It tastes good and not so sweet.
 Of all protein supplements this is my favorite. I might experience with different flavors, but two scoops + handful of walnuts + a cup of soy milk is an AMAZING shake. I got great gains from this as well, more so than the cheap stuff I used to buy from department stores.
 Great product. Great Quality, Great taste.
 Great quality protein!<br/><br/>This protein tastes great if you love chocolate, and lives up to the quality you would expect from Gold Standard protein.
 Has a good taste, and no bad aftertaste. Exactly what I was hoping for
 The Rocky Road flavor is the best thus far. This is the best Whey out there. I don't like the fact that the price has increased.
 Protein mixes well and doesn't clump as some other cheap quality brands do. Isn't the greatest tasting protein with water but its tolerable as proteins go. Worth the purchase and 10 pounds will last me plenty of time so I'm satisfied.
 Got the coffee flavor. It's beyond awesome
 Mixes great, tastes awesome. 10/10 would recommend
 Best tasting whey protein I've had before
 DO NOT BUY VANILLA ICECREAM. IT TASTES AWFUL
 Is good
 This protein is good quality and has a lot less fillers then most other proteins. I enjoy the amount of actual protein in it.
 This was delivered on time but had been opened when I took the loose lid off which was a BIG problem. It was the first time I ordered this product. I am not going to use it. I have ordered the Syntha-6 several times, each time well-sealed and full weight for the 2.91.  This container's contents were down several inches; however, I didn't weigh it. I don't want to have to pay to return it, but would like a replacement if you will send a voucher with return package.  I wouldn't send this publicly if I could see another option on the website.
 Everything in order, product was exactly as the description.
 Great tasting protein for a great price.  Has everything you need in it for building muscle in a healthy way.  Mixes great with a little bit of water.
 great product especially at such a low price
 This is a great protein powder!!! Love the chocolate flavor, the way it disolves easily
 Product was effective. Taste was good.
 Good protein.Taste is ok.
 I have had just about every flavor from optimum nutrition,The extreme milk chocolate is the best of all of them.The consistency is very creamy and the flavor is very rich in water.it tastes more chocolaty than the double rich chocolate.and its very easy on the stomach.
 I love this protein!! The taste is amazing! And it gave me some great results! Must buy if your trying to get lean mass.
 Lid/seal was broken. Not sure if it's original or fake.
 Expect the best. Great mixed with milk. Would buy more when I finish with this one. Satisfaction guaranteed, by me. hehe
 its fine but it didn't taste that i expected , anyway thank you Optimum Nutrition
 top!
 I've been buying this protein for over 6 years now and it never disappoints. High quality, awesome flavor and a nice high 80% protein count. Don't bother with anything else but this!!!
 This is my favorite protein powder, hands down.  Every ON product I've tried is top quality, but I think their protein powders are where they really shine.
 Among the Whey taste, I liked this one. Not too sweet and it tastes good to take it regularly.
 New vanilla ice cream flavor is disgusting! It was good for years. Why did they change it?
 Great Product
 Out of all the flavours I've tried chocolate molt is the favorite definitely recommend
 Great
 This is a very nice product. I have been using this from a really long time. And what better website to get this other than Amazon.
 Very good!
 wrong flavor
 Greek yogurt + a scoop of ON Protein Powder = protein packed chocolate pudding
 Great value and high quality. Mixes very well with water or milk. I love this vanilla creme flavor . I plan on trying most of them
 Very plain and not very chocolatey or minty but it gets the job done
 It's a good protein supplement with visible results.<br/>Definitely a recommendation.
 Great tasting protein
 I love making shakes with this whey protien ! All I do is add skim milk 2 ice cubs a scoop of whey a scoop of flax seed and a scoop if chia seed &amp; peanut butter! Blend it up in my mini blender and OMG yum! This protien is delicious!  ;)
 Great price for a crap load of lean protein from the best brand (aside from musclepharm). I always get chocolate or double rich.
 The flavor was good, and for the amount of servings the price was excellent!
 Nice flavor. Value for money. Got better results supplementing my workout with ON as against the previous one I used to buy from Walmart. Better quality protein that assimilates faster and more efficiently.
 Definitely the best tasting protein out there! Will definitely be restocking!
 I've been using Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard for 7 Months now and this product has not let me down. Best flavors right now are by far Mocha Cappuccino, Double Rich Chocolate and Cookies and Creme.
 This is a great deal. It tastes great and 10.5 pounds for $80, that's a heck of a deal. I got the dbl rich chocolate.
 Out of all the whey protein powders I have tried, this by far is the best. It doesn't give me the stomach disturbances the other wheys did and the recovery time is shorter with this product, which means, you can workout with better intensity. This is my favorite whey and will always use it. It tastes great too.
 Love it! I make a smoothie for breakfast every morning using the protein powder. Yum!
 great product for gains
 Always been my go to protein powder.
 This protein speaks for itself look at the sales figures! I've been using this for years.
 I would recommend this
 Mixes well, tastes pretty good.  I've many protein powders in the past and this is the best by far. Highly recommended.
 GREAT
 Flavor is great... Melts into water or milk like a charm!
 Optimum nutrition in my opinion has the best performing, best tasting protein on the market today. I don't mind paying a couple extra dollars for a great product. I know what I'm getting with ON and that is a great product.
 I buy this every time I need protein. Taste great! Best stuff by far that I have ever used!
 Great.
 The Gold Standard of whey protein, been using for years.
 It's a good source to meet lifters protein needs, and it also includes valuable amino acids. The taste could definitely be improved though that's the only drawback of this product.
 Great product, great price, great timely delivery.  This is a staple of my nutritional routine and I  appreciate the ease at which I can make sure I don't run out, at a fair price, without going to the mall.
 Great product very easy to use in shaker cup and use in food. Would and going to buy again!
 Great product and arrived quickly
 Always the best bang for your buck! Along with a good taste.
 It does not taste good. I have also tried the ice cream sandwich flavor and the extreme milk chocolate flavor. The extreme milk chocolate is my favorite out of these.
 Great product
 Coffee flavor tastes great, does it's job well. Price is decent.
 I love this protein powder and drink it after each workout.  The flavor is the best I have had and would highly recommend this product
 Excellent product. Will order again.
 Good stuff so far.
 Great stuff..recommended
 Best protein flavor hands down!  Tastes like a Starbucks Frappuccino
 I usually go with BSN Syntha 6 for protein but I chose gold standard this time because of the flavor. This powder mixes well and tastes great.
 Better than vanilla flavor for sure. Not very expensive.<br/><br/>Definitely would like to recommend. Very good source of protein, enjoy !!
 First off, idk why ON has pretty much become the standard whey supp for weight lifters and strength training. I suppose marketing prob has a lot to do with it and the fact that most muscle heads seem to hang on every word the buff guy at the gym says. I too saw all the reviews and figured, THIS is what everyone is taking and they seem to like it, so I will too. Then, I hate to say it bc I'm not an old lady or a watcher of Dr Oz, but I happened to be flipping through the channels and Dr Oz had a show on protein powders and they tested several, ON was one that didn't have in it what they advertised. Big surprise, a supp co that didnt have in it what they say is in it. Kinda pissed me off tho, so I bought a different brand, one they said had what they advertised, (I'll leave it out so Im not accused of being a company pitchman). So, the new brand needs 2 scoops for 1 serving, but at least I know im getting what I pay for AND it tastes way better than ON, actually tastes like choc. I also bought a shaker cup and didnt want to waste the ON I had left, and after shaking up the ON I found it chalky and disgusting. apparently the more its mixed the crappier it tastes. Gold standard my ass, company is a rip-off, strait up! I'll never buy another one of their products, and the HMB I bought sucks too, about 1/4 of the capsules were cracked and destroyed and spilled all through the bottle but that's a different review, which I already posted. bottom line, company sucks.
 delicious muscle juice.
 its good
 Good stuff. Pricey, but good!
 This stuff is pretty much your standard chocolate protein powder and is pretty good. However I recommend checking out the extreme milk chocolate flavor, it tastes way better.
 Love this product. The flavor is great and it really helps with recovery.
 Good Product and has better Output.
 Best flavor from optimum nutrition-extreme milk chocolate. Easy mix!!
 Best drink around
 Always a great product.  Used for years.
 Loved it!
 This is by far the best protein has 10% more servings compared to other brands I feel it helps reduce soreness from weight training Tasty easy to blend with your favorite fruit I recommend it
 Best flavor! Tastes delicious with water or milk.
 Excellent taste
 Very good happy medium protien. PLEASE WHATEVER YOU DO, DONT TRY THE CARAMEL TOFFEE - INSTANT TICKET TO TASTEBUD HELL! Worst tasting flavor experienced. Banana cream, strawberry banana, chocolate, delicious straberry are all very good.
 The taste isn't bad at all.  To me, I can barely taste the chocolate when I mix it with water.  No after taste either.  I drink it like water after working out at the gym, and I feel slightly better knowing that my muscles are getting the protein they need.
 No,1
 Best taste ever!
 Got the chocolate coconut, not a favorite flavor.
 The best protein shake I have ever tried. Might need to get used to taste.
 The product's taste is weird I tried many but I have not tried as bad as this product, I really cant drink it
 Protein is protein. This product is easy to mix, taste good, and its protein. What else do you need? Quality wise I would say it is a bang for the buck. Affordable with quality. Not many other company can have this.
 Good product
 This stuff sucks period. There is now way there's 5 grams of bcaas in there. My recovery time dropped while taking this I'm doing 2 scoops at a time just so I can use it up and switch back to muscle pharm combat powder. Save ur money and buy muscle pharm at costco 5 pounds for 42.99. Also it does not stay with u after taking as a shake or putting it in with my smoothies I'm hungry within 30 minutes. Combat powder by itself without being in a smoothie will last me at least 1.5 hours
 Love it
 Exactly what the description says
 Tastes delicious with milk!
 The best whey protein by price
 My favorite protein powder it tastes great and mixes very easily.
 I ordered this because it was one of the few brands/ flavors that did not use sucralose. Well guess what, they do! The listing here on Amazon is incorrect.<br/><br/>Be aware the new formula does contain sucralose!!!<br/><br/>I’ll be returning this as I don’t want that crap in my body.
 I received this item much earlier than it said I would, which was very nice.  And to my surprise, it is HUGE! I know it says 5 pounds but i wasn't expecting it to be THAT big! This will last me a very long time. Worth the money.
 Great!!
 double rich chocolate is just great<br/>it taste good with milk , reasonable taste with water<br/>you might notice that flatulent smell nasty sometimes
 Awesome price. Great Flavor.  Decent taste with water, but even better with Almond Milk or Skim Milk. Will buy again!!
 I always venture out to try and find new protein powders, but always end up back with ON Gold Standard in Extreme Chocolate Milk. It's the best flavor AND the only protein powder I've found that dissolves without a blender bottle. I throw a scoop in a cold water bottle and shake it up and it mixes so smoothly. Highly recommend for convenience and flavor.
 Good stuff but I'm go back to chocolate flavor..
 Great taste, good formula/ingredients, but gave it four stars because the scooper is a PITA to find when it first arrives.
 Great product. Love the taste and packaging was good. Will order another one with some different taste may be. Love it !!!!!
 Good
 As expected
 Can't go wrong with ON's 100% Whey, anyone whos serious about lifting and working out most likely uses this protein source.
 My morning post-workout coffee alternative
 Tastes good and mixes well
 Tastes awful but it works.
 This tastes absolutely fantastic.  I have tasted this version and the double rich chocolate.  I won't be buying the Double Rich chocolate any more.  I much prefer this flavor.  Also, the price was right @ 52 bucks.
 Tastes great and works well.
 Mix-ability is great. Taste is good 7/10. Great product for the price.
 It was perfect
 Works good seen results fast
 Excelente
 I love this protein. Great buy.
 Great condition, and no hassle. Just wish I would've gone with another flavor!
 No complaints!
 Delicious. I highly recommend this or Rocky Road.
 Take it everyday
 Great taste, easy to mix. However, could taste better with water. Gold standard never fails to at least meet expectations for the price, for whey in specific, I believe they have gone beyond your standard protein.
 This is the best protein whey in my eyes. Double chocolate tastes the best.
 Tastes like hot chocolate and it's great!! But I think I'll try the vanilla kind next time
 Most delicious protein we have used.
 Gives me heartburn.  I've been using different protein powder brands and decided to try Optimum due to their rating.  Bad idea.  Don't recommend it. I'm going back to my old brands.
 good taste and mixes easier than most
 Really love the taste.  Good stuff here. Lots of pro's use this brand.
 I don't want to knock it, but its not may favorite. I will try the chocolate next after I use up all this large container.  The quantity is great for the money. Just not big on the taste of the Cookies and Cream....
 I like the chocolate mint with skim milk after my workout. Good protein and I feel great! Would definitely recommend!
 Drink a scoop with water after every workout, makes the workout feel complete. I like how big the bottle is, and it tastes pretty good (vanilla ice cream). I didn't give it a 5 because i have not seen the results, Ive only been taking it for two weeks.
 Rocky road is my all time favorite flavor
 Great product, you know what to expect getting it. Flavorful and packed with protein
 I've been using this product for the past 5 years or so and I've always been satisfied. I paid a little more this time though because the previous vendor did not have it available. It's still worth it.
 Love it great for suplementing
 Best-tasting protein powder I've come across!
 The taste was a little off but it still is strawberry banana and mixes well with milk. The price was also excellent for a 5 lb container.
 Absolutely perfect blend of isolates and concentrates.  I got the chocolate malt and it's delicious.  Spot on with the malt flavor and mixes very well.  Optimum is a very solid company.  Very fast shipping.  Thanks amazon
 This is the whey to go
 It was fantastic
 This taste really goood and mixes easily in my blender bottle it taste like chocolate milk.
 As Expected
 Great taste!
 good taste
 I like many of the other flavors, but this one is almost unpalatable. The gritty "cookie" crumbles aren't appealing at all.
 Good taste not better than casein chocolate supreme but theyre different types of protein .. This is the best whey protein ive had and it seems to do the job with 24g of protein per scoop/serving :)
 Taste good
 Tasty !
 My wife and I use this product in our shakes after we go to the gym.  It tastes great and it keeps us from feeling sore the next day.
 Perfect
 Mixes well, tastes great and I see results!
 O&amp;N Is The Top Choice For Me I Have Always Used This For Whey Protein NOt Only Is It Great On Taste But They Many Flavors That Is What I Love The Most..
 Good product
 Good
 It might be little expensive on Amazon as most things are. However, I am completely satisfied with the product as it was pretty consistent and better than the previous whey product I had bought from GNC or one of the stores.
 good
 Pure whey protein. I blend it with a banana. Great taste. Like a chocolate milk shake :)
 Already made a difference. I feel like I am loosing weight. The banana cream flavor taste great. I would highly recommend it to anyone.
 My son loves it
 👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽
 Fake counterfeit protein batch number was scratched off and inner safety seal was not intact!!! I don't know about others but I don't like giving away my money for a false product. I now went back to ordering from bodybuilding.com after this rip off!
 Not the worst, not the best
 It's good. Your muscle would be built up as soon.
 This is by far the best tasting protein on the market. 5/5
 Been using this product and I've liked it and I received the product on time.
 Arrived on time. Happy as always!
 Too slow
 I love the taste and it mixes very well
 WARNING CAKE BATTER WILL MAKE YOU GAG!! I honestly can't believe they would sell this without a taste test I didn't even finish cake batter as the taste was too horrible instead a purchased a different protein my times with ON are over very bad product
 It was delivered a full day before the expected delivery date. Awesome! Oh yeah, protein is good too.
 Very tasty...mixes well with milk by simply stirring with a spoon...I use it once daily....sometimes twice if I have a serious workout...
 Tastes so good!
 Is a good quality product
 Best whey protein in the market
 Excelente
 First off, I do not use protein shakes in order to build muscle/exercise.  I have been using them as a 1-2 time per day meal replacement.  Used Muscle Milk for a month and loved it.  It mixed well and tasted good.<br/><br/>At the recommendation of a co-worker who works out, I tried Gold Standard.  He said it was just as good (taste-wise) and did not contain as much of the bad stuff in Muscle Milk (see Consumer Reports review from 2010).<br/><br/>I has hopeful that this would be as good as Muscle Milk.  I was wrong.  Very wrong.<br/><br/>The product's taste is not even close.  I had the Double Chocolate, but it was hardly chocolatey.  It also does not have a thick of a consistency as Muscle Milk.  Finally, my major gripe is that the powder did not mix well at all.  I tried everything.  There were always large, disgusting clumps.<br/><br/>Bottom line, if taste is your priority, this is not the stuff you should purchase.
 This stuff really works and tastes great.  This is the third brand of protein shake I have tried, and it's by far the best I've used so far.  Great value for an awesome product that really speeds the bulking process.
 Very good product.  Mixes well in both the blender and the shaker.  Grood flavor...even better with milk and peanut butter.
 Rocky road is a good chocolate alternative to switch up to. I know it's hard to try a new flavor but I haven't been disappointed with any of thier flavors yet.
 Easy ... Does the job !
 Came on time. Smells bad but tastes good when mixed in smoothie with fruits.
 delicious and nutritious
 Flavor was slightly chalky
 Great product, Awesome taste. The best of the best. 73 servings for the price and quality, cannot beat it
 Great product good price
 Great product! Definitely recommend to anyone trying to get fit.
 Mixes easily. Good taste.
 Great product!!
 My favorite protein !
 I love this!!!
 tastes good and helps put on weight. perfect for college football players who need good weight.  Recommended by strength coach.
 it tastes good. However I was a bit surprised/disappointed that it does not contain a round scoop in it. When I purchased the other brand a while ago, it did contain a scoop.
 Awesome product to use as meal replacement or after a hard work out. I've tried a lot of of protein shakes in the past and I have to admit that this has to be on of the best tasting ones.
 Great fast-acting protein source at a great value. I'm a repeat purchaser. I've tried a few different flavors and found Extreme Milk Chocolate to be my absolute favorite! Awesome taste!
 awesome!
 I think ON is somewhat overpriced due to its wide popularity. I would be conservative selecting new flavors as a lot of them seem dissapointing. I would go for all-time classic Vanilla and Cookies and Cream. Chocolate is somewhat weak. FYI taste is always richer when protein is mixed with milk
 I ordered the Rocky Road flavor, and it is horrible.
 I like it...  Good flavor, good ingredients...
 good quality, a bit of a heavy scoop tho so maybe just fill it most of the way up the scooper but not all the way.
 I like this product, has a good taste and I'm watching results... I will need other in a few months...
 This stuff is awesome, works great after workouts and it taste really good (ChocolateMInt). I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great protein.
 This product has a great flavor. I am so satisfied.<br/>I have a glass of this every morning for breakfast.<br/>What a great way to start my day!
 Whey protein with that goes great after a workout or mixed in with a protein shake. Taste like mint chocolate. Comes with a scoop.
 Love the flavor!
 This whey is by far the best ive tasted, the double chocolate is really good, and thats with water cause im at a low carb diet IMAGINE with wilk the taste would be way better
 Taste great with anything even water will stay with this product and works as should. And Thanos Amazon for always fast delivery.
 Great protein. Great buy!
 GAINS! Getting Swole with the perfect supplement!
 This was the first time using this product and it was awesome.  I just used cold water so there were no added calories.  Just ordered my second container.
 researched many alternatives,  found this, no going back, chocolate malt is amazing
 OMG I love this product it's really easy to use and very helpful thanks!
 Quality quick service. A vast variety of flavor selection.<br/>Recommend to others who are in search of the best Whey Protein
 Gym food that gives me gains.
 Awesome and I'm loyal
 This stuff tastes great and I have more energy in the morning when I take it the night prior (before bed).
 love it
 As described
 This was a great value for a quality protein powder. The taste wasn't quite as good as the previous product I had used, but good enough to make it worth purchasing again. For price per serving and flavor, this product is definitely worth it.
 It's taste very good
 This is an excellent and tasty protein powder with no gritty after taste. Use it in my coffe and smoothies. It does not upset my stomach and great for pre and post workouts. Excellent!
 Great product. Fast shipping.
 I love this flavor!  The best protein shake
 Works well as a meal replacement and taste great.
 Chocolate toffee is a decent flavor, cake batter is gross, and cinnomin graham cracker is the best.
 Nice ingredients, bad taste, sucks to mix with ice.
 I loved it. The flavor is delicious
 best taste!
 This is the best deal you'll find for this high quality protein. The price is extremely competitive and the product is vacuumed sealed in a bag. This will be what I will be buying as long as I can!
 It's protein, it's cheap and mixes easily. Seems to be easy to digest, the vanilla ice cream isn't the greatest but flavor isn't really important to me.
 Great product!
 The great quality of Optimum Nutrition combined with the best flavor I've tasted (Vanilla Ice Cream). Only con is the price, but it's worth it.
 Tastes fresh. Speedy delivery
 This flavor goes into solution much easier than extreme milk chocolate, chocolate mint, or mocha cappuccino.  The taste is a bit weak, but not terrible.
 Just what I expected to get.  Good bargain as opposed to walking into a GNC and paying $75 or more.
 The main reason I bought this was because the reviews online were near-stellar for this protein.  I ALWAYS do research before buying anything and protein was no exception.  I like this stuff, it tastes dandy, and I'm sure all the ladies notice the difference! ;) *ZING*<br/><br/>Here is my favorite recipe that I put this Whey in:<br/><br/>1 avacado<br/>1/2 cup of soy milk (vanilla flavored will blow your mind)<br/>1/4 cup of organic sugar (I use less normally, and if the avocado is wicked ripe I almost half the sugar)<br/>1/4 tablespoon of vanilla extract (liquid vanilla flavoring basically)<br/>THEN...<br/>I add about a 3/4 scoop of this Gold Standard Whey<br/>and SOMETIMES add a half scoop of Juice+ powder (if I do this, I cut back on the sugar even more)<br/><br/> I normally double everything as to only dirty my blender just once every 2 days]<br/><br/>... put all of this strait into a blender, blend (obviously), and pour into something to set in the fridge for 30 minutes or so to get a nice chill on it. When you come back to your shake you'll have a GORGEOUS yogurty-textured blend of delicious, and more importantly healthy, protein milk shake.<br/><br/>Happy workouts and stay healthy. :)
 I love the product itself it's the best protein powder I have personally tried. The flavor was okay, next time I'll probably stick to ordering the chocolate.
 Everything as advertised
 I use Gold Standard Whey as both a protein shake and a meal replacement.  I started using the product a few months ago and have seen major gains since then.  The taste is pretty much what you expect from a protein supplement--I just mix with water because I'm not very picky.  In water, the protein dissolves pretty quickly.  I don't have a shaker so I just put it in a cup and stir with a fork--I let it sit for 2-3 minutes to make sure any small clumps dissolve, but clumping is relatively minimal with this compared to other products I've used.
 I looooove the flavor. But If you're planning to add protein to your smoothies I'd recommend to go for the vanilla flavor instead.
 I love this. Good taste. Not chalky. Easy to drink.
 Sweeter than what I prefer.
 The product mixes well with a small amount of milk.  It taste great and has worked well as a meal replacement.  After I drimk it I stay full for a while and it does not make me feel bloated like some products. Will buy again!
 food good.
 excelent , 100% results. im diabetic type-2 and help me a lot with hi sugar blood levels.
 was delishe, i gained 43.75lbs of muscle in 5 years. thanks optimum nutrishe. i will be buying this product again
 Gold Standard is my go to protien.  Chocolate flavor is good.  If you want to spice a bit of your morning coffee, throw in a bit of this stuff for a knock-off mocha.
 The product arrived on time without any damages.
 it taste good yes
 All of the flavors I have tried taste great! The powder mixes very well with anything (I use coconut milk). Of all of the protein powders I have used, ON Whey Gold is by far the best based on flavor, mixability, quality and price.
 The container was open and not sealed.
 Great taste! Can't wait to try others! Came in mail couple weeks back fast. The only issue was the scoop which i didn't know was there till i was half way done with it.
 eh.
 ON protein is the best out there. Good price for 10 lbs. I think it will last long enough to get some pounds. I always buy this brand.
 Good
 It has a great flavor
 Good taste and good quality.  It was highly recommended by my good friend and trainer.  He said this was the best on the market today.
 Always delish any flavor!
 Best shake I've tasted so far.
 Great taste
 Well worth the 5 Ibs when on sale! Makes dieting and exercise easier with a good quality protein and motivation booster!
 Fast shipping, big container so it lasts long. Chocolate flavor is really good. I can see results, protein helps refuel your muscles. Great product, thanks !
 Great favor! I got milk chocolate
 I love this protein. It taste really good. and mixes with water very well. I do it for the gains and I believe you should too!
 I love it. It really does make a difference
 whey protein really helps my workout. the added glutamine is a great bonus.
 The product I received was exactly as ordered, and arrived earlier than expected! I am extremely satisfied with the product and it tastes great as well. I will definitely buy this product again!
 thanks
 I love the flavor 👍🏽
 that product is amazing! i'm love 100% whey '
 Good taste.
 Just a good, simple whey product you can always count on.  The 10lbs bag is very convenient and cost effective.
 Before buying this product, I have gone through multiple whey proteins. This one trumps them all.<br/>Nutritionally, it has the least amount of cholesterol of any whey protein on the market, as well as having less than 1 gram of saturated fats(.5g).<br/>Taste-wise, ON 100% Whey Extreme Milk chocolate IS thee best tasting whey protein product on the market. Honestly, I thought it tasted just like a CHOCOLATE MILKSHAKE?!?! No desert for me anymore, just ON Milk Chocolate 100% Whey.<br/><br/>PS: Always mix Whey with milk... NOT water.
 the best protein out there tastes amazing, chocolate mint flavor is one of my favourites, stay away from cookies and cream
 Tried Double Rich Choclate. Had it post workouts. My muscles are so much better toned now
 Amazing
 tastes good.  purchased for grandson.
 Great product.
 I have gone through several different types of protein and this one, by far was the best.  It blends up immediately and has a good flavor with great results.
 Good taste and helps restore muscles well
 I can't believe how well this stuff dissolves in milk. One day I forgot to put my ball in the bottle and I couldn't even tell a differences in clumps. Also tastes damn good with chocolate milk.
 Great taste and good price. Clean and simple
 This is our second order on this product.  It has been beneficial  to me and my wife to keep us going and able to do all the things we want to do and places to go.<br/><br/>In fact, we have a standing order to ship every other month.
 Yes there are better proteins out there but for the price and taste I would just stick with this for the normal non competitive builders. Most flavors are good with water and even better with milk.
 It was a great buy but it doesn't taste like the previous ones I've bought from the store.
 I love this stuff! I originally bought the Strawberry, which is good but gets quite old fast. I personally added Truvia to mine because I liked it a bit sweeter. But this time I ordered the milk chocolate to try something new and IT'S DELICIOUS! I don't even have to add any sweetener!<br/>Also, you aren't going to find a better deal for 5 lbs of whey, especially with the subscribe and save option. Even on bodybuilding.com.
 Great product, thank you.
 Good stuff!
 Quality protein, great taste.
 Five stars!
 Very good product
 I don't like the flavor.
 If you like banana laffy taffy, this is for you. It is the easiest mixing powder I have used.
 Great stuff !
 Aweome!!!
 It's really great. Helped me a lot.
 Awesome product, delivers exactly what they promise. Prompt delivery, very impressed.
 I bought it for my brother and he told me the protin is useful and amazing taste
 Great protein source and after taste is not too bad
 Good product and you can't beat the price ! Will be buying again when  I run out.
 Excellent product
 expensive,but no fake
 Taste is very good.
 Exactly what I asked for :)
 Very pleasant chocolate flavor.
 Have used this product for 6 months along with muscle toning exercises and cardio workouts at the gym.  Great results, better than protein shakes provided by MD through weight loss program
 Good for work-out activities<br/>Recommend for all age-use
 All good. Will reorder. Good value
 Item pretty blah but item is whey protein isolate blend
 I ordered this protein with advice from a friend. After a few days of use I feel I can give it a solid thumbs up. The taste is amazing. I got the delicious strawberry and I feel it was named properly. I take it after every workout and I feel great the following day. Hopefully this continues. Great buy and I highly recommend. If this was helpful please tell me
 It doesn't smell good, but the taste is just okay. I think I'll try another kinda flavor for the next time.
 You truly can not be the flavor of this whey protein. It is delicious and can be used in baked goods or on top of cereal to add an extra bit of protein.
 Tastes good and really helps with my muscle recovery
 Fast delivery , good product .
 This item has a great taste and it is actually a good way to put on some muscle. I only gave it 4 stars because i  had ordered 3 of these at one time but one of them arrived later than the first two.
 Excellent protien
 I mix with skim milk in a blender and it mixes well.<br/>I like the ingredients as compared to others (sugar etc.)
 GOLD STANDARD
 The Best<br/>Dissolves quickly.<br/>I like this flavor because it tastes really good even if mixed with water.
 Superb taste and mixes well even with a spoon. Mix it with milk and you're set. Delicious. Get huge the safe and 'natural way'
 Great taste great results
 Im not a fan of the flavor but I love this protein and simple yet very effective protein and plenty of it.
 Good cheap protein.
 excelente
 The extreme milk chocolate is just delicious!
 Great Product for the price
 Great taste, great results. This is one of the best protein powders available.<br/><br/>Fast shipping. The best place to purchase this item is on Amazon.com
 What more is there to say? When I want whey I go with the gold standard of protein. I prefer that Vanilla Creme simply because my biceps love vanilla but that's irrelevant. It mixes well, it has superior taste, and its a good amount to keep me going for a while before I need to buy again. 5 out of 5.
 Best protein for the money and the taste is great
 it tastes like a caramel chocolate drink of amazingness.
 this protein is very delicious!! but it should equal 2 5LB containers but it doesn't. maybe because it goes down when its still shipping. but i would recommend
 It does the job.
 I look forward to drinking my daily shakes.  They really help me feel fuller, too.  I think this is the best shake for the best price out there.
 great taste and not a lot of carbs and garbage in it.
 The powder flavor tastes great, albeit very sweet. I had to contact the manufacturer to get the serving size, as it is not labeled on the product (aside from 1 scoop, 31 grams), and they sent me a scoop.
 Best on the market. Hands down
 Tastes bad
 Sometimes, after drinking it I feel  nauseous. The strawberry flavor is too unsavoury for me.
 Arrived RIGHT on time and there was no damage! Got the chocolate flavor, it taste really great after a great workout!
 Big chill
 It is good protein to consider price, and quantity also is good. I've comsumed it for 4 weeks, so I'm not sure how it works to me, but it'll be better to comsume this.
 I'm a nerd and I'm cheap so correct me if I'm wrong but I did the math and of the top brands: syntha-6  4.7¢/g, muscle milk 4.2¢/g, and gold standard 3.2¢/g of protein. Making this the least expensive of the 3.. In case you're interested in that kind of scheisse.
 Love the extreme chocolate and banana cream. The French vanilla is rather tasteless
 The avor is too sweet.
 It started to smell very bad after a while
 You van observe your body growing in muscle about a month
 Rocky Road flavor doesn't taste as good as someone said - it's too sweet even with one rounded scoop per 12 oz of 1% milk.
 Great! The product was on time. Really good taste. Probably the best cheapest protein out there.
 great results must get
 I've tried this same brand of Whey in vanilla and tropical fruit... not a fan.  The vanilla was fake and way too strong. The tropical fruit a little better but nothing to write home about.<br/><br/>This stuff though is awesome.<br/><br/>What I do is get a big 64oz mug, fill it a third of the way with ice, then water till it is above the ice, then 2 bananas. Blend it all until the I stop hearing the ice break, pour in a scoop of the whey, blend for a few more seconds. Done, great tasting smoothie, 24 grams of protein (plus whatever is in the bananas). Maybe I should try milk instead of water... hmmm....<br/><br/>I'm not a bodybuilder really, I am just trying to get in shape, and while I don't know how much the whey is doing for me I have put on a lot of muscle since I started using it.
 Good flavor and easy to drink
 Liked this product, but prefer the all natural. Has a little different taste than I am use to. Like the double chocolate flavor.
 I drink mine with skim milk (so i can't speak for how it tastes with water) but it tastes just like a drink you would get at a coffee shop. 5 Stars in my book ON never disappoints
 The taste was horrible, it sound good looked good also smelled good but unfortunately, mixing it with water or milk was not at all enjoyable.  On the other hand have tried Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard, Extreme Milk Chocolate, the taste of this flavor incredible had you count seconds until your next scope!
 It mixes easily with a spoon and tastes great. A high quality source of protein, I drink it in low fat milk for a quick snack or as a meal replacement.
 Extreme Milk Chocolate is the best tasting Optimum Nutrition Protein Powder ever!
 The delivery of the item itself was amazing. Very fast and well done with packaging. I look forward to trying this whey protein out. I've read some great stuff relating to it! Definitely a buy off Amazon and can NOT go wrong with the price.
 This protein sets the benchmark for all other whey proteins.
 Extreme Milk Chocolate tastes great, mix it with 1% milk.
 Very good taste with milk
 Not fond of this one.
 Good stuff
 I did not feel strong-flavored protein
 Great Price. Great taste. Great mixing. Great results. All around great, I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a true quality pre- or post-workout protein.
 I don't work out too much just 3 days a week but i started taking this stuff everyday and now i'm pretty jacked
 Good
 I mix this with Vanilla Almond Milk (the 30 calorie stuff) and it makes the most unbelievably great tasting shake ever!  My biggest problem, and it is huge, is that it tastes way too good and I think I am going to have bad problems if I can't stop drinking too much of it every day!
 Great taste. Shipped quickly.
 Great buy
 beats other brand i purchased, but next one will be in chocolate and likely like it better<br/>thanks for soliciting!
 I'm lactose intolerant and of course I bought a 5lb tub. A few reviewers said that they were okay taking this and I figured since it contains lactase I'd be fine. I took this product and was in so much pain for 2 hours it was unreal, I don't think it was because of lactose but rather some milk proteins that I might be allergic too. The thing is I didn't know I would be allergic to them, if you're lactose intolerant I wouldn't chance it. It is not worth the pain. I gave this 3 stars because it really is a great protein source and is a great supplement, I just wish I didn't buy it knowing that I can't take it now.
 very good product quality, meets all my expectations. Is just what I was looking for I work out every day and this product is excellent for growth and recovery
 Good protein!
 Great product. Tastes good, and actually has the amount of protein in it that is claimed on the package.
 Great tastes mixes well great gains
 The taste, the cost, and the quality can't be beat
 As much as I like this product, what is with the sudden price increases? Even within the same day: $58, $60, now tonight $63? Jeez.
 5 stars for the product ! Have always had a great experience with ON products !
 Great product and tastes great!
 Rocky road is the best!
 My tub was cracked
 Tastes terrible but good protein and this will make your blender bottle smell like dead animals if you don't clean it out and etc.
 Ordered the delicious strawberry, the taste was not what I was expecting. I don't know if my bottle was bad but it was extremely hard to drink. I have purchased other whey protein brands in the past and this was the worst strawberry flavor.
 Great taste, great nutrition, great product!
 Currently using malt chocolate flavor.  Absolutely stunning  taste !!
 I bought one with delicious strawberry flavor. Its taste is really good when I prepare the shake with milk.
 It is hard to find protein powder that I like the flavor of.  This is my favorite so far.  After shipping and handling it was a little more than I wanted to pay though.
 Extreme Milk chocolate might be the best flavor.
 Cake Batter flavor in my opinion taste very good when mixed with chocolate milk.  Gold Standard whey mixes better than any other brand I have tried.
 Love this whey protein!
 Great taste!!
 Great Product.
 I use a blender and add water, ice, one banana and peanut butter, and it comes out great. Good bang for your buck.
 Taste so great when mixing with milk.
 Love it!
 Awesome Product Thanks
 good delivery, cookies and cream flavor is great
 awesome taste and shipped quickly!
 I've been using it for a long a time.  I only take on scoop though, each night, because otherwise i would gain much fat.  It has a nice blend of protein and bcaas plus glutamine.  Unlike some other protein products, this one doesn't make you gain fat easy, unless you down many scoops a day.  My favourite flavour is cookies and cream.  The smell of cookies and cream is very pleasant and catches attention at home.  The product arrived on time and much earlier than expected.
 Have to hide from my wife and middle son. They like it too!
 I have tried several protein powders but ON Gold Standard is now my goto powder.  The coffee flavor has a good flavor without any aftertaste but it is a little mild for coffee lovers.  I have found that adding a little instant coffee makes for a little more robust flavor and adding some chocolate flavored protein mix really makes it taste like a Frappuccino.  I actually look forward to drinking it.  I usually mix with milk but it is pretty good with water but with skim milk it is excellent.  I have also tried the Mocha Cappuccino and it is good but I prefer the coffee with some chocolate mixed in.
 Tastes great, quality protein.
 Great purchase
 Tastes great, mixes great &amp; it's cheap. It's perfect.
 Excellent taste, great price for the poundage, good macros and mixes very well.
 I am very happy with my protein shake
 Milk chocolate is incredible... I am excited to workout JUST so I can drink this.
 Awesome! It came early than expected too. It is a great product. When I let people try it they get made at because they thought I just gave them a a chocolate shake. Taste great!
 This tastes really good. Compared to Dymatize, it dissolves better in water. Overall it is pretty good protein powder and one of the bests in its class.
 Goes well with milk, soy milk, water, etc.  Can add ice cream, peanut butter, etc. for flavor.  Good for after workouts.
 Tolerable taste. It dissolves quickly and with no crumbs. Best I ever had.
 Tastes awesome. Love it
 Great product!
 All good!
 Love the product, white chocolate is good. At first I didn't love the flavor but after using it for a week or two it's really grown on me.
 Better than any other way flavor I've tasted, in my opinion.
 Awesome
 Best Protein Supplement Ever I I just started using it a month ago and OMG i see the results NOW. Soo good
 The best whey available at a fantastic price . . . the big bag lasts for a long time so I don't have to make purchases every month
 Buen producto
 Great quality whey protien.
 Tastes great and has a lot of powder.
 Its a decent product and tastes good - I am hoping its healthy and low on fat and sugar as well - though I am not completely sure.
 Mine also didn't come with the snooping thing
 Tastes great, one of the best protein out there
 It is solid product that I trust.
 This review for the Banana Cream Flavor and may be updated when I have finished the 5 pounds<br/><br/>This protein tastes great with milk - regular or chocolate milk - and tastes fine with water. Definitely follow directions for blending because otherwise it may remain chunky and that is not great in terms of health and does not taste great either. Have not had anything to complain about with this protein. It does it's job, it tastes great, and has a scoop which is a great guide to serving size.
 contrary to popular belief the cookies and cream flavor in fact does not suck, it tastes very good in my opinion. great tasting stuff, high quality, thumbs up yo
 this item does NOT come with a scoop!!! So disappointing! You think something this expensive would come would a scoop! Well, not buying a second one for sure!
 This stuff taste great
 Taste is ok. I had vanilla ice cream. Golden standard is a really good protein itself.
 Love it !
 try is definitely better than the standard chocolate one but i will probably try cookies and cream next time around
 We have used Optimum Nutrition Whey for some time and have enjoyed the extreme milk chocolate.  We decided to try the white chocolate and have been very happy with the flavor.  We plan to order it again.
 All I can say is that I ordered a white chocolate and it is delicious.  If mixed with milk, it could be sold weather people are interested in the the protein or not.  Also, I am always interested in ordering from the best company, and I am definitely found  it.  Very good reputation amongst those who use proteins shakes, and I definitely recommend it, at least the white chocolate
 taste good
 Love this. Great taste. Shipped fast too
 Item arrived safely and as advertised.  I've been using this for years.
 Great Product!
 Great bang for your buck, don't have to sacrifice money for great taste!!
 Great combination of ingredients and total protein content per scoop. Was looking to substitute an expensive whey protein product and found it. Reasonably priced, very tasty and good overall.
 Delicious.
 Good stuff. Tastes great.
 Tastes very good
 My son loves this stuff.
 Delivered in time<br/>Great product
 Great product,
 As a personal trainer, I eat alot of protein - 250-300 grams a day. I know my protein. This is the best. It mixes well, it has both whey isolate and whey concentrate, contains a complete amino acid complex, very few carbs, and tastes great! Other brands lack in at least one of these areas, and if they are equal, are much more expensive. I recommend this brand and flavor to all my clients.
 Great after workout, taste good<br/><br/>the price is very reasonable for a high end protein shake, was recommend to me and now i recommend to everyone
 I've haven't been using it for very long, so I can't say much about results. But this stuff is absolutely delicious. My friend has it in chocolate and he's gotten pretty big. So I decided to buy it. I recommend it to anyone.
 The flavor of this powder is awesome. I never get tired of the taste even when I drink 3 or 4 a day.
 Great product!
 This protein is the standard of the industry. I do prefer the other vanilla flavor. Buy this stuff here for the best price!
 Great taste, awesome product!!
 The best in protein powder. I love this stuff. Use milk, don't use milk. Either way you're going to be just fine. Mixes easily enough, tastes better than you think it would. Don't mix it with soy milk though cause soy milk is gross - the powder would be fine though.
 Is not clearly labeled on the web as having artificial sweeteners. Look for the natural version if you want to avoid artificial sweeteners and associated taste.
 Great quality of whey protein that is good for post-workout fuel. Has a great taste and fast absorbing liquid to maintain your muscle recovery
 Item came on time and it is a great product. Worth spending the extra money and get the 10lb bag. Save money and get the extra supply.
 First time getting Gold Standard, and I wasn't disappointed! Rocky Road flavor tastes amazing and mixes quite well. Definitely would recommend!
 Perfect
 This protein is top-notch stuff. You really cannot beat it. It has an excellent taste, mixes extremely well, and does exactly what you want 100% Whey Protein to do! If you see this stuff on sale, do NOT hesitate to pick it up! Take this stuff, and get huge like Arnold... GET TO ZE CHAHHPAAHH!!
 It's a very good product however I didn't like double rich chocolate. Maybe next time I'll go for the French vanilla creme
 This is the best protein by far!
 great
 This product is a very good supplement for beginners and intermediates!
 Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard, extreme milk chocolate is the best tasting protein drink I have ever had! I highly recommend this product. I mixed it with water and with milk and both were excellent.
 Probably went through a dozen of these over the years. Best bang for the buck protein. Tastes great, mixes well.
 This is a very good product for the price. It delivers a big protein bang for the buck and keeps fat and sugar to a minimum. The flavor is good when mixed with water and great with milk. Hard to go wrong with this stuff.
 great quality protein powder
 I like this since it is lower in total calories compared to similar items with the same amount of protein per scoop.  The chocolate taste is good and it mixes well with water, milk or fruit smoothies like cherry or raspberry.  Low cost per serving overall compared to other premium brands.
 taste great, I use in my morning smoothies.  Blends well.  Great value.
 Taste good!
 Excellent!
 Very good quality
 💪🏾
 Surprisingly good taste. I've tried many powders, and this one definitely is the best tasting. Tastes even better with milk, instead of water.
 A little too sweet which causes me to increase the liquid ratio to adjust for taste.  Otherwise, it's a decent deal.
 Great product. Arrived on time and dissolves easily in water. Great tasting.
 Great product, great cost for the quality. I have used this protein for well over a year now. I recommend anyone looking for a good quality protein to give this a try.
 good product, but you can get the same thing with $20 less in costco.
 Tastes great, great quality, will buy again!
 The services is not good. But the whey is great.
 GOOOOOD
 was very good
 Whey Gold Standard is the only Whey Protein I order and use. Every flavor I have tried has been excellent!
 Great!
 Very filling and has everything you want in a protein shake. The only thing I would change is the flavor I picked. Great value. Being a prime member really paid off.
 If you want to try and keep it natural and cut/lean muscle and weight. This is the one for you. (Swimmer for 5 years and it never fails)
 That's awesome but too big to me.
 Like the product, low carb, low fat, I think it's a 25g scoop with 24g of protein, good isolate to take throughout the day.
 pretty good stuff
 The best whey protein isolate out there
 Taste is gag inducing.
 It's great.
 taste good
 Great taste, great results!!!
 This has to be the best tasting whey protein sold by optimum... scratch that this is the best whey protein on the market....
 Does not taste very good. It mixes great, but it tastes like watered down chocolate milk.
 Good taste and mixes easy without chunks
 I like it. I like the Chocolate and the Vanilla. The strawberry SMELLED like strawberry but didn't TASTE like strawberry.
 Awesome taste! its very easy to drink with water or milk, the flavor is great and tastes just like a shake no matter what flavor.
 I have tried quite a few different products, but none of them even come close to this one. Easily the best Whey Protein on the market.
 It taste great and have seen results from taking this. The best protein in quality and quantity
 I don't like it, taste and texture are really terrible.
 The Product arrived correctly! everything was perfect!
 Great product, good value! Have used this product for years, was never let down. This flavor in particular, in my opinion, is the best out there.
 Great value and quick delivery.  I won't buy this product anywhere else
 This is the best tasting protein I have ever purchased. I look forward to my post workout shake everytime. Optimum Gold Vanilla Cream is where its at!
 Works as I expected!
 Great product, high concentration of protein per scoop (24g per 30g scoop) and best deal you can find
 Good protein, good tastes and helps with recovery
 Tastes great.  The sample Pre-Workout was a nice touch
 Great for meal replacement when running low on time!
 Great product and tastes great. Fast shipping and I'm definitely a repeat customer. Thanks.
 I've been using this protein for 2 years now. Love the taste and the results! Definitely the most bang for your buck when it comes to protein!
 So far so good:)
 Perfect product
 Ilike it
 Tastes really good and it is very filling.
 Tastes great, mixes very well.<br/>Pretty low carb and fat which is crucial and with ON you know you're getting whats on the label.
 Taste good in water but haven't tried it in milk yet but I'm sure will taste better in milk. Product sells itself good gains.
 Best whey ever, I can put it in my oatmeal or yogurt.....so good!
 This whey protein tastes good (i mixed with water which is consider optimal for fast absorption) and mixes well. You can't go wrong with this protein powder.
 Tastes great, and is easy to mix.  I'm very happy with it.  Arrived quickly and in excellent condition.  I've continued to have excellent experience with ON.
 This stuff is really good.  Tastes just like Nesquik when mixed with skim milk. Would recommend buying.
 Double chocolate is not to bad, sometimes seems to have a hard time dissolving. Seems to do what it is suppose to.<br/><br/>Strawberry gets 1.5/5 it is so disgusting. Basically just peptobismal it's a nightmare.
 High quality protein, but the flavor sucks and its a little chunky compared to other protein shakes.
 Great protein, rocky road tastes great, and has given me even better results. Will be a lifelong Gold Standard Whey fan
 I bought this product on the recommendations of people I trust. I am more than happy that I did so. This product works fine for me.
 Best tasting protein I've ever had.  Also mixes great with pancake mix for bannana pancakes!
 SO FAR IT HAS BEEN GREAT!  TASTE IS NICE AND HAS GONE GREAT WITH EVERYTHING I'V USED IT WITH.L. ROSKELLEY
 arrived on time like it stated,<br/>one Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard, Double Rich Chocolate, 5 Pound on my front porch!;)
 Got here in 13 hours!!great product
 great price on a great product. Shipped fast too!
 This is a product I will not buy again.  The taste doesn't even have a chocolate taste for double rich chocolate.  For all the reviews and recommendations I was highly disappointed.  Still trying to get a refund but keep getting put off.  I will NEVER purchase this again.  Doesn't even compare to a product I was previously using.
 Delicious
 Manages to taste better, mix better, and have more protein than anything you'd find at a supermarket. Extreme Milk Chocolate is a hard flavor to go wrong with.
 Great Taste, and worth every penny!
 I mix these with milk, a banana, and flax seeds and get the tastiest post workout smoothies ever. Definitely recommend!
 It works every time and gets the job done! It tastes great as well. Two thumbs up for Gold Standard Whey
 Best whey product hands down.
 24 g of protein taste good
 good
 Pre and post exercise and also daily use after Hockey game.<br/>What type of results you are looking for?<br/>Taste and results.<br/>Above the expectations.
 It's the same ole stuff from GNC! Nothing new!
 Excellent proteins!
 Wonderful supplement. Tastes great, easy to mix and for the price it just can not be beat. I would highly recommended this product.
 yummy
 Great tasting, quality protein.  Good price.
 Excellent taste, good value for the price
 I'll never use any other protein again.
 Good stuff.
 Awesome
 good
 Good , Fast shpping
 Its a must for everyone, who wants to bulk up and nourish with proteins needed.
 Yes,,, is an exelent product
 I have gained my weight by 10 pounds so far within a month. And still more than half of the supplement yet I have to finish. Simply, this 5 pound tub is worth 20-25 pounds.
 It has a very good proportion of protein and the strawberry flavor makes it too good. For anybody who is going to gym, this is a must have item.
 Great source of protein when I don't get enough from my meals on certain days.<br/>Great post workout shake as well!
 Good
 Excellent product
 I'd give this product 5 stars but today only 4 because the price just continues to rise. I guess you get what you pay for and overall this is a  great product. Limited additives, clean protein, easy to mix and build into your workout regimen. If I had more time to cook MASS amounts of foods and just eat that after working out I would... but I don't, and this makes it easy to get some quality protein after a workout (very important).
 Its best
 Strawberry taste pretty good but don't put too much water or else it taste really nasty.
 Its does what its supposed to, great quality and taste.
 Nice product, it came in perfectly conditions everything close.<br/>I would recommend to buy from this customer.<br/>I recommend rocky road nice taste
 Delicious!
 Pretty good, but I've had better, overall I like using it.
 Very good taste.  Mixes well with milk or water.
 The best protein i have had with the best results
 It was the correct product as shown. The delivery wasn't long and just in time for me to make my shakes.
 Great product!
 Delicious, and straight protein.  Couldn't ask for a better combo.  Just remember to use it quickly or it can go bad.
 Always good. In the top 3 whey protein powders. 'nuff said
 Great product. Will be purchasing again.
 its like blood for me
 Good product
 Double chocolate tastes excellent. Mixes completely in cold water.
 It was extraordinarily good. Just one query why does it have so much of price variation- $49.99 to $ 106.00?
 I like how it test<br/>We 'll see the results
 Hope to find a product without artificial sweeteners.
 Tastes great and works well.
 Love this protein.  My favorite is doble rich chocolate.  Easy to blend and great taste
 Super fast shipping. Great product for strength building.
 Taste good, and it really helps me to grow some stuff :D
 Great product and an excellent value. Buying this stuff in bulk saves you lots of money!  Optimum Nutrition's products are top of the line as well.
 Great product... Love it, it's working for me. Love the flavor, Best protein, I won't stop drinking it. Great yay
 Excellent
 Love the flavor
 Awesome product!! Very fast shipping will def order again!!
 Good stuff I recomme to anyone  taste real good it doesn't stick mix very well on shaker smooth good 1
 Works really well. Love the taste too, I use it about an hour after lifting and occasionally when I wake up in the morning.
 It tastes like medicine. I do suggest the brand but get a different flavor.
 Arrived quickly and without incident. Tastes decent with water, and quite a bit better with milk. Very good "bang-for-your-buck" powder.
 My Favorite brand of protein powder!  I love the Cake Batter flavor, it tastes​ much better than the vanilla and it mixes well with fruit and peanut butter for excellent smoothies.  I can also make protein pancakes and bake with this.
 i purchased the extreme milk chocolate and love the taste. not to mention it was cheaper then what i usually get at GNC.
 Good
 Really good!
 Very good
 It is awesome
 Too sweet.
 I have muscles now, Thanks Optimum Nutrition!
 One of the best tasting proteins out there
 I've been using this for about a week now, and while I can't vouch for its effectiveness, but I can vouch for its deliciousness.<br/><br/>Tips for delicious consumption:<br/>Double Rich Chocolate Protein<br/>Plain Greek Yogurt<br/>Honey<br/>Splash of vanilla extract<br/><br/>When you mix it up it seriously tastes like Brownie Batter!
 Really great stuff. I feel like two scoops after a good workout really builds
 Great for berry smoothies!
 As it was advertised
 Good stuff
 Love it!!!! Just got my first package ever of the double chocolate and it is simply divine. Can't wait to try all the flavors and see if this helps me reach my fitness goals! I also really appreciate that they offer the smaller size instead of having to order the big a** container, it's nice to be able to try a "sample" size before committing to the bulk size. Makes me a happy customer!
 tastes great, exactly what i expected; mixes very well with anything and washes tremendously out of bottles. I bought the chocolate malt one and i am looking forward to trying new flavors.
 Tastes good, mixes decently, surprisingly good with water (not to mention milk). Good macros. Of course, the pricing is reasonable too.
 Lightweight and delicious. Ive been slurpping this stuff down for two years. What more is there to say?<br/>Best blended with milk and a banana!
 Great product and actually tastes good!
 This is a great low card whey option.
 I don't like that the bottle was to big for the content
 Tastes great and mixes well. Definitely my go to protein moving forward.
 I have been a loyal Optimum Nutrition whey protein buyer and the double rich chocolate is probably my favorite. Instead of using a blender, i use a cup with a secure lid with it.  all i do is add non fat milk, and shake vigorously for 15 seconds. Chug the good stuff down in 5 seconds flat. its that good
 Fast and easy thank you
 Love ON products! These are good products.  Well blending, good tasting, muscle building! everything is good. Also, im lactose intolerant but this thing never makes me sick.
 This Whey dissolves better then other products I've tried. I mix mine with Almond Milk and sometimes Cinnamon to add a little different flavor
 It was amazing overall product. It met my expectations on everything.  Overall feel alot better then taking other proteins... thanks
 It was perfect as listed
 I used to buy the bargain brand whey for 30 bucks a 5 pound bag. It tasted bad, didn't mix well, and had shady ratings on review sites. Here, ON continues to impress with their high standards, great taste, and excellent nutritional content. This flavor beats out all of their other vanilla flavors. This, along with their double chocolate, will likely be the new staple protein powder in my diet as a college club athlete.
 Good stuff , tastes good!
 Plain and simple: this product makes it so easy to get lots of protein into your diet. Nothing else comes close.
 Great taste and easy on the stomach.  Overall the best protein shake for your money and quality one the market.
 For the price you can't beat it! You get a great quantity for a great quality product at a very reasonable price. It has a good tasting flavor as well.
 Not much to say, its a tried and true product that alot of people stand behind. Tastes good, low cals and carbs, and a good does of protein. What more could you want?
 Tastes fine, not too many carbs, includes Glutamine (helps you recover/rebuild muscle faster). What I wanted and nothing more/less. Goober.
 Best protein I have ever had
 I can see now I am growing massive amount of muscles after drinking Whey Protein after intense workouts.  It is very effective.
 ON is typically quality protein. This one is no different. Also it mixes well with other flavors. ie..bananas, peanut butter, oats
 Very tasty.
 very good
 This flavor is tasty when mixed with water. It is definitely worth the upgrade over cheaper chocolate brands, which I didn't like enough to purchase again. I would order this flavor again
 This product is just amazing and I loved the flavour. The protient content per scoop is great. I will defnitely recommend this to my friends ! :)
 The taste is great, and the results too. Excellent protein to take it every day. It's my second tube, and I will keep buying more.
 I've been bodybuilding for over 15 years now. This is the best tasting protein on the market. I love this product!
 Love the flavor
 Tastes great and works,can see improvement
 I've been using this powder for a couple years, and my brother used it before me. It's got a good taste and it's priced pretty fairly.
 Breaks down easy, tastes and works great!
 This is about personal taste and this is not one of my favorite flavors. However,  it is a very good product a reasonable price.
 Cookies and cream does not taste like cookies, or cream, or both. Everyone has their own taste buds but it's very different from the c&amp;c I've gotten for years. Taste seems to be between coffee, sour milk, and chocolate? I'm wondering if ON ran out of c&amp;c material and just started dumping in random flavors. Would it be possible to exchange for a different flavor? I already opened it but really do not want to choke down 5 gallons of this - I would very much appreciate it.
 Great product, exactly what I ordered
 I have been using the protein powder from Provida Labs, but switched to optimum since this was a lot cheaper. This has a lot of protein, but very low in sodium, fat and sugar and I very much like it. The only reason I cant give a 5 is because of the taste. But don't get me wrong, this tastes good and sweet but not as good as the protein powder i am used to from Provida Labs. This is my opinion on the Vanilla flavor and I'll try chocolate the next time.
 Great product
 Tasted good and does what it is supposed to do.....Highly recommend this product.
 I really like the taste of this flavor... the only reason why i am giving it 3 stars is because of false advertisement... I bought this particular flavor because the picture shows 77 servings but i only got 73 servings... to some this may not be as important but to me it is and therefore the 3 stars...
 great taste mixes well and feel full I will continue to buy and make it a major part on my diet.
 So tasty!
 Taste and works great, love it.
 ... ... the son to my office friend is very happy by this product, he used this to training requeriments
 It doesn't taste like cookie and cream its more like coffee but its not terrible. I think double rich chocolate is better for the first time buyer to try unless you like coffee.
 Whey protein is an excellent product to gain mass muscle in the gym, it helps me a lot. I reccommended it for any person who want to try it for the same reason as me.
 Tastiest protein powder I have ever had
 This is the only flavor that I keep coming back to, after trying so many brands and flavors. It mixes real well, tastes delicious, and let's me get my proper protein intake after workouts. The price has gone up, but what can you do. Much cheaper on Amazon than on standard sites.
 A+
 Love it !!!
 Great product and timing! If you are looking to purchase some good supplements, you've come to the right place. Got a good price to.
 the best
 Fast shipping! Good product!
 It is good but doesn't taste all to well
 10/10
 Excellent product
 Love it
 This is my go to protein.  You can't beat the quality at this price.
 Yes. Smoothest protein I've ever had. Definitely worth the price.
 i love it. it is very very good<br/>i want to recommend people to buy,<br/>this quality is so good!
 Love it!
 Very good product as described. The protein arrived on time, and the banana flavor is one of best flavors that I tried so far.
 Great product,full of energy and recieved it in great condition and time.
 Tastes good! Excellent product!
 Great taste goes great with peanut butter and milk
 Tastes awesome.
 Amazing protein powder
 Great purchase
 This is my standard supplement. Always meets expectations.
 Great for right after workout in milk. Also great in cereal in the morning. It provides a scooper for you so you know how much is one serving (you might have to dig a bit first to find it).
 Good product!
 Very good and easy to mix. No artificial sweetner taste.
 I always go back to buying ON after buying others.
 The strawberry flavor tastes like medicine but can be handled with the aid of milk
 pretty good
 I have got to say, this protein is great in taste, value and overall quality. I used to be taking a GNC generic brand of whey, but this blows that by a thousand miles!<br/>Tried the French Vanilla Cream, must say it was awesome. I'm personally a vanilla lover and although at first it tasted different it was because the GNC one I was using wasn't as great! already ordered my second tub, this time Cookies and cream :)<br/><br/>Cons: Its not really a con, just that it took me a good shake around to find the darn scoop. Was hiding all the way down the tub.
 I love the flavor
 24g of protein per scoop and thats not counting the milk. I had it for over 2 months and I haven't gotten tired of the taste; in fact, its pretty damn good. There's no need to add anything to it to make it taste tolerable, it really does taste great. I use vanilla soy milk and a couple of ice cubes and mix it with a blender. Perfect every time.
 Love this brand and this whey, but the flavor was not as good as I expected
 This is a great product, especially for the price, the whey was half the price at GNC, and there are more flavors offered on line!
 The best on the market, hands down.
 Solid product as usual. Getting this size really cuts down your re-buying.
 Absolutely love this flavor! Has a strong banana taste but it is still delicious!
 OK
 This is a great price for a high quality protein and does the job it's supposed to do. With using this i gain 7lbs of muscle in two weeks.
 Good
 very good,yammy.Double rich chocolate is my favourate.
 Reasonable price and tastes good too.  I tried two other brands of protein powder.  This is a great addition to my breakfast smoothies.
 This is a quality product with very good value. This site provides the best price I could find anywhere. Great ratio of islotated whey protein.
 Love it
 The White Chocolate flavor tastes horrible! Really fake tasting.
 Not quite sure what the flavor was but it didn't taste like cookies and cream. Also had a strong after taste. Gave it to a friend, they don't seem to mind it.
 Best price I could find with most protein
 This stuff tastes delicious, I highly recommend it. Mixes great and is the perfect qaulity, what else should you expect from optimum nutrition
 Ordered Vanilla Ice Cream and it is one of the worst proteins I have ever tasted.  Granted, I use water but it tastes horrible and has an aftertaste that reminds me of a bad sugar substitute.  It is going to be rough getting through the rest of the this tub.  Next time I need to check reviews on the flavors.
 Best tasting whey on the market.
 The flavor is great. My absolute favorite!
 Great stuff
 Great Quality.Great Taste.Double chocolate.
 Taste is amazing I usually drink it with milk and a banana for taste boost my favorite flavored protein drink for sure.
 Favorite whey protein!
 This protein shakes last long time (I always order 5 pounds and it lasts like 2-3 month, but of course, it depends on how often you drink it. I usually workout 3-4 days in a week and drink once or twice a day before and right after workout) and I love the strawberry banana flavor. Taste great with milk!
 Tastes great, mixes well. No complaints
 Great powder. Mixes easily and tastes great.
 Really easy to mix, all of the flavors tastes great, one of the best isolates on the market from every angle.
 Good
 I've been using it for about 6 months and I like very much the results.<br/>The price is also worth it.
 It is great!
 its very good
 Very tasty and satisfy your hunger! It's a great source of nutrients and a good way to start your day.
 This tastes great and mixes well. Plus it has a pretty low price for the number of servings you get.
 This was my first time ordering a different flavor than the chocolate ant it is delicious. I thought I would get sick of the flavor drinking it everyday but nope I love it
 It meets my need.
 BEST. PROTEIN. EVER.
 Good taste and mixes well. The best protein powder I have ever found.
 Pretty good
 Mixes well, tastes great. Love the product and would/will buy again. I haven't had a flavor I don't like with this.
 This product never fails. All flavors taste good and of course the results are always good as well! Still think the vanilla flavor is the best though..
 The Extreme Milk Chocolate Flavor tastes great! I rate it 5/5.<br/>I got the double rich chocolate before and I give it 4/5
 Is perfect
 I bought it just for my wife 'cause she is a Vegetarian 'didn't eat meat and eggs 'so i thought the Optimum Nutrition can fix it'need time to see'
 produto original e rápida entrega. excelente vendedor. recomendos a todos o  vendedor. o prazo de entrega foi comprido e o produto é original
 Excelent product by Optimal Nutrition. Perfect taste, good solubility and normal price make it best of the best. Many thanks
 Good results, good product, period.
 Authentic product and delivery is prompt
 Good quality and really fast delivery speed.
 Stick with chocolate peanut butter!
 Great stuff ! Mixes easy and tastes great ...
 Great product.
 Really and cool and awesome
 Definitely my new favorite
 Worth it
 Contains Sucralose.
 Really disgusting, tastes nasty and way to sweet. Can't return it because I missed the window, don't waste your money, seriously 😖
 The best protein I have ever used.
 Good quality at the best price I could find.  It tastes pretty good for a protein powder, and dissolves easily in a shaker bottle.  Dollar for dollar, this is probably the best protein powder available.
 Good. I have always used to like optimum nutrition. Great product. Definitely worth the money. I recommend it. ! .
 Loved the taste . Only concern is the high  price ...
 Excellent
 Great stuff
 It was great!! Mixes perfectly and I never got the chunks I would normally get with my old whey! I Recommend it to everyone
 Good taste, actually resembles chocolate.  Good flavor, buy it.
 Great High Quality product! Quick recovery, and noticable results!
 Awesome tasting great results!
 The Cake Batter is my 3rd flavor I have tried. (the others were the double chocolate and ice cream vanilla) I bought this flavor because I wanted to try it since it got good reviews flavor wise.  I wish they had a smaller tub to buy because if I would of known the cake batter tasted this way I wouldnt have gotten such a large tub.  Unless you are looking for a flavor that is so sweet it gives you a headache, don't buy it!  Even the smell of it is so strong that its way too much!  I would suggest the ice cream vanilla if you want a nice not so sweet flavor.  But the chocolate has been my favorite so far.  I do like this product as far as how well it mixes and for the nutritional value of a protein powder.
 100% satisfied!!
 The nutritional aspects of the protein are great, but I was mostly excited about finding a delicious flavor of whey. Unfortunately, this isn't the one. it tastes very similar to a typical vanilla protein powder, which was a huge let down.
 Best protein.
 best protein product i've ever taken period, and on top of that, it tastes great. anybody who's looking for protein shakes, this is it, look no further!!
 Awesome great taste and great protein...
 Good price and taste is awesome, a good break from the other chocolate flavors that become a little mundane over time
 Unbelievably great!
 I just got this flavor and even though this is great protein this flavor literally looks and tastes like pepto bismo
 GO TO WHEY
 Tastes good. works well.
 Got mad gains from this stuff. Mixes easy too.
 LOVE IT
 Best ever go to Protein for quality, price and taste!
 Got what I paid for no complaints here.
 Tastes great
 good！
 I used to use Nitro-Tech but the Double Rich Chocolate by Optimum Nutrition tastes great and seems to work just as well as the pricer Nitro-Tech stuff.  Just make sure you don't over do it with the milk and you should be fine!  I made the mistake of mixing 2 scoops with 4 cups of milk and that left me with horrible stomach problems days later.
 Actually tastes like vanilla ice cream
 Tastes good!
 Tastes good, blends well, and has a great macro breakdown
 Quick shipment,excellent price, great taste
 Nice deal
 Perfect. It tastes so good
 Great protein, tastes good, and easy to mix. I will buy this again. Delivery was quick and the protein was a good price. ON in my opinion is some of the best out there.
 mixes very well, no clumps<br/>The powder mixes very well with other ingredients for shakes and smoothies.<br/>I am going to try the other flavors
 So nice!!!
 Works good tast good and it's affordable
 great
 Great stuff
 love it. probably the best tasting whey ive ever had and shakes up in a shaker really nicely wish i would have gotten more!
 The cookies and cream flavor is by far the best flavor I've had of this product. It works just as good as the platinum standard and its a lot cheaper. Overall great product.
 Best stuff on the market and this seller got it to me next day. Stokeeeeddd.
 Great protein, not a fan of cake batter flavor though.
 Very good 👍
 Love it
 Good!! 5 star
 Love the taste!
 Good stuff
 Best protein. Wish it was less expensive.
 Great price!
 I really wanted to see what all the hype was about so I gave it a go. To bee fair, I know I chose sort of an out there flovor, but I LOVE white chocolate. For some reason, it taste like mocha. It's also the only protein that has ever been this foamy. I will probably try a more comparable flavor next. I do love the nutritional values and the servings per container....BUT The thing that bothered me most was the scooper. If a serving is 31g, MAKE YOUR SCOOPER HOLD 31g!!!!! IT HOLDS 27....I'm not going to get my scale for every scoop. Luckily I had an old scooper that came to exactly 31g. This rounded scoop business is pure bulls***. All in all, I can get past the bad stuff because of the label, but this is not my favorite.
 I recieved my portein on time, I have no problem with this product i recommend to anyone who is looking for protein
 Great tasting, cheap price, top of the line protein. I got a great deal through amazon. I'll be getting some more tubs of protein once I'm done with this batch
 Good 👍🏼
 Really loved this product!
 I love it
 good
 My favorite protein powder and I've tried most. Mixes easily and tastes great.
 I thing this is the best protein around the world, I'm really happy !
 Great product great company
 Great product that taste great!
 good product and good taste with 10oz of milk
 the protein shakes are of such good consistency with ON Whey. much better than some of the other protein out there, expensive but worth it.
 I am very disappointed... Firstly an item did not have any kind of packing!! Secondly and the most important, this product is fake, because as you know there must be validation date at least for 2 years printed with blue color at the bottom of the jar, but there is nothing and you can see attached file.<br/>I advice you don`t buy this fake product. You will be disappointed as I am now.<br/>I WANT REFUND, BUT I DON`T THINK AMAZON CARES ABOUT IT!
 Awesome! And great taste.
 Best product best price I ever have..
 Mix with coco water--the best drink in the world!  It's refreshing drink after a hot day in the gym!  Great!
 Good value for as large of a tub as it comes in.  Protein is pretty standard, doesn't mix terribly but, as with most other protein powders, doesn't mix completely either.
 Great product
 Great taste. Dissolves easily. Great product!!!
 This is a great whey protein product.  It's easy to drink, lasts for weeks, and helps me produce the results I want.
 👍🏼
 Helped me get back to a healthy lifestyle. It was great tasting and better yet it was easy to mix.
 It's a really good product i love it!
 Great products
 I just wanna say the banana cream flavor taste really good!
 Great s***!!!
 It tastes great. I am definitely seeing some results. Just ordered cake batter flavor and cannot wait to try it.
 This product works very well
 Best price out there
 Great taste.
 Delicious! Lasts me a long time.
 S***s bomb
 Great Product!
 Yes
 Best protein powder I've ever had.
 Perfect. Deliberes on time. Love it
 Awesome
 Great taste and mixes really well with water.
 Great taste! Highly recommend! Fast shipping...perfect for post work out....i will continue to buy ON products.. I like Rocky Road and now this
 This is a good product filled w/ fun and adventure mystery and intrigue.<br/>Damn what else do you want me to write.
 This is good protein for the money.  The taste is a little bland (I've had better), but it gets the job done.
 Excellent
 Add Milk, Ice and the Chocolate Mint Whey, and you have a great pre/post work out supplement that taste like a milkshake!!!
 Protein packed powder and tastes good
 It is good<br/>But I don't have the spoon<br/>What should I do?
 Very happy with it
 GREAT
 awesome! great flavor!
 Third time buying a 5 pounder. Low sugar. Lots of protein. Tastes ok. What else do you want in a protein shake?
 The product is great, but it tastes kind of sweet to me.
 Great stuff!
 This is a great supplement.  Tastes awesome and I got it at an amazing price. It was almost 50% off!
 Tasted like it's supposed to and no need to throw away giant jugs.
 Good .
 Each scoop is Packed with proteins
 Shipped fast and had a variety of flavors. Great tasting protein and effective one for anyone to use and mixes in milk or water
 Hands down, best ON flavor I've had.
 Good product; they don't change their formula drastically and doesn't have a bloat effect as do other brands. Mixes well when making shakes or just with water (ok, so there is some chunkiness left over but not as bad).  I'd recommend vanilla and double chocolate. I also like Chocolate Coconut and am trying Banana Strawberry (not bad either).
 Great taste!
 Best of the best !
 Good price, great flavor,, overall great deal.I tried one and now I'm hooked,, it does your body good! Buy it, you won't be dissapointed.
 Amazing product tastes great.
 Awesome and delicious! Shipped so fast!
 Best workout stuff out there.... have always provided the consistent results I need
 GREAT PRODUCT TASTES GREAT
 fast shipping, great product
 it is really tasty and I feel it helps me with my workout!
 This product tastes really good! It's very easy to get resolved into cold water. Reduce muscle recovery period quite effectively.
 Have a nice flavor, I'm testing now this protein and later, I will say if it's really efective. For now, I've been using for only a Week
 It has been the best protein powder that I have ever used. It taste very good, placing second order today!
 Does its job. Really works. &amp; it's not a bad taste if you're big on how protein taste. Mix with milk for a better taste too
 Best protein period.
 Great product, received same day
 Quick delivery and taste great!
 Great product
 Best whey protein in the market, have used gnc and bn. But this stands out.<br/>The double rich chocolate is delocious too
 This Is Great . Mixing is we'll also taste is good !
 flavor is so good! but i need more sweet a little :)
 Awesome
 Exactly what I wanted. It is a trusted resource for if you are looking for protein at a good value
 I really like it!
 Very satisfied
 I use this protein powder with milk or water to ease low blood sugar issues. The flavor is the best of any protein shake I've had, expensive to cheap brands, premixed to dry mixes. It also has a really low carb to protein ratio, so for people with easily imbalanced blood sugar (ie diabetics), this is a good choice. The powder mixes very well into milk and water. I occasionally mix it into coffee as well. I usually use blender ball bottles, but even with a spoon, it dissolves relatively well compared to any other protein powder I've used and even when you get the small undissolved balls of powder, they aren't gritty and bitter like some powders, so it isn't unpleasant if you do have to mix it with a spoon and can't get it entirely dissolved. The only heads up I'd offer is that this protein powder hasn't worked well for me when dieting. I tried using this as meal replacement and I was not only hungry (typical with meal replacement), but I actually gained 13 pounds in a week. I was drinking about five of these a day during that time, with water, (excessive attempt at last minute weight loss for a wedding). So, for those of us who are going to try the unhealthy route of fast weight loss, this is not the way. Obviously fast weight loss is not a good idea, but there are healthy-ish ways to go about it. If you want to do that, find a different protein powder. When I use this regularly once or twice a day as an addition to my regular meals, as a snack, I do not gain weight. The biggest selling points for me on this are the low carb to protein ratio and amazing flavor.
 Mixes well and taste great. This is my goto whey protein. Love it
 Love the taste!!! Not so sweet as all the others.
 Tastes pretty good and I'm jacked, but it doesn't mix very well with milk. I most it with water and that mixes well.
 i love whey protein and gold standard's vanilla ice crea tasts greate with everythin i mix it with (orange juice, milk, soy milk).
 Great!
 Tastes a little more like vanilla than cake batter.
 taste good
 Is a good product that help me in my workout and my practices daily! I have a friend that like this too
 Great
 5 stars If it includes scoop
 Best whey protein.
 Made some gainz
 Exactly what it's supposed to be! Fast shipping too!
 Mmmmmmmm this stuff is tops. I love chocolate malt so I figured I would give this a try - a departure from my tried and true Gold Standard strawberry flavor. You gotta do 2 scoops to get the best flavor. But it's pretty dang delicious. I can gulp it right down in one fell swoop. And as we know Gold Standard always mixes like a dream. If you like chocolate malt, you will like this whey pro.
 Best protein drink I have ever had!<br/>A little to spendy????<br/>Was $39 now $59??????<br/>Can i get a better deal next time I make a purchase????
 Mediocre with water, delicious with almond milk, SUPER delicious with almond/coconut milk blend and at least a teaspoon of instant coffee for a blast of caffeine. This is a great post-workout meal when you need the protein but don't have time for a "real" meal. When I ordered it, I had planned on trying other flavors when this is gone, but it is so delicious I don't want to order something else and be disappointed!
 5 stars!
 Good
 Great taste and a great product!
 Everything I wanted.
 The best protein powder out there
 Flavor is amazing.
 I really did like the product even I did not notice increase in my  weight  but maybe because I burned some fat .
 Great.
 If you're looking for a protein powder that tastes good...keep looking. This tastes terrible and it smells like metal. It has a lot of good qualities, but I need my protein to taste good otherwise I can't drink it. If they could get this to taste even close to MusclePharm's version...I'd be sold. But I'll stick with MP for now.
 Good
 This is what I have been looking for.
 great protein powder.
 Great value for the price.  Taste great.  Tried plenty of protein powders, this is definitely one of the best out.
 Tastes kinda like toothpaste. But it gets the job done I guess. I personally liked the syntha 6 cookies and cream much better.
 good deal! you cant pass this one up. just like the one you buy at GNC just half the price
 good tasting, mixes well. good protein content. all you need in good whey!<br/>PS: may try extreme milk chocolate next time.
 Only critique I have is that the taste of Double Rich chocolate was kind of...eh. I'll definitely buy it again, just choose a different flavor.
 This is a great product!!! This is my favorite protein product and will continue to purchase this brand of protein!
 Optimum Nutrition makes some of the best protein for the best prices
 Taste great,would buy again.
 Gives me the gains I need 💪🏽
 I personally really loved the protein powder, it tastes good in milk though.. It doesnt taste like i am drinking a protein shake, as tastes is awesome.. Recommend it
 Great so far...let's see how it goes
 As expected great purchase and really worth the money if You want to see progress in your body.
 Best tasting protein I​ have ever had!!
 Works grate
 Tast is not really good.
 Mixes well in just water.  No clumps.
 Good s*** son
 Makes me want to stay consistent on working out just so I can drink this with milk. Love the taste!
 My favorite protein at a great price.
 Excellent product. This was what I was looking for. A very good protein product for pre/post workout. Highly recommended for those who does intense workout.
 Best protein out here. I was able to gain 35 lbs muscle mass taking this religiously. It's the only product I took ( didn't buy the casin) and still had great results. It did make me put on a bunch of muscle weight and was easy for me to chisel that weight into cut arms and chest.
 Price is more than a bargain and delivery was fast!
 I bought it at lowest price on amazon. It tastes good with high infusion rate, feel smoothy when drink my protein shake.
 It is okey.
 Good
 Optimum Nutrition has great products.
 better than other becouse not too sweet
 This product arrived fast and was a great price.  It dissolves fast and actually tastes good too.
 You can actually taste the coconut. Tried mixing with oatmeal but didn't mix very well. Great in shakes or just with water.
 💪
 Really good product. Totally recomend it.
 10/10 would buy again
 this product is great, fast delivery too it's all i was expecting, i would recommend this product to all customers
 good taste, lower calories.<br/>high percentage of protein.
 Great product, I highly recommend it. Also it tastes great.
 I don't like the flavor vanilla Coke taste bad, next time I try chocolate or Strawberry see how that working
 Great way to meet a high protein diet!
 It works
 it's a really good product,
 EVERYTHING IS JUST 100% PERFECT BUT IT WAS JUST A LITTLE HARD TO FIGURE A WAY OUT TO OPEN THE "BAG"<br/>ANY WAYS THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM LOL AND YEA LOVE THE FLAVOR
 Nice
 The powder seamlessly vanishes in any liquid and leaves a silky smooth taste. The banana cream flavor meets my chimps expectations. 10/10 would drink again.
 By far the best protein out there. On my 6th bucket and ordering more. Double rich chocolate is my favorite
 One of the best if not the best whey on the market!
 love it!
 I always use this brand and always got good results. I'll be using this same stuff for as long as its available.
 Soooo good.
 Good every day maintenance product
 Awesome product
 Taste great, blends well, no bloat and no aftertaste
 It is great.  Tastes great. Mixes well. Great post workout.  Best protein I've tasted in a long time hands down
 Very happy with my order.  Thank you!
 Great product, great gains, easily mixed. The flavor is the best put of all of them and pretty good for a protein shake.
 This was for my grandson who is a fire fighter.  He thinks it is wonderful.  I am allergic to milk products so I do not use it.  Joann
 No comments. Amazing product and quick delivery
 Best protien powder I've purchased!
 The best bang for your buck protein out there...great taste, always consistent, no matter if you are cutting or bulking... ON is the choice for all!!!
 Good
 Love this flavor.
 Tastes great when blended with Milk and a little ice.
 It could of used a better flavor aftertaste and less chalky of a compound for the flavor it was trying to accomplish
 Have always used ON whey, this is by far the greatest flavor. Little sweet but not to much. On whey is also some of the highest quality protein
 very good . I take it every day
 This item was a great purchase...it was a great deal and it arrived sooner than I thought. It was also exactly as described
 they have really good prices for good protein i will def get this stuff again it works great thanks guys
 Very useful
 I've tried several different types of protein and this is the absolute best one I've ever had. Really great stuff!
 It mixes easily and doesn't leave any unmixed chunks of powder behind.  It seems to be a quality powder.  But the flavor of this one isn't that great.  I'm still not sure why they named the flavor Rocky Road.
 Mixes well and has a great taste. More importantly it is a good protein and I have made decent gains
 Good taste and quality
 great protein powder, i barely started lifting and i knew i needed a supplement and this is definitely what i needed
 Chocolate malt is just ok tasting. Good value, though.
 fast delivery, great product.
 In summary: High protein per serving, a lot of added aminos (no need to add extra glutamine), about $8 cheaper here than at supplement stores that rhyme with PNC, mixes well, tastes good, and does not spoil quickly.<br/><br/>I am a casual lifter and a fan of optimum nutrition ("ON").  Between that and muscle milk, I have been using these products for approximately 10 years.  Last year I decided to branch out and try another whey supplements given that I have never really tried others; I just went right to ON.  So I tried 3-4 types.<br/><br/>Aaaaaand now I am back with ON.  I had marked less gains and recovered noticeably slower with other protein wheys than I did with ON.  I imagine part of that is all the amino acids and other things in ON, whereas many other wheys are just the whey or minimum amounts of the extras.<br/><br/>By no means am I a fitness junkie like I was in high school or college, and certainly just a causal lifter now, but I still do full-body workouts and I find my body needing more then just whey.  ON has just become my staple and it mixes well while taking good.  I frequently mix it with oatmeal in the morning for breakfast, or on the weekend with ice cream.  I like the plain vanilla flavor just by itself, but it mixes well with pretty much everything (fruit or peanut butter).<br/><br/>The amount of protein per serving is fairly high and there are a lot of amino acids added which make buying extra aminos or glutamine a thing of the past for me.  I rather just have to mix on thing than create a concoction of everything--especially when running late in the morning.<br/><br/>I recommend this to causal lifters or high school/college athletes, which is what I had used it for.  I can't say I would recommend it for body builders, merely because--well--I am not a body builder.  But I imagine they may be satisfied too.
 I couldnt be happier and I will buy again. The whey settles well and doesnt clump. also, for the price ill have enough whey for an entire quarter at school and thats wonderful
 If you have any problems with an agony, I wouldn't recommend to drink it, but if not, than it is very effective way to gain some weight.
 Better than bodybulding items
 My husband is using this and he really enjoys it! It came on time and with no problems! Thanks~!
 I've only had this product for about 2 weeks and I loved it the moment I tried it. ON is great and it has everything you need.
 This stuff is awesome!! It's not too sugary, and it mixes well. I'd buy it again, and the price is fantastic.
 Great quality product
 In my opinion, this is the best Protien! In terms of value for many and quality. It tastes really goooood!
 I love this product. It taste great and give me energy. I take it 2 twice a day and it works.
 Doesn't leave a gritty after feeling like some whey protein. The double rich chocolate is easy for me to drink.
 Great taste!
 Exellent protein, classic, i dont care if there are new proteins, im going to choose the classic and the best one, Gold Standard from ON.
 I've used it before. It's delicious in milk.
 It's the best out there 💪
 Really good
 Great value and flavor.
 Glad I chose the Double Rich Chocolate. I was afraid it wouldn't taste very good, but I was pleasantly surprised with how good it was.
 Pretty great! I love Whey protein shakes and it Works better than others  so far that i have tried out
 I have lactose intolerance and many protein powders give me bloating but this protein powder works like a charm for me. No gas, no bloating, no real issues. Has a nice amino acid profile
 Boss pause...BOSS
 This product not only tastes great, but it also mixes well with most beverages. I also add this to my oatmeal for breakfast.
 It's whey. Helps me reach my daily protein needs.. Nothing magical.. Great price for the amount. Tastes goo and mixes easily.
 The product came quickly, and the price was the cheapest that I have found on the internet or in a store.
 Love the taste!
 BEST PROTEIN EVER
 This protein is a good basic whey and mixes well. Tastes good  use it before workouts.  Hydro whey is better though
 Good product
 Gold Standard packs a lot of protein into a single scoop, so you don't have to mix a ton of powder.  I have been using the chocolate flavor for three years, but I have recently switched over to the banana flavor.  Not only does it taste much better (to me), but it mixes more completely with the milk.  As for results, this protein powder has assisted me in moving from 147 pounds to 172 pounds over the last three years of working out.
 I thought I give this flavor a try since I usually only get chocolate malt flavor. It definitely tasted a lot better than I expected. I would definitely get it again.
 it's fine. Tasted delicious and it's very suitable for me I really like it .ok ok ok ok ok ok
 Really Nice Real Happy With The Product I Liked the Price It went way over my expectations, I like the price and value
 This tastes better than anything I ever done drank. Also, I don't get nearly as sore after lifting. Good stuff.
 I'm a fan of this chocolate flavor, not too sweet or artificial tasting. This powder mixes pretty easily but will clump up and require a little bit of work if mixing with a spoon. Works great in a blender bottle.
 One of the best protien I used
 excellent Whey
 i am using it for 2 weeks i really works. i can say that i like this product. nice price
 Amazing flavor. Mixes easily. Great results after a hard workout.
 Loved it use it every time I work out
 the best
 Exactly what I expected when buying it. It has good quality and good taste and I very much enjoy this shake.
 The best price on this protein it's on amazon (if you have a prime) GNC has it for more than a five dollars.
 I love this product http://www.publicauctionfinder.com/
 Good protein, excellent with milk!
 Great taste, my go-to flavor
 I was a little skeptical at first because I have never ordered "Banana" flavored whey before. But now I know I will order it again. This stuff is a great protein source. Dissolves/mixes quick and is a fair price.
 Good
 GREAT PROTEIN
 Good stuff. I feel more energetic and stronger the next day. More. More. More. More. Can't wait to try the other flavors.
 I like it, the whey protein give me energy and power. I make crossfit and I start to see good results.
 Don't use that hot water ,or it will taste terrible.
 Perfect
 Excellent product i have ever used 👍
 Great taste, will buy again!
 Always amazing protein. No news about it.
 Tastes great.
 it taste nice.
 A+
 Great taste
 i like it!!!! it works great and i would buy it again!!!! i love gold standard 100% whey protein :)
 Great product recommend it to anyone who's trying to help build muscle
 Great product
 Great product!  I have noticed large gains in muscle growth and shorter recovery time
 I think it's the best flavour i bought.
 My favorite , the best I've found.
 great product
 thumbs up! good stuff
 Mixes great and the taste is hands down tasty. Also very filling!
 I found this Gold Standard Coffee very tasty. Gold standard is very well known in nutrition world and this presentation is no room for error.I used this protein mix with unflavored cereal. I can combine this as good meal.<br/><br/>I felt the same effect than other gold standard proteins. Easy to digest and it has a mix of different proteins; you can use between meals or after exercise.<br/><br/>Highly recommended for someone who needs a protein for all purpose and avoid having 1 type of protein for pre-workout and after-workout.
 Great
 It's pretty good
 Can't go wrong with ON and their ingredients. This was a great flavor (they offer a wide variety). A bit more expensive than some options, but you know you're getting a good product.
 I absolutely swear by Optimum Nutrition protein.  No other brand compares in terms of quality and taste.  I have tried pretty much every flavor and they all taste great but strawberry is still my favorite.  It mixes better and tastes better than any other brand I have tried.  This is by far the best whey I have found.
 every whey is the same, although i think the flavor is exceptionally strong in this particular flavor of whey protein
 I recommend it
 I love this product PERIOD
 It was easy to mix and full of great ingredients. Would get this product again and agian. Hope you all enjoy it.
 Great product . I have used it for years with great results
 Great Product. It gets me skrong.
 Good
 Good stuff I love the banana strawberry
 Taste great came fast
 Best bang for the buck. Cheaper than bodybuilding.com.
 its the best tasting protein I have ever used and very easy to mix
 fast shipping great product
 It seems to be doing my son good, he loves to workout and needed something to supplement his protein intake
 10/10
 I have tried many different flavor and coffee is the best one so far because it taste very well with water!
 The product is decent. But I expect its flavor to be much better because it is more expensive than other flavors.
 Taste is good not as good compared to others. Mixes good. Works great.
 really good product
 I mix it with milk, and its delicious! I actually enjoy drinking it, which I can't say about other protein powders.
 Perfect
 Good product<br/>But the shipping ...very bad
 Best tasting protein that I've had.
 Great all around
 On time and a great product. My go to brand because it is one of the better products for the price
 I love ON and especially this flavor!
 Nice
 A plus
 Great product, ships on time as always
 This stuff is SO good.  Vanilla is where it's at! (I have strawberry too, thats great.  Chocolate - ehhh, not so much a fan).  But yes, vanilla, mm mm good.
 the packet was torn
 This protein powder taste great and is a great supplement! Coconut lovers will be satisfied! It tastes like almond joy chocolate!
 Have tried many protein shakes (premixed and powder) and the white chocolate flavor has been the best I've yet tasted
 Thanks.
 Tastes great and shipping was fast
 Best whey in e market. Nothing else works as well for me
 Great product and a great price.
 Was a great purchase.. price is right for the quality and taste. I highly recommend this brand for a protein supplement.
 Muscled up quickly
 Total good
 Love it! Tastes great and the results are what I wanted!I will buy this product again! If you are looking for a quality product this is the way to go!
 Great
 tasted great! Came quickly too.
 This drink is like no other protein drink that I have ever tried. It's so light, and dissolves quickly, plus it really taste just like chocolate milk! ON rocks!
 Tastes good.
 Great stuff!
 excellent
 Just what I needed
 I was surprised that protein powder is delicious.<br/>I think Coffee flavor is the best one.<br/>Try this one. you will like it.
 Despite the recent price hike, this protein is still the best out there per ingredients and number of servings. We've tried Double Rich Chocolate and Extreme Milk Chocolate and both are great.
 Product is fine. The serving scoop was hard to find.
 Think you
 The best whey protein
 As expected.
 The cookie batter flavor mixed on top of milk is the bomb.  Also it provides good bang for the buck and calorie.
 My go to!
 I've tried Double Rich Chocolate, Rocky Road, and Extreme Milk Chocolate. They all tastes great and are easy to swallow, but my favorite flavor by far is Extreme Milk Chocolate.
 Best protein hands down.
 Great taste and filling after a workout.
 This is a great protein and it has everything you want for a great value and at a great price.
 High quality whey protein, packed with lots of good stuff like BCAAs and glutamine, and the taste isn't bad either!
 I take a scoop ofthis, 5 grams of creatine and mix with water. tastes pretty good and i have been making steady gains
 Very sweet
 Great
 cap had crack in it lost sum of product, but excellent other then that.
 I recommend this product if it easy for you to gain weight. Tastes great and lasts a long time. .
 I have trainer at a gym that recommended it.  I don't get enough protein in my diet and this works.
 this not only taste good but one of the best whey protein out there! would definitely recommend this to others!!
 t's very good. I recommend it
 Best whey protein there is!
 A
 Great product. Cake batter taste amazing!
 Great !
 Good
 best bang for your buck protein
 Great product!
 What I like about optimum protein besides the nutrition facts is the taste. It is not too sweet like other brands that I have tried.
 Great product.
 taste is pretty good.
 Second time that I have purchased it and it still is the best value for the money. I love the French Vanilla!
 It tastes magnificent heated up, I haven't tried it cold yet.<br/>Best type of ON whey powder I've tried yet.
 Really good supplement after your work out...definitely recommended....after just 4 weeks I could see the results in my body already.
 Perfect
 Tasty, make me powerful creature.
 Nomz!
 Been taking it for 2 weeks and its been giving me the runs...after I drink it in less than 30 min I'm in the toilet! Even though I take pills for my lactose intolerance. I double the water and lowered the protein by a bit...so far so good...ok see in 30 min if that works.
 I love this protein. I have been using it for a little over a year now and it has never failed me.
 Great product.
 Chocolate coconut tastes great, blends well. Couldn't be happier with this product.
 The best protein on the market hands down
 The best.....
 It tastes good both with water and juice. And it is also in a reasonable price. I will buy it next time.
 This protein used to be the best price/quality option and still does the job, but now it contains sucralose. Health first, then muscles.
 Isn't cheap but it tastes great and dissolves well.  I drink it after a workout.  I mix it into soy or almond milk using an immersion blender and sometimes add a little instant coffee or peanut butter for variety.
 Taste great and mixes well. Ive been using it for over a year! Great as a breakfast shake or a booster right before a workout.
 Good price!
 THIS STUFF IS AWESOME. MIXES EASY AND TASTES EXCELLENT!
 Good protein
 Great
 As good as advertised
 Its only good in milk.
 the best whey on the market place.  If you are looking for the best results get this protein for lean muscle.
 Awesome supplement.! I highly recommend it
 Great Product
 Great source of protein, tastes fabulous!  I take 8 ounces of soy milk and mix with protein powder for breakfast.  Easy, simple, taste great and holds me till lunch!
 awesome
 Tastes good.
 Great product!
 Optimum has always sold only the highest of quality stuff. You really cant go wrong. 100% whey is the best protein you can buy period.
 Good taste
 very good
 All other flavor/brands are too sweet. This one tastes the best.
 If there is anything out there better than this post it!
 Love this stuff
 Well the product has wonderful numbers on it. You need 99% protein and not carbs or fats? Got it.  I have 2 complaints (minor ones).<br/><br/>#1 After being pampered with Marc Lobliners MTS whey nothing will ever taste good again. This tasted like straight powder to me<br/>#2 It doesn't mix as well as it claims. It does alright I guess but not as good as it could be. I use a blender to get a smooth shake.<br/><br/>Tons of servings, great price. Fits macros easier than 95% of powders out there. Will buy again
 Looking for another flavor of whey isolate protein powder, and reading the reviews for this version, I made the mistake of buying a five pound container of Rocky Road.  This was a huge mistake, as no amount of milk, yogurt, or fruit can mask the chemical taste the powder adds.  The chocolate flavor is completely missing; Optimum's attempts to create the flavor of nuts and marshmallow is an abject failure, and this is a non- returnable item, something I wish I had known BEFORE I purchased this. The entire five pounds is going in the garbage!  What a waste of money!
 This is honestly the best protein powder I've ever used. The powder is very fine. It's so fine that it mixes well with almost any liquid and it doesn't get thick when mixed. I usually mix it with almond milk. The double chocolate flavor is nice on the palate. Taking this whey protein makes me not as sore the next day than when I don't take it. Maybe it's a mental thing but I definitely feel better after drinking it, especially after a hard run or workout.
 Met all expectations amazing
 I love this protein. This was my first protein powder and I recommend it to others. It's cheap, does what it has to do and tastes good.<br/><br/>Arrived on time and the tub is not damaged.
 I mean i guess it is right what they always say, what would oo you do for a klondike bar.
 It taste really good
 Always good a great post workout mix
 Love it and it works
 great product, really shows progress if used everyday. lasts about 2 months or so if you get the 5 pound jug
 Delicious
 It was quick delivered and product is awesome.
 Super delicious. Need I say more? Why is there a god damn requirement for words in this review. Nobody will find this helpful.
 I'd loved the product. What I have to do to revive in Brazil?
 Awesome flavor
 By far my favorite whey powder.  Tastes good and breaks up easily.  Price is also a plus being one of the cheapest of the good whey products.  Every time I get another brand I go right back to the Gold Standard.
 Great product
 It's great!, still using it.
 Great product and taste!
 There're no other substitutes for its quality.
 it is one of the good and wrathful product
 excellent!
 The best.
 Taste amazing.
 good product
 Great protein !
 It was perfect.
 Mixes very easy and no chalky after taste. Not a lot of fillers also, Best bang for your buck. Great Product
 Five stars!!!
 Probably the best.
 so great
 Love it. Great taste.
 Fine consistency makes it easy to mix, it tastes pretty good, and the brand is one of the most reliable out there. Would buy again
 Good protein.
 Great taste
 Gainzzz
 Flavor is questionable when it comes to taste.
 great stuff, great taste, blends easy, low carb and sugar, add a little pb for an awesome shake, you will love it
 Perfect
 Stirs well and tastes great!
 nice product
 The best flavor!
 It actually is really delicious!
 This is all I use. Its the best protein isolate to serving weight ratio I've found for the price (80%). This and creatine are the only supplements you need. Everything else is ineffective garbage. Don't believe the hype. I've tried it all.
 Good price. Good product.
 worked wonders for me!
 Worth for the money spent
 very good
 simply amazing.
 Best protein powder I've ever bought.  Every time I try a different flavor I fall in love all over again.  Such good quality protein and tastes amazing.  I am currently on prep and my current favorite smoothie recipe is: 1 cup almond milk, 3 cups water, 1 frozen banana, 3 frozen strawberries and two scoops of the cake batter protein powder from ON.  Soooooooo goooooood and helps me curb my sweet cravings while satisfying my hungry tummy.  I would recommend to anyone looking for a good tasting protein.  I have tried a good majority of the flavors and they're all great.
 This is the best protein i've used by far. For those of you who don't know, Optimum Nutrition makes and packages all their supplements in their own factories as opposed to many other brands... which is one of the reasons they can put out such a high quality product.. tastes AMAZING (french vanilla creme is where its at) and completely dissolves in whatever you mix it with and goes down smooth. I'm no expert, but imo you can't go wrong with ON products.
 good
 Great and easy to use. Dissolves quickly!
 excelent
 Received quickly and great tasting as always.
 This is OPTIMUM NUTRITION
 All good
 Great protein that provides a lot of energy and recovery
 I really love ON whey protein powder and this SOUNDED great...but it has a very chemical taste.  Stick to vanilla or chocolate.......
 The best!
 I would rate 5 stars but the more I think about this, the more I get upset. I received my product April 2018, only to find that the product expired March of 2018. The thing is, I found out about this only after using it a couple times... I knew it tasted funky and once I had it the second time I had to investigate. I believe it is our right as customers to not have to worry about a product being expired - especially a product like this. I hope none of you have had this experience! I’m expecting a refund and/or another one.
 Love it, get it if you can
 As always.. The best.
 Best stuff, hands down. Only has what you need.
 excelente
 Good tasting and mixes well. Only just started to use it but seems good so far. I would recommend this.
 Great taste, but doesn't mix as well as I would like
 It is a really good protein ...
 I have been a long time user of this product, tastes great, priced even better!!
 All good
 Best protein supplement! Love it
 Good good
 it is really amazing to ship to China
 Excellent product!!  Flavor was very satisfying.
 It taste Awsome
 Excellent the best
 Good
 Good stuff, lasts long
 I did not like this product.  It had little black dots in the cookies and cream flavor that got everywhere.  I'd say look for a different flavor.
 Great product, great value
 Delicious. mixes great. not gritty. Tastes just like Chocolate milk.
 Cake batter is my favorite. Awesome product.
 Love it. Fast shipping.
 Great product
 The best
 Awesome, it really helped a lot on building muscles.
 Very tasty!
 How the product I can not say, because the effect is not easy to see.But then I see in costco similar goods only to find a big problem.Should properly seal sealed bottle, but I actually received the goods does not seal, you can directly tune inAfter all, this is for eating, not seal very assured, so I'm not happy, do not know to eat or do not eat.
 Great Product!
 Good price for 10lbs
 Excellent product.
 This has always been my protein of choice, it lasts for about 1.5 months and always tastes great. It is a great post workout drink that will give you the protein you need without anything you don't.
 I've tried a myriad of protein powders and they were either disgustingly horrendous tasting or did not mix well. This fill both voids. very delicious and mixes wonderfully in a shaker bottle. Will keep buying this as long as I supplement Protein.
 Nice product !
 Good
 Can improve on the taste side  and does get frothy leading to more to wash it down if you are consuming with water.
 Very good!
 Love it. I would attest to the quality of this product as I am truly convinced that protein powder is a great form of lean protein.  Optimum Nutrition provides a great product that I chose specifically for the quality after that whey is whey.
 This is a very good protein supplement. In the beginning I din't like the banana flavor but I got used to it and now I like it. On training days I drink it in the morning with low fat milk and one serving before and after training. I like to prepare on a blender because it gets a creamy flavor.
 Super goooooooood
 Great protein
 Great!
 Tastes like chocolate milk!
 THANKS.
 It is good.. just needs to be a little cheaper
 Delicious product!
 best flavor.
 Perfect
 THE BEST WHEY TO ME :D
 Best tasting whey protein I've ever tried!  Don't skip meals and add this to your routine and you should see improvement.
 Great protein!!! Taste good, and recover well from workouts. Excellent when you dont wanna eat another piece of dry chicken for dinner.
 The best one.
 I like this. It taste great for being a protein shake
 Tastes great. No aftertaste.
 I've received the product. Everything was ok!
 I am really satisfied,from buying and consuming this product of Amazon verified. I have been consuming this every day . so far so good.
 best whey protein out in the market, gives you fast results, great for recovery and it also digests pretty good
 A+++++
 Good and honest seller =)
 Pretty damn delicious.
 I wish they made this in 2# tubs, rather than just 5#ers. It tastes just like an almond joy bar.
 Good
 Of all the protein powders i've used, this is the best tasting and easiest to mix.  I prefer mixing most flavors with milk instead of water, but I've also had success with unsweetened almond milk and a bit of stevia. Of the flavors I've tried, on a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being some theoretically best tasting protein powder in the universe), I'd rate them:<br/><br/>Banana Cream:  9<br/>Rocky Road: 9<br/>Mocha Cappuccino: 8 (9 with a little actual coffee mixed in)<br/>Double Chocolate: 7<br/>Milk Chocolate: 4
 Quality product. Great value
 Good
 Best!
 This really does taste like coffee ice cream. I used a scoop with a cup and a half of soy milk. Excellent.
 Tastes so gouda!
 Excelent  product I recommend it, I recived the product faster and it was good and I recommend it al all.
 Wonderful.
 good quality. 5 lbs finish quickly, so I am glad I tool this product. That is it, three more words =)
 Great dela
 good
 Very good product
 Great
 Nice taste
 Yummy
 I'm a college student, and I workout everyday. This stuff has been a lifesaver to get me the protein I need before bed and after a workout. It is certainly worth the money.<br/><br/>I have tried Rocky Road for the last 6 months and love it. I think I'm going to try Extreme Milk Chocolate next, based on reviews.
 Excellent
 I've been using Optimum Nutrition since 2012. When I received the product the seal was not glued to the container. So I'm questioning whether the product has been tampered with &amp; the quality since the lid is not air tight. But more so the tampering of product. I've seen first hand in Nutrition stores where a less quality product has been used in a top brand container with label.
 tastes decent. I can work out for hours. I even did 12 pushups last night! Hopefully if I keep consuming this I will be able to 13 pushups in a day.
 Good
 It was all very good.....thank you!
 Great product
 love this
 Great product
 I like it. It is a very good product for people who go to the gym I really like it
 Goooood
 I've always been a fan of ON Whey protein.  Been using for years.  Tried a few other brands before, but they were nasty compared to this one.
 Is great

 Tastes like it's bad for you. Terrible.

 It is the best protein ever
 Vanilla is better than this taste
 i wont see the effect till i get really ripped. but i would say french vanilla taste better than chocolate. it's soooooooooo creamy
 Great product!
 Best there is in protein powders!
 Great taste
 Very tasty and high cost bennefit
 Best protein powder I have ever had. Im on very strict diet to lose my belly fat. I did very fast progress with protein powder supplement. My goal is to get 75gr protein. it is only possible with supplement. I put optimum protein powder in small travel containers ( designed for shampoo, soap etc) I take the protein powder during day in powder form without mixing with liquid. It tastes very good. it feels like gum when you directly eat in powder form.
 Nice！
 ok
 It was okay
 For the price and taste ON Whey Gold is really the best.  Have been using for 5 or 6 years and every now and then we try a small  package of a competitor and keep coming back to ON.
 nice product!
 very satisfied
 Excellent
 Always great!
 Taste is great, but definitely on the sweet side (hence 4 stars vs 5). Awesome price and I definitely make more gains and recover faster when using it daily.
 Awesome
 Good

 Very tasty. Me likey.
 The Double Rich Chocolate is not my favorite when I ordered it they were out of the Extreme Milk Chocolate the protein powder flavor of the gods. I wish it was 5 pounds of Extreme Milk Chocolate order Extreme Milk Chocolate.
 GUD
 Amazing
 Quality protein at a great price. Optimum nutrition produces quality products. I've never been let down by the quality of the various products that I purchased. I'm completely satisfied. Works as intended.
 Don't know if this product can go stale or bad, but something was definitely off.  I've ordered the smaller sizes of this product multiple times and the product always mixed up well.  Can't explain it but the taste was off. Final product was thinner/watery even after using same measurements and even putting in less milk.  Amazon was great to refund my money so I will go back to the smaller size.
 Excellent product!
 Love it.
 It came with no inside seal cover...
 I tried other products from different companies, but is not good as Whey Gold Standard, Delicious Strawberry.  I have been using this product for the past three years and I love it.  I used after working out to help my body recover.  I recommend this product to my friends and to those who works out extensively.
 I chose to love ot cause it really worked on me like a charm... maybe even too much for me
 I've used it for a while, however, recently I don't know what changes have been made to this product as it doe n't taste as it used to be earlier?<br/>It contains artificial sweetener. On the top of it, I found a ~ 2 inches long thread-like fiber in the box I recently bought. Not using it anymore.
 Very popular and good all-around: value, nutritive value (for what it is: focus on protein), taste.<br/><br/>Caveats are that the older, cheaper prices seem harder to find now, and that the cholesterol content is potentially high (at 10% of the day's allowance per serving, it can add up).
 Great
 Well I really like this protein , I have done a lot of research and this stuff is the best , it's a little bit too sweat but I just add more liquid and it taste just about right .
 I have bought it twice. The amazon price was the best I got. This was my first ON product and I am not dissapointed. Tastes excellent with milk. My shake usually consists of 300-350 ml of milk, one banana, 1 scoop of whey and 2 spoon of Hersheys. Choclate milk combo is also a good option.
 Great!
 I have yet to try Cake Donut, but Cookies and Cream tastes pretty good. I don't like using other proteins powders from different companies since I started buying from ON. Other companies' whey protein are chunky and hard to mix, but protein from ON blends in smoothly and tastes great.
 Delicious! I would recommend this product. It tastes great and mixes well with milk. No lumps or anything like that.
 Excellent!!
 Delicious product. Definitely can tel the difference when I stopped using. Taste good with water and tastes even better with milk specially when its cold. I sometimes add almonds and a little ice or peanut butter and some honey.
 I'm reviewing their customer service because the product is pretty self explanatory that it's whey. But I ordered this product about a month ago, and I never received it so I messaged their customer service and, with no hassle, they sent a new one. The only drag was the first shipment didn't have a tracking number so I couldn't watch it, but the second one did and I got it in a couple days. I'll definitely be ordering from Nutrition Discounters next time!
 Awesome
 Be prepared to receive a "ginormous" container... "I pick things up and put them down" kind of container! Taste is excellent great way to start the day.
 Great protein.  High protein per serving low price per serving.  Mixes well and taste great.  This is great for gaining or maintaining muscle.
 Excellent
 Very good!
 Great
 This Stuff is great. It mixes well, Tastes great, goes down easy. Doesn't bloat me or make my stomache upset. I take this every single day after my workout or mid morning between breakfast and lunch. It works great and has helped me pack on a few lbs. of lean muscle mass.
 Fantastic stuff
 Gains
 Great!
 Good product and taste very good. If you want put up some muscles go for it. The Chocolate flavor it's amazing
 Delicious
 good
 Quick shipping! Great Product!
 Great stuff
 i bought this bc for years i have read and heard ON whey was some of the best on the market.  I have tried so many other brands and had good and bad.  as far as the ingredients go this one seems to be pretty complete but taste......well there is barely any.  This is one of the worst tasting proteins i have ever had.  if i had to liken taste to anything it would be similar to playing outside as a kid and getting dirt in your mouth.  Sorry but thats the best way i could describe it.  for the price I paid i feel as though it was a huge let down.
 Mixes pretty well with spoon and water. Flavor isn't WOW but it goes down easy which if after you drink 20000 protein shakes all you care about is 'how easy does it mix and how fast can I chug this' and if you still care about taste then you are probably fat/a girl.
 Love this stuff! I was skeptical at first since It is double rich chocolate, and I had not tasted it before, but it is good! I typically mix 8-10oz of milk with it. I  drink it after a workout!
 While I am happy with this purchase as far as the shipping and quality of the product.  The taste is absolutely horrid.  Yes, it is that bad.  I will be trying a new flavor from the same company next time.
 good product.....i also add organic cocoa powder to strengthen the taste and organic hemp powder to get more protein and organic cinnamon for flavor and health benefits.  then shake it all up together.  i use a regular ball shaker and this blends nicely but you need good arm shaking skills  :-)
 Perfect
 Best protein ever!
 I bought the 5 pound double chocolate flavor. I have it every morning with low-fat milk. The taste is very acceptable in my opinion.
 I keep re-buying this whey protein! It works really well for me. I ache a lot less the next day because of this magical powder. It blends well in a standard shaker bottle. I like the extreme milk chocolate flavour!
 Perfect!
 Good deal
 Perfect
 my only criticism would be the taste. i've typically used the NOW Foods Whey Protein Strawberry 6 Pounds, which tastes amazing due to its higher sugar content... but i'm not that picky and this one is pretty good. i was so surprised at its mixing ability... not a single chunklet after the usual 10 seconds in a shaker. its a little high on the cholesterol side, so maybe avoid it if that's a concern of yours. overall - pleased with my purchase.
 Goo
 very good
 goood
 Very good product
 Great taste. Great product.
 Very good
 Very good quality
 Very good I'm buff
 Good
 Good stuff!
 I love the O.N. whet protein as the biggest part of protein supplements are: (1) calories (2) Taste (3) how easy it is to mix. Its a 10/10 in all those calories.
 Very happy
 Pros: quality, packaging, easy to mix.<br/>Cons: it's obviously nothing more than nutrition supplement, you'll need some Canada legal pills to make it work on 100% not 10%.
 Good！
 Good product, but, I ordered banana strawberry, I received banana cream, I'm sure it will be good but it's irritating, one time I ordered 5lbs and received a 2lb container, I didn't even complain then , I just considered I got screwed,  Orwell again
 it tasts FANTASTIC
 Great protein, at a great price!
 I've been using ON products for a few months now. This protein powder mixes well and has a nice smooth taste. I used to use a very popular whey protein but found it way too sweet. ON seems to have mastered the mixture. It's easy to drink and enjoyable. I don't dread drinking a protein shake anymore
 It taste  Like cake
 Very good
 Taste like I’m drinking cardboard.  No ideas how anyone thinks this is tasty.  Also the supplier shipped me a dented container with a broken seal. There was powder everywhere inside the undamaged box.
 Great taste
 Great product !!!
 I really like the whey gold standard product and have ordered it consistently for many years. However, this double rich chocolate bag I just ordered is awful. It tastes extremely unnatural and bothers my stomach everytime I take it. I originally thought it may have been the milk or the tap water I mixed in with my protein drink, but after using bottled water and a new bottle of milk my stomach is still upset when I take it. I will never order this flavor again.
 Great protein!!!
 Love it
 Its amazing
 It is very easy to drink and tasty. It melts very easily and can be digested in an hour. Hope the price goes down  though.
 Great
 This is very recommendable so far. I am not sure how much this product improve my muscle growth, but it is been all right.
 Great
 Great
 Good flavor. I am very sensitive to artificial sweeteners. I put one serving in my breakfast smoothie every morning. It sweetens but I don't notice the artificial sweetener much. Overall very good!!
 very good！
 I am a fan of this protein shake. Begin a vegetarian i don't get much protein on a daily basis and then i tried this.its a nutrition in a box. I consumed this throughout my pregnancy.Try this and you won't regret.
 Been using this brand for years and so far this is the best flavor i've tried.  Not sure if it's worth the preium price though.
 I've used this product for over 6 months now but this is my first time buying a 10lb bag. The 3 star rating is there because of amazon's slow shipping. It said "shipping soon" for 5 days now and so I'm pretty sure T'm going to get this item in a week. This is a big step back as opposed to my previous experience with amazon, which my product came in a total of 3 days.
 Taste great!
 One of the greatest tasting proteins I've had. Tasty, mixes well, and is mostly protein. Perfect post workout if you ask me.
 It tastes good.
 5lbs of protein for less money than 3lbs of other products (for example, GNC AMP). Dissolves very well, an entire serving in an 8 oz cup and it dissolves, I am not used to this. The product works, it's cheap, and above all, it's a supplement. It's there to help you, not do the work for you. Don't think twice, buy ON 100% Whey, and buy it from Amazon.
 Sent it back. Gives you terrible gas!
 👍👍👍👍👍👍
 Great
 Best whey ever.
 I am definitely happy with this protein powder. So far I have tried cookies and cream and extreme milk chocolate and loved them both. I mix it with chocolate milk and I think it tastes great! I tried it with warm water once, not the greatest option but still not too awful. Overall, I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is thinking of investing in protein powder.
 I've used this stuff for everyday for the past year. it tastes good the end.
 I have purchased this protein about 5 or 6 times now. I just bought Strawberry and Rocky Road to try something new. I'm not sure if something has change with the product in the last 6 months, but I don't really like either flavor. The Rocky Road actually makes me feel sick. I wish I had stuck with the Chocolate Malt as that and the other Chocolate flavor are great. Strawberry is ok, a bit weak tasting. Next time I will stick to what I like.
 Between a dialed gym regimen this protein, and the matching creatine and bcaa's i put on 25lbs of muscle in 3 months. I tell everyone i know whos interested in lifting about this stuff.
 Why? Why is this $60? I've bought protein for years. It used to be more reasonable. But I'm not going to buy it anymore. These greedy companies just keep jacking up their prices? For what? Someone tell me why this product cost anywhere NEAR enough to charge this much.<br/><br/>BODY BUILDERS, DON'T BUY IT ANYMORE. SEE HOW FAST THE PRICES COME BACK DOWN.<br/><br/>I refuse to be ripped off anymore. The protein is good. It mixes well with water or milk. The flavor is ok (some better than others. The chocolate peanut butter was great (that may have been the ON casein). Coffee flavor is the last one I bought. Good flavor. BUT NO MORE BEING RIPPED OFF.
 Tastes great!  Don't know why the little girls on here have to complain about the recipe?  If you want something that tastes like ice cream, the buy ice cream... sheesh.
 My husband likes the taste of this powder, but I don't care for the taste. I prefer the taste of GNC Amplify XL, but its to expensive<br/>so we will continue to buy Optimum Nutrition protein powder. We ordered cookie &amp; cream.
 Love ON protein products. Some of the highest quality protein.<br/>Helps me keep my lifts going up and building that lean muscle.<br/><br/>Taste is not as good as other chocolate flavors of this product, but still good.
 In terms of what it is, its protein, hard to mess up from a reputable brand. It arrived fine in shipping. I got the extreme chocolate milk flavor which I mix with unsweetened almond milk. It tastes good, a lot like chocolate milk, maybe even like the real thing if you make it with real milk, which I haven't done.
 Thanks
 Double chocolate is so good. I put a banana, 1-2 scoops of powder , 10 strawberries, 1 cup of skim milk, and ice in a blender for a 350-450 calorie breakfast every morning.
 I ordered the white chocolate flavor and its just too sweet. Doesn't taste healthy at all
 Super delicious. I recommend mixing with Lactaid regular milk.<br/>I mixed it with water and it was pretty nasty.
 First time buyer... the Chocolate Malt tastes great. My favorite part is that when I get lazy on doing dishes and run out of shaker bottles it does perfectly fine being stirred in with a spoon and does not leave clumps like the GNC brand I always used to use. 10/10
 GREAT PRODUCT GREAT GLASS GREAT BEER GREAT GREAT GREAT A+ ALMOST AT THE WORD MINIMUM SO i CAN SUBMIT THIS REVIEW, GOT IT.
 Very good product.. Fast delivery... Good Price.... What else Can a small pennis  ask for......
 Tastes Great
 This product is low calorie and high protein.  Could be used by anyone wanting/needing more protein in their diet without adding a lot of extra calories..
 I think this is one of the best proteins out there. It's great tasting, lots of servings and a decent prices. Also mixes easily and doesn't upset the stomach
 Great!
 Fantastic product!  I use this as a meal replacement for breakfast and sometimes a post workout meal.  Its delicious and keeps you feeling full and energized for several hours.  I use a Ninja system to blend it and have not tried just the stirring or shaking method.
 Great product. Still sealed when arrived, but the screw cap was not fully sealed so powder was all over the rim when I first opened it, a bit dropped on my floor.
 The extreme milk chocolate is crazy delicious! With water or milk.
 Taste is always subjective, but this one is pretty good.  Clumps a bit when made and requires a vigorous shaking to mix but otherwise a good product.
 When I was originally looking for a protein supplement I got started with Optimum Nutrition Double Rich Chocolate (5-pounds).  While I was pleased with it, I decided to look into a few alternative brands.  I can't claim that with any brand I felt a big physical difference.  That said I am using whey protein more as a supplement, so I rarely had more than one serving a day and at times did not have any if I felt my food that day supplied adequate protein.  (Yeah, it took me a while to get through five pounds of this stuff.)<br/><br/>- Cost/Pricing<br/>One misconception I had as I looked for protein was that comparing price per pound.  I thought I was making a good comparison of the cost of each, where it really makes more sense for me to compare price per serving.  Since the other two main proteins I tried had a serving size 30-45% larger, the containers I was buying would not last any where near the same length.<br/><br/>For example, the 2.91 pounds of Syntha-6 I bought was not bad on price, but only contained 30 servings because of its huge serving size.  The fact that almost three pounds would only last me a month or so made it a much more costly protein.  Here's a break down of serving sizes.<br/><br/>Serving Sizes (in grams):<br/>Optimum Nutrition - 30.4g - (24g protein)<br/>Six-Star - 39g - (26g protein)<br/>Syntha-6 - 44g - (22g protein)<br/><br/>- Artificial Sweetners<br/>The other disappointment with the two other protein powders was they both use Sucralose (witch is more or less Splenda).  Particularly with the Syntha-6 that advertises on their container that they do not use Aspartame, it is a little deceptive to just replace it with a different artificial sweetener.  Everyone varies a bit on their take of artificial sweeteners; personally I avoid them, at least in anything I would be consuming on a regular basis.  With that said, understand Optimum Nutrition is using Acesulfame Potassium as an artificial sweetener in their whey protein.  I am torn on how I should feel about that; it is something I would rather avoid.<br/><br/>- Taste<br/>Syntha-6 was the best tasting of the powders I tried, but considering it contains six grams of fat (two grams saturated fat), it really should taste pretty good.  Fat content is something that I think people freak out about a little too much at times.  Syntha-6 is actually intend as a meal replacement as well as a protein supplement, so it makes sense they would have a higher fat content.  Depending on your goals or nutritional needs that may or may not be a good thing.  I saw it more as a negative since I was simply looking for a way to add protein to my diet, particularly after exercise.  Meal replacement isn't something I am too interested in... meal addition is more up my alley ;)  (Optimum Nutrition has 1 gram of fat per serving)<br/><br/>- Conclusion<br/>Of any protein I have tried for a decent amount of time (at least three weeks) Optimum is still my favorite.  The taste is good, especially when mixed with milk; and as most have said it mixed pretty easily.  I order another five pound container, it will take me a while to get through that.  The down side that I still find with it is the use of Acesulfame Potassium, but I have yet to find a good powder with no artificial sweeteners just yet.  Over all I would recommend it, has not given me any adverse side effects, like gas or discomfort.  (I always think it is a good idea though to try a new supplement at half dose instead of full to get an idea of how it will effect you.)
 Best protein on the market. No need to look elsewhere. Great for taking right admirer a heavy workout or taking in the afternoon for a quick afternoon pick me up. My go-to protein. Optimum all the way. Vanilla ice cream is the best.
 This protein mixes easily with milk and has a satisfying taste to it. Works great when making shakes in the blender as well.
 Fabulous protein. Reviews are great and, it is working for me. If you work out or just do not get the protien needed daily this is for you. Will definitely buy more.
 Tastes disgusting, I have been going to the gym recently and wanted to start taking protein to build muscle. Bought this Bc of the reviews and man was I disappointed. It doesn't even taste like chocolate, more like a bunch of artificial chemical taste.
 I tried this item and taste was horrible, if feels like drinking a water with iron rust contaminate, plus it has many things that's unnatural, you can read the Scooby detail article about this and other ON products in general.<br/>http://scoobysworkshop.com/2011/04/07/boycott-optimum-nutrition-100-natural-protein-powder/<br/>bottom line, it is bad in eery aspect, taste, ingredients, price. these product should be used to maintain good health and this one may do the opposite.
 When I opened the box the bag had a puncture hole and some of it was pouring out. I used a knife to open the box but I have received plenty of items in the mail and know how to properly cut with out hitting the contents. Plus where the hole is was no where near where I even cut the tape. I'm a little upset because this makes the item that I wanted to consume questionably not fresh and I have to find a new container to transfer it to.
 I use this protein as my pre and post workout drink, and unlike other brands, it does not make me feel bloated.  My overall strength has definitely improved while using this protein.
 Had the mocha cappuccino and is probably the best tasting protein powder I have ever had.  Tastes great in water and milk.  Been using ON for the last 6 years.
 this almost certainly gave me food poisoning. probably just a tainted batch?<br/>my reasoning:<br/>1) didn't eat anything new / surprising / different besides this for 2 days previous<br/>2) had a standard 24hr bug bout of food poisoning starting within 8 hours of eating this<br/>3) tried a small halfscoop a few days later, felt nauseous again. guess I had to be sure... my burps taste like mold right now.
 I can't believe they changed the formula for my favorite flavor vanilla ice cream. It tastes disgusting now way too sweet
 this product is great mixes well and it's a fast release of protein so it's not thick the only thing why i'm not using it is because i'm not working out but I'll start tomorrow
 The flavor is not the most delicious in the market, but the protein works perfectly. I saw the growth I was expecting in my muscles and maybe more
 Good stuff mix easy taste OK...got dig to find scoop...Reconsidered taste quality after comparison test.  Still like but not the best taste.
 Hi,<br/><br/>For some reason this 10-lb ON Gold Standard Double Chocolate that I received does not taste like anything! I've tried this exact product multiple times, and have been loyal to ON for 4 years (consuming probably 10lbs a year). But, this last batch I received tastes terrible! It tastes nothing like chocolate, and the texture is a bit off. Please let me know what I can do, because this must have been a part of a bad batch...<br/><br/>Regards,<br/>Gus
 I've had optimum nutrition numerous times in my life. But I'm not sure if I believe this is actual optimum nutrition. It mixes like nesquick and has no sort of density. I don't want to be absurd and say someone is selling some random chocolate drink mix in optimum nutrition containers but something is going on here..
 This is my favorite protein powder. Every flavor I have gotten tastes great and mixes well. Helps my muscles feel better too after a hard workout.
 the chocolate malt is by far the best tasting gold standard whey protein I have had yet!  great product as well, I can see results
 Banana Cream is a remarkably deilicous flavor. Give your mouth this wonderful banana orgasm while you muscle up and tear stuff up at the gym!
 I have been using Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard for the past year now.  I always purchase it from a popular place by my house.  The pricing on Amazon is so much better an with prime, product came really fast.  This time I ordered the French Vanilla Creme, per other reviewers ratings but have yet to try it as I want to finish the prior one that I have opened.  I previously purchased Tropical Punch.  If you are not able to mix it with milk (Atkins so water only), it isn't the best choice; ok and doable but there are much better flavors out there.  I hope the reviews of the French Vanilla Creme are correct; which I am sure they will be.  Happy Shakes!
 I will make my comments very short and crisp as there are very good reviews listed under this product category. I would say this product is somewhat in-between very expensive and very cheap, useless protein products. If you are a jogger, play tennis, spend time in Cardio and spend time in muscle toning then this is for you. If you want to get monster muscle then look for another product.<br/><br/>"Understand" what you want from your body. This does a good job in keeping your energy level high and overall you have a feel good factor. Hope this helps.
 I really don't enjoy working out. Even so, I begrudgingly subject myself to a sweaty torture session a couple times a week because I think it'd be fun to live to 100 and have robots spoon-feed me tapioca.<br/><br/>The one, single thing I enjoy about working out is my post-workout protein smoothie. I don't really have time to cook a real meal after working and then going to the gym so in lieu of a meal, I created the best meal-replacement smoothie known to mankind. Frozen blueberries, greek yogurt, a little frozen kale (I promise you won't taste it), peanut butter, almond milk, and just a little bit of vanilla protein powder. This is not a protein shake. This is a meal replacement that incorporates a small amount of whey protein to give it a little more substance and it is SO GOOD (normally). Today, I made my smoothie with about half a scoop of Optimum Nutrition Vanilla Ice Cream flavored whey protein and I swear it was absolutely vile. I don't really know how to describe the taste beyond a sickeningly sweet, artificial vanilla-ish flavor that overpowers absolutely everything else it's blended with. The greatest smoothie that has ever existed became absolutely impossible to stomach with just a dash of this stuff.<br/><br/>I am not a health nut. I am not a gym rat. I'm just a simple man who needs something to look forward to after a workout and this stuff robbed me of that experience (and about 25 bucks) today. And now I am grumpy.
 Love it and can't get enough. This is my favorite flavor. The other taste... off to me. so if you like chocolate get this one.
 It is different from What I ordered! the label and the ingredient that are written are totally different, it might still be the same protein powder, with another label! It is weird! and I cannot return it. it should be ok, but when you do not get sth as it is described , u r not happy!
 I've been a customer for the last 5 years.  Gold Standard Lives up to its standard.  Trust, Reputation, and Quality 100%.
 This is a great product as far as 'style' goes, however it's not entirely gold standard, nor 100% whey.<br/><br/>The Amazon page comments on how it is 'Packed with whey protein isolates'. This isn't the case, it's a combination of isolate and concentrate and has a total protein content of only 75%.<br/><br/>I usually use an isolate with an over 90% protein content, I'm currently using a 95% isolate. It's not acceptable to me to have a 'gold standard' whey 'packed' with isolate that is as high in cholesterol, etc as this product.<br/><br/>That said it mixes superbly and tastes great with milk or water, but I'm not using it again. I used it as I was in the USA on business, I will stick to my specialist retailer's product, which is pure isolate, lower in cholesterol and lower in carbs.<br/><br/>It would be good if Amazon could mention that the serving size is a 32g scoop, it'd put the 24g of protein per serving into perspective.
 The container was missing its seal around the lid. I'm hoping the product wasn't tampered with. For all I know someone dumped out the ON Whey and put cheaper filler in and sold it. Also this product was expired upon delivery.
 I ordered the Cookies n Cream flavor. It doesnt really taste like cookies n cream, more like a coffee flavor still tastes great though. Mixes very easily in a shaker bottle or even in a cup with a spoon. Anyway I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a high quality whey that wont break your bank.
 I like the flavor of Gaspari Myofusion cookies and cream better. This brand does not taste as rich as the Myofusion does. Will not buy this brand again.
 Discovered that the product has been reformulated.  It now uses an artificial sweetner (which I have been told by a doctor to avoid) and tastes much worst than before.  Will not buy again.
 Best tasting bang for your buck! I really feel like I get my moneys worth with this and it's an awesome source of protein..I enjoy drinking this a couple times a day!
 The flavor of the extreme milk chocolate is absolutely amazing. It mixes well in milk too. Great results so far with putting on mass.
 The best on the market. If you don't think so I'll gladly arm wrestle you and win due to my Optimum Nutrition fortified muscles.
 Bought this for my son, who big into working out and weight lifting. It offers a great blast of protein and tastes good too.
 I've been buying ON Whey Protein for over 10 years now and still continue too.  Its a great product thru and thru.  I've never had any issues and will continue to buy it.
 estoy muy contento con la rapidez con que fue enviado el producto, solo tardo 2  dias en llegar a miammi- mas tardo quien me lo trajo el pais.
 I want to turn this stuff into ice cream and lick it off my girlfriends stomach in an attempt to make sick gainz.
 Cookies and Cream tastes better than double rich chocolate and Rocky Road.  Also dissolves more readily for whatever reason.
 I had this product on Subscribe &amp; Save with 15% discount for $72, now the price has gone up to $79 for S&amp;S, and from $84 to $93 without S&amp;S... Ridiculous price increase on Amazon. Still available on Bodybuilding.com for $84 - 10% off coupon for $74... its sad to see I will no longer be purchasing this from Amazon from now on.
 Rocky Road - VERY TANGY and delicious, more of a sweet after taste than double rich chocolate.  If I had to pick again I would probably pick rocky road, but there is definitely a sweet aftertaste that I'm not a super huge fan of.  Anyway the protein is bulletproof and I trust it, and am happy with it.  Gained 15 pounds since July (it's Feb. now) and I'm sure the whey didn't hurt.
 It's the gold standard for a reason. Quality protein and I like the taste. I wish it didn't have the sugar though.
 Hi,<br/>  This the third Whey I bought. The problem is this bottle tastes very different from the previous two. There is a very strong smell in the powder. Can you guys take it back to do some test?<br/><br/>Peng Chen
 This stuff tastes like crap. Don't waste your time or money. It's not even good with milk. And it's expensive.
 Disappointing
 I have been a happy consumer of ON brand health and fitness products forever and love it. Using everything from their creatine to casein to whey. This product isn't as advertised; it's nowhere near strawberry in flavor nor delicious. It can't can't be stomached. Please contact me about a refund or replacement with different flavor this just won't work whatsoever.
 Cookies n' cream tastes like something you'd feed an animal. Also this appears to be causing me stomach pain. Rather have thrown the 60 dollars out.
 This is a great product! I got myself a good deal when I bought it so it is worth it even at full price. Great protein! I recommend it!
 I was a little upset. Tasted almost identical to my cookies and cream. But can't complain about the macros. Optimum nutrition is the best
 Got Rocky Road, it was good for the first couple weeks but got tired of it fast, to the point where I don't ever want Rocky Road again lol. Honestly only got Rocky Road cause I heard good reviews about the flavor. Recommend mixing the Whey Protein with milk or make some shake out of it. With water, its decent in the beginning but gets gross after a while. Trying French Vanilla next!
 Best protein in the world for quite some time now. Pure protein with extra bcaa included. Definitely worth what it costs.
 Disgusting
 This is a really good product, particularly for the price you get it at from Amazon. 24grams of protein in only 120 calories is a about as good as you can get and the taste is better than most other protein powders. Which isn't to say that it tastes great, but it does taste better.
 I honestly hated all the protein shakes I have ever had. I heard the double rich chocolate was good so I went for it. I actually do not mind the taste at all. The best way that I explain it to everyone is that if you were to warm it up, it would taste like hot chocolate. I recommend this flavor over any of the ones I have ever had.
 Use warm (not hot) water and it leaves zero clumps after just a few stirs, no need for a shaker bottle. Optimum Nutrition also has about 90% of the protein they claim on the label, versus the 72% actual protein in Trader Joe's and 54% found in Body Fortress's whey protein.
 Purchased the double choco variety and thought it was great.  Dissolved the best of any whey protein we've tried so far, and it tasted good too.
 Taste like  Pepto-Bismol. Do not get the delicious strawberry flavor. Get double rich chocolate, extreme chocolate or the mocha  cappuccino.
 Optimum whey is simply the best and has worked for me over the years.....but why does the price keep rising EVERY TIME I PURCHASE HERE??<br/><br/>Used to be $35...then $40ish....now $52.99??? for a tub of powder??
 The price of the product was good when I bought it but I was very disappointed with the taste of it.
 Don't buy this product. I've been working at a gym for 3 months. Price, ok  any sealing problem? no, taste? yes! there is a problem with taste.<br/><br/>I bougt cookies and cream. First few days, it was ok. and then after 1 month, the taste was changed somehow. I can smell really strong chemical scent from the jar which feels not good. Now I don't want to drink it and will throw it to garbage can. what a waste!!
 Great tasting and mixes well in water.
 This product was not approved by a major consumer awareness lab for having improper listing of ingredients.
 This is a great product. I use it twice a day to help reach my current protein requirements. I got the Rocky Road flavor, which isn't bad, but it sort of tastes like cheap chocolate, so I would recommend a different flavor. It's great if you decide to throw a little bit of peanut butter or a banana into your shake, though.
 one of the best flavors, I love coffee and it's a nice taste for this product, the protein is very good too, recommended
 Tastes so nasty, does not taste good at all. I think I'll just stick to their platinum protein instead.
 pros:<br/>-tastes great with water and milk, as long as you use 1under 12 oz per scoop<br/>-easy to mix with blender bottle<br/>-first time you drink it may taste a bit off, but you'll soon get used to it and crave this flavor<br/><br/>cons:<br/>-more expensive than other brands, but it's definitely worth the extra
 &lt;3 it. Love the flavor too! Idk if it works but I only drink about 10 scoop  1 scoop each day].
 Cake batter not the best flavor, bad after taste.  But does help with food craving and gives me energy
 Some of the best tasting protein I have come across. I used it exclusively for years.<br/>Great taste
 The cake batter flavor has a terrible chemicaly sweet taste and aftertaste, I've had to find ways to hide it in baked foods or smoothies since drinking it straight is nearly impossible.
 This is a great protein.  The flavor is awesome, it mixes well and does what its suppose to.  I've bought more than 10 of these.
 This is the only whey I buy. I have tried chocolate, vanilla and strawberry  (not into the unique flavors offered) and all taste great. I mix in smoothies for breakfast or use a shaker cup on the go before or after a workout.
 Supposed to be the best whey protein but it's causing headaches. I started with 1 scoop with milk and got a bad headache so I stopped and the headaches went away. Again after 10 days I started a scoop post workout and the headaches started and in addition I got fever too. Please test before buying!!!
 This beautifully crafted tub will tie your room together. Set it on your shelf to give visitors a lasting impression of your home.
 I've tried about 10 of the flavors and multiple brands of whey protein...optimum always takes the cake. My favorites are chocolate malt and double chocolate. the vanilla flavors are "eh" - if you're unsure, it's a toss-up between any of the chocolate flavors. love this stuff.
 great protein powder. I would have probabl y gotten chocolate flavor but beggars cant be choosers
 Delicious strawberry is not an exaggeration. This is my favorite meal of the day, three times a day.
 Great protein!! Definitely will buy again!
 Tastes great! Use it after my runs, and helps me get through the day without being sore at all. Thank you!
 Best whey protein on the market. Period! I use it in smoothies and it blends well and tastes great.
 This is the best stuff. You can pay $80+ for this at your gym or buy it on here for much cheaper. It tastes great. Goes great with milk.
 Been ordering this product for a while now off Amazon. This time around however, the seal keeping the powder fresh was completely broken. This is also the first time there was a preworkout sample package in the container. I tried the powder and it definitely taste off, so beware of that. Now I have to go through the hassle of possibly returning the product... Quite annoyed.
 switched to this from muscle milk--all i can say is this--GAINS. GAINS EVERYWHERE<br/><br/>highly recommended<br/><br/>buy for your son, make them strong like bull
 I was excited by this product because it was my first type of protein supplement and it worked out really well. Take it before and after you workout and by the end of the tub I gained 15 pounds. Went from 187 to 202. Would definitely recommend, it tastes really good as well.
 Double chocolate in milk is palatable. The 10-lb bag is also more economical than smaller packaging. I have been using it for several years as a protein source being a vegetarian.
 Good taste and performance met expectations. Amount for the price is a good value.
 Amazing product, tastes great
 I received the chocolate on time and I have to say that it works beautifully. My recovery of muscles were good to the point to where I felt no soreness the next day and allowed my muscles to get stronger. This did the job that it promised to do for not a bad price either. Good product.
 Awesome!  Tastes great and easy to mix in to other foods and shakes.
 What can I say? Great product, great price. I highly recommend the double rich chocolate flavor.
 This is a well recognized protein. It should satisfy the average protein user.
 My wife loves this stuff - swears by it, says is the best so I'll write that here.
 tastes good<br/>dissolves well
 works good
 Not sure if I am getting stronger or bottle is getting lighter with every scoop. Either ‘whey’ (get it?) I consume it like a human.
 I have been using this for a long time and recommend it. This is a reorder.
 the double rich chocolate tasted like crap.. probably the worst whey i ever tasted.. maybe its the companys malfunciton.. all i taste is unsweetened milk chocolate with some protein... srsly where the freak is the sugar.. god dang it.. 1/2 in already.. cant wait to switch over to MTS cookies n cream mint... same price and way better than this piece of crap
 This product does not blend well.  Hot water, cold water, tepid water all leave chunks of powder. Will not order again.
 As a Spartan Racer, I decided I needed a little support with my exercise routine to help muscle synthesis.
 I thing its not original (fake)
 Tried the Mocha Cappuccino, Rocky Road, and Double Rich Chocolate. By far I like the Double Rich Chocolate the best. Mocha is alright. Rocky Road is almost undrinkable as I feel it has a super artificial smell and taste. I'll be buying the Double Rich Chocolate next time! (maybe sooner than later if I cant find a way to mask the rocky road taste)
 Caused kidney stones for me according to the doctor. Passed 2 in about a 10 day stretch. I'm sure this works well for some if not most people but I am not among that group. Taste was decent though.
 As a coffee lover, don't buy the Mocha Cappuccino flavor if you plan on drinking it with water. The taste is pretty bad. Only way to make this flavor okay to drink is by mixing it with milk. Go with the Double Rich Chocolate flavor.
 Too expensive !! I can save myself 20$ and get a larger quantity
 i have used it about for a now and i dont think it works at all..also I have used so many different brands of protein and this ones taste is clearly the worst one ever.. it doesn’t even taste like chocolate. As a person Who were usually satisfied with ON PRODUCTS, im really unsatisfied and full of regrets for purchasing this product..
 Great tasting and mixes easily. Super large size will last a long time!
 Optimum is simply the best I do not need to write a review for this
 This is not the first time I order ON protin, but I don't know what is wrong with it this time! The powder don't desolve easly and I always find pieces in it.
 Before I used this stuff I was 57 years old and completely out of shape. Now I'm in my thirties and can lift pianos with one hand.
 Best protein I've ever had hands down. Tastes well, mixes well, and feels like it actually works. I can use it with pancake mix as well. I haven't had the courage to try any flavor besides chocolate or vanillaso I can't speak on them. Vanilla is my favorite as well.
 Not chalky. Great for mixing! Great with fruit too. I blend it, it makes a shake consistency. Great flavor!
 This is a Best Protein shake. Taste is very good. I love extreme chocolate flavor
 I just got my Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Protein yesterday. Well i had a good workout today and I was excited about taking the Tropical Punch flavor. Once I tasted it.. well it wasnt too great. It kinda tasted liked tropical punch but it tasted like medicine or tropical punch with a milky flavor.
 I knew I was taking a gamble buying into the the label and what all the protein has to offer. I'm sure it's packed with all sorts of good stuff I need which I like, but the Chocolate Mint flavor is not good, barely tastes like chocolate and does not have a mint flavor at all. Guess I'm stuck with a big tub of tasteless whey....
 I've used a lot of the GNC products, and I can say that this is the best overall product for the price. High quality protein for a reasonable price, mixes well, and tastes great.
 Tastes great.  Good protein and low sugar.  Great in my smoothies.  Thank you!
 My fiance works out all the time. He has purchased this a few times now.
 This is perfect to be added to the burn fat process and prevent the muscle loss.<br/><br/>It comes with a 10cc scoop, its pretty funny because it says to take 32 grams per serving and the scoop shows CC.<br/><br/>A full scoop of 10cc is equal to 31.8 grams.<br/><br/>GOOD LUCK.
 If you want gainz, you will buy this product.  It is strawberry and it is delicious.  Got massive gainz after usage.
 Gross tasting no matter what I put in the smoothie. Yuck!!!
 I'm a celiac and dairy intolerant.<br/><br/>If you are in the same boat I wouldn't recommend. Always left me nauseated, gassy, and sometimes with the runs. Plus I'm not convinced that this proteins quality is any better, but they jack the price up because its Optimum.
 Taste best with milk rather than water... However I found that it doesn't disolve completely... Just shake well and leave it for an hour..u will find the power resides at bottom....but overall it's good
 I love this Whey protein. It's always been consistently one of top best protein powders in the market. Great taste too. I just wished it wasn't so expensive.
 Great results, clean product, easy to digest, ZERO bloating
 味道很不错，有浓郁的巧克力味。不过在一大罐蛋白粉吃完之前，你也许想换换口味，所以如果你用量大的话，可以买两三种口味的一起吃，或者每种口味只买一小罐。（Taste very good, rich chocolate flavor. However, in a large pot of protein powder before eating, you may want a change of taste, so if you large amount, you can buy two three flavors together to eat, or every taste only buy a small can.）
 Just the best protein you can buy. Been lifting for 8 years and never have drank anything else. Low in carbs and fat which is good for a guy my size - 6 foot 5 250 lbs.
 this is the standard protein for most people for a good reason. good taste, good mix-ability, good quality (whey isolates)
 Best flavor hands down. Been ordering it for almost a year now and Amazon is the cheapest. I've ordered at bodybuilding.com, massnutrition.com, ebay, all of them. The most bang for your buck = Amazon. Check for yourself if you don't believe me :)
 So far I really like it! Not really anything negative to say about it other than the flavor I got. The cookies and cream is really sweet luckily there are so many flavors to choose from.
 I have been consuming ON's Whey for a while and always liked the taste. However, the last one I bought is weird, thin, and looked like it had expired. Looking at the recent reviews I see that it is not the same anymore... now I have 5lbs of disgusting whey to consume until I can try a new one...
 Super easy to order online and great price!
 If you are prone to fever blisters this product will give you frequent ones
 didn't work and went back to my regular powder
 My husband love this ! We drink this before to go to the gym
 It is the best whey protein product available in the market... Love this product ..have been using it for last two years....
 Great price, and awesome product!
 I recieved it without manufacture date and batch number
 great value. Tastes pretty good
 Love it a lot !! The best protein out there and taste very good too.
 Lots of different flavors, all taste pretty decent.
 great protien as usual from gold standard
 Best protein out there, tastes great too.
 I bought this exact container of double chocolate 6 months ago and it was great. This container has a very bland taste and isn't good to drink.. I wish I could get a replacement tub from Amazon. This new container is not expired so I'm not sure what the problem is.
 Tastes good and dissolves well.
 Always a great choice! Works perfectly, not too thick and not too watery. Double rich chocolate never gets old and it helps so much with workout recovery. Highly recommend for anyone looking to add more protein easily into their day.
 Love this product. Shipped real fast.
 I did it Arnold. I am finally muscles.
 Love the flavor, not too rich or too sweet. Enjoy that I can mix up with a little ovaltine or PB2 to change up the flavor if I get bored with the "plain" double chocolate. No chalky flavor or weird aftertaste either.
 Taste great. Outstanding whey protein.
 Only brand I trust. Wish it was cheaper
 Tastes good with milk or water
 good price on Whey. Good taste,
 it tastes not as good as the one in Costco, and it is cheaper at Costco, i don't recommend to buy
 excellent product thanks
 the best and my favorite protein powder
 great quality and price.
 Works good tastes good
 best protein out there. no doubt.
 This is a great way to stock up on protein...the cookies and cream flavor is very good. I would reccommend to anyone seriously attaining a fit body. This vendor was great to work with.
 Not one of the better tasting ON whey powders.
 I've tried a lot of different whey protein and this is the best by both performance and taste.
 Tastes good. Has protein.
 Good protein works great.
 Mixes very well, tastes a little like cake batter but more just a very good vanilla flavor. If you like vanilla this is a very good choice.
 It's just as expected
 Great Product! Great Taste.
 Best on the market. Can't beat it.
 The best Taste like s*** though gonna try new flaver
 Still good because it's gold standard, but it's my least favorite that I've had.
 tastes like chocolate shake
 Good product for great price
 Product has good flavor, mixes well!
 This protein is def one of the best. i use this right after a workout and in the morning or mid day. and its a great taste.
 love the taste
 I prefer the Vanilla Ice Cream.
 Very good protein one the best
 The only protein I will use!
 The new flavour is just disgusting. It is ultra sweet impossible to drink . Terrible!!!!
 After researching , I decided on this brand and this flavor. Excellent on both counts and at a good price. I mix it with milk. Since it does not supply carbs, I will add a cup or so of chocolate milk to this protein powder to replenish glycogen and protein after exercising. Just ordered the Double Dutch Chocholate flavor.
 Very good, I like it!
 I just saw my chest muscle move today. Never Before. That's crazy !  And price is good.
 Whey protein is good for your soul.
 Don't like the taste 😜
 Great!
 gains
 It tastes caulky to me.
 I FEEL LIKE IM ON STERIODS
 Blends pretty well in a shaker cup and it tastes pretty good compared to many other protein powders. Would definitely recommend if you lift :)
 Can't beat the price!
 We have ordered this flavor for years but this last batch was disgusting.  Not sure whether we received a bad container or if they have changed it.  Definitely going to have to switch it up.
 First time protein buyer, this product recommended by many friends. Great price, great taste, great value. Would recommend to anyone
 I love ON products
 this is huge,and too big,and we cant bring back.so just give somebody else for present . but this is very good drink for gym
 Great product, very easy to mix, tastes great, and quite effective.
 came as is!
 Great product!
 I use this nearly every day, still tastes pretty good. Sometimes I add some chocolate syrup to change it up. I would buy more flavors, but it's too big to store a whole bunch.
 Smells bad after a couple if week<br/><br/>s and taste isn't good. The chocolate is way better. I want buy this one again.i think they should discontinue this flavor for sure.
 awesome
 Best on the Market
 I pick whey up and chug it down.
 Great taste, mixes great with everything. Taste amazing with water. I mix it with cherios with yogurt with pretty much anything and it taste amazing. grind it with some ice and water and u got urself a cold coffee lol.
 Just did not agree with my digestion.
 good stuff!!
 This is the best protein powder ever.  More protein grams, less calories, and less carbs than all the others I've tried.  Tastes great too!
 I have taken On Whey protein for years and this time the product arrived open with another flavor. It also does not mix properly as the otherps I have bought. It may be because there was a hole in the product for a long time, or because it is not the original product.
 Good
 Good
 This is my favorite protein in any flavor!
 This is a great product for supplemented protein. The extreme milk chocolate tast pretty good. My only complaints is that it's a bit pricey and when you blend the proten, it becomes fizzy. Which is really annoying to drink and taste weird.
 I don’t normally write reviews. The seal on my container was broken/opened. Maybe someone returned it and I got the one with broken seal? Anyways I’m too lazy to return it so I will just use it. Hopefully I don’t die. Cheers!
 perfect
 My go-to whey protein. Never been disappointed. And great chocolate flavor.
 Great item love it.
 I have the product  and I have used  a little bit  but I have notize  that is not like real I would love to get my money  back or the half  of my money back and send back the product  because I m disapointed
 Tasty
 GOOD.
 Arrived already open, only the seal was blocking it from the open air. Now I have no idea if I actually got 5 pounds worth because the top 1/4th is empty, but maybe it would've been like that anyway even if it was sealed. Either way, still unsanitary.
 Not but flavor which is a good thing
 Excellent
 Just what I wanted
 Great as usual
 Almost a month already and i love it!!<br/>I wish they lower the price thats all!!<br/><br/>Thanks optimun nutrion whey
 Works great for post workout.  I use to go to he bathroom once a day.  Now my max is 3.
 good good~~ very good~
 Not sure if it works but tantes good.
 I love this protein powder, best stuff on the market.
 Good protein, little calories with a good amount of protein.  What your looking for when your cutting
 I tried out this flavor after having Chocolate flavor for a while. This Cookies and Cream flavor has a strong taste of powdered milk. If that's your thing, then by all means.
 MIxed with water is amazing. No bs. I could drink it like it was just water. Its a #1 rated drink for a reason.
 FAST shipping. Product came as shown! No problems whatsoever.
 Taste: The banana creme flavor is quite tasty<br/>Quality: It is one of the best protein powders in the market<br/>Easily soluble in water/ milk and can be consumed in a variety of ways<br/>Delivers very good results
 Great taste! Mixes well.
 Great source of protein - mixes easily
 Got good reviews so I tried it.  I can barely keep it down.  Maybe it's just me but I have tried better producta
 Didn't like the flavor but good product.
 It's the best deal in high quality whey protein mix.
 Yummy!  Also tried the vanilla ice cream, both are delicious!
 Mixes well, tastes good and has good ingredients.
 Awesome
 Best tasting protein I have ever had. Tastes like chocolate milk. Of course I mix it with Milk.. so that helps!
 Very easy to mix with water or milk. Another plus that you need is taste, and this even tastes good when you mix it with water. Thats hard to find.
 Great flavor
 as advertised lol
 This is my go to Protein powder. It tastes good and gets the job done for a reasonable price per serving. There are some other products out there that taste better and offer different blends of protein like whey and casein but those also cost more.
 I purchased the first 5 pounds of whey protein from bodybuilding.com, I got the same product from amazon, tastes different, can anyone explain that?
 not so good
 ok
 Taste great
 The ON Vanilla Ice Cream used to be my favorite for sneaking extra protein into just about any smoothie, but the "new and improved" flavor is pretty bad. I just got another 5 lb tub, not realizing this flavor had been tweaked, and I'm hoping I can return it. This used to be a pretty tame vanilla that would mix well with anything, now it drowns out anything else in the drink with an obnoxious fake sweet vanilla flavor.
 This tastes very good.  I describe it as a cold version of how hot chocolate tastes.  It is not grainy at all when shaken or blended.  I use this as a breakfast to go.
 Whenever I drink this Whey I feel nauseous / sick, I went through the whole bottle thinking ill eventually get used to it. I even got the same feeling with the Casein version, this brand of Whey is just not for me. I suggest you buy the smallest size to try out first.
 I love this product. I have been using it for the last couple years and I am really pleased with it.<br/>I used the platinum hydro-whey before, but I think that the gold standard does the same job and gives you the best $ value per pound.
 Awesome and tastes good
 syntha taste better,but this has less cal from fat and less fillers.mixes well
 good for people who exercising.
 Tastes great at a great price too
 Great protein! I have been using this product for the past 3 months and I have gained a good amount of muscle. Will continue to buy this product.
 I usually love this brand, but they didn't have the milk chocolate flavor so I got double rich chocolate and it's disgusting.  It tastes watered down and has a very gross after taste.  Unfortunately I got the 10lb bag so I have to choke it down.
 Awesome for my son. The gold cup is included for correct amount.
 Double Rich Chocolate is BOMB!<br/>Mixes well and tastes great.  I mix it with skim or non-fat milk and it tastes great and doesn't even hurt my stomach.
 Mixes easy and tastes great. Recommended by many friends. I've used different types of whey protein supplements and this one has become my new favorite.
 Terrible flavor... I have been using the straight vanilla flavor for years but this flavor sucks.
 The nutrition facts and taste of this particular whey are much better than most of the brands/flavors I've tried so far. I really like it by itself with just water or in protein shakes.
 work ok so far
 Best protein on the market hands down. Smooth, not too filling and not too pricey on amazon. I recommend this protein to everyone who is weight training, running, and any other athlete.
 If your looking for a protein that is very easy to mix, and taste good then this is for you.  I have tried a lot of proteins and this was the best.  I will defiantly order this again.
 Great product, the previous reviews say it all.
 Switched to this from GNC brand. It doesn't taste as good as I was expecting. Its a very bland flavor.
 WARNING: Sucralose is an ingredient. The photo of the ingredient list does not show this, but it is shown in the product description.
 Great product
 what to say- its whey protein pretty generic buy on price
 The product that I brought was "Delicious Strawberry" and it did not taste good or smell good at all with water.<br/>But seems to blend right with milk. But I strongly don't recommend you buying the strawberry flavor, cause it taste like some rubber and it smells horrible. Your best bet would be reviewing other flavors or perhaps start with muscle milk which I previously enjoyed and will continue to use it instead of this product.
 Good product! Come fast to Ogres house! Build mussels! Lift more heavy things! Amazon say Ogre need three more words.
 Best whey protein tried so far. Dissolves easily and taste great
 Gave me heart paplations wasn't pleasant . Just take it into consideration before buying it because you can just lose out on 50 bucks . *flys away* taste great tho
 I LOVE PROTEIN!!
 good flavor
 Great product at a great price, but most importantly great results!! worth every penny!!
 I have been drinking this for about one year. It great when mixed with peanut butter and banana. Water and crushed ice.
 bought a 10lber
 it suppose to taste like mocha and it tastes like chocolate
 Excellent taste. Great price.
 Great product.  It arrives fast and works great.  I would like to see Amazon to carry a wide variety of supplements!
 its ok so far, it smell great, taste great even when mixed with water only. i gave it four stars because i havent seen the results just yet, but will make a review about that part soon
 I like this a lot. This tastes very good, and its a pretty reasonable price. I think I found my new base for comparison.
 Ordered this, came in time and I chose the banana flavor, my last brand was syntha6 chocolate and it tasted amazing, switched over to whey with banana cream with water and it tasted horrible.
 I don't always have much money for good protein and other supplements, but with this protein I can get my bcaa's and glutamine intake all in one! Love it.
 Great product however doesn't taste as good as optimum nutritions other products.  I definitely would recommend a different flavor such as French vanilla, way more tasty
 Fast delivered. I bought the double chocolate one. Tastes great!! I like that its not too sweet. Only thing that I don't like about this product is that it says that it has artificial flavors.
 This really works its the protein out there i tried alot of them this stand out alone in one week i gained 4 pounds of muscle do not hesitate its great
 ok
 Great taste
 The flavor is great it mixes well with a blender. Gets nice and thick. My favorite protein type, keeps you full mixes great with bananas and berries
 super thanks
 The quality of the product is great. I would recommend buying this product for daily protein use. I also appreciate the quantity of the product in the container.
 Love this protein
 it taste good , i take it before and after workouts<br/>it's more delicious with milk , but still good with water<br/><br/>Waleed
 taste is NASTY in water, forced to drink milk with product for it to be drinkable.
 For the price, I think you get the most bang for your buck with this protein. I have been using it for a long time and never wanted to use any other. Also the flavors are amazing.
 Living in India every time I need to gift a cousin or a friend in the US, life has gotten easier with Amazon. You guys do an immaculate job that makes shopping pleasurable and is no longer a chore..
 Best that I could find that was first low carb. Also low calorie! And great price if bought in bulk less than .80 cent/ serving!
 Well i didn't listen to comments of this product disrupting digestion so here i am unable to digest any dairy products what-so-ever following ingestion of just 1/2 scoop once a day for three weeks!  Now it's one medical appt after another while i abstain from ALL dairy products because even lactase supplements aren't helping.  I never, ever had a problem with dairy until i tried this product.  Coincidence?  Maybe, but i probably will never be able to eat ANY dairy ever again, and it's hidden in a lot of prepared foods. I recommend you use this product with caution and discontinue at the first sign of digestive distress even if you've never had a problem digesting dairy products before...just sayin'
 The Cake Batter tastes absolutely awful. Any other flavor should be OK.
 It doesn't taste like any chocolate I am use to
 Do not buy the strawberry, I repeat DO NOT buy the strawberry. Unless you like the taste of medicine...<br/><br/>Otherwise this is a great product.
 I like this company because it works well with the numbers I need in my daily intake of food. Unfortunately I don't think I'll get this flavor again, I can only take so much of it's mintyness.
 All other Whey Flavors do not compare to this flavor. It is so good it will make you want to spank the monkey.
 This is the worst flavor ON has to offer. Make sure you try your flavors first before you commit to a 5lb container
 Taste is just terrible. Other ON products much better.
 If you like fake sweetener, then you'll love this. :(
 Great product!
 I opened the box, and there was a chocolate dust spreaded throughout box because was a hole on the package.
 Great product, have used it before but when ordering from amazon.com it did not have the seal under the lid.
 i love On but the cookies and cream flavor is horrible.<br/><br/>nasty tasting in water and only slightly tolerable with milk<br/><br/>i shouldnt have strayed from coffee flavor
 love this.  I really enjoyed the protein.  the flavor is good and it is a great value when you buy the large bag.
 Great
 Taste gets tired very densely.<br/>What I mixed with milk may be bad. However, it was better when it was water.
 This size is for about 1-2 month of use, if you take it 2 times a day during your training days and once for rest days. It taste really good, like real coffee, and it helps!
 Tudo perfeito
 GOOD And FASTEST
 Taste like crappie gives lots of gas. Never again
 Got me bigger is a really good protein product and im looking foward to get a new one i defenitley recommend it !
 Will never buy another brand of protein!!
 I like the product but came with no scooper which made it a difficult experience compared to most proteins
 I love Whey Protein because it helps build my muscle leaner, it gives my body the look I like and quick recovery after working out.
 good
 I was excited on this product when I got it but soon very disappointed. It couldn't be mixed with water even I stir it for 5 minutes and the taste is terrible nothing like most other people rating.<br/><br/>I bought a different one at Costco and it taste much much much better so I through away this product earlier this morning to my trash can. I am not recommended
 Scoop missing from the tub
 Product was what I expected, with fast delivery!
 They delivered the wrong flavor. WHO THE F*** WANTS BANANA CREAM FLAVORED PROTEIN.
 I've ordered this a few times now.<br/><br/>I went with Extreme Milk Chocolate based on all of the reviews.<br/><br/>I recommend mixing 1 scoop with 6 oz of water. It says 6-8 oz and I mixed it with 8 oz first and it didn't taste as good. Trust me and use 6 oz.<br/><br/>I blend a little ice and 12 oz of water with 2 scoops of this whey along with 1 banana in a NutriBullet for 25 seconds for part of my breakfast every morning.<br/><br/>I love it.
 One of my favorite protein powder drink mixes.
 Taste good
 No chalky taste, but still not my favorite protein drink.
 glory hole!
 Favorite protein
 Tasted great, even with water. I've been taking it for about 3 weeks now and it's deffinitely helping me stay less sore.
 Awsome
 Great taste.
 I ordered a 5 lb. of French Vanilla Creme and received a container with a broken seal which was clearly opened previously.<br/><br/>Beware.
 this my main ish yo, i get mad pumps from that loud pike boy lemme let you know this whey taste so dope dawg and gets me that tein i need in my blood all day homie ya feel?
 Great value and best tasting protein shake I have found.  Chocolate Malt flavor kind of reminds me of Ovaltine, tasty!
 Do not get strawberry.<br/><br/>I loved Vanilla, and Chocolate Mint was amazing.<br/><br/>Strawberry tastes like that fake strawberry flavor mixed with pepto bismuth.
 easily the best tasting protein I've ever had! mixes perfectly with milk and tastes like a legit strawberry milkshake! no joke!
 NEED CONSISTENCE USE
 Great taste
 Read all about this product and had to get it. I have not received it yet but soon it will be sent to me. Great product!!
 Standard high-quality Whey Protein.
 I've been using Optimum Nutrition Whey for years on a daily bases.  For breakfast I usually put one scoop  into a blended smoothly with blueberries and a bananas with cranberry juice and some Greek yogurt.  The whey helps to thicken the liquid to a thick milkshake like consistency and I'm good to go to lunchtime.
 Yuck
 Is it that hard to read the flavor of the protein powder and make sure it matches the order before you ship it?
 I love other flavors of ON gold standard whey, but the stawberry banana was not very good. Will not buy again.
 I LOVE THIS FLAVOR. Strawberry is what I live for tastes like real strawberries.
 Good timing. Protein works justa lil to thick. But all in all is good. Do you even lift bruh ?
 At first glance this seemed like a very ordinary fitness product. However, after several weeks I began to see impressive results. Eventually I developed a spectacular regimen blending Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard Double Rich Chocolate 2.27 kg protein powder mix into my daily routine. On day one I would do 12 x 30 reps of goblin squats holding the heavily weighted plastic tub (normal goblet squats but screaming like a goblin), 2 x 2 power thrunch crusters (power thrusters while holding a mouthfull of organic whole wheat high fiber overpriced instant grits with tiny of bits of dried mulberries), 7 x 53 Bulgarian crab tossers (but with only 1 leg instead of 3), 180 degree power lunges with power tool assist until heart rate reaches brain raisin stage three, 5 x 5 reverse crunches with a Vietnamese pedicure, 2 x 30 Malibu box jumps (like box jumps but onto the hood of a slow moving 1993 Chevy Malibu). Day 2: drink 34 oz. of Bailey's Irish Cream and a V8. Day 3: 243 woodchoppers while dressed as a gay lumberjack and wearing beaver teeth, 3 x 34 Nisman curls (bicep curls with a 2.27 kg tub of 100% whey protein powder while indicting the corrupt Argentine regime for conspiring with Iranian state sponsors of terrorism), 11 x 74 slurpees (burpees after a major dose of novacaine in the lower mandible), down dog with or without lipstick. This tub is the perfect size and weight for a wide variety of compound exercises. Plus, it's beautiful matte black color scheme blends well with any decor. We added a stylish up cycled table top to use the product as an end table when not using it to exercise. Buy this today (if you haven't already midway through this review.)
 Bad taste
 Got the coffee flavor, tastes great, mixes well. I like it with almond milk. Can't go wrong here.
 I Loved it, was hesitant about trying it because usually protein powder taste horrible but it ended up being great and I highly recommend it.
 My fave protein, chocolate is the best flavor :) Good price here as well, will buy more when I run out
 good
 Taste's like my child hood Fructose Syrup enriched Quik!! But it's all protein!!!
 Price was good but protein powder was a little watery after mixed. I won't purchase it again
 One of the best protein powders out. I keep coming back.
 I was hoping it would taste like the ice cream, but it didnt. Its not bad, but its not good. Definitely not buying this again though. =)
 PERFECT!!
 I was a huge long time fan of Optimum Nutrition's Pro Complex, but they reformulated and drove the price into ridiculousness. So I converted over the 100% Whey, found the flavor I liked the most and I'll keep going until they screw this up. I buy a good 4 tubs at a time and lasts me 4-5 months. I mix it with Cashew Milk and Psyllium Fiber for a morning shake every day and it's one my favorite "meals" of the day.
 Is there any other protein worth taking?  It's the gold standard for a reason.  Accept no substitutes.
 My favorite whey!
 Great!
 Great taste. Mixes well.
 Excess Protein had to throw it off
 so good
 It was a gift to my son by request.
 Best optimum flavor I have tried yet. Not as intensely sweet as some of their others, which is perfect. Still tastes like a dessert. LOVE
 I have been driking this while doing insanity, and it has been great so far.
 does what it says, works fairly well, but the flavor leaves something to be desired, but works none the less.
 I love Gold Standard 100% Whey but Vanilla Ice Cream has been the worst flavor I've tried. Never again!
 I bought this ON WHEY for my husband who is trying to build his muscles. He is satisfied with the product. We are expecting the effect.
 Why did the protein powder do not have a dust pattern and the opening was sprinkled a bit. Solution  pls
 I buy this flavor all the time for the past 2 years. It's fast and the product came fast.
 good
 i got the product and it has already lived up to my expectations, i can see results after only four uses

 its the best i truely like some much, truely recomended, is the winner of his kind, i like his flavors
 great
 Great taste!
 Though the product itself is one of the best considering its nutrition facts and overall value the rocky road flavor is just not me. I should've stuck with chocolate now I gotta take this product for about 3 months sigh...
 Simply the best. This is the only protein you'll ever need.
 Perfect size.
 amazing as usual
 The price of this this protein has gone up so much. It used to be 40$ for 5 lbs! So damn taxed now...
 when I received it, it wasn't a new one, it was opened.....I don't know why
 Bottle not full all the way, no sealing and no measuring cup, disappointed with buy this time.
 This stuff is horrible had a very bad experience with this stuff do not buy if I had a choice you get no stars
 Protein is freaking awesome! Im making so many gains now! Ill continue to purchase this product for all my days!
 i like the strawberrey flavor
 Good product just took very long to get the  product.
 Fantastic product that has given me great results. Much better than any other protein I've used and tastes great.
 Gross flavor.
 Banana cream doesn't taste good. It also comes out dry and rubbery after baking or microwaving.
 I wasn't very happy with my tub, somehow the top wasn't put on correctly and whey leaked through the seal onto the box.
 Delicious! A good variety on the protein flavors.
 Terrible taste
 great product
 Mine didn't come with a scooper or cup to measure how much to take... I have no idea how much I'm taking 0.0
 Excelent
 So far so good about 1/3 rd into it and good results so far
 I regret getting such a big bag because it tastes terrible. Has such an awkward aftertaste. I've had it for a few weeks and really can't stand the smell/taste so I've only had it twice. In the past, I bought the vanilla and didn't experience this so I figured the strawberry would be good too. Never again.
 Love th whey not the packaging, I got it with a hole on the side.
 Good
 It tastes real good and it does Justice to my body and I can see that it actually working
 Excellent.... Good taste...Good choice.
 Great Deal
 Go for it
 its the best.
 Coffee flavor is horrible!!!!
 best tasting protein I've had!! highly recommend the extreme milk chocolate!!
 Did not taste like cookies and cream, more like vanilla flavor.
 This stuff taste great,works great, and for the money you cant beat it.
 It tastes really good. That's the best shopping experience I ever have.
 nice protein loveeeeeeeeee
 I dont like chocolate malt flavour.  Dont go for malt flavour.
 Great flavor!
 Awesome!!!
 I don't know whose fault it is. But once again, I order the white chocolate flavor and get the double rich chocolate. Last time I ordered the vanilla cream and got double rich chocolate. I am not a happy camper. I just want the right flavor I ordered...
 I bought the mocha cappuccino flavor, got coffee instead. Disappointed
 Great with water, better with milk. Practically a dessert.
 came with a hole in it soo i threw it out
 expensive no results
 My containers sealer came opened and it seems as if this was returned or something.
 Wo gan jue zhe ge danbaifen wei dao feichang hao!!!!
 The previous version of Vanilla Ice Cream was spot on, not overwhelming and not underwhelming and tasted great when paired up with whole milk and didn't leave a bad after-taste. This whole "New Improved Flavor" is disgustingly sweet and not anything I would label as any type of improvement. Maybe their taste testers were screwing with them or their R&amp;D chefs lost their sense of taste and smell, either way the end result is not good.<br/><br/>To further compound this, whatever artificial sweetener they're using now leaves this really chalky, "I just drank a case of cheap old diet soda with additional artificial sweetener" after-taste. If you're into that kind of flavor, this might be right up your alley. Otherwise, find a new flavor as this one now tastes like vanilla Sweet'N Low in disgusting quantities.
 Cake batter? Nope. It tastes like artificial sweetener.
 Love the flavor works great just a little watery wish it was thicker
 Ya bish
 I like it but the Mocha Cappuccino had a better taste!
 good will be buy more other prodution
 Best tasting protein powder i've tried so far.
 Great flavor, great price
 Product tastes great! (like a sugar free shake). Delivered on time!
 it is really good, good flavor, and works well.
 Chalky
 Looks great but do you mix with water or milk?.
 I didn't like the double rich chocolate flavor.
 Didn't really notice any gains.
 Awesome product ! Great price.
 I prefer the more mild taste of the Optimum Whey Natural
 Terrible flavor.
 One of the best protein I have ever taken!!!
 Great taste like fudgecicle!
 Best whey protein in the market.
 Great product, great taste. Coffee is one of my favorite flavors.
 I buy this product all the time and decided to try another flavor.  Cookies and cream sounded delicious so I decided to check it out.  Before i bought it I read the labels in the images displayed for this specific flavor and everything seemed to pass the my liking.  After i got the product i read the labels and again and actually realized that the ingredients listed on the image on Amazon.com were not the same as my actual product. What i got was a different formula with different nutritional value and and high fructose corn syrup which is REALLY bad for my personal health.  I am giving this product ONE star because the product was incorrectly represented online and can have an overall affect on my own personal health.
 We didn't like the taste of this one.
 Too much chocolate for me. Vanilla goes better with everything.
 Great
 Hubby loved it! He's gaining great results!
 Tastes off , like something is spoiled .<br/>will be returning
 My whey came very fast. 5 stars will buy again
 The seal was broke &amp; completely open.
 Alright so I know there are already 1000+ reviews on here, most of which say how great the protein is so I will spare you the long drawn out pros of this product because those have already been vouched for in great detail. I will just reiterate that this is a great quality protein full of BCAA's and other important nutrients at a reasonable price. However, the subject of my review is a flavor comparison that I think is useful for people contemplating which of the many flavors to get. I will update this review as I try new flavors by them. I will preface these flavor reviews by saying that all of them are pretty highly rated because ON's proteins taste significantly better than much of their competition's proteins.<br/><br/>The flavors:<br/><br/>French Caramel Toffee: 7/10. This protein flavor is pretty adequate at achieving the caramel taste with a hint of toffee at the end but it comes with a pretty bad  aftertaste that caused me to not want to purchase it again.<br/><br/>Vanilla Icecream: 8/10. An overall good flavor but it lacks a really vanilla-y taste that some of their other flavors do have. So if your looking for a mild vanilla flavor then this it the one I would choose.<br/><br/>Rocky Road: 8/10. This product tastes a lot like the french caramel toffee one but with a less bad aftertaste, but the aftertaste still isn't great. With milk this one is pretty solid overall but when taken with water the aftertaste becomes even more apparent.<br/><br/>Chocolate: 9/10. ON's chocolate is probably their most popular flavor and for good reason. Its a delicious flavor that successfully tastes good in both water and milk. A good choice for your first flavor from them.<br/><br/>French Vanilla: 9/10. The best vanilla I have tasted to date. It is more flavorful than the vanilla ice-cream and only has a semblance of a bad aftertaste when mixed with water and no bad aftertaste when mixed with milk.<br/><br/>Extreme chocolate: 9/10. Very strong chocolate flavor that I found pretty delicious and very sweet. If sweetness isn't your thing I would steer clear of this chocolate and go for the plain one instead.<br/><br/>I hope this helps and I will update as I try new flavors!
 Stuff almost killed me. I've been using gold standard whey for years. Bought this and my first time using it I ended up in the hospital due to an allergic reaction. There is something in there that shouldn't be. I switched over to rice protein and am much happier. Easier to drink, easier on my stomach, and no near death experiences.
 Great product, great seller!
 I like the protein and comes  on time
 Got the wrong product. Banana ain't coffee. Wtf
 Good teast
 Great stuff. Great flavor
 The best.
 Hard to beat this protein
 Fan
 Very god !
 GAINSSSSS
 perfect
 Good product good price
 it's very nice<br/>!
 👍🏻👍🏻
 Came as described. Gonna start taking tomorrow!
 Smooth and good.
 it arrives open!!!
 Amazing taste!
 excellent
 Flavor is really good on spot ..
 Gold Standard for a reason!
 I'm disappointed in the "double rich chocolate" flavor. I just finished up a different ON chocolate flavor called "Natural Chocolate." This Double Rich Chocolate is not nearly as good. It's too damn sweet! Don't know if I'm going to be able to finish all 5 pounds of this stuff.
 Flavor is not good to digest
 Nice product.
 Amazing stuff. Worth every penny.
 The best!!!
 👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽
 Great Product and Price!
 excelente
 I have ordered this same protein and flavor from bodybuilding.com for several months. I decided to order from Amazon because I ran out and needed it quickly through my prime membership. This protein tastes horrible. It was either stored improperly or this is expired. I have tried everything to make it taste better. I've added more scoops. I've changed what I'm mixing it with. Everything. I'm convinced this is a manufacture default. Wish I could return it, but I've already opened it and used it. Beware of ordering this product directly through Amazon.
 I ordered the Cake Batter flavor.  I figured it was time to try something new after having used both GROW Whey, and BSN Syntha-6 (both of which are awesome).<br/><br/>I should not have dared it this time though.<br/><br/>This stuff tastes like S#@%.  It mixes fairly well in both milk and water... but the mixing is not the problem.  It's the gagging and choking which ensue after you start drinking it.<br/><br/>Trust me on this and buy BSN Syntha-6 instead of this crap.
 No good
 good
 Great protein for a good price. Cake batter taste great! This is the same price as bodybuilding.com. With prime you must order from here! MASSIVE amount of protein. Picture compared to iPhone 5
 Great product
 The plastic lid is missing
 The best in class and budget
 Best protein there is.
 Very good
 Don't like the taste
 It is a very good product
 loved it!
 tastes great in milkshake
 The reason I gave Gold Standard 100% Whey Protein a 3 start is because it has been found to contain Acesulfame Potassium. It is a potentially harmful ingredient according to independent lab testing. Current scientific research, largely limited to rodent testing, has identified negative results such as prenatal development effects and reduced cognitive function.  I have been buying this brand for years and I am very disappointed.  I did more research and found several that rate much higher and free of chemicals.  Here is what I found:<br/>Integrated Supplements Whey Isolate Protein<br/>Myprotein Impact Whey Protein<br/>NOW Foods Whey Protein Isolate<br/>Jay Robb's Whey Protein<br/>Garden of life Raw Protein<br/>Spiru-Tein<br/>Sunwarrior Warrior Blend Raw Vegan Protein<br/>Vega Sports Performance Protein<br/>M RM 100% All Natural Whey<br/>All max Nutrition lsoNatural Whey Protein Isolate
 No scoop provided!
 Very good
 I hated it
 This is great!
 tastes awful
 Very good product
 Great
 Nice
 Too sweet
 It's a good product, taste good and all,  but doesn't work with me, causes me hemorrhoids... Bad experience.
 Muy buena!
 nice
 Thanks

 Nice
 I've been using whey protein for almost a year. this so called deciduous strawberry doesn't taste good. not awful either!
 This still contains a blend of whey concentrate, which has more IGF compared to pure isolates, which isn't so good for your skin. I had to switch to pea protein because of this, otherwise I'd definitely still be using ON's stuff.
 I have been a user of 100% whey for over a decade since back in the days when this cost less than $25 for a 5 lb container and had no issues till recently.  For the past few years I have bought the Cake Batter flavor exclusively and use it twice a day.  Recently I bought two 5 lb containers and both had issues-the tasted horrible, mixed to the thickness consistency of a Dairy Queen Blizzard, smelled wrong, and gave me horrible diarrhea afterwards.  As i've said in 10+ years of use I know what the stuff is supposed to taste and smell like and that it shouldn't mix together at the consistency of sludge.  I emailed ON and told them about the two bad containers and they sent me back a 50 or so question email to fill out so they could investigate the lot numbers.  They told me how serious they took the matter and would get back to me within a couple weeks but that was it I got no further replies for over a month even after asking again.<br/><br/>After giving up on the hope that ON would stand by their own product I contacted the retailer I bought it from and they sent me replacements with a prepaid shipping label to send back the bad two.  In other words the retailer did a fantastic job of fixing ON's horrible protein at their own expense.  I will never buy another ON product again due to their inability to stand by their products and replace them when they are causing sickness to their customers.  If you are looking for a laxative then this is a terrific product for you otherwise avoid it.  Maybe you will get a good container maybe not but i'm not risking my health again with this company.
 This stuff upset my stomach so badly.<br/>It also didn't mix that well when I got it.<br/>$60 down the drain
 I ordered a 5 pound Delicious Strawberry flavor and on my invoice inside the box it said delicious strawberry however the tub i received was Double Rich Chocolate. Im currently in Afghanistan or else I'd send it back for a return.
 Wrong flavor, man i wanted the one i ordered. Come on. And i dont have time to return the thing. Great thanks alot. Now im gonna be angry for a month cuz u get the flavor wrong and i have to drink garbage.
 I received a 5lb. container of the Double Rich Chocolate on March 28, 2012. About an hour after drinking the first shake, I got sick (won't go into the details). I wasn't sure if it was the powder or one of the other ingredients in the shake, so I tried it again the next day. I got sick again. I paid $52.99 for this giant container, though, and really hoped I hadn't received a bad batch. I tried it two more times and got the same results. I've since stopped drinking it but wanted to post a warning after seeing some other recent reviews of people getting sick.<br/><br/>I got such a big size because I'd bought a 1lb. container in February from Amazon and really liked it. No issues with the product that time. I don't know what's in the 5lb. container this time, but it's not good. I won't buy this product again.
 I have already sent email to you. This product is not at all good. Very very bad taste. Not able to drink with any combination. I never tasted such bad flavor in life. I suggest to all not to go for it. Believing amazon I purchased.
 it's a good this protein, I've been using this for a month now, tastes is okay and mixes good with water or milk, I recommend it. No GI problems with the product.
 The White Chocolate flavor tastes exactly like bad quality Vanilla protein. This review is for the flavor, not the actual product.
 Seems to be a good price initially, but the quality wasn't as pure as I'd knowingly put into my body.  Depends what you're looking for ultimately.
 Convenient size for travelers. Fits nicely in my luggage and allows me to keep my macros in check while on-the go.<br/><br/>Pro tip: once y
 I CRASHED MY CAR INTO THE BRIDGE<br/>I DON'T CARE<br/>I LOVE IT, I LOVE IT<br/>I DON'T CARE<br/>I LOVE IT!
 Do not buy cake batter. It is unbearably disgusting. The only way I could get through the bucket was to mix it with chocolate milk and peanut butter and go on a bulk.
 With asmuch compiyition as there is I left this behind for better deals, the product is great, but the price is way too high compared to others which are 30-45 collars less.
 I bought it  for my high school athelete son . He did NOT want to drink it after t one scoop trial.
 You guys send me the product be damaged<br/>it looked ugly outside<br/>If next time I order the product have be damage like that, I won't happy<br/>I need product look new<br/>I think you guys have to fix it<br/>Thanks<br/>Tri nguyen
 It doesn't do anything for me. I mean really, nothing... so for me, in my opinion, Other brands are way better.
 Tastes and smells like pure chemicals. I would not recommend this protein to anyone. There are better alternatives that taste much better and are pure like PROMIX brand and many others.
 the product seams good but it has no big effect on my body, but I think it's my body resistance toward gaining weight.
 Flavor of the strawberry banana too artificial.  I was so lookig forward to trying this but was very dissapoined.  Not for me.
 No recibido, por un tema de permiso no tengo el producto en peru, se esta haciendo los tramites para encargar el producto
 Mixes fine, but it tastes horrible! The only protein powder that literally makes me gag! My next protein powder will come from Smart Powders.
 Too sweet for my taste.<br/>Tip of the day: Tripple check that your order does not get changed from regular chocolate to this one.
 Strawberry is good, banana is good, strawberry banana is the worst tasting thing I have ever had in my mouth.
 The protein itself is top of the line, no question!  The double rich chocolate flavor is not very good.  The extreme milk chocolate is WAY WAY better!!!  The winning combo is 1-2 scoops extreme milk chocolate protein powder, 1 cup dark chocolate almond milk &amp; 1/2 cup egg whites.
 Contains sucralose. My own fault, but I didn't check the ingredients list. I just listened to all the glowing reviews and was more focused on taste.<br/><br/>I don't understand the obsession with artificial sweetners.There is a weight of evidence to cause concern, so why would anyone risk it?<br/><br/>I suppose I'm stuck with this for a while. It tastes ok, but again, trying to avoid sweetners. I'll be more vigilant next time.
 Doesn't desolve well half the time I had to pour it out supposed to be able to add it to my favorite beverage but seams like it curdeled when I added it to my coffee ruins my morning.
 This is the only protein I've taken that  causes a massive Stomach ache. I would avoid this flavor unless you enjoy hours in the bathroom
 I have bought this product for several years and really like it.  The only problem that I have is that the price goes up faster than gold prices and gasoline.  It's just Whey for crying out loud.
 I don't see the scoop
 I will not recommend this flavor to anyone since it does not have any flavor. It feels like drinking a glass of mud. Tastes better after adding sugar, which is bad if you are looking to cut down on sugar.
 Normally I love this product and have had no problems with it whatsoever, aside from a shipping problem once, which was very well handled. However, this time the jar came void of a seal and the bucket weighed in at a little over 4 lbs, when it was supposed to be 5. I recommend the product, but I can't give it 5 stars when I did not receive what I ordered.
 Cookies an cream taste like crap. I think I got a bad protein. It probably was I'm a wally dry place. I'm so dissapointed.
 Somehow this new one seems very bad in taste and not as thick as it used to be with water...it's horrible, I feel like I am drinking milky dirty water than a protein shake. Will not buy it anymore from here
 not worth the price... there are a lot of other brands that offer then same as this protein does for much cheaper.
 I ate the whole tub in one sitting and got swole!  Added about 100lbs to my max deadlift and clean and jerk.
 Really bad taste compared to other products.
 Mixture doesn't always come out perfect, sometimes clumpy. Gets the job done as a standard protein. Taste is decent. !
 in my country there is a limit of pounds  i dont know why sendind them on the same code of track package and i cant return it
 nice
 Orderd this item in the past &amp; never had a problem, this time all I got was an empty box. $50 for an empty box is pretty steep I THINK!!!!!😡
 i am a regular user of ON whey but i find a difference in taste of the product delivered by amazon
 I actually bought this product!
 Third time I have received the 5lb protein jug with the "sealed for your protection"(white seal, not the plastic one) seal stuck on top of the lid. This is disgusting because contaminants can easily get into the bottle. I have ordered over 20 of these jugs over the past 2 years and this has happened 3/20 times. What this tells me is that they don't practice safe handling at their facilities and don't bother to inspect. Last time I will order protein from Optimum. I have used other protein and their protection seals are impossible to remove; I'd rather spend an extra 5 minutes removing the seal than getting impurities in my shake. Tossed the 5lb jug out and will order a different brand.
 I got rip off! come with black tape around it to seal the top.. didn't have a under the cap seal on it with like someone made it in the kitchen and sold it on amazon... once I open it and seen there was no seal of protection under the cap i didn't try it! I have never brought Protein that didn't have the seal under the cap to rip to open.. since I paid 60$ I give it a try it was the worst thing I ever tasted before. cant send it back so I now going to donate it to the trash were it belong! Optimum Nutrition is a joke.. I wouldn't ever buy protein from this company again EVER!!
 perfect!
 I've been buying this product for years but I noticed that since my last order, every time i drink it, i get a little nauseous. I wasn't sure why since it had never happened before. I just found out they changed their formula, WHY?! the previous formula worked and I loved them for it, i'll now be looking for a new protein
 When I first started using this product I was barely strong enough to lift the box it came it.  Now i can save time by skipping the gym and drinking protein 3 times a day!
 This item had no seal on the tub. This is a health hazard, not to mention safety because it could be tampered with. Defiantly not going to use it unless amazon tells it it is safe, or issue a replacement. Otherwise, I wasted $60 and it is going in the trash. Better to waste $60 than risking you body.
 I tried to scan the barcode on MyFitnessPal and it says "Invalid barcode" but it doesn't say that for anything else I scan. I tried another scanning app and it couldn't find the info for it either. Very annoying.
 It so taste and works great~
 Could be cheaper
 Too foamy
 Doesn't taste nearly as good as the vanilla ice cream.
 Well, the packing was terrible, the 10 pound bag had holes on both ends at the top and the protein was found everywhere in the box; just a mess to clean up. This is my first and last time purchasing the 10 lb bag if this is what I'm going to receive.
 Tastes great, came as expected.
 It seems that gold standard has got to big and doesn't appreciate its customer's anymore. I never received my item and I never even got a response when I emailed the supplier. I guess it's about time to find a new brand of protein.
 Unless you love pink medicine flavor I would pass on this one.
 First off, the product itself is amazing, the quality and the taste, I know it, it's not the first time I purchase it. But if only ON knew what Amazon does to their reputation!<br/>The item arrived perfectly sealed. Outside. It was much later when I found out that the inside protection was damaged, and the weight was also all wrong. The 5-pound bottle weighed 1 lb less!<br/>Beware!
 Meh. It didn't put me in the hospital.
 great taste with milk or water
 I'm just wondering who had the 1/4 of the powder when I first opened  it. Won't buy it again. It's like only 4 pounds now.
 I am wondering what taste buds do these people have that gave 5 stars to this crap! Terrible taste! Terrible texture and it does not mix well! I have tried it a couple of times and it makes me puke. I am allways open minded when it comes to reading reviews but this time I was wrong. Syntha 6 is the best protein powder, good taste, good results, and mixes well. There is no option for 0 stars otherwise does not deserve a 1 star at all.
 Good and in the cab it it is said that has samples.But, i didn't find any samples inside the box.
 This products just turned coarse and inedible .I can't mix with anything else. I wish it can returned.
 I have been a personal trainer for 12 years.  Trust me, I have tried MANY types and brands of protein powder.  Optimum Nutrition brand has the best tasting, highest quality powdered protein - bar none!  I will never ask a client to try anything I haven't tried myself, so I can say with great certainty, the flavors are excellent.  There is no funny "after taste" when you make this powder into a shake.  I usually put a scoop of dry powder in a small shake container. The powder stays fresh in your car, messenger bag or gym locker until you are ready to use it.  Try that with a bar!!  Just add 16oz. of cold fountain or bottled water at the gym, for an after workout muscle recovery drink. At home, I use skim milk, but the shake tastes just as good with water and a good shaking.  Many protein bars and powders cause excessive gas....bad news if you are going out in a public place after your workout!  This protein powder is an excellent quality whey and does not cause tooting...really. Can't beat the nutrition for 120 calories.  Chocolate mint is a fave.  I keep trying other brands as my clients ask about them, but ALWAYS come back to O.N.
 Love this product, but this flavor isn't as tasty as the others.
 I dislike this, I don’t want it anymore , it make me lose money
 I just recieved my 2lb chocolate malt today in the mail, when I opened the package, I find out that the seal is broken and that only 1/3 of powder is in the container. I have found no way to contact them other than packaging feedback. I will no longer be purchasing anything from amazon unless they take care of this scam.
 Its good
 Flavor it's awful
 Taste so bad.....
 I used to love this product until they changed the ingredients. It has has a bunch of filler in it which makes it less useful.
 Bought this product for the second time. The first time around I felt that this product was good and the consistency and taste was also pretty good.<br/>The second time i bought it, this product had changed! I am not sure how many grams of protein i am taking in as have to keep adding in multiple scoops to get the consistency of the drink i am used to and the taste.<br/>I have a feeling this product is being counterfeited.<br/>My feelings are compounded by the fact that this product is available in every single store nowadays at a price cheaper than amazon.<br/>Skip it.. try something new or try Nitro Core 24 which i am going with now
 I just wanted to point out that I've now tried every flavor with only water, ranging from the merely ok (Strawberry Banana), to pretty darn good (Chocolate Caramel Toffee). However, my last three orders have been identical. I have discovered the best flavor by far which is...<br/><br/>Drum roll please...<br/><br/>CHOCOLATE BANANA!<br/><br/>But wait, there is no chocolate banana! That's right, I now order two containers of Banana Cream, and one of Double Rich Chocolate, to make my 2:1 Banana:Chocolate shakes. I encourage everyone to try it, it's beyond delicious, even with just water.
 This product constipates me very bad.
 I have had Double Rich Chocolate flavor of this whey protein. I think it tastes better than this one. This flavor has higher flavor rating than the double rich chocolate one on bodybuilding.com. So I bought it this time. It is too sweet to me. Girls and teenagers might like this one better. However, if you have tried double rich chocolate flavor and need more flavor, this may be the best choice. ON's products are good, but because of what USPS has done to me. I can only give a 4 star. USPS wasted a lot of my time. Hopefully, you can change another delivery company.
 SURPRISED. It comes without serving scoop. How is one expected to take recommended serving without the right serving scoop.
 Milk chocolate is too sweet.
 I used it for 21 days at the recommended serving size (while working out most days). I had a blood test a little while before starting this, and everything was perfectly normal. After using this for 3 weeks, I got another blood test, which showed a significant increase in AST and ALT, and a little bit of Bilirubin. I don't have any case of hereditary issues that might cause this All these show a significant increase in stress on the Lever which is really bad. The values I got by using this for 3 weeks was almost 4 times the safe limit. I immediately stopped using this and 4 days later, I got another blood test. This time, the values had fallen significantly, to around 20 U/L above the safe limit. I absolutely recommend you against buying and using this product. If you do use it, get a blood test and check your lever functions to see if they are alright.
 when I received the protein, it seems it was a used one, it was covered with dust and the box is damaged, when I open it, the film was half opened. seems like a returned one. and the effect is bad, incomparable to other products I used before, takes me more days to recovery. BAD!
 This product smell like s***..
 Everything I wanted, tastes great.
 Blends well.<br/>Tastes great.
 Just bought this and I had to stick my hand and forearm into the jug to find the scooper. A good amount of the powder spilled into the kitchen sink just trying to find the stupid scooper buried at the very bottom. Are we NOT supposed to find it until we're done with the jug?  I also spent an hour trying to research how much I'm supposed to take (that is, I researched what their scoop is equivalent to... a teaspoon, tablespoon, etc.. with no luck). I read other reviews here that said to use a spoon or kitchen tongs to look for the scooper, and I had given up. Then I wanted to contact Amazon's customer service, but first I'm supposed to contact the manufacturer who will not even reply to me unless I bought it straight from them --- so I gave it one last chance, and stuck my arm (forearm deep) into the bucket and swirled around until I felt something when I was literally scraping the bottom of the barrel with my fingernails. I pulled out a gold colored scooper. There it was. And there also was a mess in my kitchen sink of powder wasted. At least tell the customer how much the scooper is equivalent to, so no one has to go through this. . . .  I will update this review in the future as far as the whey protein and its effects. -- For now, only 1 star for making me waste what I purchased.<br/><br/>---UPDATE JUNE 15, 2013--------<br/>So after using the Whey Protein, I'll raise the stars from 1 to 4.  (I'm still pissed about the scooper, so no 5 stars.)  As for the product, I'm not using to grow muscle at this point, so I can't comment on that. I've been using the Whey Protein to preserve the muscles I already have as I lose weight (burn fat) by taking in enough protein while dieting. I guess my muscles are being preserved, so good product I'd say. The taste at first was not the Vanilla Ice Cream as expected. It tasted more like Vanilla Ice Cream with metal and pennies in it. If you go into this expecting the actual taste, you'll be disappointed. But if you go in expecting a metallic taste, then you'll be surprised that there's some vanilla flavor in there too. I got used to the taste after a few months of use.
 Good
 Beware! Deceitful label photo! They hide the artificial sugar content! Unless you don't mind ingesting cancer causing substances, DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT!
 Yes, it helps my muscles after my workout to repair faster. I love the flavor.
 Excelent
 Found no difference in weight loss or muscle mass.
 HAVE FOUND THE GNC BRAND TO BE JUST AS GOOD.  I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS AND IT IS VERY GOOD. BUT GNC ADVANCED GOLD WHEY IS LESS EXPENSIVE
 u guys sent me an expire product and i don't think this is good for business. I recommend you guys to take some serious action into this
 So many gainz, brah
 Really good
 The protein that I received did not have a protective seal on it, that is required by law. I am assuming that it was taken off so that I would not be able to return it. Not using my best judgement I tried the protein anyways. I tried a scoop of the protein after my workout. It make me sick to my stomach and light headed like I was gonna vomit. This lasted about 2 hours. This didn't make since because I was having a great day and a great workout. I have tried this ON protein in the past with no complaints. I think the protein was either contaminated with something or spoiled. I think the sender is trying to get rid of this bad product and knows if they send it without the protective seal then whoever receives it can not return it, per the amazon return policy.
 Why didnt it come with a scoop
 not worth from amazon.com
 We like this powder, it tastes better than other protein powders we've tried, and also mixes well.  The flavor combines well with other foods in smoothies or whatever we choose.  We are completely happy with it!
 This product made me vomit no matter how many different ways I tried to doctor it up. Up until I tried this product I had been on a 6 protein shake a day medifast type of program with no ill effects.  The smell of this stuff is horrible. I even tried to plug my nose and just choke it down with a small amount of water. Wish I could return it. The only difference in the shakes is that this is whey and the other product was cassein.
 The sealing in side is not there. Instead, it sticks to to the cap.<br/>The powder inside is only more than half.<br/> The most important thing: it tastes SUPER BLAND. I only poured half of my shaker to make it thick, but it tastes like expired Ovaltine.<br/>Definitely fake supplement. I hope amazon fixes this with the replacement
 Everything was great !
 Stay away from the Optimum Nutrition Whey, Chocolate Mint flavor.  It smells fantastic.  But, no matter what you mix this with; Whole Milk, Skim Milk, Ice Water, Tap water, it tastes just plain awful.  I can't even describe it.  If you don't want to take my word for it, at least buy the smallest size available before committing to a 5 lb. tub.  Now I'm stuck with forcing this down with castor oil-like efficiency.
 Esta una chimba
 Dont buy from these wack jobs, its diluted and didn't even come with a seal under the cap, to top it off there was powder all over the bottle when I opened the box
 tastes more like a white mocha and coffee, I dont like coffee.
 I still do NOT get my stuff, too late...... I have been waiting for my package for a quite long time...
 I used to get one of these 5lb tubs per month at the price of about $35 through subscribe and save (reg about $40).  Did it for over a year... maybe even 2.  loved the product and loved the price.  Suddenly got an email a couple months back that ON doesn't want to participate in the Amazon subscribe and save program any more.  So I come here to see what the regular price is and was expecting $40-- without the S&amp;S 15% discount-- but see that the price has been jacked up to $53!  I would have been fine paying $40 without the S&amp;S discount, but this is ridiculous.<br/><br/>Seems to me like an underhanded business tactic for ON to use S&amp;S to get people buying it regularly, then discontinue the program and jack up the price.  Sorry ON, but I'm not playing that game.  I'd rather switch to a lesser protein powder than do business with you now.<br/><br/>---UPDATE&gt;3/22/12---<br/><br/>Here are some links to other protein powders that are more reasonably priced, and that are in amazon's S&amp;S program:<br/><br/> ...]<br/><br/> ...]<br/><br/> ...]<br/><br/> ...]<br/><br/> ...]<br/><br/> ...]<br/><br/> ...]
 Are you kidding me bro?!!!! My dam protein is half way full . I should just stick to my steroids ... Me strong me smash
 Protein of choice, but with a price hike on 6/9/2013, may need to look elsewhere as that is a joke.
 I purchase it about more than 10 bags and there are 4 bags were broken (have a hole) and the whey going out a little. I do not satisfy with it and consider stop buying it next time.
 when i opened package, i found it was not sealed, and powders were everywhere in the packaging box. thats it
 "CAUTION" This product may or may not make you extremely tired. You have 'WARNED'.<br/><br/>This product make me extremely tired after a month of use. No, I did not over dose. I mixed with a cup of skim milk and a scoop of this after work out everyday. That's about 24 grams of protein daily. However, a month later I have noticed I'm getting very tired even after a long sleep. I started back track my daily routine, work out, and diet. Nothing changed except, taking of this supplement. In my research, I found some of protein supplement can make you extremely tired and I guess this is one of them. My tiredness went away around 48 hours later after I stopped taking this supplement. I can't be 100% sure if this product same side effect on you. But I'm sure my body was rejecting this one and I may have permanent damage on my system if I keep taking it. Take or not, it's your own risk.
 French Vanilla Creme was just bearable. It wasnt very bad, but just bearable enough to keep intaking this for the next 2 months. Will i purchase this again? Nope.<br/><br/>I thought this was going to taste something like mocha flavor, but i was totally wrong. It taste like vanilla with bannana and less tasteful.<br/><br/>I have a very good taste bud since i like to try every food in this earth, including hot and spicy stuff, all meat, pasta, and, maybe, insects.<br/><br/>It can range anywhere from Hindi, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Mexicans, Thai, Fiji, and Italian food.<br/><br/>Alot of the foods that i eat are very delicious.<br/><br/>But, this is just bearable!
 Very weird!  When I opened the bottle received today, there was no seal of protection around/under the cap, I didn't dare allow my son to use it. We have never bought protein products that didn't have any manufacture seal. We are really concerned about the safety of Optimum Nutrition products!
 This bottle, must have fallen from heaven just to make my life a little less insane. I have an exclusively nursed (very difficult) 7 month old whom I have gone through 10489506$ bottles with and am also giving my best shot at weaning to formula as my supply has dropped. He immediately took to this bottle, loves to squish it like a boobie, and has even drank purely formula out of it twice in a day now!! Thank you como tomo gods. I believe in you. :)
 This price keeps going up and up... certainly not worth that huge price tag no matter how tasty it is..<br/><br/>i remember when this stuff was $39.99.  Screw this shtt
 I like it!!!!
 The Seal was completely broken when I got it. I don't know if someone ate some powder and then sent it to me, or add something else into the powder. Sending the item back would cost me too much time.
 Taste great
 The product doesn't have an expiration date!!!
 Everything about this product has to do with how many "scoops" your supposed to use, but it didn't come with a scoop, so now I have a tub of powder and no way to know how much to use.
 eat real food to get gains
 Well we used to buy this product as a staple at our house. No they've "improved the taste" They added Sucralose, (artificial sweetener), and Cellulose gum, (makes it thick and foams up in the blender). Now it is way too sweet, and if you are sensitive to artificial sweeteners like me you will get that tell tale head ache right away. Sending this junk back for a refund.
 has sucralose.Stuck with 5 pounds of stuff I can't use.very disappointed.make sure of what you are ordering before you order
 NEVER AGAIN WILL I BUY THIS PROTEIN!<br/>I found a roach leg inside my protein after finishing about half of it! This is ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING and UNACCEPTABLE!<br/>WTF!<br/><br/>I never leave the container open and I have never, EVER come across a single insect other than spiders where I live, so I know it must have been sitting inside the container this whole time. So gross!<br/><br/>This used to be my go-to protein for a long time. Looks like I'll have to find a new one now. Preferably one without insect-derived sources of protein.<br/><br/>Goodbye and good riddance ON.
 did not have a good flavor I would like my money refunded actually
 Hey Optimum, is there any reasons why you added  Sucralose to your product? do you want to loose more customers? guess what, you lost me and this will be my last time i will be using any of your products unless your take out Sucralose. Be warned if you will be using any Optimum products as they contains Sucralose-<br/>Sucralose—the no-calorie sugar substitute most commonly known by the brand name Splenda—has been found to cause a variety of harmful biological effects in the body, according to a recent research review published in the Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health, Part B: Critical Reviews.<br/>Reduces good gut bacteria:<br/>Sucralose alters the amount and quality of those beneficial microbes that hang out in your belly (the same ones found in yogurt) by 50% or more. “Alteration in bacterial counts is associated with weight gain and obesity,” says Dr. Schiffman.<br/><br/>Makes meds less effective: The sugar substitute limits the absorption of therapeutic drugs, such as those for cancer and heart disease, rendering them less effective.<br/><br/>Releases toxins: Many people bake with Splenda to reduce the calories in a recipe, but sucralose decomposes during baking, which releases potentially toxic compounds called chloroproanols.<br/><br/>May alter your body's responses: Sucralose can alter insulin responses and blood sugar levels, has been associated with inflammatory bowel disease, and may even alter genes, the researchers note.

 Don't purchase. They'll just overcharge you for a product that expires in a month. What single person uses 5 pounds of protein in a month?!
 it does not support very heavy cameras, so it is very easy to get out of position.
 I've been powerlifting for over 14 years &amp; have literally tried it all. (well... most that is) Remember when Designer Protein was "In"? Anyway, I purchased this protein along with a handful of others @ a GNC (Yes, GNC... Retail price w/ no Gold Card) without first checking out the reviews. Basically a blind study using myself as the test subject. Out of all the proteins I tested, only ONE stood out from the rest. Being that I wasn't influenced in any way by a salesman, reviews, etc... my observations were not the result of a placebo effect. With ON, I not only maintained my weight but gained weight as well w/ consistent workouts. It did an excellent job of curbing my appetite as well as this has been my breakfast, every morning for close to a year. I recently decided to check out the reviews both online &amp; on Amazon &amp; low &amp; behold, a 5 star average all the way. I'm not the least bit surprised. This is by far the best protein I have ever used.
 Just a damn great album from start to finish. To me it is a better album than the last album.
 by how much I enjoy these sheets. As someone who has purchased tons of cheap sheets from Ikea and other similar retailers, I assumed these would be equally scratchy and utilitarian. These sheets, however, are so soft and silky - way softer than I expected for the price. They are a beautiful cream color and look great in my bedroom. I'm so glad I purchased this set, and I will definitely get a few more sets in different colors to mix it up. Who knew AmazonBasics sheets would actually be good??
 Wrong item! This is such a pain!
 To early to tell
 worst thing is that I can't return it. I haven't checked their reputation before I purchased it, but it is really bad. I don't exactly know why it makes me sick. I had the same product from GNC store last time, but smaller size. It was okay. and I purchased another one from GNC again and it's okay now. But I wasted money buying from amazon, specifically from this seller. If the seller read this, I hope you give me the money back. If you don't, nothing I can do. However, your business won't be successful. I don't really know what had happened, but I warn other people to know at least that it can make you feel sick.
 I'm not sure if its my body but I didn't see any results after using it for two straight months! Kind of disappointed, but also not surprised of the outcome.
 First of all this item cannot be returned because it's considered 'Grocery'.  That was news to me when I found out that the list of ingredients in one of the photos was not what I was getting.<br/>The item I received includes Sucralose which I didn't want, and is not listed on that photo.<br/><br/>Don't take a chance on a 'grocery' item from Amazon if you're not familiar with it and it's ingredients.<br/>Now I have to figure out how to add a photo of the item I received so that others will have full disclosure.<br/><br/>Update: Fortunately, Amazon customer service took care of my complaint in their traditional stellar fashion, but I would have preferred to receive the item I thought I was getting.  Thanks Amazon, but maybe get out of the grocery business.
 The star rating applies more to Amazon than to the product. I received exactly what I ordered, but the lid was barely on and it was totally unsealed? Not going to be consuming this by a long shot.
 I exercise at least an hour every day. I take protein after ever workout every day. I have been doing so for quite a few years. During my time trying different proteins, this has to be the worst yet. I really don't see why this has such high ratings. It's a complete ripoff. The price for this crap is terrible! The best protein I have tried to date is by far Body Fortress Super Advanced Whey Protein. The price is much better, it contains everything optimum has plus more more recovery supplements already in it. It feels much more filling and tastes far better. I would recommend staying away from optimum nutrition. If you don't believe me, just try Body Fortress yourself. You can get a 2 pound container for only $15 at Walmart or several other stores/sites. You won't regret it. You will regret optimum nutrition after trying body fortress though.
 I am a bikini competitor, needless to say I go through A LOT of protein. This is my 3rd 5lbs container of OP gold standard in the last few months, I just finished off the white chocolate and chocolate mint which were both decent.... but let me tell you the coffee flavor is so on point!! it's F***ing delicious! Can't beat the quality for the price you get with optimum nutrition especially when you go through 5lbs every 5 weeks or so.<br/><br/>I've also tried vanilla ice cream which was good and the "delicious strawberry" which in my opinion was an awful artificial flavored mess. So steer clear of strawberry and the rest are good!
 I use this as a meal replacement based on a diet a nutritionist gave me, which included this product specifically.<br/>The recipe in the diet calls for one scoop of “ON Gold Standard” blended with kale, spinach, almond milk, almonds, flax/China blend, and 1/2 a banana or berries.<br/>It’s satisfying, and tastes okay. It’s not like drinking a milk shake.... but it’s not bad.<br/>I haven’t tried it on it’s own (without the other ingredients), but I think it would be fine.<br/>I’ve only tried the “Extreme Milk Chocolate” flavor, so I can’t comment on any others.
 This junk doesn't work at all. I'm serious I've been bathing in this stuff for like 8 straight days and I haven't grown any muscles. It also makes you smell rank of "Double Chocolate" protein bather. I also think bathing in all of this protein was what caused me to get a UTI. On my right hand, which is the hand I usually have in the milk/protein bath while I keep the left on the outside of it, My fingernails have significantly improved in health and length. The one single thing it actually does well is it makes the bath taste much better when the milk accidentally gets into my mouth.
 It's really annoying that this company doesnt sell samples so you can try different flavors before buying!!!<br/><br/>I got the flavor Milk Chocolate or "extreme milk chocolate" &amp; this specific flavor tastes really great! It tastes like nesquik chocolate powder with that slight chemical taste all protein powders have but on this one it's much more mild than other protein shakes I've tried (muscle milk, whole foods protein shakes, a few others).<br/><br/> Because this flavor is milk chocolate it wont work with the protein shakes that I do which are more like berry flavor &amp; personally I dont like milk chocolate with berry flavor..so I'm gonna continue trying out this brand but in other flavors (I dont know how I'm going to go about doing this yet). I'm gonna try another flavor that'll mesh well with fruits like berries,mango,pineapple,peaches. I hope ON's other flavors are as good tasting as this milk chocolate one but...my hopes aren't too high as it's pretty damn hard to make a strawberry banana flavor protein powder taste good.
 Bulls***
 I'm still fat
 That ok alright it
 Good value protein. Would not re-buy chocolate mint, but using unsweetened almond milk instead of water makes it quite drinkable. The mocha flavor is quite good. Cookies and cream is dreadfully sweet which was not for me. Mixes smoothly and quickly in a blender bottle. I’ve found that if I don’t like the flavor, I just mix with 4oz water/milk per scoop and then I can just chug it quickly to get it over with.
 Caveat emptor - Although the front of the tub says Whey Protein Isolate is the primary source, the inclusion of Whey Protein Concentrate (which is a much cheaper "filler" protein) is somewhat concerning.  A good, pure whey protein isolate might have 0-3mg of cholesterol in a 30g scoop depending on the filtration method.  Whey protein concentrate on the other hand might have anywhere from 50-80mg.  This has a whopping 50mg per 31g scoop, which makes me question the ratio of isolate to concentrate.  Based on this fact alone you might be better off with another product if what you really want is all whey protein isolate and less cholesterol.  I used this product in the past but stopped because of the artificial sweeteners and the fact that I wanted all isolate and not cheap fillers which cause bloating and gas.  I now buy unflavored, cold-filtered isolate in bulk.
 I am going to start by saying, I have made working out one of my top priorities since October. I am not some new year new me reviewer of a product I have only used once. I ordered this product because I really wanted to increase muscle mass as fast as possible and I knew protein would be perfect for how much I was starting to workout. I am at the gym at least 5 days in the week after school on weekday and work on weekends. After every workout, I take a scoop of protein with a cup of water and finish it quickly. After trying a couple other kinds of protein, I found Whey and was immediately drawn by there overwhelming amount of flavors available. At first the taste kind of bothered me but, after seeing how quickly I was improving at the gym, I got so used to taking the protein that I don't even taste it anymore. I'm sure there are flavors that would taste great with just water and the powder but, if you were into making shakes, this flavor would be great for an extra flavor boost. I absolutely love the progress I have made in the past 5 months and hopefully will continue to improve more and more every week with the endless support of Whey protein.
 It's not perfect... you still get all kind of junk chemicals but at least the ingredients list is short and no "sugars". A lot of people like the S6 product but they don't realize or don't want to, the impact of the ingredients in that protein. The list is so huge and full of junk.
 I don't usually write reviews but felt the need to after trying this protein. I bought the 8lb bag of Double Rich Chocolate off amazon after it went on sale about a month ago. I just finished a 5 lb tub of ON French Vanilla which was good IMO and jumped on this deal, never having issues with ON products before.<br/><br/>  This stuff just ruins me. It gives me terrible stomach aches when I take it and makes me a bit nausuos. I've tried mixing just one scoop with a full shaker cup of water. I've tried 8 oz milk, lactose free milk, almond milk, mixing with oats, mixing in a fruit smoothly, drinking water and eating before and after taking the protein, and nothing works. I'm done trying to pretend that this is a good protein. Now I'm stuck with roughly 7.5 lbs protein that my body can't digest. Hopefully ON will take it back.<br/><br/>I've taken Orgain Organic Plant Based Protein, EAS Whey Protein, and Body Tech Whey Protein, all chocolate flavored, in the mean time, and have had absolutely no issues.<br/><br/>Maybe it's me, but maybe it's not. Hope this review helps.
 ON makes some amazing products. But this flavor in particular just did not sit well with me. While favor like/dislike is very personal, this one particularly bland and it upset my stomach to the point where I had to five the entire bag to someone who could tolerate it better. I was glad that I got it 50% off with another deal because I would have been extremely upset having spent the money on a really terrible flavor. The Extreme Milk Chocolate is 100x better. If that's an option that you're considering, I'd take that as a better option. I still support ON, but would suggest avoiding this flavor if possible.
 The vanilla ice cream flavor tastes pretty much like melted vanilla ice cream. You do get an initial whiff of spoiled milk that characterizes whey, but that doesn't affect the taste. And there is an aftertaste of the artificial sweetener, sucralose, that stays with you for a while. I much prefer this to the double rich chocolate that I had been using because this doesn't give me the slightly nauseated feeling the chocolate did.<br/><br/>The French Vanilla, by the way, tastes nothing like this. It's less sweet and tastes more like the spoiled milk flavor of raw whey. A teaspoon of cocoa vastly improves the flavor without adding much of a chocolate taste.
 I have lifted weights and trained for over 15 years and have been through different brands, and finally started buying Optimum Nutrition two years ago, and haven't looked back. I have tried other brands and flavors, to see which I like most, and iON is a clear winner across its product range.<br/><br/>With protein powders it is honestly hard to say that not one of the flavors I have had is not ---&gt; good. Vanilla and Chocolate are easy to drink and easy to mix with frozen fruit, peanut butter, etc. The flavors aren't too sweet or too bland. I don't get half-way through the drink and think to myself, bwuh, this stuff is thick, or blah, like past brands. The drinks are delicious. I drink several each day.<br/><br/>What I like most about this powder is how easy it is to mix. Past brands were often clumpy and if not mixed properly/thoroughly, I would get some powder clumps in the mouth. Yummy. :/  With this product, I merely add milk to a large cup, then add the powder. Once in the cup I stir up the powder with a fork and then add a banana, frozen raspberries and/or frozen strawberries, and sometimes an egg, kiwi, fresh strawberries, blue berries, and occasionally orange slices or nuts. Then I use a hand blender until all is smooth and ready.<br/><br/>Delicious. Just plain delicious! Then I take in some creatine, fish oil tablets, flaxseed oil, and multi-vitamins. Seldom sick. Lots of energy. Feel great. No irregular bowel movements, diarrhea or other illnesses/symptoms.<br/><br/>Highly recommend this product to anyone the is fed-up as I was with nasty tasting, hard to stir/blend protein shakes.
 This is by far one of the best protein powders on the market. Just about every protein powder on the market has similar protein amounts. However, none of them taste as good as these.<br/><br/>Personally I don't want crazy flavors like triple chocolate chunk brownie fudge with peanut butter. I just want plain vanilla or plain chocolate. The flavors I have tried are vanilla and the basic chocolate. Both flavors taste very good whether mixed with water or milk.<br/><br/>Also another reason I love this protein powder is because it mixes really well with milk. I personally prefer to mix my protein powder with milk because I think it tastes better. Most protein powders don't mix really well with milk, but this one does for some reason which is awesome.<br/><br/>Overall you cannot go wrong with this protein powder.<br/><br/>Please rate this as helpful if it was helpful to you.
 Just one scoop of this gives me a very bad headache enough to screw up the whole day.<br/>Initially it was difficult to isolate the reasons to my headache. finally, found this to be the culprit. Everytime I have this with water or milk, it gives me a bad headache.<br/>Has this gone bad or the ingredients changed or what? I dont know... but I just cant use this<br/><br/>UPDATE: JUST NOTICED THAT MY REVIEW DOES NOT SHOW UP AS VERIFIED PURCHASE THOUGH I PURCHASED THRU AMAZON LAST MONTH. IS IT BECAUSE I GAVE A NEGATIVE FEEDBACK??
 I purchased this without looking at ingredients because the front states Whey Protein Isolate.  But this is a blend that contains Concentrate.  It tastes decent, but I wanted something clean and this has too many ingredients in it.  I was fine with it for about a month, now I noticed this is what is keeping me bloated.  Even if I take HCL or ACV, it keep me bloated for about 4 hours.
 This product was easy to mix even by spoon, though it did take a min. or so of stirring. I mixed it with 2% milk n it tasted like chocolate milk. Delicious.  I bought this from local grocery because the pics of Amazon product doesn't match up with actual product at stores n I wanted to be sure I got the real deal n not a 'knock off'. All in all, a great product.
 I HAD HIGH HOPES FOR THIS PROTEIN POWDER AND GOD WAS I WRONG. THEY MUST'VE CHANGED THE FORMULA BECAUSE I ORDERED THE RICH CHOCOLATE FLAVOR IN THE PAST AND IT WAS NOT THIS BAD. ITS VERY DIFFICULT TO DRINK THIS STUFF. I HAVE TO DRINK IT SUPER ICE COLD JUST TO GET FORCE IT DOWN. I'D STAY AWAY AND FIND ANOTHER PROTEIN POWDER TO DRINK.
 Undrinkable! I thought it was me but after reading these reviews, I'm in good company. I am a first time user and thought I'd give it a shot but I am returning this product because of the excessive sweetness - I can actually taste the sucralose. You can smell it upon opening.  Also, they've added Acesulfame potassium, also known as acesulfame K, a calorie-free sweetener up to 200 times sweeter than sugar and as sweet as aspartame. What made it more sickening was adding frozen fruit. Tried again this time using nutritional binders: chia, hemp seeds and flax seed with 2 handfuls of power greens and it was drinkable.  Shouldn't have to go to this extreme.  I'm returning to Isopure where the taste is good and the ingredients are few with added vitamins/minerals; however, it does have sucralose (definitely not in such quantity as this) and no Acesulfame Potassium which what I think caused this nasty flavor.
 If you want high quality supplements, get familiar with the NSF (National Sanitation Foundation). They certify companies and facilities as meeting certain standards of quality. If they aren't on the list don't buy it. Also, the NSF and GMP (Good Manaufacturing Practices) logos are easy to look for on the products themselves if you don't want to use the list.<br/><br/> The following links will get you started.<br/>http://info.nsf.org/Certified/Dietary/<br/>This one will get you the big list of companies you can trust.  You can search for a specific one or just hit search and let it list them all.<br/><br/>http://info.nsf.org/Certified/GMP/Listings.asp?CertName=glanbia<br/>This one shows that Glanbia and Optimum Nutrition are certified. I also found that EAS and Twinlab are on the list and readily found at the usual stores like GNC and Vitamin Shoppe.
 Overall pretty decent taste for essentially liquid aminos (I got the French Vanilla). Combine a scoop of this with about a cup of milk (fat content doesn't matter) in a BlenderBottle for a nice, frothy protein shake. The only concern I have is the price: you're paying about 75 cents for just the whey component each shake. If I could pay only 50 cents or less I would give this product a five star rating.
 I see a lot of reviews about the formula being changed. I get the chocolate flavor and put it in milk and it still tastes the same to me! It’s like chocolate milk. This is the best tasting protein powder I have tried. Kind of pricy but I guess you get what you pay for because I tried a cheaper kind and it tasted like crap. This is the only one I buy anymore.
 Have been using Dymatize Whey Isolate  gave this Gold Star stuff a try was very disappointed sad to say it has 3 times more carbs than Dyamatize Whey Isolate is also a pure isolate this one was Not the same in Quality or taste In Both I found Dyamtize Whey Isolate by far Superior in Protien content protien to carb ratio and taste and digestion Bronze star would be a better name for it The Real Gold Star in Taste and Quality is cleary Dymatize Whey Isolate !!!
 Pros: reliable great quality from ON, solid rounding on macros, fairly affordable for a big brand<br/><br/>Cons: Flavor! It’s a bit bland compared to other brands... However I had my old container of nesquik powder next to it and decided to experiment. For those who have a tiny bit of flexibility for macros/sugar I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend adding a tablespoon of nesquik when mixing with milk. Total flavor transformation and I can’t stop using it now!
 I LOST 50 POUNDS Using this Product!! I use this every morning in a "power drink" as a protein supplement and also for its micronutrients. High quality product, i use in my shake made with high protein peanut butter called Naturally More. I have lost 50 pounds replacing my meals with this protein....LOVE IT!!<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Naturally-More-Natural-Crunchy-Peanut-Butter-Spread-with-Protein/dp/B01B65NX92/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Naturally More Natural Crunchy Peanut Butter Spread with Protein</a>
 I like this product. Let me first start by saying that I do not think this is "the BEST" protein product ever. However, I've tried many protein products and this comes rather close.<br/><br/>In my honest opinion, "the BEST" protein product out there would have to be "Profect" by Protica Research. It's actually the stuff used by gastric bypass patients. It's 25 grams of high-absorb protein in only 2.7 fluid oz that literally tastes like fruit candy. But, it's way too expensive and a two-months supply can set you back a couple of hundred bucks easily. Because of this, it's better suited strictly toward its medical purposes.<br/><br/>This product is also not the "most cost-effective". There are plenty of other whey products out there that are much much cheaper and have just as much protein content, but they all pretty much taste like doo doo. What's the point in torturing yourself to save a few bucks? Cost is definitely an important factor, but not the most important.<br/><br/>Apart from all of the hype and a... Read more
 I started taking protein powder recently and got my first brand (Muscle tech) at Walmart. It tasted good but I wanted the best. I researched on Amazon and Optimum Nutrition came up as the best seller with amazing reviews.  I chose double chocolate as that seemed to have the most recommendations and I love chocolate.<br/>I don't know if they have changed their formula because this is the first time I've had it but it was disgusting. It had a very strange smell and was hard to get down. I'm very open and decided to give it a try for 2 weeks, hoping it would grow on me or I would get used to it. I has NOT!<br/>In addition to the very bad taste, I noticed I had horrible stomach issues, horrible gas, bloating and diarrhea.<br/>I simply can't take this anymore so I'm finishing up my Walmart protein, which doesn't have those effects and my search is back on for another protein.<br/>I know the reviews are good but reconsider or at least don't order the huge one, like I did, and waste $60.
 I loved this product until I discovered it had sucralose. Obviously people using this are going to be people that are trying to take better care of their body in general and there’s way to much science out there about the negative effects of sucralose on your gut. Why not use Stevia?!!<br/>Or just a small serving of organic sugar in the raw.<br/>If they improve the ingredients it will be a five star review.<br/><br/>On a positive side I do love the banana flavor and that it has BCAAs.
 There are some reviews here that talk about what's in this stuff, nutritional value, etc. I will say this is a good product, but I'm sure that first time buyers want to know how it tastes. Mind you, these are just my personal preferences:<br/><br/>1. Chocolate Malt: this is my favorite. Good flavor. Obviously not as good as an actual malt from an ice cream shop, but close.<br/>2. French Vanilla Cream: my second favorite. Sort of a vanilla ice cream taste.<br/>3. Strawberry: not bad. If you enjoyed strawberry Quick in your milk as a kid (or maybe you still do), you'll like this one.<br/>4. Banana: Tastes like banana taffy. Not my thing but if you like the sweet artificial banana flavored candies, you'll like this.<br/>5. Chocolate Mint: The chocolate malt is a favorite and since that one is good I had high hopes for this flavor. I was disappointed. Very bland chocolate flavor with a hint of mint.<br/><br/>Hopefully this helps first time buyers. I'll add more as I try more flavors.
 As others have said, this was my go-to protein and tasted great. Now that the formula is different it’s just terrible. I thought my tastes changed but after comparing my old container with this new one, I realized it hadnt. DON’T BUY THIS! The high reviews are from the OLD FORMULA!
 This product is very good for the price. It is NOT the best, but the "best" is only marginally better and costs 3x the price. If you are taking 2-3 shakes a day that can really add up. At the start of 2006, I'd say Biotest produce the best products, you can read about them at T-Nation. HOWEVER they are very expensive and this is a fine product. I would give it 5 stars except it is a bit below the quality of others. Most protein brands I would only give 2 or 3 stars.<br/><br/>I am writing this review to help anyone who is unsure, as I was, about FLAVOUR and MIXABILITY. You can read detailed reviews on the bodybuilding website.<br/><br/>The flavour is not bad. Mixed only with water, it is not bad at all. Which is important because you will be taking it all the time. I have only tried Vanilla, which I prefer as a flavour, since you can mix it with other things, such as orange juice. The fact that it mixes with water and tastes OK is a great bonus.<br/><br/>Mixability - it is about 90% the mixability of the current best in the world. Most powders out there are 80% mixable at best. I mix with a spoon. But really, it pretty much mixes itself. I use it with soda water which fizzes, I put a bit of water in the cup, put the powder on top, stir it - and it fizzes to the top of the cup. Then I stir it up, add more water and it is done. When drunk, there is almost NO residue. That means no washing up. There are always small amounts that are not mixed, but these are very small indeed, and who cares your stomach will mix them. When drunk, the cup needs only a light rinse in water and is practically clean - the best cleanup of any product I have ever seen. Note that these useability benefits - clean mixing, easy cleanup - are essential if you are going to use the stuff multiple times a day. Who wants a trail of dirty cups along the sink?<br/><br/>Hope that helps. I certainly would recommend this product to anyone as the base of their protein, even if you can afford the more expensive brands.<br/><br/>Good luck with your training.
 I’ve had other flavors of this product before and been relatively satisfied. This flavor, however, tastes like overly bitter coffee. Considering I was going for sweet cookies and cream, I’m not happy with the purchase. I rarely write reviews, but in this case I followed up with Optimum Nutrition and was told that any refunds or replacements would have to go through Amazon as I didn’t buy from ON. Also, their investigation will take several weeks to determine if the product met their quality criteria. Seems odd that a company won’t stand by their product and make the general assumption that the customer is right.
 THIS PERSON IS SUCH A LIER! GOT MY "CAKE BATTER" PROTEIN! IT WAS OPEN! NO SEAL ANYWHERE!!! SMELLED LIKE SOMETHING WEIRD, TRIED IT &amp; IT GOT ME SICK!!!!! IDK WHAT YOU PUT IN THIS, BUT MAY GOD BLESSS YOU, HES WATCHING WHAT YOUR DOING &amp; SELLING TO OTHERS! DO NOT BUY PROTEIN FROM THIS PERSON
 Quality protein and a great flavor! I went with the white chocolate (normally I just get the smaller key lime pie flavor), and have been pleasantly impressed! I always prefer vanilla or white chocolate over regular, and normally vanilla in any protein just has a weird flavor to me. This was the one to set the bar so far. It's not to enjoy that soft white chocolate flavor, this is more of a treat than a protein drink based on flavor!
 I never understood the rage about this product.  Its good, but so is many others for less the cost.
 Milk chocolate is by far my favorite flavor.  Stay AWAY from the rocky road flavor, I tried it and there was something definitely off.  The smell stuck to my hands and breath for hours and I had to force myself to take it (which means I don't take it as often as I need to)  Milk chocolate is AMAZING though. Stick to that
 I was able to get a couple jugs of this from Amazon at a really good price.  I've eaten a lot of protein powder over the past 20+ years, and most modern ones are pretty good.  I was almost shocked at how bland this tastes, especially since I know it has been viewed as a pretty solid product for a long time.  The chocolate taste and sweetness both are barely perceptible.  Maybe some people like that, but I thought it was pretty bad compared to most others out there.
 not much else to say other than the title of my review. i've been drinking the ON Vanilla Ice Cream for 3 months now. It is delicious and definitely helps me stay on my diet and I know i'm getting the Protein i need with my workout. I remember the days when i used to have to plug my nose to drink the MetRx shakes. Those days are well behind me, i look forward to drinking this stuff and it does satisfy my hunger. I throw a raw egg white in there for a few extra grams of protein too. I mix 32 oz of skim milk and 4 scoops of shake in the morning with the raw egg white and waaaala i have 135 grams of protein waiting for me for the rest of the day. That along with my other meals gives me plenty of protein for the day. I definitely recommend this shake to anyone wanting to make sure they get enough protein or even anyone that wants to cut down on their carb intake.<br/><br/>Ohhh and i'm very picky about the taste of protein shakes. This and Muscle Milk are my favorites but stopped drinking Muscle Milk...too many calories and frustrated they stopped making the Root Beer Float. Hopefully ON will make a Root Beer Float flavor one day.
 $27.99 for 2lbs? I can get that much with BodyFortress from wally world for $16. Still upset I used to get it for $13. and ON used to sell for $16. ON is very high quality protein though and mixes very well in milk and unlike some powders this tastes good.<br/><br/>I digress however. I'm not going to buy this stuff anymore. It's mostly just placebo- marketing to get you to buy stuff you really don't need. I've gotten all kinds of gains eating real food- oatmeal, eggs, milk.I just make sure i get at least 100g protein  But if you must buy supplements you might want to look into soy protein it is cheaper (don't believe the bro-science that you will get a lot of estrogen it isn't true).
 The taste was too sweet, so I add some unflavored protein powder - about 2 parts unflavored to 1 part flavored --  and this fixes the taste.  Also, the unflavored powder has a very superior score from the cleanlabel project which improves the heavy metal, etc. score as well.
 I have tried a few other protein powders - from rice, to grass feed whey, to the brand isopure which I used for a long while.  There are lots of other similar comments from other reviewers so I will keep mine short.<br/><br/>- High purity,  American sourced  and made , low contamination ( consumer reports issue)<br/>- BCAA's.<br/>- Mixes very well - smooth.<br/>- Vanilla tastes pretty good.<br/>- Easy to digest - I have a minor lactose and other food allergies.  My stomach loves this stuff.<br/>- Price/Value for what you get.<br/><br/>Only down side is due to a mix of protien types - a single scoop full has 24 grams of protien which may not be enough for some. I use a scoop and half.
 use it everyday.<br/>Iced Mocha latte: double shot of espresso into a ninja blender with crushed ice,1 or 2 scoops whey,splash of skim milk, splash of sweetener of choice (I use coconut flavor).  Just like $5 store latte.<br/>Orange Tootsie Pop: Yup maybe disgusting to some but I love it. teaspoon or 2 of orange psyllium fiber and a scoop or 2 of choco whey.  Orange tootsie pop I swear!
 I was disappointed  in this whey powder. Since it was "double chocolate", I  naively expected it to have a chocolate  taste. Silly me. It was definitely  more vanilla-ish, was even a beige color. It didn't taste bad, in fact had very little taste at all. Definitely  needs to be jazzed up with fruit or something.
 Majority of the reviews cover how good it, but I think it has too much sucrose. I would have given it 5 stars, but my god, one scoop of ON can over power the taste of the fing taste of "Amazing Grass Green SuperFood" (2 scoops). I wonder ON protein ingredient is like 25% sucrose, because I can barely taste "Amazing Grass Green SuperFood" (compared to the plant protein chocolate drinks, where the amazing grass overpowered the protein drink). I'm not one of those people who believe sucrose will kill me or some crap, but I hate how strong the taste is.
 General Use<br/><br/>Optimum Nutrition has entirely satisfied the need for a functional protein that can be used by a spectrum of people. The 2015 Protein Powder of the Year award winner from Bodybuilding.com provides consumers with a high end product at reasonable cost. The beginning athlete that has just begun their fitness journey will be just as satisfied with this product as an avid weightlifter would be. I purchased the 5 pound container for $57.99 which is fairly cost efficient since each serving only costs $0.79. This highly rated powder is in the same price range as lower quality protein products.<br/><br/>Flavor<br/><br/>The flavor I purchased is Extreme Milk Chocolate. It has a very rich, chocolatey flavor, making it something that I look forward to after a long workout. The protein powder is best mixed with milk in a blender or thoroughly stirred with a spoon until entirely dissolved. Mixing with water resulted in a less desirable chalky texture that most protein powders have, so milk is a much better option. The high quality taste is no surprise because this product won Bodybuilding.com’s award for 2015 Best Tasting Protein of the Year. I have yet to try any other flavors because I have been completely satisfied with what my current flavor tastes like.<br/><br/>Effectiveness<br/><br/>I used this whey protein as a post workout supplement to help muscle recovery and therefore enhance muscle growth. The difference this product made was very noticeable. I immediately felt less soreness in the days after a long workout and was ready to rework a muscle with fewer days rest for that specific muscle. The 24 grams of whey protein and amino acids that every serving contains definitely served its desired purpose. Protein supplementation is a great benefit to any athlete, and this product is the ideal way to satisfy your protein needs.<br/><br/>Good luck and best wishes to everyone on their own individual fitness journey. I hope I was able to help expedite your process of finding a quality protein powder supplement.
 My background...<br/>I'm 6'6" and fat.  I'm trying to lose fat and move from 270lbs to 220lbs.  This stuff gives me a delicious protein snack with no unnecessary calories.  This stuff gives me full control of my calories: almost no fat or carbs and loaded with protein.  So I'm able to mix it with water, milk, fruit, oats, etc.  I'm not a bodybuilder, and I'm pure amateur in terms of nutrition and workouts.  That being said, lets get started...<br/><br/>PERFORMANCE / EFFECTIVENESS<br/>****************************<br/>I have no idea, to be honest, but Optimum Nutrition is reputable and I'm getting stronger, while recovering more quickly.  I'd say it's more of my workout and diet, but this stuff has barely any fat or carbs - it's almost pure protein, in terms of calories.  Great base for a pre- &amp; post-workout shake.  I have to believe that this stuff has contributed to my progress more than not because when I was deployed for 4 months I didn't have it.  Since I've come back to America I have more control over my diet and am able to use this (a high protein, low fat) to better control my diet.<br/><br/>TASTE<br/>******<br/>- Cookies &amp; Cream:  Incredible!  This is my favorite but only comes in a 5 pound tub.<br/>- Double Rich Chocolate:  Standard chocolate flavor.  Nothing special, but good to mix with banana.<br/>- Rocky Road: Wow!  I moved to this because cookies and cream don't come in a 10 pound package.  I'm not kidding when I say it tastes like fudge and marshmallow.  It's really great!  I can't wait to try it with skim milk and a banana mixed in.<br/><br/>TEXTURE<br/>********<br/>I've used a blender and a blender bottle with this stuff and it mixes great EVERY TIME!  Smooth, no chunks, doesn't clump, etc.
 My personal trainer recommended I take this to help me gain some weight and to feed my muscles better to improve my workout results. I did a bunch of research and while, usually for anything, some will say it's good and some will say it's bad, I believe that the science is pretty sound. This stuff tastes OK (but one of those mixing bottles with the little metal ball inside, it mixes this perfectly) and I have noticed better workout results and some small (good) gains in weight. My energy levels are better also.<br/>Don't expect miracles, but I for one am staying on this stuff, I think it's good for me.
 I've been lifting and supplementing for 13 years, and this is the greatest whey I've ever had.  Ultra fine powder that mixes completely with just a spoon and a cup of water.  Taste is delicious, even with water.  Zipper keeps it super dry.  It's hard to find something to dislike.  The only thing would be if you get bored of having a single flavor of protein, a 10 lb bag may not be for you.  But then again that's why you add bananas, peanut butter, or nutella to the mix.  I've gone through my second bag already, and I'm not bored of the taste.
 I tried double rich chocolate, french vanilla, rocky road, and extreme milk chocolate. The chocolate ones were definitely the best with extreme milk chocolate being just a little bit better. Rocky Road was kind of funky though. I still have yet to find protein powder that actually tastes as good as the flavor name, but this brand's whey is one of the best ones I've had.
 I am a heavy lifter, and so I need to consume lots of protein in order to recover from my workouts.  I love ON whey protein.  I especially love the double rich chocolate flavor, although I alternate between chocolate, strawberry and vanilla.<br/><br/>I start out my morning with a shake made of two scoops mixed with milk, which is low in calories but great in everything I need.  It also keeps me going until lunch.  When I lift hard consistently, and use ON Whey Protein, I can feel the muscle growing and experience excellent gains.<br/><br/>I will always have some on hand, and go through a tub every month or month and a half.  I would definitely recommend.
 I've now purchased this twice. I really like it- and have been trying the different chocolate flavors. I like that this doesn't get chunky and doesn't taste super chalky.  I will keep repurchasing this brand!
 Great taste and easy to mix.  I prefer to drink mine with milk but I did try it with water and it was fine.  Based on research before buying this product has quality ingredients and  a strong serving of protein.  I wish they had taped the scoop to the lid or something as I had to fish it out but other than that extremely happy and will definitely buy again.
 I bought this protein powder (Vanilla Ice Cream flavor) after my personal trainer suggested I start taking protein shakes. The protein powder that he wanted me to buy at the gym was way too pricey for my budget (Xsport brand).  So I bought this as an alternative because it had a similar composition.  It is low on fat and carbs while still giving a high dose of protein.<br/>I usually mix with milk (as I don't currently have a blender) and it mixes pretty well but sometimes still get a few chunks.  It has also taken me a while to get used to since I have never eaten protein shakes before, which also means I can't compare it to other products.  The flavor overall is fairly good and it is reminiscent of cake mix.  It tastes a lot better when I make it in a smoothie with added fruit, ice, and other mix-ins; most likely because it hid the flavor better (I use The Abs Diet recipes).<br/>I found it is a great snack for me between meals or for breakfast or after workouts.  It keeps me full but it does leave me feel sort of bloated after drinking one.<br/>Buying it in a larger quantity means getting a better deal.  So it's a good deal for what I think is a little higher quality protein powder.
 I've been using this for a little while now on days when I am not able to eat breakfast. I don't use it for building muscle or for weight loss. I try to follow a paleo/primal diet and sometimes making eggs in the morning takes too long. In this case a protein shake is much better than nothing. The taste is OK. I don't really care about taste, so as long as it is not disgusting I'm fine with it. We also give this to my kids occasionally with Pixie Vites mixed in. My kids hate the taste of those vitamins but love them with this protein powder. We don't give them this everyday though, just a couple times a week. I'm sure there are better quality powders out there but  has worked for us.
 I'd say that this product's great reputation is well deserved. Hard to recommend this product without sounding like I work for them haha<br/><br/>Combined with the right exercises, you should see visible results pretty quickly. Personally, I matched this with micronised creatine (also from ON) and had far greater results doing the same routines I did years ago. (skipped gym for 3 years - now back on)<br/><br/>Going through my 2nd tub now, and now all my other workout supplements are from Optimum Nutrition. :)
 Delicious! I blend it with my morning coffee with a little ghee or coconut oil for quick and effective power-packed cognitive-breakfast w/ 25 grams of protein. End result: a tasty french vanilla cappuccino-like breakfast with near zero carbs. I Win!  Not to mention this is one of best products on the market with zero filler or additives.<br/><br/>P.S. This review was powered by ON Protein/Fat/Power Coffee Lol.
 A friend recommended this to me. While the chocolate flavor is good at first, the artificial sweetener they used would stay on my tongue for hours after drinking a shake...even after brushing my teeth. Not a good aftertaste. I blended it with some unsweetened coco powder to dull that down which helped me finish the bag, but I wouldn't buy it again. I've since purchased an unflavored powder that I add my own coco and agave nectar to.
 So people are probably wondering why this ON whey protein is the best one in the market... I was. I have been working out for a few years but i always used other brands of protein. I thought this brand was expensive. I could find much cheaper ones and it should work the same as long as I workout, right? uhmm.. no. I finally switched to this brand and I can feel right away that this is a high quality protein powder. At a glance, it taste good, it blends very well. After taking it, my body feels light and not bloated like other brands. The most important advantage for me is I don't get acnes from this brand. I will be taking this from now on and I won't be going back. Yes it is more expensive than other brands but I think it's a good investment if you wanna make the most out of your workout. You sweat blood at the gym, you would want to replenish your body with good stuff, right?
 I do Protein Sparing Modified Fasts, which are pretty restrictive, so the things you can eat, you want to taste good.<br/><br/>I've been through at least 10 different protein powders, and they all have their own explanation of why they beat all the others.  They also all claim to taste THE BESTEST!!!11!1.  They don't.  Some of them are downright disgusting.<br/><br/>Granted, I am not a weight trainer or an athlete, just someone with whom sugar does not really agree and who wants to lose weight.  PSMFs are fast, effective, and nixing the sugar makes me feel a thousand times better. Because I'm not looking for any specific nutritional punch, just something for a meal supplement, my main concerns are carb count, protein quantity and taste.<br/><br/>The carb count is low. Just a couple of grams per serving.<br/><br/>The protein count is higher than a lot of others, which range from 16 to 20 on average.  This one has 25.<br/><br/>The taste is great!  Don't get me wrong, I much prefer the taste of a rich, thick, sinful vanilla or chocolate shake, but for what it is, this stuff is really good.  There is no grainy texture, no lumps, no aftertaste, and even in water (with just a tablespoon of cream for richness... yes, I know that's cheating on the PSMF, but I do it anyway and it still works) it rivals a pretty good glass of chocolate milk.  This was for the chocolate malt flavor. I have the vanilla but I haven't gotten into that one yet.<br/><br/>GNC had it on sale for 25.99 and knowing what it tastes like now, I'll likely go grab a couple more tubs of it.
 I've been buying Optimum Nutrition's whey protein for a few years now and I believe it is high quality whey protein, but . . .<br/><br/>I am extremely disappointed with the way the company is JACKING UP THE PRICES.  The price of this stuff on Amazon four months ago was $50 for a 10 pound bag - now it's $79!  The price has skyrocked up 60% in the last four months - this is ridiculous!<br/><br/>If they don't come back to reality and drop their prices down soon I'm going to have to look for something else - Optimum Nutrition is doing a MAJOR DISSERVICE to their long-time customers.
 This whey protein is perhaps the most tasty ON product I have tried so far. ON whey products are all good in my opinion. If you don't like the original chocolate flavors, certainly give coffee one a try. I should mention the coffee flavor seems a tad more sweet than the chocolate one so I sometimes blend the two.
 I’ve been using the ON Whey protein for a couple of years now and love it. Great tasting, great results with all the protein and nutrients you’d want. The best out there, hands down!!!
 If you're a hard gainer, I would most definately recommend this for you to drink AFTER every workout (preferably a lifting workout). I jumped from 155 to about 175 in the span of 6 months or so. Mix the chocolate flavor with a banana and almond milk and boom, damn good drink. I will say though, the strawberry taste like bootyhole. I don't recommend.
 Years ago, I did a fairly extensive "taste test" of all of the major protein powders on the market. Every single one disappointed me: they were either too expensive, tasted terrible, didn't mix up well, or usually some combination of all three. This was the first powder I found that would mix perfectly (PERFECTLY) in a simple shaker (no blender needed!), tasted just like chocolate milk (the other flavors are lacking for me), and was very reasonable per scoop. Lately, the price on this has ratcheted higher and higher, but I'm not ready to start hunting for a replacement. It fills me up as a post-workout shake!
 I've been using this mix for over a year now with great results.  This is a great mix of whey protein with great flavor.  Whether making a recovery drink with milk, fruit, yogurt and oj or simply making a 'snack' with just nonfat milk, I've really enjoyed this drink. Muscle recovery was improved with this protein as well, and digests very easily...this is a good one for those like me with a sensitive stomach.<br/><br/>The flavor is great, company is respected and the cost is right. The shake also mixes very well without a blender or shake-mixer, which you can't often say with good protein powders. Amazon is your best bet for cost on this one too, especially as a Subscribe and Save item...
 This is the best protein powder I use. Ive only tried cookies n creme. Ill consider other flavors in the future. Perfect for blending into smoothies or simply dissolve in water if rushed. No clumps!
 I Had this whey protein before and it was great. Now the recipe is different and it just tastes awful. I can't combine it with any of my smoothies because its just TOO sweet to the point it almost makes me puke. I'm used to protein but not like this. So many people rave about this protein but they are just riding the wave of what they used to be. Do your research and you'll see I'm not lying. Returning this and hopefully finding cleaner protein.
 i have to much years buying this... what is the meaning of the proposition 65?.... this have lead i dont udenrstand , what happened?
 I ordered the French Vanilla flavor.  It goes well with more or less everything.  This is a solid protein powder that mixes really well.<br/><br/>I've also tried Muscle Milk and BSN in the past.  Muscle Milk probably has the best flavors but it doesn't mix as well and it seems that there may be more additives.  BSN tastes ok (on par with ON) but their protein definitely doesn't mix as well as the ones from ON.
 This protein has been my go to for many years now. The powder is fine enough to be mixed easily with a few shakes of the bottle and the taste is great. Another plus is that the zipper on the bag is high quality and is unlikely to break before you finish the product (unlike Protein Factories bags). All in all I have used about 10 different brands of protein (and about 4 different types) over the last 10 years and I feel like this one is the highest quality for the price you pay.
 First time using this protein powder(heard a lot of good things about this so i decided to give it a try) and i love it. I Ordered strawberry banana flavor and it taste exactly like strawberry and bananas. It will be awhile until i see results since i got it three days ago but I'm definitely loving the taste. If I'm getting results from EAS protein powder I know I'll definitely see something with this.
 I have been taking this product for years now.  I have tried many other proteins, I have found ones that I like, but I always come back to Gold standard.  I have tried nearly all their flavors.  Extreme milk chocolate being my favorite,  followed my rocky road and mocha cappuccino.  The protein percentage is very high in this product compared to others, and if you look at every bodybuilding sight, this  product is always at the top of the list.  So whoever says this product is bad, is definitely doing something wrong..  5 stars in my book,  as well as all my bodybuilding friends..  Give it a try and see why they call this product the Gold standard.. Nothings better!
 Tastes Great. If you're ordering the chocolate flavor.. I recommend ordering another flavor to mix it with because it doesn't taste so good on it's own.
 I just got the rocky road flavor in the mail right now. I think it tastes better than the double rich chocolate. It mixes very well with milk. The rocky road seems to mix even better.<br/><br/>Be warned however, the flavor is STRONG with rocky road. I actually wish it wasn't so strong. I put about 1.5 scoops in about 3 measured cups of milk. It's a strong splenda type flavor. I generally try to chug it as fast as I can without breathing so the flavor isn't as strong lol. But the powder itself seems to work pretty well.<br/><br/>I feel like my results at the gym have been improved due to the protein powder.
 Having bounced around a few times between this and EASs Whey protein powder products,I give a nod to Gold Standard.  Its lower cholesterol content combined with less sugars, tips the scale, at least for me.  I do have to pay attention to my cholesterol levels; despite what some would have you believe, dietary cholesterol intake does influence those levels (it's not simply related to saturated fats in many cases).  That said, EAS's chocolate flavored whey protein powder has a slightly sweeter chocolate taste, something I actually prefer, but overall, Gold Standard's the product I consume most often.
 I got the 5lb bag of the Double chocolate, I have tried quite a few protien shakes and I have to say this by a landslide is the smoothest, mixed in so eaisly and it wasnt thick even with two scoops. That strong protien taste wasnt there either, it just tasted like chocolate milk. It also has low carbs, I'm on the paleo diet so I use this for meals when im too busy or tierd to cook, wasnt expecting it to taste so much better, so I'm very happy. 1 downside I couldnt find the scoop lol but im sure its in there somewhere.
 If you're looking for a protein supplement to add to your workout/muscle building routine, I highly recommend this on multiple levels.  1) Price - I think I bought the 5 lb jar for about $45 on Amazon.  At other health retailers, that price is easily in the $60-75 range.  2) Taste - This is my second 5 lb jar.  The first was milk chocolate, which I generally liked.  The cookies and cream that I'm on now is OK, and is the only reason this isn't a 5-star review.  I had heard good things about this flavor, and figured I'd try it, but it's very vanilla-y for me.  Finally, 3) Results - I've only been doing weight lifting/resistance training to bulk up for about 4 months now.  The mornings on my workout days I drink a serving of the protein powder and then another serving after the workout (usually within 30 minutes of my cool-down); and in those 4 months, I've gained 15 pounds of muscle.  I had seen other products boasting "16 pounds of muscle in 4 weeks," but I wanted gradual change.  The combination of a consistent workout schedule and this protein powder are definitely helping me achieve that.
 Very good
 Well, I don't like its artificial/plastic-ish taste...it hardly taste any chocolate... I have to have it with flavored milk,i.e chocolate milk or fruity yogurt.. Then I read the label which says that this is the purest protein you can really get on this planet (is this why it doesn't taste much?)... Not sure whether this is true. I give it four stars if this is highly purified protein...
 As a personal trainer/ health and fitness fan this was my go to protein powder.  Unfortunately they changed the ingredients using surclose(an artificial sweetener)  I returned the product and bought good old fashioned bison and veal.  No poison for me.
 I've been around the world and back in the supplement world.  From designer supplements to fad supplements.  To trying different so-called miracle supplements.  I have found out through all the supplements I've tried and all the results I've had and all the money wasted, that there are only 3 supplements that will ever do anything worth while for muscle building for the money you pay:<br/><br/>1) Whey Protein<br/>2) Creatine<br/>3) Beta Alanine<br/><br/>All the other stuff you hear about is basically based off these 3 ingredients.  Those that are riding the bandwagon of pre-workout supplements like Jack3d, well the majority of those are based off on caffeine (which is cheap and easy to get), beta alanine (which can be bought separate and cheaper), and AAKG (the so-called pump cure which in fact does nothing).  You have your other supplements that are filled with who knows what and causes side-effects and very little actual muscle building.  Why do I mention this other stuff?  Well your hard earned money is going to this other trash according to top sellers on places like bodybuilding store sites.  Creatine and Beta Alanine are great.  But Whey Protein is a must.  I say "whey" and not just protein because I am talking supplements.  Obviously, if you can't man-up and eat lbs of chicken or other clean meat along with complex carbs like potatos, oatmeal, and pasta daily for months and months straight, don't bother with whey protein.  However, whey is great because it can be used before and after gym and waking up.  I use it even before sleep but then you will get the casein crowd telling me I don't know what I'm talking about even though I walk year-round at under 10% bodyfat and have a 515lbs deadlift.<br/><br/>So back to why this is great.  It is clean and has a decent profile for the money.  I have used Isoflex by AllMax nutrition that has a far superior profile but you pay for that (27 g protein for 30 g scoop = 90%+ protein per serving).  Optimum only gives you about 80% at best of protein per serving.  Not talking about the name guys (100% Whey Gold), but the actual product based on serving scoop/protein amount ratio.<br/><br/>Bottom line, I have tried every flavor of ON Protein and 2 of the 16 or so flavors suck badly.  However, Extreme Milk Chocolate is where its at.  Never puked it beforee and it does nothing but slowly, but consistently pack on the muscle.<br/><br/>Sorry for long review, but I hate seeing people get suckered into crap supplements and wondering why they still look the same after years of training.
 This Whey Protein powder has been the best out of all the ones I have tried so far over the years and here is why:<br/><br/>No Clumps- I used a small blender ball shaker and this mixed in about 10 shakes with no clumps at all.<br/><br/>Small Amount needed-  only one small scoop per shake. 5 lbs gets you 77 shakes, not bad at all.<br/><br/>Taste-  I use the chocolate and have to say the taste is better than all the others I have tried. Not chalky at all like most Protein shakes.
 Ahmazing. Took this for 3 days and put on 20 pounds of pure muscle mass. I can bench my dad's truck now and I leave all the bitches swooning with my muscular physique
 Great protein product.  I mix it with water and it tastes great.  Other powders I have to use milk or it doesn't taste very good.  It also dissolves just fine.
 Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Protein is without a doubt, the BEST protein supplement on the market! I have tried both the vanilla and chocolate flavors, each being superbly delicious in their own fashions.<br/>The vanilla is rather smooth and creamy when mixed with milk and also does very well when mixed with smoothies. However, the chocolate is my favorite of the two. It is surprisingly rich and flavorful that makes you craving for more!<br/>Overall, you cannot go wrong with this product. With 23 grams of protein and only 3 grams of carbs per serving, this is the ultimate protein supplement drink on the market today.
 This Whey Protein product has helped me built muscles.  However, all thanks to this product - My psoriasis has come back - After more than 4 decades in submission.  Guess I will have to fine another product to help me build muscles.
 When I first started working out I just bought the regular GNC brand protein and it was ok but I really didn't want to drink it so I gradually left the weightlifting scene behind.  Now that I'm back in it I read some reviews and decided to buy this brand but unfortunately GNC only had Double Chocolate (not a choc fan) but I bought it anyways.  I just use water since I can't tolerate milk that well and it still taste amazing and I don't even like chocolate all that much.  I shake mine and have never had a problem with clumping or anything.  There are other products that have a lot more protein per serving but why down a shake that taste like  ...] once a day when you can drink this at every meal and more.  Will order Vanilla next since that flavor is my favorite so hopefully it taste just has good.  Buy from Amazon, GNC is too expensive.
 I am a huge fan of protein powders as a meal replacement. And I was tired of the typical flavors....vanilla, chocolate and strawberry. So I tried the banana cream flavor of this powder.<br/><br/>In a word, yum!! It's not too sweet with no funky aftertaste. I might just have a new favorite! Can't wait to try some of the other flavors of this brand.
 I tried so many proteins and I dislike all of them they’re gross. These are the only ones i absolutely love.
 Perhaps there are several (not many) other blends that have more BCAAs or whey isolates that are indeed more effective. However, if your goal is long term and you do not require extra calories to put on weight, this is easily the best 'go to' protein powder on the market.
 I've never been someone who buys protein powder - I'm not into muscle building and supplements.  However, I recently had a week when I had to work 80 hours.  I ate one or two meals a day that week, and nothing terribly nutritious.  All I did for 7 days straight was drive to and from work, work, and try to get 7 hours sleep.<br/><br/>After it was over I decided that I'd buy a protein powder, and a green powdered superfood to keep in my pantry so that if I'm working long hours I can come home, throw the protein powder and green powder in a blender with frozen fruits and have a somewhat nutritious meal in 5 minutes.  In fact, if I'm going to use the blender (and then have to wash it) I might as well put in enough to have several smoothies - one for dinner and one to take in the car for breakfast.<br/><br/>I did an experiment with this powder today. I put a scoop of this powder, 1/2 cup of skim milk, 1/2 cup of vanilla yogurt, flax seeds, a handful of fresh spinach, frozen fruit and a couple of packets of Splenda in my Vitamix.  I really enjoyed the smoothie - I couldn't taste the spinach at all, the frozen strawberries and blueberries gave me antioxidants, the flax seed provided Omega 3, the yogurt was good for my digestive system.  I'll end up making smoothies with this whey powder a few times a week to satisfy my craving for something sweet and cold, but without the fat and sugar of a milkshake.  And when I have to work long hours this powder, the green powder and the frozen fruit will be a way to fix a quick meal substitute.
 I hope the formula and ingredients improve.<br/>This is supposed to be a health/nutrition supplement and yet there is artificial flavors and soy???<br/>Also natural flavors aren't any better. I get that ON needs too use cheap production methods to keep up with the competition.<br/>But consumers have access to how bad or potentially bad these unhealthy fillers are.<br/><br/>ON...I'm sure your customers are willing to pay a bit more for a non-soy, non artificial/natural flavor product.
 Optimum Nutrition is a trustworthy brand for protein. They tend to be more expensive than other brands, but you know you're getting what you pay for. I found Extreme Milk Chocolate to be a bit too sweet. Double Rich Chocolate is my favorite as it's not quite as sweet. Cookies and Cream is very sweet so I mix it with unflavored whey from another brand. Definitely recommend using a shaker cup to get a good blend. Blending with water tastes a bit like (cold) hot chocolate mix, but I prefer milk.
 Good product from Optimum, but caused a little too much bloating in me.  First of all, I don't think double rich chocolate is the best flavor when mixing with water.  But when taken with milk, the flavor was a lot better, even enjoyable.<br/>I have now switched to Cookies and Cream. And though I've heard many complain that it's much too sweet, it tends to agree more with my stomach.  The flavor is great, even when taken with water and bloating for me is greatly reduced.  I don't know why this is the case. But I think it might have to do with the differences in flavoring ingredients.<br/>My recommendation is don't do what I did. 10lbs is too much to commit to without really knowing how this product will play with your body.  Buy the smaller container and try different flavors to find out what works best for you.
 Optimum Nutrition's Gold Standard line is one of the best-tasting and easily-dissolved protein powders I've tried. It comes in a variety of flavors so there should be something for everyone - but I encourage sampling as not every flavor is right for every person. The nutrition label says it all for this powder; High protein, low-carb and very little fat makes this a perfect supplementary protein source.<br/><br/>Whether you're an amateur lifter, pro body builder, or just an average Joe it is likely that your eating habits are heavily carb-centric. To a lifter or dieter, the addition of supplementary protein to your overall caloric load will help keep you satisfied as well as foster any lean-muscle adaptations (whether you're after endurance, "toning", or size gains) you may be after. Personally, I use this product as a staple in my diet to offset the cost (in both price and preparation time) of my food budget and it is integral to my weight loss and muscle building goals &amp; progress to date.<br/><br/>If you're tired of clumpy tasteless powders, give ON's whey a shot! You'll be glad you did.<br/><br/>Some other consumption ideas:<br/>  (note: boiling or very hot water will curdle the whey mixture - not tasty!)<br/>Hot Protein (cocoa)<br/>  Instead of hot cocoa mix, I add a scoop of whey and artificial sweetener to 8oz of hot water or coffee (NOT fresh! cool it down)<br/>Oats and Whey<br/>  Add a scoop to a prepared bowl of oatmeal for a flavor (and protein!) kick<br/>Oatshake<br/>  Combine 1/3 cup oats, 8oz water/milk (or ice cream), 2tbsp peanut butter, and ice. Blend to desired thickness (amount of ice and oats used determines overall texture)<br/><br/>Don't forget - if you aren't dieting scientifically, you aren't dieting! Consult your doctor before beginning any new diet or exercise program and read about calories, metabolic rate, and body fat percentage. The body you want is yours with dedication and perseverance!
 This protein tastes very good and gets the job done. Mixed with water/milk, it is easy to put down and really does help your body recover from tough workouts. One problem that I have run into is that the protein starts to smell extremely bad and seems to expire quickly. I did not take protein for a few months and went back to this tub and it seemed as if it became stale. It made my stomach upset and again the smell is unbearable. I would recommend buying a smaller tub size 2-3 pounds rather than having 5 pounds for a long period of time allowing the protein to essentially go bad. This may be a rare case, but half of my tub has to be thrown out.
 24 Grams of Protein in about 60 seconds flat.  It doesn't get any easier than this.  This is THE best-tasting protein whey I have tried.  It tastes just like chocolate milk, only thicker.  The powder mixes easily in my shaker bottle, even without the wire-whisk ball.  I've noticed that some other protein shakes are gritty in texture, but the Optimum Nutrition stuff is smooth, with no hint of grit.  I've tried it with water, 2% milk and Silk.  The best flavor/consistency can be found by mixing one scoop with 7 ounces of Silk...excellent stuff!!<br/><br/>However, it should be noted that the "5-lb" container is not 5.15 lbs (77 servings) shown on Amazon or Lindberg.  It's 5 lbs flat, which will net 74 servings.  I opted for Double Rich Chocolate, so maybe there's a discrepancy that's dependent on flavoring.
 This tastes like garbage compared to the performance whey by ON. This still isn’t a bad product, but I’m not satisfied with it after having their other products. Costco is a great place to buy the performance whey. Just some tips for those that don’t like the flavor on this one.
 ON Whey Gold Standard really is a fantastic powder. I couldn't recommend it more. I've tried about 3 or 4 different whey proteins to help build up lean mass while cutting down on body fat. Between a healthy diet, ON's Whey Gold Standard Double Rich Chocolate and frequent (daily) exercise, I've already seen fantastic results in just 3 weeks. I'll continue to rely on this to help achieve my goals - body fat reduction and lean mass growth.<br/><br/>Researching the ingredients, this has very little added sugar and low carbs - which is perfect if you're aiming to consume lots of protein and keep your carbs down. If you're at the stage where you want to pack in carbs (super athlete), you may consider using this in addition to a different powder.<br/><br/>The taste - as superficial as taste is in a protein powder - is great and is the big appeal in my opinion. I've used other whey proteins and not really minded the taste, but the double rich chocolate is actually really delicious. I will keep buying this again and again because it's the only protein powder my picky boyfriend will use and actually enjoy. He's tried at least 6 different powders/shakes and always can taste foul (in his opinion) aftertaste. In lower quality protein powders/shakes I think this is because of a lot of unnecessary and cheap additives and metals. ON only uses QUALITY ingredients and doesn't have any funky aftertastes.<br/><br/>Mix it in with milk, it tastes like Nesquick or slightly like Ovaltine.
 I have been using ON Whey for about 2 years now- and my opinion on this is remains the same throughout that time: its a great product at a good price.<br/>I will rate this on what I think sums up a good protein powder (on a scale of 1 - 5, 5 being the highest and 1 the lowest):<br/>Mixability - 4.5  - this product requires a decent amount of mixing, or it will get clumpy in your glass. Same with a shaker bottle.. but all in all it mixes in fine with about 20 seconds of stirring/ shaking.<br/>Taste - 3.5 - definitely NOT my favorite part of this product, but I should mention that I have only tried 2 other protein powders, and one tasted worse. The chocolate is ok - it tastes like a chocolate milkshake with cardboard in it. Stay away from the vanilla.<br/>Price - 5 - in conjunction subscribe &amp; save Amazon offers a pretty good deal. I should rate this as a price to performance ratio- so the score will remain the same.<br/>Effectiveness - this product has worked VERY well for me. I have put on over 40 pounds since using it and I believe it works very well as a supplement to a good diet.<br/>All in all I would give this product a 4.5, but since I cant select that on the star rating I gave it a 5- as the taste is subjective.
 I usually hate protein shakes, protein bars, meal replacement bars, etc. You name it, I think they pretty much all taste disgusting.<br/><br/>Well I can't say that anymore. Optimum Nutrition Gold in French Vanilla Creme tastes GREAT, especially when you use milk instead of water (I'm trying to gain weight, so I can get away with that).<br/><br/>It tastes good enough to be a shake on its own, which means I'm more likely to actually stick with it through out my weight training. Could the rest of Optimum Nutrition's supplements possibly taste this good?
 This product is very good for those that are on a budget.  It cheap and is effective for someone who is either beginning a supplement program or for those who are trying to maintain gains or leanness.  I don't believe this product would help hardcore bodybuilders and those looking for major gains quickly.  As for my personal experience with this product. I noticed that I got a bit leaner with taking this product and my strength increased a little from a month ago.  Granted have been working out pretty hard to get ready for the summer season.....so that does also play in as a factor. But I would say the ON whey has help a bit in my quest for the "beach body." I would also say that combined with ON Casein in a supplement program ON Whey has help me recover a bit quicker after a hard work out that I would otherwise.  That is an important factor for a somewhat older guy (late 30's.)  I like to get out of bed in the morning and not feel like I just work out a hour ago.  So high marks in aiding recovery.<br/>Mixing and taste.  On Whey is easy to mix with all types of methods.  Whether it with blender, shaker, even with a spoon, I had no problem with mixing it.  As for taste and consistency.  It's very light when mixed with water and taste pretty good with it. Though it does leave a slightly funny after taste.  But I prefer a heavier consistency. so I mix it with milk.  And as far as I'm concerned it tastes great with no after taste.<br/>So over all a good solid product.  The only reason why I don't give it 5 stars is that this product does not produce big gains in strength or in size.
 This is some great protein. I usually take three scoops plus 20 ounces of water and shake it up. It mixes very well with water and tastes great. Does not taste watered down at all. The protein has worked great for me so far. I work out around 4 to 5 times a week and this is perfect for quick recovery needs. 24 grams of protein a scoop keeps me from drinking shakes all day. I drink 2 and a half of these a day and feel fine. No bloated feeling after drinking which is a plus.
 Was in the market for whey protein heard ON was a good brand but found out they switched to artificial flavors so I deff won't be buying this why would yous fix what ain't broken?? Trying to make a few extra dollars I suppose.. someone told me met rx is all natural so im gonna buy that instead. Hopefully ON switches back to normal so I can buy their brand.
 I tried the "Extreme Milk Chocolate" based on a review below. It's not bad but far from the best tasting protein supplement I've tried (my fav' so far is Bio Chem). The powder does dissolve better than most and the price is right - especially with a subscription. I wish it used stevia for a sweetener rather than sucralose and other artificial sweeteners. Next time I'll try "Double Rich Chocolate" for a chocolate flavor, or skip chocolate altogether. All in all, I'm very happy with ON protein powder.
 I've tried strawberry banana, vanilla ice cream, and banana cream.  They all taste like crap and artificial.  I couldn't stomach it alone with water.<br/><br/>However, the double rich chocolate is very doable with water.  It doesn't have a strong chocolate taste but it doesn't taste artificial either.  I can add in 4-6 oz of water with a scope and be done with it in a few seconds.<br/><br/>Overall, Double Rich Chocolate is recommended.
 1. Taste.<br/><br/>  Other than some of the choc powder from Gaspari Nutrition, this is probably the tastiest brand of powder i have sampled.<br/><br/>2. Digestibility .<br/><br/>  This particular brand i can consume ALOT of it (5lbs a week at least) and it gives me very little gastrointestinal problems or other wierd symptoms. Very 'clean' .<br/><br/>3. Cost .<br/><br/>  $10 per pound or lower is 'benchmark' price.<br/><br/>Winning combination.<br/><br/>rocky road &gt; extreme milk choc &gt; double rich choc
 I purchased this product on the recommendation of a friend, I was not disappointed. The flavor is great, not gritty at all, but I have found that when you are mixing it with non dairy "milk" it works better to use the higher protein varieties, or to go for a little extra powder or it will be really watery.
 this is one of the best tasting protein drinks i have ever had. additionally, the consistency is second to none. it is not thick, it mixes up very well w/ a shaker bottle, and only requires a small amount of liquid (i use skim milk). the vanilla allows you to mix it with other flavors so you aren't just stuck w/ chocolate, for example. i've used orange juice to make an orange creme drink (awesome). the vanilla by itself is awesome. add some ovaltine, you've got an excellent malt. i've mixed it up with a spoon just to try it out and it worked okay. but not as good as the shaker bottle w/ wire wisk ball. bottom line is, i'm not sure you can do better than this protein. i haven't tried other flavors, but i don't need to. i also have BSN Syntha-6, which is equally excellent. i use the ON for post workout and the Syntha-6 for general suppliment. both are incredible in all aspects. some reviewers here have issues with some of the flavors. i wonder if they ever drank protein powders back in the early 90's. cause last time i did the protein thing, they were all nasty. times have definitely changed. for those not enjoying some of the other flavors, go w/ this vanilla. you can add your own flavors, or have it plain. it's really a great tasting drink. one note: i don't use water to mix with. to me, water seems rather strange to use. use skim milk. or OJ. or a combo of stuff. i've tried half water and half skim milk (cause i ran out of milk) and that worked out fine.
 I am a former General Nutrition Center employee and there are hundreds of "powdered" protein products that "hype" about the most important ingredient known for any person that works out. if you want a simple great tasting protein supplement that will help satisfy your daily intake without feeling sick, bloated or passing gas, then you need to trust in Optimum Nutritions 100% Whey Protein. It truly gives you the results you need as far as quality and nutrition goes.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend 2% milk over water for even better taste, but water will still do the trick. If you buy Vanilla, i suggest mixing it with berries, bananas, strawberries, or bananas for added taste.<br/><br/>this is by far the best protein supplement out there that is worth more for your money!
 Was using the Trader Joe's Vanilla Whey for a while and went out and grabbed a 2lb on the double rich chocolate ON 100% whey and I have to say i'm extremely impressed! I mixed one scoop with unflavored soy milk and this stuff is so easy to drink! Tastes like chocolate milk straight up! O.N. has got me very satisfied! Will order again and again and again!
 The price is fantastic, the taste is great, it dissolves well, and this is the best part: only 10% of your daily cholesterol intake per scoop! Most other brands range from 20% or more, which, if you're taking two scoops after workout and eating an egg or two in the morning, will add up to one unhealthy diet. This brand helps manage your cholesterol while maintaining a pleasing taste. And yes, the taste is actually pretty good.<br/><br/>The only negative is the artificial sweetener used. For the same price, you can get their Natural series, which has no artificial sweetener. I suggest that product instead if you're worried about the effects of sucralose on your body.<br/><br/>Did I mention the price? $0.50 an ounce! Insane!
 Vanilla ice cream flavor: doesn’t taste bad, more like a really watered down milkshake.<br/>Does the job. 💪🏽
 Overall this has been a wonderful purchase. I'm running out of Protein so I've recently decided to switch to their <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Optimum-Nutrition-100-Natural-Oats-and-Whey-Vanilla-Bean-3-Pound/dp/B002DYJ0KW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Optimum Nutrition 100% Natural Oats and Whey Vanilla Bean, 3 Pound</a> which will hopefully help me get some more fiber in my diet. I've really enjoyed Optimum Whey. The nice thing is that it doesn't have all the additives and extras that some of the other brands provide. I'm sure that they have their benefit, but I just want the protein not some magical ingredients or fillers that make it cost more.<br/><br/>It mixes Well.<br/><br/>It Taste Great (better in milk, but not horrible in water)<br/><br/>It last a long time.<br/><br/>I highly recommend it.
 Dissolves much more easily and tastes much better than comparable whey proteins.
 I purchased a 2lbs jar and it was half empty and no spoon included ! Texture is very thin just like other reviews mentioned, yet this time is my first time trying it so not sure the texture should be richer or not. I got the double chocolate taste and it tastes good to me. It mixs kinda well in my smoothie, i use blender to mix it though.
 Got a deal for this product. Before this I was taking Vanilla Optimum Performance whey from Costco which tastes pretty good. I made a shake with three scoops of this for the first time.<br/>The good is that there is a pretty strong chocolate flavor which I enjoy, however it's not particularly sweet and if you drink it by itself its not all that enjoyable. I found that mixing it with milk and 1 scoop of vanilla whey makes the shake delicious. Good product.
 There are over 1000 reviews so not much more to say. Purchased the vanilla ice cream flavor. Its very mild and almost tasteless when mixed with water. I'm ok with that and would rather my protein have less additives. I got it at a great price here on Amazon but not from Amazon. Amazon would not let me publish my first review when I mentioned the seller, I don't now why but that is. Its the only other seller with same price and free super saver shipping. Put two in your cart and proceed to checkout you'll see a nice surprise.
 I've supp'd with this product for almost a decade now, and for the life of me I can not understand why they would add sucralose to this perfectly good protein powder. This was the best tasting most effective protein powder I've ever had and they decided to ruin it. Now I have to look for another product. ON, get your act together!
 Using this product for years now, and to be honest, you really cant beat it for overall value. Optimum Nutrition is known for making quality products, and Its relatively cheap compared to other proteins out there, The Serving size is only 1 SCOOP compared to other products that require 2 scoops, which means your getting more value. It mixes very nicely with water or milk, and the taste is bearable with water, and pretty damn enjoyable with milk. As a college student its great to use when you have class and don't have time to grab an in between snack... just have a scoop of  this! You can use it in the morning, and mix it in with oatmeal for extra protein and vanilla flavor.<br/><br/>The only bad thing i could possibly say, is that there is no hydro whey which gets into your system faster, and pro-complex, which contains all essential amino acids... THAT BEING SAID, both of those products are considerably more expensive.<br/><br/>Overall, after years of trying products, this is the best whey protein product for your money. Quality protein, for a good price.
 fair price, great product.
 First time buying and I have been digging for my scoop, how am I supposed to have the exact amount? using a scale every time is a waste of time
 This has a good taste. If you are going to mix with a spoon, it is much easier in water ... although the taste is obviously watered down. Tastes better in milk, in my opinion, but it is also tougher to get the powder to completely dissolve when mixing by spoon. Of course if you're using a blender, you will not get any lumps no matter what you mix the powder in. I typically have a scoop before lifting in the morning. For breakfast afterwards, I've found that it tastes great mixed in with oatmeal, fruit, and nuts (the chocolate coloring of the powder makes this look like gruel, so if you like your food to be aesthetically pleasing, maybe this is not a good change of pace for you).<br/><br/>I've used this product for several years now to supplement my diet because I've always felt that it is relatively cheaper than other protein powders but without sacrificing too much in quality. I've consistently bought the chocolate flavor because it is typically the cheapest, for whatever reason. Occasionally I will buy a 1 or 2 pound bag of a different flavor just to keep my tastebuds interested.
 This protein is the best on the market you don't have to be a scientist to Google it do your homework it's your body you have to live with it it's still your mother f***en set.
 This is some of the best tasting protein powder there is. I'd like to vouch for its effectiveness, but how does one really know when you are supplementing it with other diet and exercise. Nevertheless, this is a quality tasting product though not as good as the double rich chocolate IMO. I'll be getting ON whey for a while into the future I am sure, after it replaced my ProtaQuest (also very very tasty) which got a little on the expensive side.
 I am not going to talk about quality of ON products, they are among the best and in the past few years that I have been using them I have had no complaints.<br/><br/>This is more about the flavor and I would give Mocha 4/5 for that. I had read some great reviews about it but in the end flavors are subjective to some extent. It has the mocha flavor but it's not strong enough and it does not mix as well with milk as some other flavors I have tried. To sum it up, I liked it but I am not jumping with joy, I like Cookies and Cream the best as it satisfies my sweet tooth (as well as cookie cravings).<br/><br/>The reason I give it 3 stars is because of the higher price on amazon. I am a loyal customer and most of the time I just buy from here without bothering about price comparison. However, I was a little alarmed by the wide difference in prices by flavor so I check the bodybuilding.com store and it was cheaper there. Though the difference was not great I have grown to look at amazon as the best price place, guess sometimes one needs to look around!
 I didn't buy this product on Amazon but wanted to warn everyone that as others are saying, ON changed the formula and at least for Chocolate Mint, has created a disgusting product. It's horrible tasting on it's own and a total mess if you add something else to it with even a mild flavor like Glutamine.
 This is great value for money. Though a bit more expensive than other powders, the protein per serving, taste and mixability ranks highly.  I dont have a mixer and simply used a spoon and that worked just fine with minimal clumping at bottom (very minimal) The vanilla ice cream tastes great and is a pleasant drink to enjoy, not merely tolerable.  Very smooth when mixed with milk.<br/><br/>The cookies and cream is OK but sweet and not as creamy as the vanilla.  My cookies and cream also has a slight bitter after taste could be a bad batch.<br/><br/>Overall very good value. No regrets (except will only buy vanilla as of now)
 I tried a few flavors from this brand. Was not a fan of deluce de leche,cake doughnut, and the double rich chocolate. Thought the first two were too sweet and the last one very bland. I did really like cake batter and vanilla ice cream. Thought from the taste they were true to taste.
 I've been using Optimum Nutrition's Whey Protein Powder for a long time and beyond any doubt they are of top quality in the market. It contains a blend of whey protein isolate and concentrate. Each serving contains a high percentage of protein (24g), low cholesterol and carbohydrates.<br/><br/>I have researched both in price and gains, it really kicks muscle growth and Amzaon is the only place where this product is availablle at its competitive price. Amazon ships this product free of charge.<br/><br/>Overall, this is the best product whether you are trying to get lean, build muscle or just maintaining your body weight. I have found O.N the only company that has a wide range of exciting new flavors to choose from which are also plesant tasting.<br/><br/>Amazon is my favorite shopping place with excellent prices and on time shipping!
 GREAT TASTE
 I'm now over half-way through my 2nd Double Rich Chocolate 5.15 pounder and in a month or so I'm sure I'll be on my 3rd. Occasionally I try to research the best protein for a pre or post-workout snack, but my brain usually starts hurting and I have to lay down. The consensus at least seems to be that protein isolates are the most effective form of protein--and this stuff is mostly just that, with some whey concentrate and whey peptides blended in as well. I figure that covers the bases a bit. And it's got those amino acids you're also craving. Whatever. In the last 6 months I've added ~100 lbs to my squats/deadlifts and ~50 to my bench. I attribute this mostly to a new 80/20 workout program I'm trying, but obviously nutrition must be playing some part, and I am gulping down a protein smoothie daily. The same smoothie too. The exact same smoothie for weeks and weeks and weeks. I think that speaks for the taste. This has probably already been posted but my recipe is a banana, 1 protein scoop (sometimes 2), 1 tbsp of peanut butter, 2 cups of milk, and a splash of coffee (if its handy), blended up with a hand mixer. Every day. It was pretty delicious months ago and it's only now starting to bore me, so I might move on to Vanilla for my next tub and do the standard strawberry, banana, milk &amp; honey thing. In my opinion, chocolate protein and strawberries do not mix. Oh yeah, this stuff dissolves pretty completely which is nice, although my Kitchen Aid hand mixer is pretty mean. On the rare occasion I'm spoon-mixing, I get a little bit of the protein globs which feel weird swallowing and cement themselves to the side of your cup. The only real complaint I have about ordering this is trying to find an existing flavor/size combination. Those drop-down selectors include a bunch of imaginary options. Somebody knows what I'm talking about, right?
 I bought 2 of them ( Double Chocolate 5lb), but i found one issue related to one of these two reasons:<br/><br/>1- Great change in the formula. Or<br/>2- I received bad patch<br/><br/>The difference between the new and the old patch is like the difference between fresh and salt water. Do not recommend this product at all, the powder was very corrosive and the powder’s color is not the same . I will not be purchasing this product again. The main problem  that i can’t return the products to the seller because i’m not living in USA, I was just a visitor and bought them when i was there.<br/>May be i will update my review with some pics.
 I use this every day to get in extra protein. It tastes great and mixes easy.
 I buy this product every month... Always has a plethera of flavors and sizes. No all of a sudden they only have one or 2 flavors!? I can't even check the flavors either. I am NOT happy right now with this company and I am very upset. I Dont Like It, go back to the old way of having us buy this protein, you made it WORSE.
 I have used this whey protein for the past two years and it is great. I have had three flavors: double rich chocolate, rocky road, and vanilla ice cream (that is also the order I rank them based on taste). The product mixes very well, whether using a shaker cup or a blender. Although the shaker cup is more convenient, I prefer the blender as it gives the shake a creamier consistency. With only 120 calories and 24 grams of protein, it is a great product for building lean mass. Conversely, I have added peanut butter, bananas, and olive oil to increase calories and protein, and again the product worked great. The price is also great, and in most cases, is more affordable than other proteins in its class.<br/><br/>Summary: great taste, great numbers, mixes well, I will buy again.
 Something changed with the formula as of April, 2017. It's obscenely, nauseatingly sweet. It has a strong taste of artificial sweetener, and it gives me a terrible headache. I'm really sad about this. ON was one of my favorites. Labdoor.com rates it only 75% optimal, though. They have a list of strong alternatives.
 Been using this product for over a year now.  This protein shake had helped me gain lean muscles over the time I have used it.  The taste is not the greatest, but I would sacrifice that for the result.  Amazon had it on sale in January and I was able to get the 10-pound bag for less than $84...now I have an awesome protein supply for the next six months!
 Obviously if you're looking to get some lean muscle mass on ya' you're trying to get some good quality protein. From my experience Optimum Nutrition has always provided products that work very well and are reliable. I take a protein shake about a half hour before i work out to get the protein digested and ready for my muscles and then one immediately after working out to give them that quick shot of protein. Doing this, doing frequent cardio, and eating right and I saw visible results in about a month or two after i started taking working out seriously. Getting yourself motivated is half the battle. So if you can do that you're golden. But to see results I, in addition to any other person who knows about nutrition and fitness, would probably tell you to go with Optimum Nutrition. I use their protein, their multivitamin, and their creatine. Seeing results is what will make anyone keep going; using this has gotten me there. Great product. When in doubt go with ON.
 I bought the Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Whey, Double Rich Chocolate, 5.15-Pound Tub and found the value of this product very good compared to many other retailers. I used this product for about a month (3x daily), using it to supplement my regular diet and workouts throughout the week. I have gained 3-4 Ibs. in that time period. I was expecting better results with this product. Here is my disclaimer however, I weight trained (6x/week) during the entire course of taking this product but did not incorporate any cardio workouts to supplement my weight training. This may have had an impact on weight gained (cardio work is an important aspect of weight training due to the loss of fat that occurs from it). I was hoping to add more healthy weight than just 3-4 Ibs. But please take into consideration your body type, everyone is unique and each person must evaluate his/her make-up when it comes to weight training, cardio work, and weight gain/loss.
 Great product!
 I was given specific guidelines by my surgeon, post-op Weight Loss Surgery, to drink a protein drink with more than 20g protein and less than 10g carbs per serving, 3-4 times per day. There are so many options on the market that meet those guidelines and making a decision can be quite daunting. I found Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard in a CAKE BATTER flavor and I was sold!<br/><br/>Now, for the most important part of reviewing any protein drink... IT TASTES GREAT!! I'm so happy for the flavor options. I can't wait to try all the others. I am recommending Optimum Nutrition to all bariatric patients.
 As a thirty-something father of two, I'm a little late to the Get Buff party. With work, kid extra-curriculars, and frenetic meal times to worry about, in addition to a body that just isn't 20 any more, I'll take my fitness where I can find it. After a lunch time workout at the local gym, I need something to help my body recover. ON's Whey Gold Standard really fits the bill.<br/><br/>With a work laptop, lunch, a change of clothes and a towel to wrangle into work each workout day, I place a premium on ease of use and portability. Obviously a 5 pound mega-jug doesn't fit the bill, but this powder can be placed in a blend cup with liquid (I go with 1% milk) and stashed in an insulated container with a freeze pack until after my workout. The label claims it's 'instantized' and while I'm not clear on what that entails, it certainly mixes with ridiculous ease. A couple shakes of the blend cup and I have a nicely frothed up beverage for the drive back to work. There are no powder clumps bobbing at the top or lingering in wait at the bottom, daring me to spoon them out to get my full serving's worth. The drink is velvety smooth.<br/><br/>The Mocha Cappuccino's taste is quite delicious by my standards. It isn't quite as chocolatey as Hershey's syrup, but it's a nice full flavor and I could easily see enjoying it for the flavor alone. It also includes coffee as an actual ingredient, which is handy for those of us with caffeine habits.<br/><br/>The powder proudly wears its nutritional merits on its sleeve, so I can add little in that regard. If you are looking it up here, you already know that it's low in calories and carbs, but high in whey protein, the particular sort of protein that is most easily absorbed by your body. This particular brand is well regarded, suffering only from the occasional irritation that popular products always engender from people who prefer their brands to be a little more exclusive and against-the-grain. I'm sure there are more esoteric varieties available that are marginally better in some precise way, but a pretty wide Google net seemed to reveal that ON is a well-loved fixture even among some of the die-hard enthusiasts. Considering the exceptional taste and ease of use, that's good enough for me.
 Whether you're trying to lose weight, get stronger, or just need added protein in a diet this is a must have. Onstar is a great brand that delivers quality products. There have been multiple tests done on this way that prove it is one of the best out there if not the most popular. For the price, 24g of protein per serving, and the great taste there is no way you can pass up this product.
 Tastes absolutely horrible!  Couldn't even finish one shaker full.  It has this disgusting aftertaste like you just chewed on a multivitamin! Had the Double Rich Chocolate and will be returning.  What's up ON???  I like most all of your other products but this one is a total flop
 Not seeing anything different yet but still use it don't test that bad
 Best tasting protein I've had so far. Great price for 5 pounds of it. Will be buying again when my husband &amp; I run out!
 Purchased 5 lb of Cookies and Cream flavor from Amazon. Before this, I've only had the Double Chocolate so I was a little weary of trying something new. Thankfully, it tastes pretty delicious. I usually just mix it with a bit of water and stir with a fork, and it always dissolves easily. The little cookie bits at the end are a nice touch, too. It does have a strong mocha-like smell which can be nauseating.
 Love this stuff, the manufacturing date was 2 months prior to order so not bad, that leaves 22 months before expiration so overall great stuff. Love the strawberry flavor, tastes just like strawberry milk when you mix it with milk. Been using this brand and same flavor for 2 years now and i've seen consistent growth throughout my use of this product!
 This is without question the best all Whey protein on the market. It does not adversely affect my stomach or digestion, and it tastes great.
 These Moronic Manufactures Need Heed Customers' Complaints. I bought a tub of this stuff, as I'd heard good feedback from people. HOWEVER, those rendering positive feedback obviously have no aversion to Artificial Sweeteners---&gt;&gt;&gt; Sucralose is UNHEALTHY &amp; DISGUSTING!!! Back to the store this toxic, horrid barrel o` chemicals went...
 Great mix with Strawberry Vanilla + Almond milk! Give it a shot.
 Hands down the best flavor is double chocolate but the vanilla ice cream flavor is more flexible. It's very quick and easy to make a vanilla smoothie just pop 2 scoops into the blender with non fat milk add some blueberry's (or your favorite fruit) a couple of ice cubes and that's it. Another tasty way to drink the vanilla is to mix it with sunny delight. I keep both the double chocolate and ice cream vanilla in the house at all times.
 Was advertised as being double rich chocolate.  Taste is bland with light chocolate flavor, nothing Rich about it or double either tastes alright blended with 1/2 banana or with strawberries yummy in that case, probably would not buy if I tasted it first.  I had a different product that I mixed in my morning coffee and it was great.  This one clumps up if mixed in a warm beverage.
 most of these reviews are about the flavor of this product. if im body building i would be more concerned about the content which clearly says each scoop is only about 72-73% protein. 100 percent? pfft! the bulk WPI i have been using is 91% and tastes like the fruit i flavor it with, Im my case frozen blueberries and fresh bananas. my family tries to get in on the smoothies if im not quick because they are delicious! $150 for 10 kg of WPI, i would never waste money on a gimmick such as this when i can buy bulk direct from the source. Mmmm i hope you enjoy the flavors!<br/><br/>my recipe<br/><br/>1/2 cup frozen blueberries<br/>1 whole banana<br/>2-3 scoops of WPI<br/>1 handful of walnuts or other raw nuts<br/>1 cup of skim milk<br/>ice cubes and a touch of honey if desired<br/><br/>blend until smooth, enjoy and hide from the family
 Disgustingly Sweet. I think they made the mistake of thinking because it's a low calorie sweetener there was no reason to hold back on it. I got mine at GNC and will be returning it there. Sucralose may not have the calories of sugar, but it confuses your bodies insulin response which can make you feel bad and still increases your chances of getting diabetes.
 When it comes to a no non-sense protein powder, one that has extras such as glutamine and BCAA's, and at the same time has a minimal amount of fat and carbs...this is the protein to get. This isn't a meal replacement or should be used as one, if that's what your looking for try muscle milk which is high in protein but also other calories as well.<br/><br/>This is your post-workout protein shake plain and simple. I always add one banana either in the blender or just eat it separately, and when I'm in bulking phase I'll also add one tablespoon of peanut butter and bam, you have yourself a meal replacement too if that's what you prefer. Not to mention, its freaking delicious with the peanut butter!<br/><br/>One simple thing I have been adding to for help in the gym is an amino acid called Beta Alanine;<br/><br/><a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Citrulline-Malate-200-Grams-Powder-Free-Beta-Alanine-200-Grams/dp/B008MWPUOO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Citrulline Malate 200 Grams Powder + Free Beta Alanine 200 Grams</a><br/><br/>This stuff fits the bill, definitely recommend it as its cheap and if you lift heavy, you'll see what I mean in about two weeks time.
 I am 28 weeks pregnant and recently diagnosed with gestational diabetes. My husband who is an avid runner and gym attendee recommended I try his whey protein mix as an alternative breakfast, lunch, or snack. I'm not a fan of these types of mixes/shakes, but I enjoyed this vanilla mix in milk (skim), and found it to be filling. This mix contains MUCH less sugar and carbs than even diabetic-specific shakes, which was really surprising to me. PLUS, I get additional protein for my growing baby. An all-around good product.
 Excelent product with a solid non-chalky taste that mixes well with water, milk or into a smoothie.  Works exceptionally well as an additive or replacement to pancakes and other flour based recipes also!
 Great tasting protein combined with a great price! Where else can you find high quality protein that isn't full of sugar and other fake amino acids?? Will definitely buy again
 Just look at the ingredients. Done. Low carb too.
 The best!
 After Dymatize started lowering the quality of their product (added sugar and more sweeteners and made it taste like crap and had less protein) I decided to switch to the other protein titan.  It mixes much easier than dymatize did and I like the taste a lot more.  It also contains more servings per 10 lb bag so it isn't as expensive compared to Dymatize as it initially seems.  I did the math and it was only a couple cents more per serving than Dymatize and it's a lot higher quality.
 If you are not a fan of Costco huge over-sweet cakes taste  - don't buy it. This is how you can compare it about sweetness - Costco  over-sweet cakes.<br/>It's simply not possible to drink, because it's TOO SWEET.<br/>I understand, that company is trying to adjust under consumer's taste, but no way we like to taste SO MUCH  shugar/sweetness in the protein.<br/>It's not an ice-cream  or Costco cake.<br/>It's a protein.<br/>Shouldn't taste like cake  - SO SWEET.
 I'm trying it for the first time. It really difficult to swallow.
 This is the stuff all wight lifters have after there work out for that muscle they are looking for. Also, the double chocolate is the only way to go and get 10 lbs of that stuff at a time because, it will not go bad for a year.
 I will never buy any other whey protein beside optimum nutrition 100% whey
 Regarding the taste, I find it much better to use milk or a combination of milk and water. Water-only mixing isn't the smoothest drink, and I've found it tough to dissolve all the particles. If you can manage to find some milk or wait till you get home, you'll be treated to a much better shake.<br/><br/>Regarding nutritional aspects, I really can't say. So far so good.
 My favorite protein powder and flavor :)
 This was my first protein powder purchase, I'm a 31 year old male that just wants to add some bulk to my muscles.  I tasted it today for the first time after my morning workout and was very pleasantly surprised that it tasted kind of like rich chocolatey Ovaltine.  It had a bit of an aftertaste, but nothing bad.  Very pleased with the taste, now just hoping that it does it's job.  We'll see!
 It tastes and works great for a good price.<br/><br/>I recommend the chocolate its great with skim milk and peanut butter.<br/><br/>I drink two 150 gram protein shakes a day and include a whole chicken baked at a local grocery store with seasonings only each day. While taking this for two weeks now I see an improvement already compared to my regular whey.
 This stuff isn't as sweet at other protein supplements I've had, but it mixes very well.<br/><br/>In water alone, the flavor and sweetness is very light, which I really like, but in milk (I use non-fat lactaid) it is absolutely incredible. Like having an actually milkshake almost. Its awesome in Lactaid.
 I got the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor which reminds me of the astronaut dehydrated ice cream flavor type of smell but it mixes well with unsweetened almond milk (reducing lactose). It is not too sweet and the aftertaste is minimal. I chose this brand since it had less ingredients than the others and less artificial flavorings.
 There isn't a lot more to add from what others have said.  ON gold standard whey is just the best basic protein powder.  If you want a before bed shake, check out the Casien protein but for breakfast or snack or post work out protein shakes, this stuff is the best.  It tastes great and blends into milk really well, even if its just skim milk.  I like the chocolate flavor enough that I haven't even tried the different flavors.
 Terrible artificial strawberry flavor
 I've been using ON whey for years now.  It mixes extremely well in a shaker bottle or with a spoon and it tastes good (not great, but good).  It provides an excellent amount of portein per scoop and is very cheap on Amazon.  The only downside is that it can taste a bit thin or watery, but that's still better than the chunky taste most proteins have.
 I can't stomach this stuff, literally makes me nausous. How it has 1g of sugar yet exceeds the sweetness of any other drink I've had in memory is odd. The sugar substitute appears to be the problem here. I'd rather have a 20-30g of actual sugar than this garbage. And besides, an insulin spike is proven to be beneficial to muscle growth post workout - something ON is presumably aware of.
 The taste is pretty good, 7/10, but it starts to get old about half way through the jug.<br/>I've tried most of the ON flavors but this one foams up more than the rest of them for reasons unknown, even in water.<br/>It will clump up a lot if you don't shake it pretty hard. The down time is a pain in the ass, waiting for the foam to settle.
 My favorite protein powder. Tastes great, low sugar, low carb, mixes well, love everything about it.
 I use a heaping scoop of this chocolate whey in a cup of skim milk every morning. It differs from other whey I've used in that it completely dissolves. Tastes good and is helping me stay well and strong while I lose weight. Awfully large container but can be divvied up into smaller quantities. Recommended.
 I bought the Delicious Strawberry flavor and its very good. I always cringe when thinking about having to drink protein. I was skeptical almost ready to cringe after mixing it with water, but it tasted very good. Tolerable doesn't come to mind, it tastes great.
 i am 17 and have been using this product for the past 6 months... it has an overall good taste... it's not the best i have had but definitely not bad! The quality is average nothing extraordinary but the value i believe is good so it is worth a try...anyone who wants to have something to supplement their diet with protein should consider this ! THERE'S SOOOOOO MUCH OF IT....
 Optimum Nutrition's products may often be overlooked by many due to its plain labeling, and a lack of crazy adjectives describing all the benefits you will get.  But those who research supplements know that Optimum Nutrition makes only the highest quality products, and their whey protein really is the standard by which to judge all others.  It is about as pure as you can get, and will easily and quickly be digested by your body post-workout.  It tastes great to boot.  This is NOT the protein I would recommend for overnight muscle building, as it is a quick digesting protein.  For when resting it is recommended that you take a slow-digesting protein which will probably be a mix of soy, egg, and whey proteins.  But for post-workout pure protein, without a lot cholesterol or extra unneeded calories, this is the BEST.
 The white chocolate taste great. It's not too strong of a flavor and doesn't leave your mouth tasting tacky.
 Assembled in USA with CHINESE INGREDIENTS!
 First off let me say the taste of this product is quite good (Extreme Milk Chocolate). It tastes good in both milk and water, but it isn't required in the "Anabolic Window". The anabolic window is a myth made up by companies trying to sell you more products. There is no magical time period post workout that your muscles require nutrients in or else you don't gain anything. This product is good, but I use it to give me a protein boost with meals, that's what it's good for. Your muscles don't go catabolic post workout and don't need protein within a certain short time period to actually rebuild. There is a WebMD article stating any protein ingested within 24 hours after working out will be what helps your muscles rebuild, but the absorption rate of those proteins doesn't matter.<br/><br/>As a supplement, this is a great way to help get the extra protein you require into your diet, but don't rely on this to help you build muscle as it isn't going to change things much.
 Great tasting and smooth. This is the first protein powder I've had that didn't have a chalky consistency (I only use a blender bottle).<br/><br/>Will buy again!
 This protien it a little on the sweet side not great because i am not accustom for protein to be sweet
 I just got my whey protein by ON, the delivery was really fast; I ordered on Sunday afternoon and I received package on Tuesday.<br/>I ordered the strawberry flavor, not bad at all, tastes pretty good especially when combined with milk. I have also tried the double rich chocolate from my cousin; taste is good as well. I guess what I am trying to say is that the taste is not horrible at all as many of the other people had stated.<br/>Since this is my first time trying this product, I really can not comment in the effects it has on building muscle. I really wish people had focused on that rather than the flavor, so if you recently bought this product and know its benefits, please tells us, but only if you have seen a change in your body.<br/>A month from now, if things work (i.e. I see results), I will be buying another tube and writing another review
 Our family has used Optimum Gold Standard 100% Whey for years. Both my adult boys are athletes and use it every day. One of them is sensitive to milk products and this does not upset his system at all. My husband is a bodybuilder and feels that this is one of the best products of its kind on the market. We make smoothies, use it in coffee drinks, mix is on the go with water ... whatever the use, it tastes great. We like vanilla as it mixes best with all types of frozen and fresh fruit.
 I have to say, Optimum makes a pretty good protein. The taste is fairly good, and from what I can tell it is fairly competitive with protein per serving. The only thing that put me off about it is that it always gave me a mild stomachache when I took it. I kept taking it anyway because I didn't want it to go to waste. Recently, I had a friend who is pretty much a supplement guru tell inform me that they use coffee creamer as one of their ingredients! I immediately know what was giving me the upset stomach. I don't know if they are trying to cut corners or what, but a least for me this was a deal breaker.
 I love it. Recommend to everyone no matter the goal.
 I love this protein.  compared to others it's the best tasteing, mixes well with milk and water (trust me use milk) and I've gotten better results than with any other brands  It has 23grams of Whey per serving  ( if I remeber correctly), and these are quality Whey Protein and amino acids. I've been lifting and taking protein for well over a year and have tried many brands but got hooked on this one pretty quick.  It's got a decent price compared to most other high end proteins.<br/>I like the Choc, never tried the other flavors.
 I'll leave the technical review (regarding whey and what it does) to the experts and review what I know best, which is flavor.  I got the white chocolate and it is delicious.  Truly taste like a white chocolate shake with milk.  I haven't tried it with water or anything else.  I feel like I'm cheating on my diet / work out plan with this thing.
 Did some research and Optimum Nutrition seems to have the best whey product out there.  It has the least ammount of carbs and sugar, and the most protein.  All the chocolate flavors taste awesome, and you definately see results.  This is a lean protein, I am sure there are others out there meant for more serious gain, but this one hits the sweet spots for those who want to cut weight and build muscle.  Never any complaints and have easily gone through 30+ lbs of the stuff
 Best
 Great tasting and it mixes very easily.  I recommend vanilla almond milk or skim milk. High amount of protein without all the filler.
 I have tried various proteins, this is by far the best tasting I have had. The best part is it's lower in calories and sugars than the others I am use to. I will be ordering more of this in the future.
 The best lactase added whey out there for the price. Worth the price tag, especially when on sale, as it has never caused digestive issues.
 I had used this product some number of years ago and started a regimented workout routine after a few years absent from the game...The new formula looks, mixes, tastes and works exactly like the former. It mixes well with just a spoon, and tastes about as good as products like this come. I use it to supplement a protein laden diet, typically first thing in the morning, pre-workout and later in the evening. It is quickly soluble, so I am likely changing to a casien protein mix or cottage cheese or lean meat before bed because of longer protein provisioning while asleep, but for those who aren't particluar it can be used whenever you need that quick protein ingested. If you can find an equivalent product for a better price let me know!!!
 I'm not expert on supplements or anything, but I can say that this is a great product. It mixes very well with most things and the double chocolate flavor is tasty. The thing that really wowed me though, was that even though this product is low-carb, I cannot taste ANY trace of artificial sweetener. My taste buds have always been hyper-sensitive to the presence of sucralose and aspartame, however the typical bitter after-taste is non-existent in the ON Whey Protein Powder, yet it still manages to be sweet, tasting like a nice, light chocolate milk. I'm impressed.
 Chocolate malt is tasty af with 1/2 milk, 1/2 water.
 I bought this back in April and now again in November. This is a great product. You can use it for strength training to lose weight while gaining lean muscle. It has a great taste. Me personally, I mix it with Hood Calorie Countdown Fat Free milk. This whey protein mix is low carb and very low sugar (so this should be diabetic safe). This is a great price for the product since health stores sell this for aprox $80+. This could be used in conjunction with exercise to build lean muscle and burn fat or you can use it as a small meal supplement throughout the course of the day.
 This is the best tasting whey around. It is also very cheap for the amount of whey you get.

 ON is currently my GO TO protein supplement source. I opted to purchase the Chocolate Mint because of reviews I've read. It's pretty much the double chocolate flavor with a hint of artificial mint. Good, not great.
 I am not so easily convinced, however after having for a year now I find that it has removed calf muscle soreness. I have 1.5 scoop every day in the morning with plain water, after being advised by my trainee that protein absorption is optimum when taken empty stomach in the morning.I wish to share your views.I am brisk walker about 6 miles daily and job two miles once a week.
 The Gold standard whey is a safe for anyone looking for a good quality/price ratio for protein powder. It is highly renowned in the fitness industry. Optimum nutrition offers a variety of falavours. I personally recommend the chocolate one on the long term. Enjoy!
 It tastes good with sugar and I haven't had any side effects. At least not that I know of. The only problem is that over time the powder gets harder to mix completely with hot water. They'll be a few chunks of undissolved powder floating around your cup of whey. A blender or some sort of mixer can be used obviously to overcome this. Also check the cholesterol levels on this one, it's comparatively high.
 The product is legit.  There is no protein spiking with the product and its a great deal.  At 72-75 servings for only $57 bucks, thats a steal.  This product has a great taste and is very easy on the stomach to digest.  For the price and product, this is the only protein i'm going to buy.  This protein is a very good alternative to a meal.  I recommend to all individuals who exercise.
 Don't like the fact, that it has soy lecithin... why can't they use sunflower lecithin or something alse less cheap.. not soy friendly. ..
 Can't say enough about this stuff - it has an exceptional amount of protein and takes delicious.  And I don't mean delicious for a protein shake, I mean delicious for any kind of drink.  It simply tastes great.  Highly recommended for those that don't want to choke down their shakes anymore.
 I've worked in a supplement store for about 7 years, and I have to say this is the only product that i have consistently purchased. Love the quality, taste, and reputation behind this company. Double rich chocolate has to be hands down the best flavor P.S. i hte chocolate candy bars and ice cream. Vanilla is kind of bland, strawberry you get tired of quick so don't commit to 5 lbs of it. Banana was great! The 10 lbs bags give you way more than two of these containers so go for that instead!
 ON really hit a home run on the cake batter. I hope they make it a permanent flavor (it's limited edition) because it's definitely my favorite flavor I've had yet. It doesn't seem super cake-battery tasting but its a sweet vanilla-type goodness. I haven't tried it with water but I usually mix it with just 6 ounces of milk to get the thick batter experience. Lumps not an issue, mixes great. All around awesome buy!
 I first bought the Cookies N' Cream version of the Optimum whey. It gave me great results by helping speed up my recovery time, and I truly did notice a difference in my muscle development after starting to use it. However, the taste of Cookies n' Cream isn't really that great and small cookie bits can be annoying. However, I later tried the double chocolate flavor and it really does taste like real chocolate, and is something you can really enjoy. But in the end I guess it's all about personal taste, it seems that some of the other reviewers liked the cookies n' cream but not the chocolate.<br/><br/>On a side note; Taking protien shakes does not develop your muscles, or give them an complexion or even make you bigger. It all depends on the type of workout you have. You grow outside of the gym not inside the gym, however, muscles need to be repaired after a good workoutm and that's what protiens do. They repair damaged muscles and strengthen them, and at the same time make them bigger.

First off i would like to say i have never had anything taste as great as this protein. Usually i am stuck with buying proteins that clam to taste great, (ex)"Unbelievable taste" is always written on the label... Oh, it's pretty unbelievable... Unbelievably nasty! Most protein shakes taste like straight donkey! Mix this baby with some Milk and a some ice all up in a blender and ta da, you have a great tasting malt (without all that nasty sugar of course, and less calories!)<br/><br/>I have not tried any other ON's products but will soon when i have more money.
 Edit:<br/><br/>Found scoop under all the powder.<br/>The very bottom.
 Best tasting and ease of mind knowing that i can trust this company to only put the good stuff in this protein. Been using this brand for years.
 I have used both the Chocolate and Banana flavors (sometimes I even mix them for extra goodness) and I can say that they are the best tasting powders I have tried (of 6 or 7 brands).  They do taste best when mixed with milk instead of water, though.  Lots of taste plus lots of cost-effective protein makes a great protein powder!
 I just ran out of the Double Rich Chocolate and I decided to give Extreme Milk Chocolate a try. I usually use water with my protein after a workout because it's easier and it seems to mix better with the blender bottle (as compared to using it with milk). D. Rich Chocolate is WAY better than Ex. Milk Chocolate; I do not care for the taste of Ex Milk Choc. It's going to be a LONG two months as I work my way through my container. I will definitely not purchase Ex Milk Choc again.
 I just bought the strawberry gold standard by ON. The reason why I decided to go with this product is because after reading up on various protein powders, I found out that many of them have high metal content. this product is considerably lower compared to muscle milk also the rave reviews convinced me to try it. I also have tried the ON mass builder and as a skinny dude, I can say that product was awesome. I used only a half bag of 12 pound bag and gained 17lbs. Then school got in the way, I quit for a while and I lost it all! My second stint in the gym, I decided I wanted to go for the lean look, hence why I'm using whey. I was a little apprehensive buying strawberry flavor but to my surprise, it taste great, you could almost compare it to yoohoo. this product also mixes very well.
 I find this ON Double Rich Chocolate protein powder to:<br/><br/>Mix very easily<br/>Taste very good<br/><br/>I have no idea if it will really help me pack on muscle, but with all the physical effort I am putting into trying to grow them, I choose to buy and use what my research shows to be the best protein out there. It is a bit more expensive than some other brands, but divided by the 150 servings in the 5lb jug, that difference is a non-issue for me.<br/><br/>When mixed with 2%, 1% or even skim milk this stuff tastes damn good. I actually look forward to drinking it pre and post workout.
 I've tried and enjoyed both the Double Chocolate and Vanilla Ice Cream flavors-- Double chocolate is okay blended with water, and tastes just like chocolate milk when mixed with milk. Vanilla ice cream I don't like as much with just milk or water, but it is good for smoothies-- I'm not much of a "vanilla milk" person, but it does taste quite good and tastes very creamy, to me.<br/><br/>After scouring reviews, we decided to try the Rocky Road flavor. BIG MISTAKE. It tastes very artificial (like almond extract, is the best corollary I can come up with), and has returned the dread I used to associate with having to choke down a protein shake. If you add peanut butter or a banana to the shake, it helps a lot, but you can still get the odd, fake flavor. Ew ...] Stay away from Rocky Road! We now have five horrible pounds to try and get through. Might end up giving it away, if I can't figure out a way to make it palatable.<br/><br/>That said, all three flavors we have tried blend up very smoothly (yes, even nasty rocky road), with any of a variety of methods! I use (depending on the situation): an immersion blender, a shaker cup, a blender bottle, or even a spoon if you are willing to take an extra 30 seconds!<br/><br/>I do like optimum nutrition whey protein still, but now I know that they DO have bad flavors, so I'll be more careful reading reviews and watching for criticisms in the future!<br/><br/>I am a 28 year old female who weight trains for strength and functionality-- my significant other also uses protein powder to help achieve his fitness goals and shorten recovery time.
 This is the best whey for the money!!!!!  Great taste!!!!!  Mixes well!!!!!  No blender needed.  Great any time of day.  I have tried a lot of whey protein powders and I always keep this one on hand.
 I have tried lot of whey flavors of various brands but Cookies N' Cream stands out among all. I read lot of good reviews about double rich chocolate also, so I ordered it first. It certainly wasn't bad, esp. for a protein powder but cookies n' cream is amazingly good tasting. I don't know how many other protein powders can I take with just cold water. Just put it in a shaker and it dissolves easily even in cold water and tastes even better with a dash of orange juice...I know this concoction sounds little weird but I like it! I don't get any bloated feeling afterwards like I used to get with GNC whey. In nutshell, this product is a winner...try it once and you might not opt for anything else later.
 The best bargain from Glanbia (oops, Optimum Nutrition), it's a decent 80% wpc for the price . . . . .
 Best isolate protein powder. I have been using for more than 5 years . No complain!
 Tastes a lot better than the protein I was taking before.  No, you won't think you're having a milkshake or anything, but the flavor is actually pretty pleasant.  Seems to be of top quality.  Mixes fairly easily.  I'll be buying this again!
 Tastes great
 The flavor that I ordered (chocolate malt) isn't very good at all, but this is still a high quality product, and I'll most likely buy some more in the future (when I run out anyway).
 I’m just trying out protein shakes, and this is the best tasting kind I’ve tried so far. It’s the perfect pre-workout snack.
 Whey is a siginificant source of protein. My son has been a user for over 3 years. He exercises and uses it as a source of protein as he lifts weights sometimes. He states that he fills satisified and not interested in eating junk food. His muscle mass has improved according to him.<br/><br/>Whey's claims on the nutritional label appear to be true and effective. My son would recommend Whey for other interested individuals.<br/><br/>Great product!<br/><br/>Yoli Navarro
 I first bought the vanillia version, However, the taste of isn't really that great and small protein bits can be annoying. However, I later tried the double chocolate flavor and it really does taste like real chocolate, and is something you can really enjoy. But in the end I guess it's all about personal taste, it seems that some of the other reviewers liked the cookies n' cream but not the chocolate. I first bought the Cookies N' Creavanilla version of the Optimum whey. It gave me great results by helping speed up my recovery time, and I truly did notice a difference in my muscle development after starting to use it.
 I ordered it during $20 off $99 purchase promotion. It's a nice buy. Good product and thumb up taste. My only problem was Amazon's shipping.<br/>I ordered this product twice with 2 packs each. Every time, there was a bag leaking. When I opened the box, it had powder everywhere. It did smell good, fresh strawberry, but I didn't want to know before I opened the bag...<br/>Moreover, I discovered the two shipping contained different packages, I'm still not sure whether they are the same products so far...<br/>Besides, the two orders have different prices as well. The first one marked as $64.xx and the second one jumped to $79.xx in just 3 days. Luckily, I called Amazon and got refunded.<br/>I would say, the whey protein is good, but the shipping was a bad experience. Next time, I probably will go to a local shop and pick a good &amp; right bag myself.
 It's the "gold standard" for a reason. A little expensive for what it is, but all things together it's a good protein.
 I can't comment on how this improve gains whatsoever because it could be attributed to my diet. But on the whole, I enjoy how this flavour tastes and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for whey protein to try. I mix it either with milk or water usually. With water, it quickly dissolves without much effort. With milk, takes a little longer, but just shake the bottle well and eventually it also dissolves without clumping.
 The best thing about optimum's whey is it mixes without lumps on the other hand the flavors are a hit or miss. The strawberry banana flavor tasted great with milk as do the majority of the flavors but when strictly combined with water the chemical taste is overpowering.<br/>The chocolates and cookie and cream flavors I found to be fine in water but all the fruit flavors taste terrible. Strawberry banana and vanilla ice cream are undrinkable in water but fine in milk.
 This Whey Protein is the best I ever had! It is not too sweet and it is not too gritty. I mixes very well with anything. I mix it with skim milk and ice. You can mix it with anything you want. One serving had 24g of PROTEIN and ONLY 3g of CARBS!!!!! THIS HELPS ME TREMENDOUSLY EVERY MORNING!!!!
 This smells and tastes a bit like the synthetic flavoring on microwave popcorn.  I've tried many different flavors of this product before and they were very good, however this one is not.  It's a limited time flavor the packaging says; there is a good reason for that.
 have been using since last 5 years, awesome taste but does absolutely what it should- provide high protein content
 Bag came ripped in the box. I don't know if it's been tampered with. I wouldn't repurchase
 I just reordered this product after trying to save $9.00 on another brand. Not worth it if I can't drink it. I guess I have been lucky at ordering the best tasting whey protien drinks and thought they were all the same, WRONG. I will stay with this protien drink from now on.
 Good taste
 This has an awful aftertaste. No one wrote anything about that. How can it be?
 Good flavor, even with water.  Needs thorough mixing, I use a whisk ball shaker.  Good protein to calorie ratio and priced comparatively to other online retailers.  The scoop got buried in the powder during shipping and is a pain to dig out (use kitchen tongs).  Why not just attach it to the lid?  And why is a serving labeled one rounded scoop?  Is it that hard to make your scoop a little bigger?  It is easy to spill powder off a rounded scoop when transferring to a bottle.  Anyways, a few stupid packaging flaws, but the powder itself is great and is visibly making a difference!
 My go to protein powder after workouts or when I just need a bit of energy boost. Many flavors to choose from love the cookies and cream along with peanut butter.
 I'm always afraid to buy a huge quantity of something to have it taste bad (hello, CostCo). This Double Rich Chocolate tastes pretty good and isn't as chocolate-y as I would have expected, which is good for me. Like anything powder-based, you can add more water for less flavor and less water for more.<br/><br/>The little spoon was kind of hard to find in the huge tub of powder, but I used chopsticks :]
 Tried this product, noticed a dry itchy sensation in the back of my throat immediately after drinking it, like sand paper. It was very uncomfortable. Didn't think anything at first, thought I was just coming down with a cold, or something. Took it again a week later, same thing happened, only much, much, worse as my lips dried out too, and my face became hot and swollen. I was well hydrated at the time. Never had this reaction to any kind of protein bar, or drink in the past, so I am a little skeptical about this product. Check the web on the dangers of long term whey use before you buy any kind of whey product. Gonna stick with vegan proteins from now on, they are much healthier. Don't believe the hype on whey. Dorian Yates (several times Mr Olympia) has written extensively on the dangers of whey, please read before you buy.
 Gold standard whey accelerated my gains more than I ever could have imagined. Soon I will become too powerful for this dimension. The girlfriend loves it!
 Not actually 5 pounds, was 3 pounds when received it. Might just have been me though.
 I use this product to give that extra fuel to the muscle after workouts. The most important thing to remember is not to consume in over-dose quantity.<br/><br/>For instance, I take less than-half the spoon powder in about 9 Oz of cold milk.<br/><br/>Also, I always look for the freshness of the product. The I got here is good through Sep 2012. That's good enough!<br/><br/>In short, good product, good packaging, good price and good for overall muscle building.
 Perhaps this is the best protein supplement I have ever taken, period.  Solubility, taste, and price are top notch.  Scoop size is "ideal," compared to other massive weight gainers.  I'm currently taking ON's Serious Mass, and when I finish Serious Mass, I'll definitely go back to 100% Gold Whey Protein, and will stay with it as long as I lift weight.
 This is my favorite protein and love the vanilla flavor!
 Great price for a tub of this size.  Warning, tastes horrible in water, but tastes JUST like regular chocolate milk when mixed with milk.  It says to only mix one scoop, but that's only 25g of protein.  Mix two scoops every time you drink it.  You can mix the two massive scoops in as little as 8 ounces of milk and it will taste just fine without any undisolved chunks.
 First off, this is the best protein drink out there.  Cookies and Creme, Chocolate and Vanilla are the best for me.  I still have Chocolate Mint (new for me) left to try in the pantry.  I will say strawberry ended up being given away to a friend.  Not that it was aweful, just not my taste nor close enough to strawberry for me.  With that out of the way here's MIXING 101.<br/><br/>The simple way to stir this stuff without LUMPS is as follows:<br/>1. Pour the milk (LOL).<br/>2. Get your spoon.<br/>3. Get your scoop of powder in one hand and spoon in the other hand<br/>4. Start stirring the milk vigorously (get that funnel/tornado look going in the milk!) and add powder in a continuous poor. NEVER stop stirring until scoop is empty. This is extremely important for LUMP FREE drinks :)<br/><br/>I realize this is a "pat the top of your head and rub your stomach" at the same time sort of deal but it's quite simple in practice.  Also do not PACK the powder in the scoop so it will easily flow from it.  I can add 2 scoops to a single 8-10oz glass of milk without ANY lumps!  No joke. No blender.  Just a quick stirring of milk and a steady pouring of powder.  Hope this helps someone. NO MORE LUMPS! Works with other powders.<br/><br/>Aaron
 I have tried lots of protein powders.  I get online the low-carb, low-calorie protein powders as I am just trying to put on muscle and it is hard to find one that you can stomach.  I was stuck on Champions Whey (Chocolate) for the past year as the best but I just got my shipment of the Gold Standard - Cookies &amp; Cream and it is AMAZING!  I love this stuff.  I tried it with fat free milk in just a shaker bottle and it was tremendous.  I am going to have this before and after my daily workout, but best yet, rather than binging on any ice cream desires late at night, I am going to get a scoop of fat free frozen vanilla yogurt, put a scoop of this in with some fat free milk and I have my fat free protein shake!
 Great protein I have been using for over 6 years everyday until THE NEW IMPROVED TASTE! It's too sweet, loaded with lots of artificial sweeteners. Time to move on!
 Tastes really good. This product mixes kinda chunky in whole milk stirring it with a spoon. But if i put the powder in a small container with water and shake it the product completely dissolves. Overall I think it is a great product at a reasonable price.
 I was looking for something to give me that extra edge in my workouts and games, and ON's Gold Standard Whey worked beautifully.  It is especially important for me to supplement my exercise this way because I don't consume a lot of protein in my diet - I frequently get very fatigued only halfway into my workouts.  I've tried some protein powders in the past (namely GNC's Wheybolic Extreme in vanilla) and while I got some boost to my workouts, I just could not handle the taste.  I don't have to tolerate ON's Extreme Milk Chocolate - it is a pleasure to drink and easy to mix (I use a shaker bottle).  Yum!
 Can't go wrong with the quality and taste of anything from Optimum. The only protein on the market that I use after my workouts and throughout the day.
 Great price for the amount of product. Great flavor. Will definitely be buying this again!
 There's not much to say. It came on time as was as described.
 Overall I do like the product.  It has just the right amount of protien at 24g, 3g Carbos and no sugar. It mixes very easily in cold water with no lumps.  I would buy again if they would get rid of or greatly reduce the sweetener. The sucralose sweetener is just way too much and makes me almost gag!!  I really would prefer this product with a no sugar option.
 Moccha Cappucino is mediocre. There's no way around it. The taste best compares to a packet of Swiss Miss hot chocolate with a hint of coffee. It mixes reasonably well, however it does clump somewhat, even when mixed with milk in a shaker bottle. It tastes fine in water, and also in Oatmeal.<br/><br/>If you're interested in trying out new flavors, give it a whirl. It really isn't bad, and you will definitely finish the whole five pounds. It's not one of their more stellar flavors. It's not bad. It is simply a very mediocre from a brand that strives for excellence.
 I have been using TrueProtein for awhile but their prices are really expensive. After trying ON Whey I think Im going to stay with it because the quality is comparable and the price is a lot cheaper specially if you do the suscribe and save plan. It also comes with aminogen, a scoop, flavor, and a container all included. The cookies and creme flavor isn't the best but its not bad. The ratio of isolate to concentrate to whey peptides is great for pre and post workout. Five pounds of high quality whey for 33 dollars shipped is a steal. Definitely give this a try.
 They call it gold standard for a reason, the best protein you can buy.
 this protein powder is the best.  easy to mix in a cup and the double chocolate taste so good.  Its my chocolate fix yummy
 I've been getting the dbl chocolate until this batch of cookies and cream, which I decided to try. The chocolate is great, but I wanted to try something different. The cookies and cream is just too strong and overwhelming. I don't really care for it straight, so I've been trying to dilute it with chocolate syrup. Not really working all that well. My 14yr old son likes it, and I've tried several times now to choke it down in hopes that it'll grow on me, but it's not working. My next batch I try out will be the vanilla.
 I bought this whey because it was a bit cheaper than the other ones. Never had it before now.<br/><br/>I have mixed this flavor with water a few times and it tastes pretty nasty. (I have always mixed all my whey with water in the past)<br/><br/>Though it's a pain, if you mix a little vanilla ice cream, then put a splash of milk, then the whey and blend/mix it up, it tastes pretty decent.<br/><br/>I'm assuming its as effective in promoting rebuild of muscle fibers as any of the other gold standard whey flavors.<br/><br/>Wouldn't buy it again because of the taste though.
 Like the subject says, good taste at a great price.  Obviously, a real milk shake tastes better, but this stuff actually tastes like chocolate!  I seem to be getting bigger and attribute it partly to getting extra protein from this product.
 I like this product a lot.<br/>the price is right, youre not paying extra just for the name on it *cough* *cough* *muscletech* *cough*<br/>its filtered many times so its almost pure protein. 24g per serving which is really good considering everything else is so low, i.e. fat.<br/>i got double chocolate and i think it taste pretty good, especially with milk.<br/>i havent notice any digestion problems, and no upset stomach.<br/>overall i think this is one of the best products for the price you can get, i definitely recommend this, im buying my second bag as i type this review.
 I have been using this supplement for over 4 years...It is the best on the market as far as I am concerned with regards to price and taste and the low carbs it has....I have friends who own a health food store and usually get a nice discount on the product but Amazon's price is very hard to beat especially with free shipping.......
 DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. IT HAS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS HIGH AMOUNTS OF FREE GLUTAMATE. This product is very dangerous because they way they process the protein creates "free" amino acids that excite you neurons (brain cells) to death. I have used this product and got completely screwed up mentally from it. Not only that but it will make you LOSE MUSCLE becuase the free glutamate uses huge amounts of your ATP energy. I am 200% sure it was from this. And any type of protein drinks that are processed like this will have the same problem. Read the book Excitotoxins: The Taste That Kills by<br/>Russell L. Blaylock for more information.
 Tastes very good and I have had good results. It's definitely a less of a punch to the face compared to other protein powders.
 The BEST protein on the market! Period, I stack the ON micronized creatine with this as well. The combination is ridiculously good. They also mix well together, I never even notice the creatine with them together.
 I like ON whey protein. It's low on carbs, fat, sugars and high on Protein. I don't recommend strawberry flavor, it tastes like medicine. The mixer or bottle stinks after a while if you leave it to get dried without washing.
 5 stars. I am alreay on my third bottle. use it everyday in my smoothie.
 I've tried GNC and Muscle Milk proteins and the Optimum Nutrition is my favorite so far.  It has a good flavor, mixes easily, doesn't have any irritating side effects and it's a good value ounce per ounce.<br/>I took it down to four stars for two reasons: First- the flavor is good but it's not great- the Muscle Milk protein+ has a better flavor.  Second- Shipping took a while.  I ordered this and a shaker the same day and this took a full four business days longer to get here so that was a minor disappointment but that's more of a whine about the seller.
 Well it's supposed to be protein so I wasn't much thinking about how it will taste as long as it doesn't taste or smell gross. But now that I think of it, I think I would surely not give a name as Double Rich Chocolate. No it isn't like chocolate nectar so no. But hey its a great deal for a whey protein, not so expensive and surely drinkable, I've been having it 5 times a day for 2 months and I ain't complaining. Although it's either this or casein(which I take at night) that some times gives me gas!
 Great Product, but go to bodybuilding.com they have buy two for $99.99 free shipping
 I love this product
 good
 I wasn't sure how well the protein would absorb but evidence suggests to me that the protein is actually getting absorbed in my body. I donate plasma twice a week for money and they measure the protein levels in your body each time. If your protein levels aren't high enough you can't donate. I would frequently be turned away for low protein levels. After using this product regularly my protein levels have always been high enough, so it seems to work.
 I'm definitely not a professional body builder by any means. Until recently, I was a college undergrad, and now I'm working full-time. In general, my workouts usually consist of weight lifting at home, with a set of adjustable free weights, and occasional trips to the gym for exercises not easily done at home. More recently, I've been doing P90X, and am finishing up the third phase now.<br/><br/>This whey protein works wonders. In general, if you're only going to supplement your workouts with one thing, it would almost definitely be whey protein. It speeds up recovery, gives more energy, and really enables muscle growth. As far as whey goes, I've tried a few other brands, and ON Gold Standard is the winner when it comes to the balance of amount of protein, ease of use, price, and taste. I've tried three flavors thus far. Vanilla is okay, when mixed with milk it tastes mostly like runny, melted vanilla ice cream. Not disgusting, but not exactly my cup of tea. I went through a couple jars of the Double Rich Chocolate, based off the recommendations of many reviews, and ended up sticking with it for a while. I've never been a fan of chocolate milk, so the Double Rich Chocolate isn't amazing to me, but it still tastes good and is easy to get down.<br/><br/>I recently tried a tub of the Cookies n' Cream flavor, and I'm not going to be sticking with it. It's nice, as a change of pace from the months of chocolate I had, but mixed with milk it was waaaay too rich for me. I usually mix it with water, which makes it taste sort of like a Jack in the Box Oreo cookie shake. It tastes kinda weird if it's warm, though, so I usually either pre-mix it and stick it in the fridge for a long time, or throw in a couple ice cubes when I mix it, to cool it down. Some reviewers have commented on a bitter aftertaste (for Cookes n' Cream only, not the other flavors), some say they have never encountered it. I seem to be stuck in the middle. Every once in a while, one of the gulps will hit me with a slightly bitter aftertaste. It's not often enough to make me hate drinking it, but it's worth a mention. It seems to happen less often if I pre-mix the shake and leave it in the fridge for a while, so temperature may have something to do with it.<br/><br/>One last thing I want to mention, if you're just someone who works out a bit in their free time to stay in shape, there's one other supplement worth taking a look at: creatine. It's cheap, not harmful, and can work wonders for you! This review's already pretty long, so I won't talk about it, but there's plenty of info out on the web, so take a look!
 It's okay, sticks to the side of the blender. Alot better protien out there for the money.
 too sweet. I ended up getting sick of the flavor really quickly &amp; was luckily able to sell 3/4 of the container to a friend.
 purchased this on the recommendation of a friend, word of mouth. very happy overall.<br/><br/>tastes fine. as others have said, it's better in milk, but i've also sprinkled half portions into a fruit smoothie from time to time and that's delicious too. it isn't always easy to mix in with a spoon, unless you do it a 1/2 portion at a time.<br/><br/>very filling - i use as a meal replacement (often breakfast or dinner right after a run and workout), and am rarely hungry for 3-6 hours afterwards.<br/><br/>oh, you might have to dig a little into the mixture to find the serving cup the first time you open this.<br/><br/>i'll be getting this again when i run out.
 Great taste and mixes very easy besides that one of the or the only protein that doesn't irritate my stomach
 I'm lactose intolerant, and have no digestive problems with this product.  It mixes easily, and the taste is improved by mixing with cold water or refrigerating after mixing.  It's most delicious when mixed with plain soy milk.
 Great taste even when mixed w/ water.  I mix 3 scoops (75g. protein) w/ 1 scoop Carnation Instant breakfast (chocolate, dark) w/ a bottle of water (12 oz.) after a hard work out.  Shake it in a big plastic bottle at the gym and it all blends well, chug it and Feel your Body get Replenished!
 For 5 years I have drank extreme milk chocolate. Double rich was my first flavor and horrible so I stuck with extreme milk. I ordered this because it is cheap on sale. I hate coffee and I love the flavor. It's actually better than extreme milk chocolate. Buy this flavor.
 Taste is not bad at all and each scoop delivers 24 gr of protein. With milk it delivers 32.
 excellent flavor for the chocolate whey protein, and a good amount of protein without all of the extra junk and carbs.  a banana, a scoop of the powder and some milk is an awesome post workout shake.
 Scoop was not included - so the suggested serving size means nothing. No idea whether or not I am using the right amount.
 I go through this stuff so quickly because:<br/><br/>1. It is delicious<br/><br/>2. Great nutritional value<br/><br/>3. Leaves me feeling completely recovered the day after a tough workout<br/><br/>4. My housemates all prefer it to their shakes--I have to hide it in my room<br/><br/>Buy it, try it. Kicks the crap out of muscle milk.
 Absolutely love this stuff! Great taste, and great results from an even better seller! Will buy from again!
 Low in fat and carbs, high in BCAAs and glutamine precursors, and decent in taste. I buy the 10lb. bag, and it lasts me for a couple of months. Can't beat the price either. Great supplement.
 Best combination of taste and effectiveness.
 best scoop per cent out there.
 Awesome as usual.
 We can go into discussion about so many things about protein.<br/><br/>But honestly this protein is the best bang for the buck.<br/><br/>I use it right when i wake up with 2 tbsp's of sugar to prevent morning catabolism and one scoop with a cassein blend for post workout.<br/><br/>It's a good protein for the price.
 It's a second time I'm buying protein from this brand and it doesn't quite look the same. It looks like moisture got to it so it is not as powdery (see picture), plus it doesn't mix well as the other one.<br/>Seems to me it was stored improperly.<br/>I just hope it works as well.
 For the money this is the best protein out their. Taste wise it is above average for its low calorie standard. Do not expect a rich Muscle Milk type protein because this is not that. There is a reason MM is 200 calories more per serving. This does the job though, and has a decent taste.
 It's a very good protein shake with a good balance of nutrients. Probably the best part is the high serving count (149) which means that 5 pounds lasts at the LEAST twice as long as competitors like CytoSport and Muscle Milk.
 Rocky road is a great flavor, thanks to all the reviews below for recommending it... I just had my first serving for breakfast, and it tastes just like cold Ovaltine. I had Strawberry flavored whey of a different brand with my last batch, and that was almost enough to make me swear off whey protein entirely. It tasted terrible.<br/><br/>I would prefer ON without sucralose (Splenda) or acesulfame potassium, both of which are artificial sweeteners, but I'm not overly concerned as I don't take this product more than twice per day.<br/><br/>Mixability was good, not great. It took me thirty seconds of stirring in a cup and I still had some clumps, which eventually went away. Probably will work better with shaker bottle.
 Hi this stuff is good to balance my protein intake.  It's low on carb, fat and sodium.  Watch the cholesterol though.  I don't use it everyday but probably 75%.  It can taste a bit chalky and metallic.  I use it with water mostly and I whip it with an aerolatte (coffee frother).  I find the taste is better with really cold water. It can also be made with a shaker.  Most people make a shake with added frozen fruit and any kind of milk.  I don't like to drag out the blender.
 Everything ok
 I have been supplementing with prott for a while now and have tried several different brands.  ON is by far the cleanest most effective protein powder I have tried.  It has the protein matrix that works for me as well as the addition of BCAA's makes this a really great addition to my nutritional locker.  I LOVE the flavor and mixability as well.
 I've never had any other protein powder, but from what it tastes, it's not bad. It will last me forever because it's such a big container. I can't compare to any other brand, but I will def try other flavors. It has the right amount of protein and not many calories. That's a thumbs up from me.
 I would consider myself a bodybuilder but wanted more of a meal replacement.  This seems to work well for me and it taste delicious when mixed with soy milk.  I like to have it after a workout to help me recover.
 I have had gastric bypass and I have tried a lot of protein mixes and this one is the best every once I found this one I haven't had to try another one again. This one dissolves and isn't chalky. It tastes like choc milk. I use only non fat milk cause it does make your milk thicker and that's ok for me. I used to have this 3 times a day but now I only need it for breakfast and it is feeling and satisfying until I have my first break at work. And now that I found it on Amazon it mails out to me and I don't have to worry the store is going to be out any more and it was cheaper then in the store. Yea for me!  And it has very low sugar and high protein. Try it you might like it.
 This is one of the protein brands that I trust. There are many out there but who knows what they actually mix in their jars. The only thing to watch out is that if you mix this with water..you'll need to give the shaker a violent twirl for about a minute, otherwise you end up with lumps in your mouth. My favorite is Rocky Rad...but I'm trying out chocolate now..not as good. Thumbs up for this product. However amazon took 15 days to get it to me..!!!!! first time that happened.
 Simple ingredients changed after many years. Boo.
 O.N. Just simply can't be beat. They're an honest company with high quality for a good price. Overall their protein doesn't taste great but is still above average especially the mocha cappuccino.
 Optimum Nutrition has been #1 rated protein for years now. There is good reason for it. Its the highest quality of protein, the taste is absolutely amazing, and the price point is better then anything your going to find.<br/>it doesnt contain other supplements, just straight protein. It doesnt clump up when your mixing it, it doesnt have a horrible after taste either. Its just straight wholesome goodness.<br/><br/>This stuff cuts recovery time from muscle exhaustion dramatically. Literally over nite muscle soreness evaporates into a figment of your imagination. Im not a rep for Optimum, just a proud user for quite a few years now.<br/><br/>I will always buy Optimum, and nothing else!!
 I've always trusted Optimum Nutrition when it comes to whey protein. It is one of the few brands that actually mixes well and I can stand to drink. I couldn't find it any cheaper than here on Amazon.
 I have used this crap. Yes the company outs in real protein and that's where the good part stops. It's right there on the label under ingredients.<br/>They put Acesulfame Potassium sweetener in the Product. That artificial sweetener gives the user headaches, nausea and blurred vision<br/>among other things. That Sweetener called "Ace-K' has been proven to cause cancer and these supplement companies insist on putting that<br/>product in their supplements.<br/>My question is why do they not care about doing bodily harm to athletes?
 Taste good. Love it so far
 This is really THE best protein that I've ever tried. It mixes well with anything and tastes good (well, better than other brands). Plus, I instantly noticed results with it! Usually my workouts kill me and even with protein shakes I will be sore the next day. With this protein I recovered quickly and was ready for another round! It's worth noting that I've only been using it for a little over a week, but so far I'm more than satisfied with it.
 This is one of the best powders I've tried.  Keeps you full for hours.  Mix with almond milk for extra flavor.
 Love the product. Great protein, low in carbs. The Cookies &amp; Cream flavor could definitely be better but when I make it into a smoothy with milk, a banana, and some ice it becomes much easier to drink. Will buy definitely buy again!
 Looking for a great deal on a great protein powder?  Found it!  This is easy to drink after a workout, tastes great, and provides a good amount of protein for the taste and the price.  I'm not a chocolate lover, but this is smooth and easy to drink.
 The best, no question
 I a sold on Optimum Nutrition products. This is a great tasting protein that works if used as directed. I am drinking one shake in the morning and one post workout, and I have seen great results. 10lbs of muscle in 2 months, and shredded body fat
 Smells good but with a bitter aftertaste.
 This is the best protein powder that I have consumed compared to other similar products. I did some research on the type of protein that is good for muscle building and everyday consumption and found a lot of information about whey protein. I researched different brands and found Optimum Nutrition very popular. I feel good after drinking protein shakes. I got the best deal on Amazon for a 5 lbs protein powder tub. I am so happy with the product that I have signed up for frequent automatic shipments.
 Got the cookies n cream flavor<br/>Nice
 I have had Rocky Road, Natural Chocolate, and Cookies and Creme. I rate them in that order. Cookies and creme tastes awful IMO.
 You want a great protein? YOU FOUND ONE! You want something that taste great? WELL DRINK THIS STUFF BUDDY OLE PAL. This protein will give you the results you want, the yum yums you desire, and confidence you deserve!!!! LETS GOOOOOO!!!!!! Drink this, get lean, and love who you are!! Everyone clap your hands and slowly start chanting, whey... whey.. Whey.. WHey.... WHEy.... WHEY... WHEY WHEY WHEY LETS GOOOOO IM PUMPED
 Great Product, Great Price, fast shipping!
 I'm a newb in strength training, but this product has helped me to achieve my daily required protein intake, which is not possible just by eating "real food". And the cal-carb-pro-fat composition is just perfect for someone like me who's in a cutting stage.<br/><br/>Side effect: I have been taking this for about 3 months and I didn't notice any harm side effect, except that for the 1st-2nd week I felt a bit sleepy after consuming this.. but it didn't recur anymore after 2 weeks.<br/><br/>Good Stuff!
 Because you have one friend that uses this product and hasn't seen results that means it doesn't work?  Try using your brain before posting another review.  Your friend's lack of progress is not an indication of this products ability to perform its purpose.  Whey Protein is not a magic shake that is going to give you muscle.  You need a good diet and equally good training in the gym in order to see results.  The purpose of protein is to fuel the rebuiling of the muscle tissue you break down in the gym.  Since most protein consumption takes time, and is inconvenient directly after a workout, whey protein is ideal.  It mixes fast, requires no preparation, and whey is digested faster than any other type of protein.<br/><br/>That being said, Optimum Nutrition produces the highest quality whey protein.  It mixes well, and tastes great.  24g per scoop is a perfect amount as well.  I take one in the morning and two postworkout...among other things.
 This is a great product,some people might say it does not mix that well but I always use a blender and haven't had a ploblem.I have tried the following:Delicious strawberry,double rich chocolate,cookies and cream,rocky road,and vanilla ice cream.The best so far is strawberry and cookies &amp; cream,double rich chocolate,rocky road,and vanilla ice cream are just alright.
 I have been using this whey for several years and the flavor is terrific; not too sweet with a nice chocolate flavor. I have yet to find another which I like more.
 This arrives fast and in good nick. The powder does not leaves clumps if you shake or blend it. The taste is nuetral and blends well with many things.
 So far the only protein that has stood out to me in quality and taste and results has been beverly international mass maker or muscle provider.  Every other protein I have had since then, well... is just expensive powder.
 The best tasting whey protein I've tried.  With milk, it tastes like a chocolate milkshake; with water, it's still delicious.  Wait for it to go on sale and then stock up.
 Tastes Delicious.
 It works just as well as the Muscle Milk I used to take. It doesn't seem to dissolve, the particles just hover in the water. It doesn't clump at all though, which is an improvement on Muscle Milk. There is very little flavor, tastes like slightly chocolaty water. Milk might improve the taste but then it has too many calories. No bad aftertaste. Cheap. Something I definitely recommend buying if you use protein often and don't mind the lack of taste.
 Haven't been working out much due to a shoulder injury, but there are a few things I really like about this protein;<br/><br/>1. mixes better than any I've tried<br/>2. Tastes great<br/>3. Higher protein per serving than other cheaper brands.
 I'm 3/4 of the way through my second 2lb container of the mocha cappucino flavor but decided to try the coffee in the 5 lb size (because it was such a great deal) in the hopes of getting my scrawny 13.5 yo son to try it. But after mixing the coffee flavored powder with skim milk and discovering that it tastes like a coffee shake I'm no longer willing to share it with him! I happen to love coffee in general so it's not surprising that I prefer this flavor to the m.c. It's also not as sweet as the m.c.
 Always a great product and shipped new.
 This product deserves every gold medal it has won and then some!  I recently purchase some GNC Pro Perfomance protein, and I cannot stand the taste.  For close to the same price, I purchased the ON Whey Gold Standard, and what a difference!  The protein powder mixes much better, has better stats as far as BCAA's and grams of protein per grams of powder.  Definitely give this a try.
 Best tasting protein powder. Tried other brands but they all gave me the Hershey squirts.
 This whey or that whey? One of life's great questions. Well this is the whey to go. One time I lost my whey, but then I found my whey again. The Kurds had it. Kurds and whey just dont go together. Keep the Kurds awhey from your whey.
 I love that supplement , I always use it after my workout ... it's easy to dissolve and it has an excellent flavor , I also mix it with my BCAA
 Best protein powder on the market today. For more information check out this article about this protein powder<br/><br/>http://www.aemuscle.com/best-whey-protein-powder<br/><br/>Checkout my video on it aswell: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGqxWrcAtjU
 I start off everyday with a this shake and an egg white sandwich. Boring? Maybe, but I'm fueled with 500 total calories (sandwich and shake) and 40 grams of protein to start the day. It mixes well in 30 seconds with a spoon (no shaker), and it taste great; especially, if you drink it every day.
 I've been using this protein powder for several years now.  It's the best tasting, most easily dissolving, and (from what I've read comparing many competitors) best quality protein powder you'll find.  Worth the price.  Also notably lacking in potentially toxic metals as identified in a Consumer Reports investigation of several protein powder brands.
 This is by far the best flavor I've had as far as whey protein goes. I've tried strawberry banana, double rich chocolate (ON Whey Gold Standard) and strawberry milkshake Muscle Milk. ON Whey wins by far, the other stuff was complete junk compared to this. I will always have a tub of both strawberry banana and double rich chocolate sitting around - strawberry banana to mix with my oatmeal in the morning (DELICIOUS!) and double rich chocolate for the much needed protein after workouts. I'll be sticking with Optimum Nutrition for a long time.
 Tastes just like a less sweet milk chocolate.  I don't feel like I am drinking a protein product at all.  Not overly sweet and fake tasting like alot of other products out there.  Recommended over MusclePharms product or any type of "house brand" (ie vitamin shoppe, gnc) out there.
 My wife and I enjoy smoothies for breakfast but run out of whey powder quickly. This 5 pounder not only is delicious, but is also a good value!
 I have been using this for close to a year now. No other brand can beat this product. Period. Absolutely awesome whey. Mixes instantly. Complete pack of amino.
 This item has been listed as "Exclusively for Prime Customers." I have chosen not to buy the product because of this factor.
 I believe this to be one of the proteins on the market because it has the best quality to price ratio. The only reason for the 4 star rating is you can get more servings for your dollar on Costcos website.<br/><br/> ...]
 Blends well and the double chocolate tastes great
 This is a go to for me. I love the Optimum Nutrition products and this one is no exception.
 This product can have great results if used in the right way (e.g.: cardio, weight lifting, eating healthy, etc.) if you're looking to build muscle.  I wouldn't recommend mixing this with water...doesn't have the best taste.  Goes perfect with milk though, especially fat-free milk. It adds an extra 8g of protein and helps with weight loss. Amazon also has the cheapest price for this online as far as I could find. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to live healthy, get a more toned body, or build muscle.
 I received an item without QR code, which can mean that the product may not be original.
 Out of everything I've tried and heard about from other people, this is the best whey on the market. It is the best tasting (at least the chocolate; strawberry is okay and I've not tried anything else), it mixes with water and milk very easily, it is quite inexpensive, and you can't find it cheaper than on Amazon. If you're into exercise nutrition and you know you're going to eventually use ten pounds, just get the big bag. You'll save money.
 My wife loves it. Received quickly.
 Very good
 I ordered this protein powder due to the great reviews and it seemed like what I needed. I ordered the Extreme Milk Chocolate flavor. I had no idea, however, that this product has artificial sweeteners. The first time I tried this product, I could taste the artificial sweeteners immediately. The "fake" taste and the way I felt after drinking it makes me regret buying this product. Quite a disappointment.
 I love Optimum nutrition, this is one of the supplement companies I've placed my trust in.<br/><br/>5 stars for being a great protein.<br/><br/>1 star for tasting like straight cocoa powder. Average out at 3 stars.
 I actually bought this at Costco (6.3lb bag)and loved it. Mixes easily, taste and smells great.
 Taste great.  It actually has more protein than other products that I bought.  Great value for the money.  I highly recommend this product.
 Good taste, and mixes well even when I forgot my shaker cup (Improvision). Would recommend this to anyone who wants a quaility Whey powder.
 We love this brand of whey powder and keep several of the flavors on hand.  The banana whey always runs out first.  I wish Amazon would put it back on Subscribe-and-Save and offer the discounted price that's available on Vanilla and Chocolate whey.
 Some reviews out there about this product contain some pretty inaccurate information... The study done on its carcinogenicity was a dose depended study on multiple rodents, all of which received dosages which would FAR exceed ANY human intake from using this protein or any artificial sweetener... and no increased rate of tumor incidence was detected even at these astronomical dosages (up to 3% of the rats diet was based on Acesulfame potassium. In addition, while the studies done did prove in rodents increased insulin production (minute levels, again dose dependent), no hypoglycemia was recorded.<br/><br/>Are you planning on consuming 2 pounds of this product a day? Is that the reason for your concern? IMO great product...<br/><br/>My two sources (or just search on PubMed...)
 I blend mine with milk and it tastes just like chocolate milk. Add a little extra powder or less fluid for a more sweeter taste.
 Love this product
 Great product
 The flavor is great. Much better than EAS vanilla. It mixes well, with water, or milk. A shaker cup is highly recommended.
 This protein is probably the best out there. There isn't anything bad in here, not too much sugar and it's a great way to supplement the diet to get extra protein in and fast after a workout. I find I'm a lot less sore taking it right away after the same workout than without taking it. After trying a dozen other proteins, this one can easily be called my favorite.
 I am a first time user of Whey and I have nothing to compare it against. I compared contents and price online and Amazon's was comparable. The delivery was less time than scheduled.
 Excellent 6 weeks and I can see  results
 good
 Great taste, high in everything good and low and everything bad at a great price.  I have been using it for years and with amazon you do not have to pay for shipping.
 can never go wrong with 100% whey. Great before and after workouts. Try the chocolate with milk half a banana and scoop of peanut butter and you will never go back
 This is the best nutritional shake of any kind that I've had. Mixed with 2% milk the Double Rich Chocolate tastes great (I wish I could drink it all day) and it mixes really well with just a spoon, not clumping up like other brands. I first got this at GNC and was turned off by the price but it's half as much here on Amazon so it's perfect. I can't speak for the other flavors but I can highly recommend the Double Rich Chocolate.
 Thumbs up!
 I have been taking optimum nutritions whey protein for a couple of years now. I love this product and works miracles for the body. I have tried, double chocolate, rocky road and cookies and cream. I loved the dc and cc so i decided to try the rocky road. This flavor is not as good as the other two. I bought a 5 lb tub of it and am now regretting this flavor. stick to the flavors you like.
 Great Flavor
 taste isn't as I'd expect, but it's protein.
 Great product
 This powder is great for what I use it for, which is post-workout recovery drinks in a shaker bottle and smoothies in a blender. It mixes easily in the shaker bottle, tastes great, and won't break the bank.
 ist ok
 I use this to get my protein in for the morning, however, I've read a lot about the use of artificial flavorings (sugar, etc.) in which I don't mind, but for those who do, maybe the Natural powder would do (which only comes in Chocolate and Vanilla). Overall, I enjoy this flavor as well as a few others of theirs'.
 This protein powder taste just like chocolate milk and it mixes well. I got a good price on the 5 pound with a subscription.
 I have tried quite a few whey protein's but this one is by far the best. I have the double rich chocolate and it is awesome there is usually no clumps and usually i dont even use a shaker i will just by a bottle of milk like the 16 0z. from the gas station and drop it in there, of course after you drink a little bit of the milk so the mix will fit in the bottle. The best part is that is just one small scoop not a huge shovel you have to put in the liquid. good product cheap and easy.
 The solubility is excellent. Stirring with a spoon for 30 seconds really does do the trick.<br/>The taste is mediocre, but I mix with water. Have not tried with milk.<br/>Not bad for being rated #4 on a protein experiment done by a redditer.<br/>The study observed the validity of what was claimed and what was actually found.<br/>Here is the link to his findings:  ...]<br/>If linking is not allowed, search "reddit protein power measurement results."
 Great product. Always arrives on time.
 I'm glad to buy  this one the best protein so far☝️
 My number one source for Whey Protein right now. Great product that does what it is suppose to do as well as taste great!
 I've had miriads of horrible tasting powders in my days and most are damn irritating to mix as well. This powder is fair priced, easy to blend (I use a high quality immersion blender), and tastes so good I even have it for a healthy dessert sometimes instead of a sweet. Choc Mint fan for life.
 This protein is the best of the best. Great taste and great results, definitely should be on your shopping list.
 Best tasting protein I have ever had. Extremely healthy and deffinitly works. Worth every penny!
 THE BEST!!!!!
 This is the best I have tried. Mixes well in water or milk without clumps. Low sugar/ carbs but high aminos and glutamine. The chocolate coconut is awesome. Has a very natural taste without a grainy texture and bad aftertaste. Well worth the price.
 this is by far the best protein you can take when i started lifting i weighed 155 and got up to 195 in 4 months that is training hard every day of the week taking 1 day off. nothing but power lifting and a little cardio take about 220 grams a day and see what happens good luck to your transformation any trainging tips email me at spl1tn_h34ds101@yahoo.com
 Good Stuff
 Started on Optimum Nutrition when I began to take protein supplements.  Changed to a GNC-espoused brand when I couldn't find ON at my local grocery store.  When I found ON Whey on Amazon, I knew it was an easy decision because of Amazon's great service, the quality difference between ON and the GNC-pimped brand, and the price.  I'm sticking with Amazon for my supplement needs.
 I have been taking this powder for a couple years now and can honestly say it is the best protein powder I have ever used. It mixes very easily and tastes great even in water.  At 24g per scoop it is one of the highest sources of protein in a powder shake.  The price here at amazon for the 10 lb bag is very reasonable.  You won't be disappointed.  Do it!
 The best taste ever...!<br/>Mixes well and tastes super good.<br/>i use water and no problem!<br/>Only thing is though, its pretty sweet.. i mean its french vanilla...
 Great product and what a price compared to health and fitness stores. My son and I take whey protein after our workouts and I stay full preventing over eating. I'll continue to purchase in amazon.
 bad taste
 One of the best protein powders in the market.  Great taste, mixes well, and doesn't leave a bad aftertaste like some other cheaper, low quality brands.
 Taste fantastic!
 This is a great supplement! Tastes good, mixes pretty easily, and I've really noticed the difference in how it helps burn fat. Plus, it's reasonably priced for the amount you get. Of course, you still have to work out hard too, so if you are commited to doing that, I would highly reccomend this product.<br/><br/>Mark
 taste has been improved.<br/>mixing is wonderful.<br/>effectiveness is super only if you work out regularly.<br/>i have been using this protein for almost 4 years already.<br/>i tried many protein supplements and i think this is the best one.<br/>i recommend!
 I bought this after trying GNC's whey protein.  This protein blows it out of the water.  For starters, I know that lots of people say it, but the taste is phenomenal.  I have the rocky road and I plan on trying the cookies and cream flavor next time.  Also, I definitely feel as though it is helping with my weight lifting.  Not like it's a miracle supplement, but it helps me between one set of lifting and the next, giving me faster recovery times than I am used to, and helping to get my protein uptake up to what it should be.  Anyway, it is good, and it is worth it.
 I love this product, one of the best tasting products available.  Has a good amount of high quality whey, great for building muscle. One of the only proteins I will use.<br/>Also checkout <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Beachbody-s-Hardcore-Base-Shake-for-Body-Beast-30-Day-Supply/dp/B008K55EU8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Beachbody's Hardcore Base Shake for Body Beast - 30-Day Supply</a>
 It was OK after removing the lumps in the bag harder chocolate lumps we were not sure of so rather then take a chance we took them out of the product.  It seems OK but could not get response on product from maker if we should be concern or not.  They are rated well on bodybuilders dot com etc. Maybe got a bag exposed to moisture is all we can assume since we got no response other wise to date
 Taste is pretty good mixed with water.  I haven't tried mixing it with milk yet.  The taste and texture is sort of like vanilla jello pudding but a little more powdery.  I've heard some people complain about it clumping but it doesn't seem to clump much more, if at all, than my whey protein.
 Mixes easily with water<br/>Low Fat<br/>Low Cholestrol<br/>Forms a creamy shake with cold milk.
 I've had 2 other protein powders this one by far the best. I had the vanilla ice cream flavor and It was no where near as good as this one.
 Usually, I have no issues with ordering ON Gold Standard Cake Batter flavor from Amazon.  The last batch I got was a completely different consistency than the other ~15 jugs I've purchased over the past few years.  It foamed soooo much when you shook it that it made consuming the entire shake very difficult.  Also, it tasted much worse than any other batch.  E-mailed Optimum Nutrition to see if they had changed ingredients or manufacturing processes and they won't fix the issue because I didn't buy it directly from them.  They assured me that "No changes to the manufacturing process had been made."  Though, they didn't tell me they weren't going to send me a new jug until they got all the information they needed from me (batch number, expiration date, purchase date, flavor, my home address).  Why would they ask for my home address if they didn't plan on shipping me a new jug?  Way to lead me on customer service.  It's 2015 and there are competitors for every product on the face of the Earth.  Customer service is the only way to differentiate yourself and my first experience with ON customer service was terrible.  Will update this review if anything changes.  Doubtful.
 This product works well for me and is resonably priced. The flavor is ok, but is not awful. I mix it in a shaker with either a cup of milk or a cup of light soy milk, and makes for a smooth drink. I'm on the go a lot, and this helps me boost my protein when I may not be eating enough.
 Tastes delicious. My favorite flavor of protein ever. Mixes in a shaker bottle very easily compared to other whey proteins out there.
 Optimum Nutrition Whey Gold Standard is always my go to for protein however I wanted to switch it up with the flavor and I couldn't resist trying Cake Batter. This protein flavor does cost more than others but it's very tasty! I do mix other things with my drink so sometimes I completely block out the flavor. Next time I will purchase the normal go to and cheaper option, French Vanilla. Cake Batter is good for a switch up.
 Tastes like Nesquik - great taste - dissolves well
 I go to the gym religiously for about 5 times a weeks and I drink this stuff like water. My muscle restores pretty quickly and this proten shake does not give me the gassy feeling other protein shakes give me. I have high energy level during workouts and I don't feel so sore. I like that it is low sodium so i dont have to worry about high blood pressure. I am not picky with food so this shake taste pretty good to me. definitely recommend it.
 Its a protein powder and does what it needs to do if you can stand the horrible after taste. Always had to sweeten it with hot chocolate powder to try to mask the taste. There are better tasting protein powders out there, this one is just too unappealing for me some days.
 I personally believe that Gold Standard is the best protein out there. I have tried a lot of them and this is the one that gives me the best results on muscle recovery and muscle developments
 does what its suppose to do... supply you with protein.<br/>taste is nowhere near the quality of syntha 6 or even dymatize, but it will do.<br/><br/>fewer calories than most as well.
 The vanilla ice cream tastes real good with 8oz of milk and this is a great whey supplement.
 I love it and love amazon!!
 I purchased it for my boyfriend and he said it tastes great and he would buy this product again.
 Great product !
 ON Protein not only taste great but it mixes easy with water as well (for the portable shakers). I've tried many different protein powders and ON Whey is by far the best one. It's a good protein supplement for those who are doing the P90x program, Crossfit or any other physically demanding training programs.
 Most whey protein makes me want to vomit.  This flavor of ON whey does not.  5 stars.
 not fan of product Formulation, Why are amounts of protein not disclosed and are rather listed as Blend, What are Manufacturer hiding behind formula . I want to know what is in product we are buying!
 Although a great protein supplement the price has been sky rocketing for the past few months. I bought this thing for 27 bucks around 3 months back and then it went to 36 about a month ago and now its 41!! I'm sure there isnt a a good reason for this price hike. The sellers are just trying to rip the buyers off for a good tasting protein. It seems my days with this protein are over. Will have to research for a new protein now.
 I've used Gold Standard Whey Protein for a few years to help build muscle.  I've been doing the Stronglifts 5x5 program and the results are amazing!!  This protein is the best there is from the research I've done.  The extreme milk chocolate is my favorite flavor so far.
 This is one of the best protein supplements on the market today. The taste and mixability of ON Whey Gold Standard is incredible!<br/><br/>I have problems with too much lactose, so I mix it in with some vanilla Soy-Milk for an incredibly smooth and delicious post-workout shake. A must buy if you're looking to pack on some muscle!
 I have only been using the stuff for about two weeks, i have seen some muscle build. Which is good for this fast, my advise is to eat many protein filled meals such as tuna or red meat along with a protein shake to see better results. It definitely helps the building process and maybe some amino acid supplements to make sure your body is usng all the protein you take in. A major plus is that the extreme milk chocolate tastes pretty good. I like it.
 Best Protein hands down
 One of the better whey protein powers on the market. Dissolves in milk really well.Best price for serving amount. Lasts me about a month and a half taking daily.
 Very Fast Delivery and this Whey tastes really like chocolate more than the one's I've tried earlier which tasts slightly fake! This tastes good and the seller shipped this item very fast!<br/><br/>Thanks!
 I absolutely love this Protein powder. Quality is good. Flavor is decent. Price is reasonable. Overall this is your best bet (unless you can find something for sale somewhere). Go with the choocolate!
 Pros<br/><br/>1)  The product has everything I need in it, at the ratios I need them at.  (Calorie v Protein count, BCAA's, essential aminos)<br/>2)  This whey blends great with everything, and leaves little to no clumping even when spoon mixed.<br/><br/>Cons<br/><br/>1)  Acesulfame potassium is used as a sweetener.<br/>2)  The cookies and creme flavor doesn't quite taste OR smell right.  Try a different flavor.
 EXCELLENT!!!!This is awesome,The best part about the product that i recieved is that it is only a month old from the date of maufacture.
 Great protein powder with 25 grams of protein per serving. I like the taste of the mocha flavor.
 as usual quality whey at good price
 One of the best protein money can buy. It works absolutely amazing. I have seen results within a couple drinks of this protein. Great product I would recommend this to anyone who wants to get lean or big. Vanilla ice cream is not as sweet as French vanilla, but it does the job after an intense workout session.
 I absolutely loved this product.  I bought the strawberry and it taste really good.  I have tried other proteins and didnt taste as good.  It doesnt disolve completely with a spoon but its alot better than other products that I have previously tried.  Also noticed that I'm noticing that my workout routine is working.  Will keep on buying.
 Optimums whey is like my go to protein powder.  It was nice when it was just $30 a jug but even at $50+ its still worth it.  Excellent choice for gaining size and adding easy protein to your day.  5 start product
 One of the best whey protein in price/flavor, double chocolate ftw.
 My son-in-law recommended it.  It takes good, even though I only mix it with water.  It is low in fat and high in protein.  I drink it after I workout with my trained for a half and hour, then I do a half hour of cardio.  I think that it is much better than the Kroger Brand which I have also tried.
 ON Optimum Nutrition is one of the best product out there I recommend him highly
 The best whey protein for sure. Almost the entire scoop is protein, not a lot of carbo/fat that you do not want.
 I've tried my fair share of protein supplements, and ON's Gold Standard 100% Whey is the best by far.  Not only does it supply you with high quality protein, it mixes better, tastes better (I prefer chocolate), rinses easier, and has better value than any other protein shake I've tried to date.  A+ for quality and cost.
 Freeze your milk for an hour or two. Let it thaw in the fridge for 30-45 minutes.<br/>Mix well. Oh yes!
 Not much to say other than it actually taste like chocolate, unlike their vanilla and strawberry (yuck!).  I've been buying this brand and flavor for a couple of years now and have no intention of switching.  The price is the lowest I've found to date so I'll be buying again from this vendor when I need more.
 We are very pleased with the service from Amazon and the product we ordered  Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% whey  Vanilla Ice cream  is wonderful.  Very delicious and we drink it every day.  We would highly recommend this product to anyone.  We will order more when this product is gone<br/>  Karen and John Baum
 I recommend it because I am trying to lose weight (and succeeding). I've lost 20 lbs this month, but that's incorporating eating healthier (higher protein diet and organic food) and excersize. I drink one shake in the morning (I just mix it with 8 oz of skim milk), and one after weight training. It works for weight loss because it does not contain all of the fat, calories, and carbohydrates that other protein powders contain, e.g., Muscle Milk. Don't get me wrong Muscle Milk is good for those trying to bulk up, and pack on the muscle. This protein powder simply gives me the protein that I need to build/maintain muscle compostion which subsequently burns my body fat.
 It's expired but it tastes great. I don't know of that will change its performance
 The chocolate flavor is rich, and even has a creamy texture to it, even when you only use water.  Add a little MCT Oil and coconut milk to it and you have a cup of pure awesomeness.<br/><br/> ...]
 Mixes fairly easily like other whey proteins I have used.  I put in two scoops, put in a little bit of milk just to cover the mound of protein in the cup, mix, and fill up the rest of the cup with milk after mixing.  I got the double-chocolate flavor and it tastes just like chocolate milk when mixed with skim milk.
 This product is too sweet for my liking and it does not disolve as well as the vanilla flavored mixed.  This product is best mixed with milk vs. water to tame some of the sweetness.
 this stuff taste like crap, plain and simple. it certainly has a strange after taste...ill pass.
 Best tasting whey protein. I've ever bought in my life!
 I have tried everything and this is the product for me personally. I think it tastes better than any other one that I have tried. Perhaps taste is the biggest factor for me. Most of the ingredients and results are the same as other quality products but I have to drink it everyday. My best friend hates but I love it. Rich Chocolate please
 Expensive but worth the money.
 Mixes so well with a spoon. I don't like that it has sucralose but whatever.
 I have purchased ON whey protein for about six months now.  I have tried many flavors and love them all!  They mix well in the shaker and do not taste or feel gritty at all!  The best when mixed with milk, but if in a bind water isn't terrible.  I totally recommend this product!
 Good im buying again
 I'm 37 years old and have been working out on and off since I was 16. I started using this brand protein and started noticing erectile problems with my girl. As soon as I stopped it came back,  I don't know if it was because of the cholesterol or something else. This is just an information to others who use it.
 this stuff is great.  Im an actor/model in Chicago and working out and looking great is my life.  Working out 2 hours a day, i need the best protein out there and this stuff is not only that, it tastes better than all the rest.  I sprinkle some on my cereal in the morning it tastes so good.
 Delicious, mixes well, decent price. I have tried a handful of differnet kinds of protien and this was by far the best.
 Im a new into the field of body building and im starting off with the 100% whey double choco. Ive only had 2 or 3 shakes, because i just got the 10.37 lb bag yesterday. They taste GREAT. Literally tastes like a mc. donalds shake. (could be good or bad to somepeople, but definetely drinkable) The only problem i noticed, when coming back to this site is that it doesnt look like you can order 10 pounders of this anymore? Did I get the last one or what? Ill keep you updated every month or so on how its workin.
 This my preferred protien to use. It is the highest quality for the price
 Taste: 6.5/10<br/>Solubility: 10/10<br/><br/>The taste of the cake batter flavor was too fake, and not that great. Not horrible by any means, but not as good as something simple, such as vanilla, chocolate, or cookies n creme.<br/><br/>However, this protein mixed together better than any I've ever had. Even with just a spoon, it mixed easily. I've yet to have any clumps.
 Really good quality but the flavor isn't what I expected
 Just received my protein at my door today. Mocha Cappuccino was okay, 6/10. It wasn't the taste I expected. Kinda taste like water down milk chocolate.
 So far the best tasting protein shake my husband and I have ever used. I also like it because of the low sugar and carb count. Great when blended with black coffee!
 I have tried many different proteins but I always seem to come back to this one. It's not the fancies or top of the line since its not a iso but do you really need all that bulls*** with a clean diet and consistent workout schedule??
 This stuff mixes so easily that I have added it to yogurt, oatmeal, and even iced coffee.  Granted, that was usually the Vanilla flavor, but I'm sure you could get brave with the chocolate (or other flavors).  Less than $0.50 a serving if you sign up for the auto-renew is a great deal.
 This product has the best volume to price ratio I could find. It tastes great, and it really seems to help. I've been using it since about January, and my 1 rep max in benchpress has gone from 240lbs to 280lbs. The only problem is, it's a little hard to mix by hand. There are always little globby bits at the top no matter how long I mix it.
 Best taste and mixes easy
 Won't mention all the info others did. purchased for bulking.  Was easy and quick to stir in or used in quick smoothies (or alone in water--hey sometimes ya just hafta! when in a hurry).  Didn't add a lot of increased bulk but my strength gains did increase quickly.
 Definitely the best tasting chocolate protein I've ever purchased.  It mixes unbelievably well.  I'm planning to buy some other flavors to use with cereal, etc., but so far this is the only one I can speak for.  I reviewed several competing products and this one was cheapest at the time; it didn't disappoint!!
 This product does what it needs to. It tastes great and I have seen results over just normally working out. It could mix better, but does a decent job of it in water.
 i am very happy with the taste of the extreme milk chocolate powder. it taste just like hot cocoa mix either in water or milk. it is okay in water but much better with milk(creamier)it doesnt quite dissolve in water or milk as quickly as the tub says. that is my only complaint. i would have like to seen an airtight peel off seal under the lid instead of a plastic seal around the lid.
 I've bought several tubs of this protein and really enjoy it. I have NEVER had a protein powder that mixes this easily, which really makes a huge difference. The taste is awesome as well, maybe a tad on the sweet side, but that can be easily adjusted by adding a little more milk, water, etc.  I usually mix a scoop with oatmeal every morning. A great buy in my opinion.
 This whey protein has a good taste and max results
 I've been trying several differents products on the market, but only two products can give you a good balance between power, strenght, recovery: Creatine + Whey Protein. Vey good, i reccommend. However, i'm in my 4 pot and i need to try another flavor.
 Delicious protein shake. High protein and low carbs. Mixes well even with fruit.
 Low calories and low carbs. It is ideal for amateur body builders and semi pro. The flavor is good and one serving meets the requirements for post work out
 Great taste of sample here at the expo in vegas
 This is a pretty good protein and the company has been around for a very long time. It mixes pretty good in the blender, not sure about by hand. A little sweet n low goes a long way for that extra sweet taste and it has less fat than muscle milk. not bad at all.
 I have been using this protein powder for more than a year now.This is by far the best of all i have had. It easily dissolves in water and tastes very good. You can mix it with milk or some fruit and blend it to make a complete protein meal. Worth the price....Go for it.....
 It's sometimes hard to find what I am looking for in a small town, and driving to the city can get expensive with gas priced and all. I found the protein that I use, in the flavor that I like at an outstanding price. Shipping was fast, my whole experience was great.
 came was as expected. i like the product
 I love this stuff, the flavors are good and it doesnt upset my stomach as other products have.
 It is perfect to blend and tastes great. I have been using it for close to an year and love it.
 My husband and I have been using this brand for three years - primarily by adding it to our morning shakes. It is a little on the sweet side but it makes a nice additive to plain yogurt. Also, since I've been pregnant I've been adding to my non-fat milk and cereal to help regulate those hormone-related blood sugar spikes.
 I have used optimum 100% whey for a few years. It tastes pretty good and mixes easily and it does not contain milk products to upset my stomach. Amazon has supplied this product at a great price and is an excellent company to do business with.
 After trying the Nitro-Tech Hardcore, I am really glad that I found this product. It seems to have the same effect, but is by far richer in flavour and cheaper in price. Even my girlfriend, who didn't like Nitro-Teck at all, now takes a shake from time to time after her workout.
 Perfect as always. Price went up a bit, but I love the taste and it does its job well.
 I've been using this whey protein for almost two years and it's still the only protein shake I like to drink. All the others have terrible tastes or after-tastes. This is perfect for after work outs to get the required amount of protein your diet requires. As someone lifting weights again, it's really the gold standard every lifter should turn to.
 Vanilla creme best flavor. Not sure why their products have soy.
 I have tried a few different protein supplements and this one probably offers the best bang for your buck.  I use this stuff daily so I go through a lot of it. At first I was buying the 32 ounce containers of a different brand. I decided to try these because the price was less per ounce. I use the supplement with water in a shaker and this brand mixes really well.  It doesn't clump like some others I have tried.  It offers a good amount of protein, they almost all offer the same amount.  I wasn't too happy with the taste.  The artificial sweetener has a bit of an aftertaste. The only flavor I have tried so far is the cookies and cream.<br/><br/>Pros:  Low price.  Mixes well.<br/><br/>Cons:  Aftertaste.
 Tastes great, easy to make and well priced. I ordered 2 tubs and it wasn't delivered within the ETA time frame. I wrote to the seller multiple times with no response. Waited approx 2 weeks after ETA and finally received it. Be careful who you deal with.
 The Double Rich Chocolate has a great test and it is less sweet than some of the others we have tried.  It takes a little bit of effort to get it mixed thoroughly but that is similar to all products of this type.  Tastes like a milkshake with low fat milk added.
 I love this product. As a person who exercises regularly I have enjoyed the quick results with this product. This is a quick and easy way to get the protein needed to help the body heal after a workout. Very reasonable price!
 My protein fart smell has been downgraded to a meager 3 on the crop dust scale. Thanks Gold Standard for your commitment to a stinchless gym.
 Good stuff
 The nutritional value of this protein is great and the flavor of mocha cappuccino certainly didn't disappoint. Ill probably get this one again. I would recommend this to anyone.
 like that it has glutamine &amp; that it is all natural for the most part but....the rocky road is ok as far as flavor. nothing special, i will definitely try other flavors.
 I read reviews on how people didn't like the taste, to them I say get a life...what do you want? Build muscles or get fat eating candy? It does taste good, it could be better, but I didn't buy it for taste alone. Some people don't like brocolli either, but it is very good for you too. Bottom Line: it works, and it isn't all that bad tasting either.
 I just want make sure to give this whey what it deserves. 5 stars for taste, mix and price. I know it is not  cheap, but it is like to use super premium gas in your car. It just make things run at better performance.
 I have been overweight (150 lbs. overweight) most time of my life, and as a 24 yrs young woman, was hard to develop long lean muscles, but this product (plus my diet and exercises), is really helping me to make it through my goal.<br/>It doesn't taste like Nesquick, but is really great for smoothies, I prepare it with water to minimize the calorie intake, and it taste good.
 As good as possible
 I have tried several whey protein supplements, and On is the best.  I mix a shake each morning with a heaping measure of On Whey Protein powder. with about six ounces of 2% milk, a banana, and about four ice cubes.  Tastes great and I am good to go until at least 10:30 or 11:oo in the morning.
 This is a great whey protein product, but it doesn't have much flavor. If you want something that doesn't taste like much, then this is the product for you, but if you want something that can be an enjoyable drink everyday, then definitely get the chocolate flavor. I ordered the chocolate first and really liked it, but then I ordered the vanilla ice cream to try something different, and I don't really care for it. Chocolate was "whey" better!!!!
 Great source of protine and it surprisingly tastes good! This is not what I expected. I'm fine drinking it by itself or adding some to a smoothie. I really want to see what the other flavors are like.
 This is the second protein shake I've tried since I started working out. My first was GNC Pro Performance 100% Whey Protein. ON Gold Standard is a lot better in my opinion because of the taste and it is absorbed faster. I used this for about 2 months and noticed more lean muscle. I recommend double rich chocolate. The next protein I'm trying is Isopure Low Carb.
 I have been using this stuff regularly for about 10 months post workout &amp; for meal replacement to keep up protein intake. I read alot about mixing whey with coconut water &amp; that is how I have been taking it (blended with a couple ice cubes). If you like strawberry shakes this will be really easy for you to take, I do &amp; I actually look forward to the shake.

 Amazing product ! Love it
 Greatest protein of all time and company
 I bought the 2 smaller tube (2lbs) but decided that these were too light for me so i decide to buy two 5lbs tubs. Used it for a few months and didnt see any results. I continue to lift these two 5lb tubs of protein but my muscles are not getting any bigger. So i decided to stop lifting these protein tubs and started to go to the gym. So far im seeing results.
 Would recommend this to anyone.  Taste, ingredients, price and quality are top notch.  Great with water or 0%milk.  Mixes well with a spoon or shaker cup.
 Excellent!!!
 Yeah bro, this works! It does make you fart like a wounded buffalo but who cares? I'm down to 40% body fat and chatting with hotties on the Internet. Buy it!
 On 100% whey protein is one of the best supplements out there.  delicious and inexpensive, take this throughout the day to fit in more protein without tons of carbs or fat
 This is a high quality protein and is the best tasting vanilla flavored whey that I have ever tasted. I find that I can add different flavored extracts to it to change the flavor. I have tried numerous vanilla flavored proteins and this is by far the better tasting one of them all.
 Not bad, would try a different flavor next time than the double chocolate but good product overall
 Very good!
 This protein is very high-quality. It tastes great - like Muscle Milk, but with much less fat and few carbs. Also, it is packed with BCAA's and glutamine. I highly recommend this product.
 Definitely the standard in protein by which all other protein powders are measured.
 This product taste awesome^^.This Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard will give u everything that u need^^ .
 I just got the Double Rich chocolate and I am drinking it right now.  The flavor is fantastic.  It is much better than any other protein shakes I have had.  I will definitely buy this again and I can't wait to try the other flavors.
 This protein powder from Optimum Nutrition is one of the best I have used, the powder doesn't have a bad taste when mixed with skim milk or water. I found that this is one of the higher protein levels out of the different powders.
 good stuff
 Love this stuff. Good tasting.
 Best Protein on the market. Best flavor by far is Extreme milk Chocolate, trust I have tasted all the rest and Extreme Milk Chocolate beats them out! Even mixing it with just water is Delicious!
 awesome products love the taste
 Good as always, but not the best flavor out of all of them. Its decent with water, but great with milk. Delicious strawberry tastes better. I will probably try Rocky Mountain next time.
 The only way I could describe the taste is 'chalky'. It was tough to choke down the first few times, eventually it gets bearable- but it's not good. The Double Rich Chocolate is the worst tasting chocolate protein powder I've ever tried, I'm not sure why so many reviews say it's amazing.
 it was a great deal and a great product give it a try not the best taste but people do say "if it does not taste good its good for you" and i  feel like im geting  good results with this product fast recovery after my workout
 It's not a "got to have flavor" but it is ok. It doesn't have much coconut flavor. Taste very similar to double rich chocolate with a hint of coconut flavor.
 I've been a WHEY consumer for years now, and the "Optimal Nutrition" brand of WHEY products in my opinion has the best taste and disolves in milk/water the best.
 This stuff tastes alright, but unless you work out constantly, you'll gain weight too. Be sure to use fat free milk to really gain the benifit, i suggest Sunmilk to mix with. Aside from that, a weight lifter will really gain the benifit, and enjoy the great flavor. I also hear its good for nursing mothers.... check with your doctor.
 This is my first protein shake. I ordered the Strawberry Banana, with soy milk it tastes like real Strawberry Banana shake. I would recommend this product to any one looking for a great tasting Whey protein.
 Mixes fast, quick and easy with water.<br/><br/>Tastes great, add 1 splenda packet for even better taste!
 I think ON 100% Whey Gold Standard really hits the sweet spot for value/taste/formulation/mixability.  I am military and have to mix this with water and it mixes much easier than other protein I have tried with water.  I love the vanilla ice cream flavor but am not a fan of the double rich chocolate with water.  Some people have said it tastes good with milk and that may be true but with just water it has a odd flavor that isn't horrible but isn't very pleasant.  I would suggest trying a few 1 or 2lb tubs of different flavors and then going  for the value of a 5lb tub once you find what works for you.
 The chocolate is not my favorite, but it's still pretty good
 This a very good flavor!  Has a weird after-taste but after a couple weeks of use I couldn't tell it had a after-taste. I will buy this flavor again!
 We bought this for a recipe but wound up using it mostly to make shakes.  It tastes great and has the benefit of having only 5 grams of carbs per serving, which is great if you're on Atkins or South Beach.
 Best whey protein I've used so far. It mixes great with water. It really helped recover my muscles after a workout with almost no sore feeling.
 Awesome
 Love it! It mixes well, tastes great, and is an easy way to add more protein into your diet. Even my kids love the taste of this stuff!
 Delicious as fuuu
 This is my second bag. It came fast and in great condition. Tastes great and i've definitley seen results. Highly Recommended.I've been lifting hard for almost 3  years now and have tried a lot of different proteins and this is by far the best
 Great protein
 I have searched for this on other sites and find that you can get a lower price, but then the shipping fees are rediculous. This is the best price including the shipping.<br/><br/>As for the product, great flavor, disolves well. Just what I want.
 I received the product in perfect condition. I am grateful
 Amazing taste
 This is the best protein I have ever had. I dont eat meat and this is the best thing to boost my body as i do all kinds of sports and i also lift. It doesnt taste bad at all, you can definitely drink it without a chaser if you shake it long enough.
 Have used other Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey.  This does the job.  I've noticed considerable gains in lean muscle after use.  The only issue I have is how over-the-top sweet this is.  I prefer the Double Chocolate over the Vanilla
 This protein is a must have,it also tastes extremely good and dissolves really fast. I got the French Vanilla creme and i recommend that flavor.
 The French Vanilla flavoring is not very strong so it almost tastes like regular vanilla flavored protein. And since it's a limited edition product you get slightly less protein than with a permanent flavor (i.e. chocolate, vanilla, etc.)
 This is a very good product.  It tastes good (for a protein shake), and even though it's a lil' more prone to clumping than the Optimum Platinum HydroWhey, it's still an excellent value.
 Product just as expected, not my favorite flavor.. a little bland, but hey that's my preference, can always try something different next time ..<br/><br/>Would recommend it though
 This is a great tasting product for those looking for a protein shake. It has a great flavor and dissolves great. I would recommend it to anyone looking to add more protein to their diet for whatever reason.
 Works pretty good I enjoy it much trying to loose weight and this helps me to control my hunger would recommend
 I use it as a meal replacement when I am in a hurry.  It is the best tasting product of its kind.
 This is by far the best tasting whey protein out there. Too bad that it says "Limited Edition Flavor". They should also sell it in the 2 pound containers as this is difficult to store.
 THIS PRODUCT WORKS GREAT AT A GREAT PRICE, ONLY ONE PROBLEM ITS TO THICK. YOU HAVE TO USE THE BLENDER IN ORDER TO DRINK IT OR ELSE YOU END UP WITH CHUNKS AT THE BOTTOM OF YOUR CUP. OTHER THEN THAT I RECOMMEND IT.
 Great product. Very easy to mix it in water or Milk. Tastes great. No after taste. Very low sugar. I would strongly recommend it to vegetarians or athletes like me who could use some protein supplement.
 Hands down the best quality and value you can find. The delicious strawberry flavor tastes like a light strawberry shake, delicious.
 The product mixes well and tastes really good.  I'm very satisfied with the purchase and plan to try other flavors (I started with vanilla)  For those who are lactose intolerant, it does contain the lactase enzyme, but it could probably use a little bit more. I think the product mixes better than the Designer Whey product.
 Extreme milk chocolate is my favorite so far. Taste exceeds expectations given the nutritional content. Job well done optimal nutrition.
 Very good taste and mixes easy. This was my first whey protein and I love it! :)
 Stronger vanilla flavor than what I have used before.  But when blended with fruit and soy milk for a smoothie it is delecious. It also has more calories than other proteins I have used but I just use a little less.
 Doesnt get lumpy when I mix it with almond milk, great taste
 It's the best product I could find for the price.  I read a lot of reviews, some negative, about taste; but I have no problem with it.  I use a shaker cup with cold water for about 20 seconds and it tastes as good as any.
 Optimum has achieved a great tasting protein shake with probably the best ratios, excellent amount of proteins and low in carbs and calories. As a bodybuilder and nutritionist expert i recomend optimum whey protein.
 This is high quality protein that is more cost-effective than any other brand out there.  If you like to get more protein for your buck use optimum nutrition exclusively and buy on Amazon.
 This protein was by far the best I have ever taken!  I have taken several but this gave me the best recovery.  I strongly recommend it!
 Great taste. Good amino content improved recovery. I'm a long time buyer and will continue to do so in the future. Just don't up the price
 Delivered just as was described.
 It taste really good and I think you should try. Good brand and good product. I like it a lot. Try it!
 Good flavors, I've tried both the double chocolate and french vanilla and I liked them more than other brands. Recommended.
 This product tastes great and mixes well.  Only problem I have with it is it's lack of vitamins and minerals and it has too many artificial sweetners...something I try to avoid.
 This is a good product, I love the chocolate taste, I have to admit, I use a little more than suggested to give it an even stronger flavor, plus it blends pretty easy in my cheap blender.
 Still the best protein whey powder supplement there is! Much better than MP, MuscleTech, and Mutant whey!
 I like it. I like the Chocolate and the Vanilla. The strawberry SMELLED like strawberry but didn't TASTE like strawberry.
 I Will recomended
 All items were sent in a timely manner and everything is exactly what I expected. Thank you for including the tracking information as well.
 Amazing
 I bought the cake batter flavor. Its pretty good, but if your expecting it to taste amazing your wrong. It has a protein grainy taste like all others ive tried. But it mixes better than most other brands and is pretty low priced
 Other than a protein bar, this is the first protein product I have used.  It really has helped my recovery and overall feeling from a hard work out.  I will rebuy this when I run low.
 Second protein shake that I have tried. It taste good by itself but I prefer to blend it with milk, banana, oats, peanuts and raisins to enhance the taste.
 I have been using ON Whey from a long time. I find it easy to mix even with water. I am not fussy about the flavor although most people like the taste!
 This is a pretty good deal if you go with auto delivery.  The powder mixes ok with a spoon.
 In my opinion, the best protein in the market. Very cost effecive compared to other stores. I will buy again.
 Most of the instructors recommend this and I found it useful. This is the purest form and easily mixes with blood.
 I used to use Designer but switched to Gold Standard 100% Whey.<br/><br/>Gold Standard tastes great, mixed better,has more protine,and has more servings. What more could you ask for?<br/><br/> Thank you Optimum Nutrition for making a great protine.<br/><br/> Dan
 Recieved the bottle dented in several areas and the worst part is, there was no scoop in the bottle.. I went through the entire bottlle and it is NOT there!
 I've tried several proteins over the years but THIS IS THE BEST BANG FOR THE BUCK!!!<br/><br/>This is THE right way to add lean muscle. If you want to get big you need a quality powder - start here!
 I have tried a number of the whey drinks. Some are better than others, and some are just plane hard to get down. This one is not to bad. If you use milk, it's a little like the old "Instant Breakfast" drink.
 This is an excellent product. Not only does it get the job done, but the taste of it is outstanding! I love this and look to buy more once I'm finished!
 Tasty! I would buy it again
 Very good overall product.<br/><br/>Tastes pretty good with milk/oj/water. Sometimes it will clump which can get annoying. It is not too troublesome with a good stirring technique.
 Really satisfied with my purchase. The price deal was decent, the product arrived in no time, and the quality, so far, has been great. This is my 4th or maybe even 5th time shopping Optimal Nutrition products and I've never had any reason to feel disappointed.
 Very good product cheap price seeing great results after one month would recommend to anyone that works out tastes good also
 Whey is always the best. Good for recovery and good for muscle growth.
 First, I want to clarify that I did not buy this product at Amazon. The online store that I bought are manipulating the reviews and considering only the positive ones. Regarding to the product, it is OK that maybe I had more side effects than others, but what concerns me a lot is how such a wealth company could sell a bottle of whey protein for more than $30.00 without a sealed lid. It looks<br/>like they produce this in high amount with poor quality, just filling up bottles and bottles without much<br/>care. My guess is that my bottle is contaminated, because even if I have 1mg of this I will have<br/>intestine issues for 2 to 4 days.<br/>So, if you are intended to workout your intestines it will work wonderfully
 I am very satisfied with my purchase. ON's 100% Whey Gold Standard has worked great and is extremely efficient.  The item is exactly as described. Thank You
 Taste great. I use it mostly for smooties but I also add it to my yogurt.  I did a bit of comparison shopping and this was the best price around. Arrived on time.
 When they say gold standard, they are not kidding.  I have used this product for 5 years and it always delivers.  Superb
 I usually use ON's Double Chocolate in the same line.  I've been very satisfied with that product.  I don't know why, but I decided to try something different.  This is very different!  It is incredibly sweet.  As well the flavor is highly artificial.  I've basically just got this sitting around.  I don't think there is any chance that I will finish it.  So, time to go back to double chocolate.<br/><br/>This product is gross.
 as good as usual.
 Delicious with non fat milk, with water, not so much. But even with water it's not bad. Got it on sale for like $83. Great purchase.
 It's a very good, very good indeed.
 Very good protein.<br/><br/>Still being my favorite. Amazon still has a very competitive price.<br/><br/>They can work on trying to make it dissolve faster.
 I take this after a good workout. Get the chocolate flavor. It taste good with water but even better with milk.
 This whey protein has a very great taste, and it is very easy to mix with water. I like to have it everyday after I go for a run!
 You really can't beat this whey for the money. ON has the best flavors and great quality. It mixes well, is comparatively inexpensive, and I like my results. I'm no pro, but this whey gets the job done.
 This is the most delicious, clean protein you can get for the price!  I have used it for the past 4 years and absolutely love it!
 I used it  I don't recommend it , if you insist to eat protein get whey grass fed  powder from you local health store , preferably mix of calogen and whey law fat 30 grams per serving amazing health benefits and good for intestine. . GOD bless
 Vanilla doesn't taste all that bad. When you first open it up you'll have to dig for the scooper. Mine was all the way at the bottom lol.
 I have used many types of whey. This one is very pleasant to drink for meal supplements and it will make you grow if your working out and drinking it before and after your sessions.
 Great product double rich chocolate is the best $40 plus free shipping cannot beat the price and it tastes amazing Best Product out there in the market with great taste.
 I felt stronger once i drank these shakes for about a week. Also leaner, great product, probably better than those nitro-tech, and the other whey gnc products. Great buy, absolutely recommended!!!
 I was told about this product by a friend, and I found Amazon provided the best price. I am very happy with the protein, it tastes great and provides key nutrients for the body.
 Great seller, super fast shipping and well packaged. The whey works great, been using it for a few weeks and already seeing results. highly recommended.
 After 3 weeks using this product twice a week I got slight results. probably I could get better results if I follow the directions.<br/>Good protein!!
 This is the greatest why protein you can buy. Not only does the the Cookies and Cream taste great, but it also has easily digestable protein, and plenty of the essential amino acids. I can't believe that this product is so cheap, it is the best out there, and the cheapest on the market. BUY IT.
 This product has a wonderful soft creamy texture and flavor. I like it so much better than similiar products I have purchased from local health food and retail stores.
 I have tried many protien powders and this is by FAR the best tasting yet. I have the double rich chocolate and the vanilla ice cream flavors. The vanilla isnt that great though. The chocolate on the other hand.....by far the best. I use half a cup of water and half of milk, half cup of ice, and blend it for about 5 minutes to make it really thick. I found the longer you blend it and the thicker it gets the longer you will feel full. Its also really good if you add a banana too. It taste more like a dessert than a protien shake. Its delicious and I highly recommend it!!
 Wouldn't buy any other protein for my money. For the price, it's the best out there and easy to mix.
 This is a great product! I was able to gain 10lbs of muscle in one month with help from this product. It's cheap, taste great and the results are amazing.
 The problem with this, as with many protein powders, is the artificial sweeteners. Usually (but not always) you know that a food will have artificial sweeteners when it is called "diet" or "light". But this is not so with protein powder. People are generally using this product as a health regimen, and it seems rather counter-intuitive to ingest these after every workout, giving yourself, overall, a heavy dose of fake sugar (which is known to increase cravings for real sugar, and therefore increase appetite). Not to mention the (yes, under-researched, but NUMEROUS) anecdotal accounts of negative reactions to artificial sweeteners that have ceased when people have stopped consuming them. Bottom line: a health food should be healthy.
 The whey protein is nothing more than a rich protein source that disolves very fast in blood with less carbohydrate.<br/>Taste :Very delicious try (getting chocolate mint also)<br/>Effect: No bad effects<br/><br/>You have to sleep well and organize your protein intake to get the best result from this product.
 Good stuff
 Used to love this stuff, than they changed it. "New and improved" my ass. More like "Changed it for no reason and made it absolutely terrible". Would not recommend, 0/10, DO NOT BUY.
 Great amount for what i paid
 I've used a handful of whey products and keep coming back to this one.  Dissolves well and tastes good.  Value for your money.
 Dissolves well in water. Seems to be giving me the mass I need (using it to get a total of 1.5 grams protein/per gram of body weight). I got 5 lbs for about $50, great value.
 I have tried several protein supplements, and ON has been the best by far that i have tried. Worth the money. I recommend all of ON's supplements.
 This stuff is effective and well-priced. I've had better gains on it than I have with other products. The downside is that the vanilla tastes like chalk.
 Great.
 The protein is good and original but itdid take along time to arrive<br/>Ordered 23 nov<br/>Arrive 4 dec at 8pm
 I thought it was really strong at first and didn't mix that well. After a few times I got used to the taste. It still could use improvement on the creaminess and cookie taste. Makes me not as sore a couple days after my workouts though. I think it works well.
 It was a little expensive at the time of purchase and needs to be mixed well in milk to prevent clumps.  Otherwise, its a good product.
 THIS IS THE JAM SON
 I use this product after workouts and it seems to improve muscle mass and reduce soreness. It tasts great.
 They best lean 100% whey protein i've ever used.It's also very tasty with all the essential &amp; non essential aminoacids that it contains.
 Don't go by high ratings of this Product it's waste of your money, try other brand of Whey Protein. Skin allergy too on taking this product.
 I use this powder after my workouts. One of the best tasting whey protein powders out there. Amazon has very good price with free shipping.
 Does what it says. Tastes like chocolate, provides protein.  I highly recommend using milk over water.
 Fantastic
 This stuff is delicious even with just water! Haven't tried it in milk yet but I cant imagine it tasting better :D!!
 taste was good "chocolate" and overall lasted me about 3 months. does what it says as long as you actually workout properly. B+
 Is it safe while breast feeding?
 Great taste! great price! works as well as any other whey protein powder, but dissolves a lot better than most I have used in the past.
 Within 3 months every one stopped working and one completely fell apart. Started out great but I took perfect condition of these cords and they still go out even with no visible wear or over use.
 I really liked the strawberry taste. Would recommend it to others as well. Something diff from Usual Chocolate flavors
 I decided to snort this the other day and instantly grew muscles. This stuff is good enough to get the job done. States great and mixers well with milk or water.
 Ships fast. Nothing to complain about. Just good.<br/><br/>Enough qty for one person, 3 times per week work out for 2 month.
 This product is not grainy or gritty. It mixes well even without a blender! It tastes just like chocolate milk! I highly recommend!
 The Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Whey, Double Rich Chocolate is the best tasting and performing protein shake I have ever used.
 I liked the taste better. Not as good as Syntha-6 though. Just used it for month haven't seen any significant results.
 Me caveman. Me have spear. Me no have mammoth throw spear at. Me need protein, so me get Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey. Me like. Tastes better than mammoth liver.
 I have been using the protein mix for the past few years and I'm very satisfied with the taste of the product.
 arrived in time and in great condition except that it came with someone else's receipt but no problem with me
 Product itself is great but has no one noticed the increase in price from $50 to over $70 in the span of a couple months?  Unbelievable..I guess my days buying it at $50 are over.
 I bought the 5lb extreme milk chocolate. I think it's made from rat poison. Horrible taste. I tried the double rich chocolate, French vanilla, and strawberry. Those were okay, but still leave a subtle chemical after taste. I like the SportPharma chocolate much better.
 Taste great if you use milk and put the right amount in.  It doesn't taste as good with water though.
 This item worked for me. I am seeing great results. I will not buy any other type of protein except for this!
 As a picky eater, I must say this flavor protein is not bad at all. I use 2 scoops with just about 5oz of water in a shaker and it goes down fine.
 tastes bitter but there is no better product than this in market in terms of nutritional facts. GO FOR IT if taste doesnt bother you.
 I love the brand, Gold Standard is very good in all regards.  I've been exercising and taking protein shakes for many years and after all my research, I am very pleased with the brand.  Rocky Road is the best tasting protein shake I've ever had, but I thought I'd try something different and get the Chocolate Malt.  I can't bring myself to down it.  My wife tried it and couldn't stand it!!  Absolutely the worst tasting protein shake I have EVER had, period.  So much so I needed to post something on here!!!  Just an FYI, try it for yourself if you must.  ROCKY ROAD IS AWESOME.  CHOCOLATE MALT IS TERRIBLE.
 Alright
 This is an excellent protein supplement. It was a good price, tastes good, and doesn't give me gas like other powders!
 I loved the taste, but there's definitely more "cream" taste than cookies. Worth the money.
 great taste (preferred this over EAS chocolate) with 24 grams of protein. very satisfied with this product
 This product mixes much better than all other comparable products that I've tried. It also tastes pretty decent as well.
 Good!
 Just like the title said, quick delivery!  I expected my item to come in about 7 days becaus I live in California, but i received it after 4 days.  It also came in a good condition.
 I have only tried the Double Chocalate flavor but it taste really good. I drink mine with water and even then the taste is still better then some of the other chocalate flavored protein I have had.
 Tastes great, and it's good for a normal weight training person like me.
 This whey is the best amazon is the best has it at the lowest price. I drink this stuff 3 times per day. I will definitely buy again.
 Choclate taste to satiate your craving &amp; tastes great! Yumm - best product on the market.
 I am never disappointed by optimum nutrition products, and their protein is always a great buy at a great price.
 Both my husband and son like this product much better than others. It tastes so much better<br/>and has been effective in it's use in conjunction with their excersize program.
 I've used this protein powder for years now, so there were no surprises.  Tastes great, mixes well and great results.
 its reaky gr8 and cheap compare to its price in the market here and its well known brand. i recomend it
 It is been good for my health, I am a 75 years old and for the first time I feel strong. Alfonso
 Great! extreme milk choc, no After taste... the best one out of the whey I have tried.
 General<br/>I've tried a couple of whey protein brands in the past and this one is by far the best. It's the best price for quality in the market and ON really put in some effort to develop a quality product.<br/><br/>Cutting or bulking. Works excellent both ways.<br/>I started using this product in a cutting cycle Feb '11, after being off from working out seriously for about 1-2 years. This helped me drop from a 19% body-fat to a 6.5% (current) without losing any considerable muscle mass (my arms stayed at around 16' through the whole process). After I dropped to a low BFP I started a bulking cycle a couple of weeks ago to try and reach 17ish size in my arms, and then drop body-fat until I'm happy.<br/><br/>I'm telling you, either if it's bulking or cutting if you combine this product with a solid diet you're going to have awesome results.<br/><br/>Serving Size<br/>24gr of protein per serving is pretty good considering that the scoop is relatively small, which means that this product is highly concentrated (being a whey protein isolate).<br/><br/>Flavors<br/>So far I've tried (in both water and skim milk): double rich chocolate, french vanilla, vanilla ice cream, strawberry and cookies and cream. The big winner for me has to be cookies and cream, not to sweet not to stale, just perfect, takes like real ice-cream without that sugary feel. Second place are the vanillas which taste pretty much the same, with a very imperceptible flavor, you might want to try this one if you're planning to make shakes adding other stuff in (such as bananas, peanut butter, etc). Third place comes the chocolate, which tastes like dark chocolate (kind of a sour flavor) which some people love, but I'm not a big fan of. In last comes strawberry, this one tastes like pure sugar for me. It tasted a little better when mixing with milk, but I couldn't believe the label when it said it contained the same amount of sugar as the other flavors because it's just TOO sweet.<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/>I try to maintain protein intake at 1gr per lbs when cutting and 1.5-2gr per lbs when bulking, this is the perfect supplement to achieve those high protein levels. For me, this product constitutes approximately of 40-50% of my daily protein intake and I wouldn't change it for anything in the world.<br/><br/>Recommendation<br/>If you have a bigger budget you might want to consider ON's HydroBuilder for after training, and taking 100% Gold Standard Whey throughout the day.
 I've had to buy an entire new wardrobe due to how swole I've become after using this fabulous product.  However, this was marginal compared to the cost of rehabbing my house to expand doorways that my incredibly muscular bulk can no longer fit through.
 Item came to me in very good packet. Item itself id of very good quality. I m satisfied with it.
 Been using Optimum whey protein for years. Priced right, tastes good and mixes well with milk or water.
 I bought the vanilla Ice cream and it is very tasty, the best tasting whey I have ever bought. I will definitely buy it again from now on.
 For adding muscle to your body this stuff rocks. I've tried other Whey Protien, but none tastes better, nor do other brands include Glutamine (a key nutrient for muscle recovery).
 All-around a solid product. Gets me the protein I need at a decent price and a good taste. The banana cream gets old fast though, but that's my fault for picking it!
 I'm convinced this company has its own people put in false reviews on this product. It definitely does not mix easily without a blender or mixer, be prepared for 5mins of stirring and you'll still end up with lots of clumps. You also can not mix this in water as it tastes awful in anything more than 3 ounces of water and even then, pretty bad. If you put the normal 6-8ounces of water, it tastes like water with a tint of chocolate. Not a good taste..<br/><br/>With milk, the mixing is even worse with a spoon but at least the taste vastly improves and it tastes a lot closer to chocolate milk.. Sorry, I will not buy this product again. I am still searching for a good protein shake, Twinlabs has a good one that mixes well in water or milk, but I won't refer it since it will put into doubt my review. I thought this one was a better buy, value wise.. But taste and hassle wise, it's not.
 Excellent product! My son introduced me to this brand of whey and it tastes great as well.
 Just like Optimum Nutritions 5LB tub this 10.5lb bag is great... The strawberry flavor is so good I feel like I am cheating by drinking a strawberry milk shake.  I highly recommend this product.
 Very good source of protein for post workout shake! Great price and tastes pretty good.
 I had them all and this by far the best tasting one, I only hope they don't get rid of this flavor!
 I expected the product in a week but it came way before that. Thank you for the fast delivery.
 Been using this brand of protein for a year now and it works well! I personally think it's the best brand out there in terms of taste and price (especially here on Amazon.) But please, get the chocolate, you'll thank me.
 This flavor wasn't the best. Good mixability however. The best I've tried. Price is worth it. I highly recommend it.
 I found this product to be excellent. With a mixture of chipped ice and Almond milk it is a refreshing nutrional frostie for an afternoon snack.
 ON Rocky Road's sweetness was a little overpowering at first, but after you get used to it, it's a pretty nice chocolate flavor.
 Great source of protein, and not bad tasting. I mix it with fruit and my boyfriend, who is a "super hard gainer" mixes it with vanilla icecream for the added calories and loves it.
 Strawberry flavor ain't a good choice.. Chocolate flavor is a way better flavor in the same product..
 I love to work out!!! and this is the best tasting protein ever! The price is great too. No complaints here
 this thing has some high quality protein and it is also a lot bigger than it looks on the<br/>screen.
 I brought this product for a friend and as complained by him this chocolate was horrible, instead of helping him gain weight he lost around 14 pounds...not happy. I doubt product delivered was original as soon as he changed the protein powder he started gaining weight. Don't cheat people like this.
 One is first attracted to this product because of the cheaper price but what you get, unsurprisingly, is a cheaper product.<br/>If you don't mix it in a blender you are left with a clumpy mess. Mixing it with  anything but milk would be a horrible idea, mixing it with water is nearly impossible. I will never buy this product again and hate to throw it away but it is a grade D product with its only redeemable part of it being the taste is not half bad.
 I have only tried 4-5 different types of whey protein shakes, but the double chocolate flavor from Optimum tastes horrible.  Typically I don't have a problem drinking whey shakes with only water as a mixer.  The first time tasting this protein with only water - I literally had to chug the shake so that I didn't taste it and then run to the fridge to get a chaser to wash the horrible taste out of my mouth.<br/><br/>I assume that mixing it with milk will improve the taste some, but I highly doubt it will be improved enough so that I want to actually drink a shake after a workout.  In summary, while this might be a great deal on good protein, the taste is so bad that I am probably going to just throw out the 5lb container after only using one scoop....totally not worth the money.
 I took it the first couple of times with water and it tasted VERY bad...  So i then tried with milk and at first thought i would be able to drink it..  But after about the 2nd or 3rd time with milk I couldn't even stand the taste it actually made me start to feel sick to my stomach...<br/><br/>I now have a practically unused HUGE bottle of protein and I'll never use it again..
 this is my favorite protein by far, easy to mix, great taste, good BCAA's &amp; i couldn't ask for more .
 I ordered. The Rocky Road Flavor but the picture here yields 74 servings and when I got it. It said 72  serving. Can it be Fake protein? It mixes well although if you use more than 6 oz of water it can of taste like medicine. Help. Can it be Fake
 its good protein but i like Bauer Nutritions Whey protein a bit more. its a bit cheaper too..
 Hands down, this is the best Protein powder a person can invest in.<br/><br/>The Good:<br/><br/>-Minimal calories(120 calories per scoop)<br/><br/>-Very low carbs and sugars<br/><br/>-High quality protein.<br/><br/>-High amount of protein person serving(24 grams) Compare to others that only give you 20-22 grams per serving.<br/><br/>-Best tasting protein powder i've used. Tastes just like chocolate milk when using skim milk. Not grainy, chunky, and no bad aftertaste.<br/><br/>-Mixes easily and well.<br/><br/>-Great price for the quantity you get.<br/><br/>The Bad<br/><br/>-NOTHING!<br/><br/>This protein is recommended for people who do moderate workouts. For intense bodybuilding or mass gains, go with a different powder since this is low in calories.
 Simply awesome
 this is the best protein powder i have ever seen that's currently out on the market...
 New formula has sucralose! Super Gross! Also Soy Lecithin and artificial flavors. Hardly a healthy drink! I'll just eat cottage cheese.
 i just dont like its teast.and i ordered another one by accidently.it shows i ordered no march,but i got it on august,so i cant return it,made me so sad!!
 Heard very good things about this brand so I went and bought this expecting the best little did It tasted chalky and nasty! This is a joke!
 This is not acceptable. I purchased this whey because it was a good deal. I ordered it with my credit card, and have a receipt for my purchase. Why was this order cancelled? You cancel my order, and tell me to repurchase it for 3x the price I just paid for it. This is complete false advertising. I have had great experiences with amazon for the past few years, but this is unacceptable! Bait and switch tactics without any explanation.<br/><br/>It is a horrible business practice to lure people in with a good price, then attempt to force them to pay a greater price for the same product.<br/><br/>Your urgent attention to this matter would be appreciated.
 Contains Soy
 Stopped working within the first 2 months. Second battery charging stopped as well. Cheaply made.
 People often say in reviews of protein powders and other health and fitness dietary products that the product is delicious. I try it and am underwhelmed. The people who rave over protein powder are clearly unaquainted with good food (that's what comes of living on egg whites and skinless chicken breasts), or they're comparing it to some of the really horrible stuff out there. The best I can say about the flavor of any of these products is that it's uninteresting. So let me say that the flavor of this whey protein is uninteresting. It certainly isn't bad. It could certainly be made better by the addition of ice cream, but that sort of seems opposed to the spirit of drinking protein powder.<br/><br/>I'm sold on this stuff because it passes the kid test. My kids like it. Like most kids, they aren't into interesting flavors, and they aren't into eating the delicious and nourishing food we put in front of them every night. Also like most kids, they like chocolate. The double rich chocolate version is convincingly chocolatey to anyone who doesn't know better (like my kids). I put this powder in a Nestle's Quick can and tell them it's chocolate milk (note: I don't actually lie and say that it's Nestle's Quick, but my equivocation puts me on shakey moral ground and I'm sure I'll someday pay for it), and they're quite happy with it. I, alas, am something of a chocolate connoisseur and can't be so easily fooled as my kids, but still I find the flavor entirely okay. I suspect that when my children first taste real Nestle's Quick at a friend's house, they'll wonder what Dad's been feeding them and there will have to be some sort of a reckoning, but we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. In the meantime, they're getting a pretty decent protein supplement to make up for the meat and fish that they won't eat at dinner.<br/><br/>On the technical side, this powder stirs into milk fairly easily, though I find it works best if I make a thick paste by adding a little milk to the powder and then adding more milk. If you try stirring the powder into a glass of milk, you'll never get rid of the lumps. (I haven't tried mixing it with water and don't intend to - that sounds revolting - but if I were going to go that route, I'd put it in the blender with some ice-cubes, a banana, a little vanilla, and a shot of chocolate syrup.) (Okay, curiosity got the best of me; I just went in the kitchen and tried that recipe and it was sort of okay; I tried it again with some blackberries and it was actually almost good.) I can't say anything about the quality of this product relative to other protein powders (that would require a large scale study), and I have no basis on which to say that it's a worthwhile product for body builders or for people who are simply physically active. On the basis of no apparent malnutrition in my family, it seems to do no harm. Accepting the label for amino acid composition as accurate, it should be nutritious. On the basis of price and flavor, this is a solid product.
 First off, I've purchased a bunch of different flavors of ON Gold Standard Whey. All of them have close to the same nutritional value, but they vary greatly in taste. Both my wife and I drink these protein shakes as part of our daily diet, and as a product, Optimum Nutrition is great. I've mixed with both milk and water, and all of the shakes mix well and don't seem to clump. I've tried other manufactures whey, and I keep finding myself going back to ON for the price, nutritional value, and above all the taste.<br/><br/>So the flavor question. As I mentioned, each flavor has a different characteristic from the others. Some are bland, some taste sweet, some taste overly fake. We loved some, and we hated some. Below is a list based on what we like so far and why. Bear in mind that I hate diet drinks for their bad aftertaste. The drinks don't have to be sweet for me to like them, but I can't stand the garbage aftertaste of fake sweeteners.<br/><br/>The best flavors:<br/>Rocky Road - By far the single best tasting flavor. The downside is that it does taste a little sweet. The nutritional value is right on with the other flavors, but it is a bit sweet. I could drink this all day. If you only buy one flavor, this is it. There is no real aftertaste, and the flavor is great.<br/><br/>Extreme Milk Chocolate - Another good flavor with almost no aftertaste. This one tastes like chocolate, and doesn't have a fake taste to it. If you are looking at the chocolate flavors, this one is perfect.<br/><br/>Natural Vanilla - This is a slightly different product, and it comes in a tub with yellow labeling instead of the red. It's on Amazon for the same price, and it has the same nutritional values. They claim it has less artificial sweeteners in it, hence the natural label. In any case, this is the best vanilla out there. There is no aftertaste, and it tastes like vanilla milk. It is not as sweet as the others, but it the single best vanilla flavor I've found.<br/><br/>The middle of the road flavors:<br/>Cookies and Cream - This one is both good and bad. If you like the creamy vanilla taste, you will like the flavor. It doesn't have a bad aftertaste, but it is sort bland. It is sweet, but bland. Also, the cookie chunks in it don't dissolve. This is the only flavor so far that has bits of stuff that you are swallowing when you drink it. It's odd. That said, I have reordered it in the past.<br/><br/>Chocolate Malt - It's just OK. The flavor is a little odd because of the malt. Given the choice, just order the Extreme Milk Chocolate.<br/><br/>Caramel Toffee Fudge - Again, just OK. They tried too hit to many flavors with this one, and it just turned out odd. Not a bad flavor, but don't start out here. I got bored so I tried it. I doubt I'll order it again.<br/><br/>And the bad:<br/>Double Rich Chocolate - This flavor sucks. It tastes like fake chocolate. Not good fake chocolate, but generic fake chocolate. It has that bad aftertaste of fake sweetener, and is all around not good.<br/><br/>Vanilla Ice Cream - Another swing and a miss. This flavor tastes like bad fake powdered milk. It has that bad aftertaste, and is probably the single worst flavor they have. If you are looking for vanilla, avoid this at all costs and get the Natural Vanilla.<br/><br/>Tropical Punch - Another fake tasting flavor. When I got this, I could barely get through the first few shakes. Eventually it grew on me a little bit, and I was able to drink it without hating it. It tastes like strawberry milk with a bunch of fake sweetener. It's just wrong, and is not something you want to drink after a workout.<br/><br/>I know that taste varies from person to person, so take this with a grain of salt. I hate the taste of fake sweetener, so this list draws from that. I've taken to buying the 2lb tubs to try out a flavor, and then going with the 5lb tubs if I like it. It costs a bit more that way, but it means there is only 2lbs to choke down if you get a flavor that you hate.<br/><br/>Enjoy!
 well i was really excited to purchase this protein powder but after reading all of the reviews i will definitely NOT be buying until they change the formula back to the old one.
 5 Pound version is just a scam! you will pay 100$ for double amount (2 lbs is 27$). I don't know what they thought, but it is not a way to do business! An advice is always pay attention to the price and $/oz. If you want 5 lbs, I suggest to buy from here: <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/B000QSNYGI/dp/B000QSNYGI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">B000QSNYGI</a>
 I bought this thinking it was a good buy. Because i used to use it, and thought this because it get great reviews. But this specific whey protein has sucralose. If u look up dat ingredient, u will see ur body cant break dat down. Which means it turns it into fat. And whats worse, dat is used in splenda and all those artificial sweetners.  From history, i remember the doctors said, those types of artificial sweeters can cause ur body harm.  And not just because they said it, but also because its artificial.  Plain cane sugar does harm to u imagine dat other garbage.  So i will NEVER IN MY LIFE BUY THIS GARBAGE AGAIN!!!!!!!!
 i got stomach upset
 I've had this product many times before and I love the taste. This 5 pound bucket is just plain bad and I'm stuck with it.
 Container was open, seal had been tampered with and 1/3 of powder dumped out. I bought a NEW package of this whey protein, needless to say I was given a refund. Use caution!
 Could I have a free sample of it and I will do a review on it for you.
 i needed my two 5 lb tubs of protein and 3 days after i ordered they cancelled my order.  what kind of business entity renegs on a purchase agreement after i have already paid?  absolutely TERRIBLE!  unbelievable.  who are these people?  XcessSupply should change their moniker to XcessDissatisfaction!!!  if you are considering to order from this supplier i highly advise you to go with a different one.  not worth the hassle.  good night. i mean, come on!
 well does any body know a good healthy shake that will help you lose weight and build muscle but lose weight more ... i wanna try whey protein optimum gold standard 100% natural whey but im not finding the right reviews
 I did not buy this product directly from Amazon, but I figured I would review it anyway. Before I begin, however, I would suggest that if you are interested in testing out protein powders, that you visit your local Vitamin Shoppe. My biggest problem with protein powders is the fact that, while I am willing to use them, I do not want to spend $20+ on a huge tub of it... only to discover that it is disgusting. Thankfully, VS allowed me to purchase any powder, and if I did not like the product, I could exchange it for a store credit. Perhaps you can do the same at your local store.<br/><br/>As for the Double Rich Chocolate flavoring: it was enjoyable. I am a chocoholic, so discovering a protein powder that would allow me my chocolate fix without feeling guilty was a godsend.<br/><br/>My first taste attempt was mixing the powder with water. It was absolutely DISGUSTING. It tasted like water with the faintest hint of a chocolate flavor. Think of watered down hot chocolate that was never properly mixed and that is what ON's Double Rich Chocolate tastes like. Some people like it, but I definitely did not.<br/><br/>Next, I tried it with the no fat skim milk I have with my morning coffee. It tasted like a rich chocolate milk. I was happy, despite the fact that I wanted to avoid drinking 8oz of milk whenever I needed to have this.<br/><br/>I noticed that when I had this shake in the morning pre/during-workout (I'm doing P90X, so I would have a serving of this for workouts like Cardio X, Kenpo, and Plyometrics), it would give me that extra burst of energy I needed so I would not bonk halfway through. Why don't I eat breakfast first? I wake up at 6am to get my morning workout done before I leave for my morning commute to Manhattan, so I really have no time to eat a quick breakfast/digest it before working out.<br/><br/>As a month passed by, I incorporated the chocolate protein powder to certain "healthy" dessert recipes. It is great to cook with when you want more protein with a snack. My favorite with this is the protein pudding shot:<br/><br/>PROTEIN PUDDING SHOT<br/>1 package of no fat/no sugar instant Jello pudding mix (I like the cheesecake flavoring)<br/>2 scoops of Double Rich Chocolate protein powder<br/>1 cup of skim milk<br/>1 cup of water<br/><br/>Mix it all together and let set in the fridge. It will be somewhat liquidy and less pudding-consistency, but it's still good to dip fruits into.<br/><br/>In my second month, I started noticing that I was getting a bit sluggish while drinking this. The taste started to feel more artificial also, which is when I finally looked at the ingredients list. I knew that ON had a natural protein powder, but I wasn't concerned with this one because there was no aspartame (which makes me incredibly nauseous). While I do prefer avoiding artificial anything, it was initially no big deal to me that sucralose (Splenda) was used. Now, however, it is, which is why I immediately exchanged my Double Rich Chocolate for a 5lb tub of the Natural Vanilla Whey.<br/><br/>Almost immediately I noticed a difference in taste; the Vanilla was drinkable with water. While it was not the ideal drink by itself, adding a banana to it instantly transformed the vanilla from a 4-star taste into a 5-star taste. Then I added 2 teaspoons of PB2 and I was in heaven.<br/><br/>While the Double Rich Chocolate is good, I agree with other reviewers that it is not the best. There is definitely an artificial taste to it that I noticed more and more as time progressed. If you are concerned about artificial sweeteners, then I suggest you avoid the 100% Gold Standard and get the Natural version of it. The taste alone is exponentially better.
 No gift options. No purchase.
 Excellent stuff. I am using On's 100% whey since about a year now and I highly recommend this product. Esp, the double rich chololate tastes like heaven, easily mixes with milk/water and leaves no stomach bloating etc. This product on amazon is a bargain and you should not let go. Get the 10 pound box and save $30. This is great stuff, if you want to grow, get this ASAP.
 Did not receive the order even though tracking info said it was delivered to the front door.  Filed a claim with A to Z and was told that I will get a refund but it's been more than 10 days now and still no sign of a refund.  This has been a bad experience overall.
 Good afternoon, I request a review for this product. I paid on December 14. Was released and compensated on my card. I await my product urgently.
 I'm an average-skinny build 22 year old. I was looking to gain some muscle mass and build more all around body definition. Purchased the Double Rich Chocolate flavor about 6 months ago. I started to commit myself and seriously work out about 45 mins. every Other day. within 3 weeks I noticed more definition in my arms and in a little over a month and a half my stomach was getting more toned. Now after about 6 months, I'm starting to form what looks like a six pack. I'm amazed at how well this stuff works for me. I mix two scoops with 16 oz. of skim milk every morning and on workout days I have 1 serving with milk before my workout, and one after. My first 5lb. Tub lasted me about 3-4 months.<br/><br/>How can I complain.<br/><br/>The pros:<br/><br/>Taste: better with milk than water. try to find whey that tastes better than this. There is not much else out there.<br/><br/>Results: They were quick for me. But this was the fist time I used whey protein and stuck to a solid workout schedule.<br/><br/>Quality: Mixes easy. Low calorie, Low carb, Low fat. 24 whopping grams of protein per serving(that's a lot!)<br/><br/>The Cons:<br/><br/>Price: All Whey protein is expensive right now but It is still well worth the money.<br/><br/>so...all that being said, If your a skinny boy/girl trying to build some lean muscle or If you just want to turn some excess fat into muscle, try this stuff out. Get a routine going and it should help out.
 They canceled my order for no reason. This company doesn't care about the customer. They just want to make money. They suck. Don't buy from them or you'll regret it.
 Ordered two 5lbs tubs of Optimum Nutrition on Thursday, and I get an email from Amazon today how they canceled to order. Do not buy from them.
 Hate the taste. I think this is the worst product I have tasted - get a different one if you can
 The cookies and cream product used to be awesome. Ordered my first one couple of months back and it was the best protein flavor made by Optimum. The next one that came in had something horribly wrong with it. Smelled like crap, did not mix well in water and was nasty overall. Sent that back and Amazon sent us another one as a replacement. This one does not smell, but has the same mixing / color issue. Maybe Optimum had a bad batch or they have changed their formula. Pretty much sucks now.
 This product gave me an allergy, I felt like I was going to die or something, I get nightmares just thinking about it. It seems that 0.5% of the population is susceptible to soy allergies and I happen to be one of them. Anyway, this product is not completely whey like the company claims, in fact it has cheap soy added to it. If you will look at the allergen information, it says that soy lecithin is been added to improve mixability. I feel like I have been cheated, if I was living in the United States then I would have sued optimum for sure.<br/><br/>People get your facts straight, whey is imported into United States from Newzealand and Australia. If you check any Newzealand or Australian sites you will know that Whey isolate is very very expensive. It is impossible to sell 10 pounds of this stuff at $60(even if it was a mix of whey concentrate-a cheaper version of whey) If some of you consider suing Optimum, please remember me and send me check as well :-) Right now I don't take anything manufactured by so called "bodybuilding product" companies. Remember in 2005 another company Ultimate Nutrition was sued for Super Complete capsules by some Swimmer and had an out of court settlement for half a million dollars.
 the cookies and cream taste is horrible. I wish I could take it back .
 This was my fifth tub and I have been pleased with it until I learned of what is actually in it.  Along with almost all others, it contains arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury!!!  Why?  Is it made in China!?  Check it out online or in the July 2010 issue of Consumer Reports.  The powder with the least of these was Solgar.  That is what I will most likely be switching to.
 I tried a free sample of this flavor that was included in my order.  It was the most miserable experience of my life.
 It seems healthy untill you read on the ingredients list... ARTIFICIAL FLAVOR.... What the hell.!!!!  Artificial stuff is the cause of most Illnesses and diseases.... Healthy Foods dont come ARTIFICIALLY.!!!!  Try hemp protein that contains RAW ORGANIC HEMP.  Protein, Amino acids, Zinc, Magnesium.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  GO HEMP GO HEMP... NOT ARTIFICIAL STUFF... ATRIFICIAL KILLS.
 This is by far the worst protein ive ever had!!! Its taste is unbearable, it smells like cow poo, when you use it in a shaker cup it comes out clumpier than my poop after eating a pound of cottage cheese, makes you more bloated than a pregnant woman, and works worse than a old man with ED trying to get laid. Bottom line this stuff sucks. Dont waste your money! P.S. the only reason it got 1 star is because amazon doesnt let you give negative stars.
 This stuff tastes Great ( I've used both Double-Chocolate and Strawberry mixed in with Vanilla Yogurt or Milk ). My only complaint is that they are sweetened with artificial sweeteners ( Sucralose aka "Splenda" for Strawberry, Acesulfame Potassium aka "Sweet One" for Double-Rich-Chocolate ). Amazon does not mention this and it is not spelled out on the container itself ( only listed under ingredients with their chemical names). I'm concerned as there have been no long-term human studies conducted to determine the potential health effects of Splenda on humans. Until long-term human studies are conducted, no one will know for sure whether Splenda is really safe or unsafe for humans to eat. Unfortunately, used in a Protein powder, a person is likely to consume quite a bit of this stuff (3-4 servings a day for me). They have a Natural Whey product with no artificial sweeteners that I think I will switch to ( contains natural fructose instead ).
 this product has so many wrongs, that is so difficult to start to review it.<br/>do not take this if you want to keep living....<br/>I got so sick and swollen from taking it for 3 days only.<br/>I did some research on it and found out that it has ingredients that produce cancer... yess cancer!!!!<br/>and I also found out that the immediate effects of muscle growth is nothing more than the extreme excess amount of glutamine that just makes your body retain water.<br/>it is poor in taste (looks and tastes like dirty water)<br/>to put it in simple terms.......it is junk.<br/>don't waste your money here.
 I like this product. Let me first start by saying that I do not think this is "the BEST" protein product ever. However, I've tried many protein products and this comes rather close.<br/><br/>In my honest opinion, "the BEST" protein product out there would have to be "Profect" by Protica Research. It's actually the stuff used by gastric bypass patients. It's 25 grams of high-absorb protein in only 2.7 fluid oz that literally tastes like fruit candy. But, it's way too expensive and a two-months supply can set you back a couple of hundred bucks easily. Because of this, it's better suited strictly toward its medical purposes.<br/><br/>This product is also not the "most cost-effective". There are plenty of other whey products out there that are much much cheaper and have just as much protein content, but they all pretty much taste like doo doo. What's the point in torturing yourself to save a few bucks? Cost is definitely an important factor, but not the most important.<br/><br/>Apart from all of the hype and apart from all of the hate, I would say that I really do like this product. It tasted a bit gross with just plain water, but when I added it to a cup of enriched soymilk, I couldn't tell the difference between it and a regular kid's chocolate milk shake. That is amazing. And this product did mix pretty well. I usually have problems with that when it comes to powdered shakes and it's always great when you can get a shake that doesn't just sit on the bottom of the cup and cement while everything else just floats to the top. I even added a serving of Benefiber fiber supplement, and it still didn't clump up.<br/><br/>One problem that I have with this product is that it does use artificial sweeteners, but I'll let that slide for now, since I don't intake too many products with them anyway. Still, it is a cause for concern for those you who want to avoid such things in your diet entirely.<br/><br/>Overall, 4 of of 5 stars. I'm pleased but not impressed. This product is definitely one of the superior brands out there but most definitely not a "gold standard". A lot could be done to improve it.
 This is the best Protein powder you can get, no doubt and let me explain you why.<br/><br/>If you want a good tasting thing and that is your first priority then get one of those Wendy's or McDonalds's shakes. I mean, is that simple. Don't be so picky about the taste when you are consuming a Protein Shake. The industry has advanced a lot over the years and the powders get better and better with the time, so stop whining.<br/><br/>Now, if you still are into that taste and everything else comes second, then look for another product that has more saturated fat, more sugar, more simple carbs, less protein per scoop (less than the impressive  .79 oz of Protein per oz of powder, a whooping 79%) and that is not 100% whey.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I still think this powder tastes great, it's just not THE best taste out there (but who knows, maybe for you it is) but the benefits beat that. I have tried the double rich chocolate, the vanilla flavor, the strawberry flavor and the cookies and cream. They all taste good to me, especially if you know how to prepare them.<br/><br/>The amount of calories very slightly from flavor to flavor (no more than 10 calories per scoop) but let's take for example, the double rich chocolate.<br/><br/>1 scoop has 120 calories, 10 from fat, a minimum amount of carbs and 24 grams of Whey protein. In case you don't know, Whey protein is the most respected type of protein there is (with the white egg protein) since your body uses it entirely, unlike other types of protein that may become body fat if there's not enough physical activity.<br/><br/>The price is incredible too. Whether you are a weight lifter, body builder, somebody that wants to grow muscles or maybe somebody on a diet to eliminate that belly, you know how expensive food can be during the month. A Shake after workout there, a bar over there, whole wheat bread, fruits, etc. If spending extra money doesn't affect that's fine but if you sometimes have to take care of your personal budget then the price gives you another reason to choose 100% Whey.<br/><br/>I don't think there's a lot more to say here. This is the best selling powder and for good reasons.<br/><br/>And if you really need a good taste, then here are some recipes.<br/><br/>Prepare these in a blender, it's the best way.<br/><br/>1)Cut a banana in pieces and put them at the bottom.<br/><br/>2)Ice cubes, like 8-12 depending on the size.<br/><br/>3)2 scoops of double rich chocolate.<br/><br/>4)Milk. I prefer Soy Milk. It has some good fats and is better. 12 oz are more than ok.<br/><br/>Shake it until its ok. I'm not gonna confuse you saying "30 seconds" because some blenders do in 5 seconds what others do in like almost a minute.<br/><br/>Protein: 60-65 grams (almost 50 coming from the powder and more than 10 from the milk)<br/><br/>Calories: About 500 (The soy milk I drink has 100 calories per each 8oz glass, again look at the nutrition facts of your milk)<br/><br/>Calories from fat: About 60 (Half of them coming from good fats due to the soy milk).<br/><br/>Instead of the banana you can try rasberries too.<br/><br/>The cookies and cream recipe works the same as the chocolate recipe, plus the calories are the same. If you want a good strawberry shake do the same thing replacing the bananas with strawberries. Like 10 strawberries will be fine. It will have less calories since strawberries have less calories than the banana. Make sure the fruit is at the bottom, then you put the ice and after that you put the protein and the milk is at the end.<br/><br/>Enjoy.
 After reading some of the recent reviews... Didn't realize the product has been reformulated.  This would explain why I thought my product had been tampered with and replaced with random filler.  That's how noticeable it is.<br/><br/>The taste is sooooooo disgusting!!!!!  What the heck ON?  It's horrible!<br/><br/>Like the other reviews have said this was a staple product of mines for years every month, as well and the product I recommended to others.  However now I will discontinue buying and steer others away.<br/><br/>I am highly disapointed.<br/><br/>People reading this, I suggest giving dynamite protein a try.
 This new formula is crap!!! Seriously????? seriously??? I'm returning this!!!! it used to be so thick now it looks like spit water, taste crappy, thin like i didnt put enough powder in it, why would you do this??
 Looked at the featured image for the flavor I purchased - which featured Aminogen™ which is frankly the only reason I went with ON Whey.  Package arrived and it does not include Aminogen in the ingredients.  I feel ripped off and I am not happy about it.  Horrible decision Optimum Nutrition - update your pictures to show what the ingredients actually are.
 This is my second bag. I used to drink chocolate Shakeol....but I cant afford it anymore. Lucky me, I tried this one the first time and I love it. Is not as sweet as Shakeol...but is a very good substitute. I use the same shake recipe, Almond milk, PB powder, coconut flavor and 10 raw almonds and VOILA!!! Delicious shake no after taste at all. I recommend it 100%. I have lost over 90 pounds replacing a meal. I use it as a meal replacement mostly at dinner time. You can add some chia seeds of flax seeds to get you a more fullness effect.
 I guess I’m a little confused. The photos with the product description (Vanilla Ice Cream flavor) include one picture of an ingredients list. This ingredients list for Vanilla Ice Cream do NOT list sucralose (like some of the other flavors do) so this is why I bought Vanilla Ice Cream. Box just came to my door 5 minutes ago and I look at the ingredients list and it says sucralose. I have adverse digestive reactions to sucralose (as do many other people- it messes with your gut bacteria). Come on.
 As background for myself and why I bough this powder; I am a collegiate distance runner, so I am mostly looking for muscle replenishment rather than bulk (although with track coming up, a little weight gain does improve shorter race times). I bought this powder because it's 100% whey, banned-substance tested, and it has a good rep. Here's why it gets all 5 stars-<br/><br/>Taste: it's great. The vanilla ice cream mixed with just milk REALLY taste like a milkshake. It's amazing without all the extra added sugars. Keep in mind though I recommend mixing this in with a fruit smoothie, for the carb replishment and also some extra nutrients. If for some reason you're picky and you don't like the taste of fruit, this flavor is actually so good that it makes it taste like a strawberry milkshake (if you use some strawberries).<br/>Recovery: before this powder I occasionally took muscle milk. I thought it was normal to just be sore and tight for hours or even days after a tough long workout. But after taking this stuff, I don't feel that extreme soreness or tightness anymore. Don't get me wrong, you WILL still feel sore, but it definitely lowers the intensity. I feel stronger than my soreness in a way, whereas before my muscles would slow me down.<br/><br/>Overall this powder is very versatile and simple and should be in everybody's supplement box. Anyone can use it, it's high quality and it works!
 I'm on my second 5 lb. jug of this. I really loved it and used it daily, but after using the second jug for a few weeks I suddenly started getting chronic stomach pain almost immediately after consumption. It felt like I was going to have diarrhea but nothing would happen. The pain lasts about two hours before settling each time. I was using this for smoothies and tried a few more times by eliminating ingredients to be sure this was it. Eventually I just had this with almond milk with the same effect. So unfortunate.
 I started getting serious about fitness last year, and decided that it was time I tried protein supplements. I have no previous knowledge of protein supplements or workout supplements. I only knew of Optimum Nutrition from my male friends who are avid gym goers. I started with the 2lb of chocolate mint, and was pleasantly surprised at how good the flavor is! The protein mixed easily in almond milk and/or water and didn’t make my stomach bloat or irritate my already sensitive digestive system. It has less cholesterol (13%) compared to some other brands, and has 24g of protein per serving. I’ve also tried the Bodylogix Vanilla Bean protein<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Bodylogix-Natural-Grass-Fed-Whey-Protein-Powder-Natural-Vanilla-Bean-1-85-Pound/dp/B00B8918MG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Bodylogix Natural Grass-Fed Whey Protein Powder, Natural Vanilla Bean, 1.85 Pound</a>, but could not get over how bitter it is, not to mention how horribly gassy it made me. Protein World’s Slender Blend tastes great, but it’s ridiculously overpriced for how often I consume a protein shake. After trying those two brands, I decided that Optimum Nutrition is the one for me. I ended up repurchasing the chocolate mint in the 5lb size. I found that Optimum Nutrition is the best value protein I can get, and is perfect for someone who is just getting into fitness.
 I have been a fan of gold standard whey protein for many years and this would have gotten a 5 star rating if it had not been for the amount received. Not really paying attention and never having had this problem before, I didn't realize this jug was short till I received another jug and noticed a huge discrepancy in the weight between the two. The last jug of vanilla was close to 5 -/+. Taking into consideration the amount I had used out of it, this jug of chocolate was closer to 3 or less. If you have the means, weigh your product when you get it!!!
 After countless great reviews, I ordered chocolate expecting it to be as delicious as all those posts said..... not!  Taste is barely there. The consistency is runny. I don't like those thick smoothie types either but this was just too dull tasting to even swallow the thinness of the shake. Yeap, all those puns intended 😘  I added an extra spoonful to it but still didn't do a thing to improve it.  To finish this bag (and never order again), I'm adding another brand to bring up the flavor and thickness.  Sorry folks but this totally sucked.
 I've been used ON Whey for years. I have switched to a couple others because they were on sale and I'm always disappointed. I can't stand chunks, even little in my shakes. This is the only protein I've found that mixes easily and taste is top notch in essentially any flavor you choose. My go-to is strawberry banana. Other proteins are heavier and thicker. Makes sense as ON is lower in carbs and calories than most. I'm stingy on buying supplements but will pay the $60 for a 5 lb jug of this every time. I'm done saving money to suffer through inferior products.
 I just realized that having two to three shakes a day with this, and or using it as pancake mix once or twice a week, this 5 lbs. contanier is lasting me almost three months. The vanilla flavor is great because it mixes well with other flavors when making shakes or using it instead of flour for baking. I'm not a fan of vanilla flavor by itself, and that's why I prefer the chocolate flavor, however chocolate doesn't always mix well with other flavors, so I guess it's to each his own. Gold Standard, along with one other whey brand, is by far one of the best protein supplements I've found. There are no unnecessary ingredient additive, it's light in your system, and mixes well with water or anything else. I'd suggest it to anyone.
 I love love love this flavor! Rocky road rocks! nice and creamy, especially with almond milk. Reminds me of graham crackers/smores...<br/>Mixes well and leaves me craving another one of these shakes!<br/>I would definitely recommend this flavor!<br/>I have also tried their vanilla and 'chocolate shake': vanilla is delicious as expected, chocolate shake also tastes as expected, not super strong or rich, but tastes like chocolate milk.<br/>I will definitely be buying this brand again, I wanted to try cake batter but other reviewers stated it was too sweet, I enjoy more of a creamy, savory shake.<br/>Enjoy!
 I have been working on a 5 lbs canister of French Vanilla Creme (which was delicious, by the way), and I realized I was almost out. I decided to go with a different flavor, and since I am risk-adverse when it comes to something I will have to drink every day for a long time, I read reviews and ended up with the top seller, Double Rich Chocolate. I cracked it open the second it arrived, and thankfully, I like it just as much as I liked French Vanilla Creme. I like this protein powder because it allows me to get a ton of protein with relatively few calories. Recommended!
 I've purchased ON Gold Standard Whey for years (different flavors), and I've been very satisfied with it. I keep reading that they've changed the formula, and with this Cake Batter flavor, it's incredibly apparent. The taste is one thing, especially the aftertaste, but the bigger problem is the fact that it foams up a ton. Drinking it feels like drinking flavored foam. I'm extremely dissatisfied, and will be looking for a different protein.
 I've been a regular customer of Optimum Nutrition powders for years. I've bought at least a dozen bags/tubs of their product (spread between Gold Standard, Pro Gainer, and Serious Mass). The first time I got Gold Standard 3+ years ago, it was great. It mixed easily, tasted great, and was a great price. No surprise that it was consistently rated the top powder to buy on Amazon.<br/><br/>However, every subsequent year I bought Gold Standard, it tasted a bit... funkier. More artificial, more chemical-y. And my most recent purchase will unfortunately have to be last. It tastes nothing like it did before, and now even has trouble mixing in milk, something that was never a problem before. Optimum Nutrition has been gradually cutting costs and corners for years now, and people have been warning about it in this reviews section long before I have. I have to agree with them now, and will be moving on to a new brand. If you're going to buy 5lbs of something, might as well enjoy it.
 Out of all of the flavors, Double Rich Chocolate is the only one that does not contain sucralose.  ON has the ingredient list for each flavor on their website to confirm.  Hopefully they continue to have at least one offering without that stuff.<br/><br/>Excellent protein powder.  Just be particular about the flavor you choose to avoid sucralose.
 A lot of protein for the money.  I've been doing a VERY LOW calorie, high protein, low-to-no carb diet to drop some much needed weight(20lbs in the past 4wks).  Protein shakes are a must for the low calorie limit I'm restricted to in order to meet my macronutrient ratio and still stay under my caloric limit.  Artificial sweeteners are a little tough to get used to if you don't normally eat them, but you get used to them quickly.  Overall, a great deal for the amount of powder you get and so many flavors to choose from.  Will definitely be ordering again.
 I was using his formula for a whole and then eventually switched to another brand after this one started getting bad reviews due to a change of ingredients.  The first one I switched to was the Muscle Pharm Combat whey.  To put it simply, it was disgusting.  So overly sweet that it was always difficult to finish. Then I switched to a plant based one.  I forget the name but it would always upset my stomach.  Finally I gave up and figured I'd try this one again.<br/><br/>Well, I don't know what people are complaining about. It tastes fine.  Slightly less sweet than before I think? But mostly the same.
 Dude. Whey protein has come a LONG way. Back in the early 2000s, this stuff used to taste absolutely terrible and most of it was just cake batter with no actual protein. I bought the vanilla because we used to just down it as fast as we could back in the day.<br/><br/>This stuff actually taste GOOD. It's ridiculous. I simply mix it with water, take a couple glutamine with it, and I casually drink it. I haven't seen the protein reports on this specifically, but it seems to be having some effect. Would love to see a laboratory breakdown on it.
 I have been using the double chocolate for years and I decided to branch out and buy the "Delicious Strawberry". MISTAKE!<br/>As other reviewers have mentioned they have added sucralose in the powder now, it literally smells like the powder at the bottom of a bag of cap'n crunch berries! ITS THAT SWEET! It tastes bad, so bad! ... *sigh, now I have 5 lbs of this stuff to find meaning for. Anyways, DONT BUY THIS!
 One of the best whey protein powders out there.  I use it after each workout or in a morning smoothie.  Tastes very good and mixes well.
 It tastes good and doesn't upset my stomach like other powders. Not too sweet and light flavor. It mixes really well. Almost instantly in a blender bottle. I can tell it's a superior product. You get 72 servings (one scoop) with this. Seems like it will last a while. I'll have to wait and see if I get results but so far it's worth the money. Also to those complaining their protein is half full, the product is sold by weight not by volume. Says it right on the tub.
 I don't ordinarily buy ON protein because they aren't the cheapest option but I decided to make an exception because they offer a lot more unique flavors. With a name like "Banana Cream", I expected this to taste like a real banana milkshake. I was awfully disappointed when I tried it for the first time and realized that it tasted exactly like a banana laffy taffy or one of those cheap banana popsicles. I try mixing it with vanilla protein to mask the taste but it's still almost impossible to choke it down. I even looked into returning it because I didn't think I could finish it, but Optimum Nutrition only honors their guarantee if you buy directly from their store. Thanks for nothing...
 I wanted to wait to review this product until I could try a couple varieties so I could make my recommendations accordingly.<br/><br/>So far I have had Rocky Road, Banana Cream and Strawberry Banana.  The flavors work depending on what you are going for.  I was excited to switch to strawberry banana, but this one dissolves a tad slower than the rest.  The flavor oft the Strawberry Banana formula is only something I enjoy when it is mixed with milk.  I thought my order on that one was wrong because it looked just like the Banana Cream powder but when I smelled it you get that rich Strawberry Banana Flavor..  Banana Cream works very well with Milk or Water.  Rocky Road I never tried with milk, but it was always too sweet.  I love sweet but I will never do Rocky Road again, but that is what I get for trust the review of a flavor I am just ok with.<br/><br/>I am considering going Chocolate Mint, French Vanilla or back to Banana Crème next time.  The Cinnamon Graham looks interesting but is only in the smaller size.
 Just got my order from a couple of days ago and it does NOT have sucralose.<br/>It is same ingredient list as was on the Amazon product page from a few days ago when I ordered it.<br/>Manufacture date on bottom is 9/17<br/>...later I will plan to look in my shed for any old cans and see if ingredients are same as current.
 I chose this product because I was trying to avoid various additives to protein. Naked protein is probably way better but the cost is coming to affect. I do like the flavor of this and I do appreciate it some mixability it's not grainy. We're almost done using it since my purse is my son and I both use it. I use it as a quick smoothie in the morning I haven't been Working out consistently my son however has been and seems to like it. I'm going to try another brand and compare it against this one. Good product would purchase again I just like less additives
 For me, by far, the best protein shake I have tested in my life. Let me tell you I have been working out for about 10 years now, previously only at the gym, now gym + CrossFit and this product has given me the strength I need to keep my muscles supporting the big stress. Amazing product and let me tell you that the flavor is super good. Actually, this is my best food of the day compared with all the fish and veggies I eat during the day ;)
 This Whey Protein is not the best tasting, least expensive or most nutritious, but it is the best balance I have found yet of those three things.  The taste is good, its price per scoop is good and its nutrition is good.  You can find some that taste better.  You can find some that are less expensive (and way more expensive too).  You can find some that are more nutritious.  This is the only one I have found though that was acceptable in all three areas in one product.  I should also add that the only flavor I have ever tried is double rich chocolate because most of the time other flavors taste absolutely dreadful and I wasn't willing to risk having a 5 pound tub something that tasted like chalk dust vanilla or dried pepto bismal strawberry just so I could experiment.  The double rich chocolate taste is not overwhelming and is not full of too many artificial flavorings (it does have some, but not even close to most I have tried), it mixes well with water and milk, but my favorite is unsweetened almond milk.  It also works well in many recipes as a cocoa or chocolate substitute and as a protein kick in various foods such as steel cut oats with some almonds or walnuts.  Its taste is not overpowering like many I have tried and that makes it very useful for things other than the standard shaker bottle post workout protein shot.<br/><br/>If I had to complain about anything it would be that ON doesn't seem to offer proof of quality regarding the ingredients and nutrition stats.  I am not saying they are being deceptive or I have any reason to doubt that there is really and truly 24 grams of protein per scoop with only 1 gram of sugar and 4 carbs or that there is anything I would normally shun, buy why not be up front and in everyone's face about that?  Most of the people who order and use this kind of stuff (especially a 5 lb tub of it!) are picky about precisely what they are paying for and ingesting.  If we didn't care then we wouldn't be on the internet scouring websites for statistics about various products and ingredients.  Anyway, enough ranting because this minor gripe is not enough to keep me from continuing to buy it and it is by far my favorite of all I have tried so far, but if it was my company I would have postings of proof of quality and tolerances everywhere I could stick them just so nobody could doubt it and I could justify charging a little more than some others.<br/><br/>Its the best total package I have been able to find so far anywhere.  You can get better nutrition and taste, but you have to pay a lot more to get it.
 I've been using this product, specifically the Double Rich Chocolate variety, for a year and a half now.  I had tried numerous other brands and flavors and could never find one that didn't taste chalky or have a gritty feel to it. This product has been consistently smooth, mixing into my shaker cup completely every time, and have a great flavor that doesn't leave a funny taste in your mouth afterward. In conjunction with exercise and a clean diet, I've had 1-2 shakes per day consistently for a year and have lost 20 pounds. During that time I was focused on cardio with some light weightlifting to maintain my muscle, and manage to gain a few pounds of muscle while most of what I lost was fat. Note: this took a year and a half, not exactly the fast way. I credit a lot of this to getting a good protein source I can count on in a flavor that has never gotten old to me. I've turned several friends onto this whey for its quality protein and low calorie count which is perfect for those trying to lose weight but not lose muscle. I can't recommend this shake highly enough. It's a staple of my daily routine.
 I got the banana cream flavor.  The consistency was good but I thought it tasted a little like chemical.  I even added other fruits in with my smoothy and it still had that after taste.  Didn't taste natural.  Gave the whole thing to a co-worker and she liked it.  Everyone's taste are a little different.
 I purchased the Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard, Extreme Milk Chocolate, 5 Pound for a nutritional supplement, meal replacement. I have on and off used the product to supplement breakfast.<br/><br/>== What I liked ==<br/>- The taste is the best. If it tasted bad no matter the cost I would review poorly. This really taste like chocholate. It is really good without a chemical or fake chocolate/protein bar taste.<br/>- The power mixes easily compared to other brands with minimal clumps but still requires its fair share of mixing. I recommend a shaker bottle.<br/>- Low price/pound is excellent.<br/>- Excellent balance of core amino acids<br/>- Sturdy storage container with screw lid that is easy to open.<br/><br/>== What I did not like==<br/>- Nothing<br/><br/>== Overall ==<br/>There are many protein shake brands out there. I have tried over 4 and I think this one has the truest taste and excellent cost/pound/protein ratios. Would highly recommend.
 Best ever! I have tried every protein since I was a teenager. I've had to use protein because I was on growth hormones as a teenager. Every one I tried I hated because it was always clumpy and tasted bad. No matter what I did. I didn't buy protein so that I could mix it with fruit to be able to use it. This one is good but choose the taste best for you. Don't realise on others tastes. No clumps with only water with this one and tastes good enough to enjoy. I now use it because I have been diagnosed with ADHD and the meds work better with protein in my diet along with working out daily. Hope this helps.
 For a long time we purchased Designer Whey but after changing to this about 2 months ago, we have not looked back.  We get the 5 lbs tub which costs about the same per serving.  But, it tastes better, mixes easier, and produces better results.  My son is an active off road biker and does calisthenics, my wife does yoga, Pilates, and other home cardio routines, and I go to the gym for weight training, and we all take this.  It is wonderful after a workout or as a snack (you might be a tad bit sleepy for a short while if you have a boring office job and take it as a snack since it absorbs so quickly).  But, if you want something for before going to bed, please get the Optimum Nutrition Casein Protein as it releases over a 7 hour period while you sleep (feed your body as it rebuilds while you sleep).
 This review is for the 5 pound Extreme Milk Chocolate.<br/>I see a lot of negative reviews talking about them changing the formula. Most of them are about a year old but they're the top reviews so I thought I'd address them. I've only been using this product for a few months but here's what I've noticed. First off, I enjoy the taste. Enough that I bought a second 5 pound container after finishing the first; no complaints with the second container either. Secondly, all the complaints seem to mention the addition of sucralose among other things like salt and acesulfame. I can't speak for how it was made before but after looking at many different protein powder ingredient lists I saw salt, acesulfame, and sucralose at the end of all of them. Maybe this wasn't the case over a year ago but it seems to be the norm now. If anyone can recommend a protein powder without these ingredients I'd be happy to try it. Regardless, I really like this protein powder and I would be likely to recommend it to a friend. As a side note, I would recommend sticking to more "normal" flavors in general when it comes to protein powders if you're worried about taste. In other words, don't order a powder flavored "birthday cake" and expect it to not taste artificial. I'll be trying a few other protein powders after I finish my current tub just so I have more to compare to but I wouldn't be surprised if I end up coming back to this one.
 Double rich chocolate? more like double bland chocolate. this new formula ia definitely the worst tasting protein shake ive ever had. Its drinkable but definitely does not have the satisfying chocolate protein shake taste im looking for.<br/><br/>If you insist on trying this, dont make the mistake of buying 5 lbs like i did. get a 1 lb to try.
 A really great price point per pound of protein. Anyone who works out or is into supplementing their diet with powdered protein knows how ridiculously expensive it is for a 1 month supply of protein. These guy have up to 10 pounds, ya that's right, 10 pounds of very well priced protein with about 15 different flavors. As for flavor, its great. Ive been getting chocolate coconut because Im frankly addicted to the flavor. Add a little coffee in it and you've got the best mocha around.<br/><br/>The ingredients are minimal, which I like. Yes its not the most organic protein with the least ingredients, but these guys do a good job on keeping the ingredients low and the price low. Hard to find, but not anymore
 I have been chowing down on this protein for a few years now and have no complaints about any of the flavors or potency of the product.  My favorites are pretty much any of the chocolates.  I have been known to take shots of this powder when im in a hurry.  So why 4 stars? product is good and the makers know it's good, but do they have to charge so much for it?  I've been buying cheap Walmart brand protein for a few months now and although it tastes awful I'm not shelling out a couple hundred bucks a month on something that may or may not be better or more pure.  Just remember In the end most of this comes out your end.  Happy lifting!
 Buyer beware, this product contains sucralose even though ingredients photo doesn't list it as an ingredient. I can't stand the taste or smell of sucralose and would not have purchased if the ingredients list were accurate.
 Note:  I highly recommend this product overall in terms of quality of protein, value, and ease of mix.<br/><br/>Taste:  I expected a stronger mint taste. TBH, this to me tastes like a somewhat weak chocolate flavor with only a very slight hint of mint.  Maybe I unrealistically expected a "thin mint" flavor, but that is not what you get with this.<br/><br/>Conclusion: All in all, the flavor is not bad and ON still has a winner of a product here. However, this is not my favorite flavor that I have tried.  I still prefer the plain chocolate flavors.
 So I've tried the Rocky Road and the Double Rich Chocolate now. The value as far as $/gram of protein seems pretty solid. The Rocky Road was a bit too sweet for my taste, and the Double Chocolate has a bit of a chemical/synthetic flavor to me that I don't like. Anyway, that's my opinion on it. I would like a nice chocolate flavor that's not über sweet, but this hasn't quite hit it for me. 5 lbs is also quite a large quantity to be not exactly loving for awhile. It would be nice if all reviewers mention the flavor they purchased and their thoughts on its palatability.
 I mix this with other supplements. Good taste, fast dissolving, no grainy bits. I always place some of my powder on my tongue with nothing else just to see how it tastes and dissolves. This is a winner. Tempted to try something cheaper, but overall this is a great product. Cookies n' Cream a great flavor, mix in a blender plain, water or sometimes milk, sometimes add a banana, blueberries, strawberries - all go well with this flavor for a change up. I bought other Optimum Products, 100% Casein and their Micronized Creatine Powder. Add some bulk supplements D-Ribose and your off. Will buy again unless I find anything close a lot cheaper. Only issue - the top of the container was not sealed under the screw off lid. That's disappointing. Will see on the next one.  ADDED AFTER ADDITIONAL PURCHASES] Third or fourth purchase - will continue   ADDED AFTER ADDITIONAL PURCHASES] Sixth or seventh purchase - still going strong - great product
 i won't push it and say that this flavor (or any other protein powder flavor for that matter) is going to make your propeller hat spin with how much you enjoy it, but the taste isn't BAD. it is however, and more importantly, a respectable source of protein that you can use to either supplement a workout or use to help balance out a healthier diet. I used "Body Fortress" before this and oh man was it garbage compared to ON.<br/><br/>there's a reason this has 5 stars, it's because it gets the job done and doesn't make you feel awful.
 The first time I bought this I got plain vanilla, which doesn't have much flavor. The Vanilla ice cream is MUCH better. I recommend Gold Standard. It's fairly basic as far as whey protein goes, but the affordability makes up for that. I don't rely much on protein powder - I use it to supplement my highly active lifestyle and vegetarian diet.<br/><br/>I love adding this whey to yogurt and oatmeal and also baking with it. Gold Standard isn't top of the line in flavor quality, but it has a lot of protein with very little carbs and fat and great texture for mixing into things.
 You will definitely get your money's worth with Optimum Nutrition Whey Protein. I usually switch between BSN Syntha6 and Cellucor Whey Protein (they have awesome flavors as well), but always come back to this one in the end. I've been taking their supplements for years now and have not been let down. From Bodybuilding.com and other sellers, this one always comes out on top. Not because of the name brand, but because of all the additional content it has in it; from your basic vitamins to essential amino acids that are vital in muscle recovery and growth. It is very low on calories, sugars, and carbs which is awesome for maintaining lean mass. If you want to pack on some muscle size (which requires carbs) then you can just use your imagination and create a meal replacement shake (i.e. add some milk, nuts, banana, flavored oatmeal of choice, etc.). In the end, its all up to what want. If you're looking for some better flavor, a little more carbs and sugar, I'd go with BSN Syntha6; its tastes great.
 Was a little hesitant after seeing the 1-star reviews citing ingredient changes, but my go-to (birthday cake; sprinkles are for winners) only comes in a 2 lb tub so I decided to chance it with the cake batter 5 lb tub (no sprinkles, but that's okay, you're still a winner because you're basically eating healthy cake batter). Mainly I was worried it was going to be too sweet after seeing some complaints about sucralose.<br/><br/>Frankly, at least as far as I'm concerned, it's awesome. First shake I mixed it with some /flavored/ coffee -- okay, bad idea, with the coffee already flavored it WAS too sweet. Next mixed it with water -- Tasted good, tasted right, and like cake batter. Yum. Next mixed it with black coffee, and another time with water and instant coffee (I like coffee if you can't tell)...oh man, it's delicious. It's like ice cream. Finally, I mixed a scoop with a cup of greek vanilla yogurt, and I think it might be my most favorite evening snack dessert-facsimile of all time. It's basically just like eating cake batter. Healthy cake batter. It defies logic. It's my new fave...sorry sprinkles and chocolate.<br/><br/>The tub I received on March 2018 does contain salt and sucralose in the listed ingredients, but I'll be honest, didn't affect the taste to me and I can't find any reference that shows it was ever otherwise for this flavor; also, 140mg of sodium and 2g of sugar on the nutrition facts is not outrageous depending on your exercise/nutrition intake.<br/><br/>If you like cake batter and gainz, as you sensibly should, I'd recommend.
 After a suggestion from my Doctor to add more protein to my regular diet, I decided to go this route along with regular Exercise. after calculating my needs for my body type/size this product seemed to be the one.<br/>I have been using it for a couple of weeks now, and it is doing what i need.<br/>it mixes up without a shaker bottle, I even use cold water and it stirs up no problem.<br/>the flavor is rich and pleasing chocolate. some of the chocolate flavors used in other products can result in "bitter Beer Face" type moments.<br/>not this one. others out there probably could care less about taste, but if you are drinking this multiple time a day for weeks on end, I and others really care!<br/>it does what you need with no hassle!
 I've bought this brand for years.  This last tub wont mix well and is gritty like sand.  It makes it very hard to drink ill be switching after 6 years of using this stuff.
 Something changed with the formula. Tastes like I’m drinking water even when using the recomended dose
 This has been a good protein powder for both my son and myself, we have been using a daily after our workouts. I am ordering our 2nd 5lb container, we did not find the Vanilla IceCream flavor to be too sweet. I actually found this flavor easy to mix with various fruits in a blender, yogurt and almond milk. We mix it up daily never having the same flavor.
 I wont buy any other protein besides this one. It tastes amazing with just water which is great for filling up right after my workout. It doesn't have any of those crazy products or add ins other proteins you will find have.<br/><br/>Have to get the double chocolate though don't get anything else!
 I've been using this protein for one summer.<br/>It tastes good, has a great price and I can see the effect.<br/>I've been doing workouts regularly during the summer (3 times a week) and had I diet especially to gain muscles.<br/>I've tried this product and I've been drinking it every morning and right after the workout.<br/>In the beginning of June my weight was - 150lb. At the end of summer I was 165lb - only muscles, no too much fat.<br/>Great taste (like nesquick) and I recommend it to anybody=)
 This review is for Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard, 5 Pound.<br/><br/>I am a not veteran to supplements,but I can tell you I have tried dozens of proteins. This, by far, is the best for me. It has been my go to protein for the last years.<br/><br/>I get no digestion issues. No gas, no upset stomach, nothing. It mixes easily with water and a shaker cup, and tastes great when mixed with other foods, like bananas and peanut butter. I weight out the protein on a kitchen scale, and find that I get more than the number of servings listed on the container, by several.<br/><br/>A note of caution, and this is for any powder supplement. Use a scale. The scoops are generally not accurate. They may be close, but if you need 64 weighted grams to get two servings, two scoops may be less, or often drastically more. Invest in a ten dollar kitchen scale, and really know what you're taking in.
 HOLY GOOD GOD IT TASTES SO BAD.<br/>I understand whey protein powders never taste as good as you'd like or as people say they do but trust me when I say this: the coffee flavor is HORRIFYING. It is very hard to chug, i'd rather chug cough medicine all day vs chug one of these.<br/>My friend gave me a sample of ON's chocolate flavor and while it didn't taste very good I had no issue chugging it.<br/>The coffee flavor makes me gag. I have to put one scoop and only fill my blender ball cup 1/4-1/3 the way and chug the little bit.
 I use to use this protein powder about a year ago but switched to a different one for while. Use to love this protein powder but something must have changed since I used it last. It tastes super super salty and hurts my stomach like crazy! 20 minutes after drinking it I feel exhausted and my muscles hurt. Wish I wouldn't have bought so much of it cause I can't use it anymore.
 Mix this with some almond milk, peanut butter and a frozen banana and you got yourself a very convincing milk shake
 I purchased this product  because both my children have been using it for quite some time and they highly recommended it.  I really wanted a fast pick me up for the afternoons and a quick breakfast I could mix up easily and drink on the way to work.  Not only is this powder the highest standard of whey protein it is also extremely easy to mix into any liquid.  I like it with either water or milk.  I've even mixed with carbonated water and it tastes like a vanilla soda. Delicious! You don't need a fancy blender or blender bottles just pour the powder into your liquid and stir or shake it up. This flavor is absolutely delicious and I don't think I'll try any others, but just in case you're wondering my kids  have tried and love many of the other flavors.<br/> Recently I highly recommend this product.  I've tried some other products that  tasted so horrible I really had to force myself to drink them.  Additionally, I found that other products didn't mix well with any type of liquid.  No worries here. Everyone I've recommended to just loves it.  Honestly, this is probably the best on the market.
 I usually stick to the chocolate flavors but I thought I would give this one a try.  I don't drink coffee but I like the smell of French vanilla.  I wasn't blown away with the flavor.  But it did grow on me.  One thing that make this better, especially for coffee drinkers, would be to much it with the coffee flavor that ON offers.  As I said, I don't drink coffee but that sounds pretty good to me.  As always, the drink is filling and very effective.  My go to.
 If your looking for a protein supplement, you just found it!!!  Optimum nutrition has done their homework when they developed this protein supplement.  With 24 grams of protein per scoop, this is a great value protein supplement to help you get to your daily protein goals.<br/><br/>This product mixes extremely well in my shaker bottle and leaves no lumps.  The taste is very good with a nice chocolate taste that is not overwhelming and overpowering.  Unlike a lot of other protein powders, this product does NOT produce that chalky aftertaste of fake taste.  Flavor of this one is on point!!<br/><br/>I mixed 2 scoops with water and found this to be a great way to get 48 grams of protein in to start my day.  I will be trying the other flavors but will definitely keep this one in my rotation.  You can mix this with milk or water and it will be as thick as you want depending on how much liquid you decide to use.  Tastes really great with Almond milk!!!!!<br/><br/>Pros- mixes well/easily with water, great price/quality, great flavor<br/>Cons- none
 This product has caffeine! I generally had this in the afternoon a few hours before my workout and this helped invigorate my spirits before workouts and kept me awake through the rest of the day while still providing the protein I needed. If you don't want the caffeine, I would say try a different flavor instead.
 I love Gold Standard protein powder. With a planned pregnancy on the horizon I started checking the ingredients to ensure they were safe for pregnancy. My favorite chocolate (extreme double chocolate) is safe. Unfortunately, my favorite vanilla (french vanilla creme) was not. So I tried the vanilla ice cream (I knew the plain vanilla was not good). The fake sugar flavor is too strong, even mixing it with the extreme double chocolate doesn't mask it. It tastes as awful as any cheap protein.
 This whey product is perfect for anyone on the Keto Diet. With 1 gr of carb, when mixed with the low carb Almond Milk (unsweetened) or an almond milk, coconut milk milk substitute, it has less than 5 gr of tasty and filling chocolatey goodness! Makes a great meal substitute or low carb snack.
 I have done a lot of research comparing many different key factors on whey protein and various other weight gainers for supplementation and have tried many. Calculating quality factors taken into consideration include mixing quality, flavor options, taste, sugar, carbohydrate, sodium, protein &amp; protein per serving %(PPS), fat levels, and finally cost all demonstrate the quality of this product.<br/><br/>Considering all the above factors EXCEPT COST, I have found 2 products I consider marginally better primarily based on protein percentage (ISO 100 84% PPS] &amp; Hydrobolic FX  90% PPS]).  I have tried both of these products and can attest to there effectiveness.  That being said; both of these other products are over $40 more per 10 lbs (a cost difference which can't be justified).  Also note: Hydrobolic FX flavors are limited and both poor in my opinion so although it has the best features it is tough to swallow, ISO 100 smooth banana is fairly tasty.<br/><br/>Gold Standard excels: both sugar and carbohydrates are just about non-existent, I have never had a product dissolve better yet, and the flavor choices are awesome; mocha cappuccino is hands down the best and most versatile being able to mix it with coffee; milk, &amp; water.  Looking at the nutritional facts of this item you will note the PPS is high while sugar and carbohydrates are practically non-existing.<br/><br/>This review is specifically for the 10lb strawberry which is also very tasty, but not as versatile as other flavors.
 I have been eating Optimum Nutrition protein for a decade and this is the worst tasting protein I've ever had. AND they wouldn't let me return it! Don't take a chance!
 I've tried half a dozen flavors of ON Gold Standard Whey.  I bought this one 'cause it was on sale, but I was VERY nervous about the flavor tasting like Pepto or something.  I was VERY pleasantly surprised that it tasted nothing like Pepto, but instead was actually delicious in a strawberry milkshake sort of way.  I've only had it with milk so far.  Not sure it would be that great with just water, but it probably wouldn't be too terrible.
 Optimum Nutrition is pretty much the gold standard (no pun intended) for whey protein. I drink one a day after my workouts and they keep me full for a good bit of time. In terms of flavor, I've tried three thus far:<br/><br/>- Double Rich Chocolate: 6/10; OK flavor. Doesn't really taste like chocolate but isn't terrible.<br/>- Strawberry: 8.5/10 ; Tastes pretty much like the nesquik strawberry drinks. So good<br/>- Chocolate Coconut: 10/10 ; This tastes EXACTLY like almond joy! Not even making it up. Grab yourself some unsweetened almond milk (only 30 calories per serving) and it will make this flavor taste like the greatest beverage ever<br/><br/>Definitely going to buy either strawberry or chocolate coconut again once I run through this 5lb jar.
 Optimum Nutrition makes the best flavors in my opinion, but I haven't had much else.  Their Vanilla Ice Cream flavor is my favorite, and I don't mind spending the extra money on this name brand for this product.  They make a better product than most of the competitors, even if it does cost slightly more.  I think their price point is perfect for their quality.<br/><br/>I have also noticed that their powder mixes easier than most.  I cannot stand getting clumps, so I am one to shake vigorously.  I have had no problems with this product and getting clumps.  So long as I add the powder to the liquid, not the other way around.
 One of the better tasting whey proteins that I've ever tasted. I wish it was a little lower in sugar, but I've used it with almond milk to make great shakes as well as with peanut butter and other ingredients to make "protein power balls."  Optimum's when makes a great base for both of these, providing tons of proteins and packing a lot of flavor. I've found better whey though with "way" less sugar.<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000QSTBNS/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_90
 Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Whey Protein is an absolute staple in our house. This protein powder gets added into every blueberry, strawberry, and banana smoothie after workouts and in mornings for breakfast. The taste is light, and is not overwhelming when mixed with fresh fruit and almond milk. Additionally, the texture is virtually undetectable, and adds a much needed protein boost to an otherwise light meal.<br/><br/>We enjoy this protein powder so much that we order a new container as soon as we begin to run low. We have used this protein for years, and I happily recommend this to family and friends.
 This stuff is nice because you don't absolutely have to have a blender bottle.  It does just fine with a fork and a cup. It takes a few minutes but it does completely dissolve.  I ordered cake batter flavor and it mostly tastes like vanilla but it is pretty good.  Looking forward to trying some more flavors after this ginormous 5 lb bucket is gone.  I drink it at 5:30 a.m. (2 scoops) with 16 oz of milk and don't eat until noon and it holds me over just fine.  Highly recommend.
 This makes a great tasting rocky-road chocolate shake.  I love it when mixed with just water in my blender bottle.  It blends easily and fully dissolves.  I find it very satisfying and makes a decent meal replacement when in a rush.  I usually add it to coffee for a special mocha-tasting treat.  It's good hot or cold.  I like that the carbs are low and can be used while low-carbing.  I will continue to buy this for the health benefits and for the taste. It's one of the best powders that I have used, and I've tried a lot of them.
 I have been using Optimum's 100% Whey Vanilla Ice Cream powder for several years. It is great-tasting, easy to mix up, and easy to digest. It is super convenient to add protein any time of day or night. My favorite mixing bottle to use is the Blender Bottle. In my opinion this flavor is one of Optimum's best, if not the best one. 5 stars.<br/><br/>UPDATE: 2017<br/>Something changed in the formulation recently. The protein seems to thicken way up, too much. I like making a couple shakes the night before work so I have them chilled for breakfast and lunch. They used to thicken slightly overnight (I make them with milk). Now, they are VERY thick in the morning, it is almost unappetizing. I am thinking some cellulose or 'gums' were added.<br/><br/>It was such a great mix, taste, texture before, why screw it up? When customers find a product they like, don't change it!<br/><br/>I have noticed that if I use maybe 1/2 water and 1/2 milk it is less thick, but the thickening agents don't make it better. If you use a blender and ice, it will already get thicker.<br/><br/>Note to Optimum: change the formula back to the 2016-ish and before recipe, that was much better. The flavor is still good now, but whatever makes it 'thicker' has made me knock off a star (or maybe 2).<br/><br/>Of note, I have been a long-time purchaser of Optimum Nutrition products, starting with Pro Complex protein back in the 1980's.
 This protein powder tastes great compared to the other's I've tried. I use it to make breakfast shakes and sometimes use it as a meal replacement. I don't feel the need to add anything to sweeten my shakes when I use this. It's not gritty, it mixes well, and doesn't leave an unpleasant after taste. I like that the calories are relatively low for the amount of protein you get in a serving. I'd definitely recommend this!!
 When I was a broke college kid, I cut a few corners with my supplements and bought some nasty protein powders.  I bought 10 lb zip-lock bags of awful tasting stuff that would clump all over the spoon and the sides of my glass. NEVER AGAIN!<br/>Enter: optimum nutrition gold standard. First, this stuff tastes great! I'm on my third flavor, and I haven't found myself dreading the last few scoops. I use 8 oz of 2% milk in a shaker cup for all my shakes.  I've tried the cookies and cream (which ranks low on flavor reviews) and thought it was a good tasting dessert-like shake. Then I tried the strawberry shake flavor which was just great - tasted like the milk after eating cap'n crunch with crunchberries.  Now I'm on extreme chocolate milk. I wouldn't go as far as calling it "extreme," but it tastes just like regular chocolate milk - I consider this a good thing. These have no foul after tastes or bitterness, they all taste wonderful. The powders mix so smoothly. No clumps at all.  The cup rinses easily.<br/>Results? Better gains and faster recovery. I'm not in competitive body building, I just like to look good and stay in shape. This is the perfect protein product.
 Solid protein choice. Can't go wrong with this brand. Since taking my training more seriously I've cut out a lot of what I enjoyed eating. This chocolate flavor really hits the spot for the chocolatey goodness I've missed. Mixes awesome with water and milk. Hits the spot for that after training snack or for use in a meal replacement. I don't plan on changing up my protein choice for a while and will definitely be purchasing this again in the future.
 Used to be my favorite whey protein until they added new nasty ingredients like sucralose.
 Wow this is completely like chocolate milk when mixed..I didn't even need to buy my Hershey syrup to experience that taste anymore!!! Plus this is filled with protein which is great for your muscle needs. So easy to mix and drink after a workout. I'm so glad I got this 5 lbs when it was on sale. My first buy ever and I'm not regretting any of it. Already know I'll finish it all myself!
 I'm by no means a work out addict or a professional body builder. I'm just an average individual trying to get in somewhat of a better shape. I've taken other whey proteins such as those from body fortress (the walmart brand), and the GNC basic whey protein. The double rich chocolate is not as flavorful as I had expected. This is my first ON Whey. Its not bad in taste but it is definitely not as good in taste as the GNC brand generic whey. However, I do think from a digestive prospective, this is much much better than either of the previous 2 brands. Both the GNC and the body fortress caused digestive issues for me (not sure why..perhaps it was not as pure as this one?). This one definitely does not cause any problems. After drinking the GNC brand I saw white crystals that remain at the bottom of the glass. You do not see any of that with ON. Perhaps this is the isolate that they mention in those whey proteins. I just started to work out again so i don't really have any results to show for it yet but i'll keep working on it and will update post accordingly to see if i do see a difference between this an the other proteins.<br/><br/>Update: Tried Rocky Road for the 1st time. It is a tad to sweet for me but its not bad.<br/><br/>My order of preference (will update as I try more flavors):<br/>1) Double Rich Chocolate<br/>2) Rocky Road
 I am trying to get physically fit after years of obesity. No need to go into too much details about my training program but long-story-short, I am trying to build muscle mass and needed additional protein without too many additional calories. Something I could make and go and discretely consume while at my job...not exactly a role made for meat or cheeses. My trainer suggested protein powder, specifically whey powder. Now, I was skeptical. Not of the benefits (all of the internet research showed positive comments) but of the taste and prep. Site after site showed the "solutions" to lumpy powders. Worrying about such, I went ahead and purchased one of those blender bottles, thinking the worst. I ordered the powder first and wanted to begin, so I put it in a small Powerade bottle and gave it a go. To my surprise the ON whey powder instantly disolved with a couple of shakes. No lumps. No repeated agitation. I don't really need the blender bottle now, but I'll probably keep it just b/c the mouth is wide enough to pour in the powder without making a mess or requiring a funnel.<br/><br/>I purchased the French Vanilla and mix it with 6 ounces of water and 4 ounces of orange juice. Ends up tasting just like an Orange Julius. I don't know about the long-term effects as I just started, but I can tell you that it's a life-saver with regards to staving off hunger pains before lunch.
 Good flavor - when blended with a liquid. The chocolate and vanilla are both excellent mixed into (slightly cooled) coffee or black tea. The chocolate is better than the vanilla in plain water. Sometimes I blend half scoops of each flavor in coffee.<br/><br/>This powder does weird things when blended in cold water - it stays clumpy longer. Slightly tepid through warm-hot fluids blend better. I've heard said that too hot liquids will do weird things to the protein, but I haven't run into that much - as the liquid cools, it blends well fine again.<br/><br/>I feel like my digestive health is better when I actively use this powder, whether as a meal substitute or as a post-work-out recovery tool.
 We were pleasantly surprised by this product. We ordered the chocolate flavoured and expected it to taste bad but it's actually very tasty. We mix it with milk and have a glass full with breakfast. Any health benefit will be seen over time but so far it seems to be working as described. We have recommended it to several people who but things like Ensure. It taste better and is much cheaper.
 I have always been a fan of Optimum Nutrition because the quality of their products is outstanding. This one in particular needs no introduction, this is by far the best selling protein out there on the market and once you use it you can see why. It has a long list of flavors to choose from and is a very fine powder, I do not use a blender but a shaker bottle and just a few shakes and its mixed up. The coffee flavor tastes great and if someone wants a stronger coffee taste then you can add half a teaspoon of decaf instant coffee which is what i do and you have a nice bottle of cold coffee.<br/><br/>This one is also my go to protein since the nutritional value is great when compared with others, barely any fat and low on calories also, which is important when trying to achieve a nice physique, a lot of other companies have a ton of cholesterol in them an more fats than you can imagine. More so with a brand like this which have been tested so many times you can trust it, which is very important for me when you're putting something in your body.
 Be careful to buy this product! I was checking expiration date, because I would wanted to know how long it last, but as picture that I attached, expiration date has been removed. It was very obvious that someone scratched off and removed it on purposely. I tried to take it for about a week, but I didn't feel safe so stop using them. The expiration date is important for safety, it should be clearly marked and visible to everyone.
 I have tried many different flavors of the Gold Whey powders, and the double rich chocolate is my favorite.  My bf enjoys the white chocolate and the toffee flavors better, and while they are great, they don't satisfy my need for chocolate like this one.  By the way, we follow a Keto-diet, so for those of you who are interested, here is how we make our protein shakes to keep us very full for a very long (at least 3-4 hours) time:  Use 1 tall blender bottle, add about 4 oz of water and a few ice cubes, add 2 1/2 scoops of whey powder, add 1/4 cup (give or take to your preference) of low/zero carb heavy whipping cream, 10 drops of Easy Sweet, and shake well.  Then take off the lid and add water to fill until the drink mixture reaches the top of the blender bottle.  Try this and you'll be amazed!!  It is a deliciously creamy milkshake - healthy and filling!!
 This is as least my third time purchasing this product. I went through many a whey protein before I finally found this one- seriously, I was like the Goldilocks of protein powders... they were all either too gritty, too filled with additives, too artificial tasting, too chalky.... I had almost given up on putting protein powder in my morning smoothies and then my brother suggested this brand to me. The powder is very fine so it doesn't chunk or add grit to my smoothies. Also, the cake batter flavor adds a nice, subtle sweetness without tasting super artificial or weird. Maybe one day I'll get brave and try another one of their flavors, but for now, I'm sticking with what's working. I'm so happy to have found a whey protein that both tastes good and helps me make my morning fruit smoothie into a complete meal.
 It works as advertised and plenty of other reviewers have talked about the quality of the protein.<br/><br/>I just want to share how I use this.<br/><br/>It dissolves easily so what I've been doing is, essentially, making iced mochas with the protein powder.<br/><br/>Into an Underarmor 24 oz. Dominate Thermos: (Underarmour branded thermos insulation bottle with a flip top lid for drinking)<br/>2 cups of milk/soy milk<br/>2 scoops of ON 100% double chocolate<br/>5-10 teaspoons of instant coffee<br/>1 teaspoon of creatine (don't use this anymore, didn't really see results so no point risking side effects)<br/><br/>Close cap. Shake vigorously (like it's a shake weight).<br/><br/>Add ice<br/><br/>Voila, protein filled iced mocha that stays cold all day.  I refill in the middle of the day with some kind of coffee drink like canned starbucks double shot.
 It wasn't all the hype that everyone said it tasted like...Honestly was disappointed cant find a distinctive taste with it. Doesn't taste like cake batter or animal cookies or anything cake like. I tried one scoop with 6 ounces non fat milk, or 3 ounces water 3 ounce non fat, or 3 ounce water 3 ounce unsweetened almond milk...the probably the best tasting combination with this fake cake batter flavor is the 2 ounce water 2 ounce unsweetened almond milk and 3 ounce non fat milk with one scoop. I tried 1 scoop with 2%...Really sweet but still not enough to distinuish the cake batter flavor...Taste more of vanilla flavor ....its way too many calories if you go beyond non fat and its essentially a waste better off buying a real milkshake at DQ.
 I purchase this from Costco typically and hoped that the difference in chocolate flavor would be minimal or just a marketing tactic for the same stuff. NOPE this chocolate is terrible. Borderline not drinkable.
 This is one of the best flavors you can get in protein. Tastes great with water or milk as a mix. I use 2.5 scoops per 11 ounces of water for and my shake is clump free and very rich in flavor.<br/><br/>Please note the mint taste is NOT over-powering, it is just the right amount to make it taste different from chocolate without being too minty. I recommend this flavor and product, super fast Amazon shipping as well.
 I got the vanilla ice cream flavor and I was surprised at how good it tasted, not good for a protein shake, actually good. I mix it with milk though and sometimes peanut butter and then use a blender, it aerates very well and I get about a 30% increase in volume after blending which is far more than the nasty stuff I got from Walmart which was flat and heavy. My only problem with it is I wanted to take this as a lunch option but it is completely devoid of nutrition, its just protein and some fiber. So if you are only using this as a post workout thing instead of a meal replacement then its great. I will instead be looking for more nutritious options.
 This protein is one of the best on the market for the price.  It consists of the three forms of whey; Concentrate, Isolate, and Hydorlized.  Being that it is mostly concentrate you still get the great benefits of whey (which includes anti-cancer properties).  Concentrate still digests pretty fast so the digestion period is nothing extreme when put along side hydolized (but if you are doing some really intense training and are a professional you might want to get a tub of hydro for post workout)<br/><br/>This whey can be used for post-workout, throughout the day, or in a shake.  It is versatile and cheap unlike the other forms.  So if you know you are going to be drinking protein 4 months out you should get this.  You will save money in the long run.<br/><br/>The taste is good and nothing I would complain about (and if you are training hard enough neither should you).  It sucks that other flavors cost more because I would like to try something other than chocolate.<br/><br/>The bag is pretty huge and the scooper is buried inside so be careful trying to find it.  I suggest pouring some of this into a used plastic tub so it will be easier and cleaner to get your protein.
 The Mocha Cappuccino is by far my favorite flavor! It's my go-to breakfast (replacing actual coffee, hence the flavor I went with) which makes me feel better throughout the day. Coffee was leaving me jittery and then by mid-morning, crashing. This protein powder gives me a lot more energy, carrying me through my day and my workouts.
 It's good protein, it's not great protein. For the 99% of us that aren't looking to be 3% body fat, it's fine. It's not pure whey isolate so there are some extra calories in it, but that's not really a negative. For one scoop it's 120 calories. I take 4 scoops a day. Two scoops with skim milk in the morning, two scoops with skim milk within 30 minutes of working out. So per day I'm probably taking in 600 calories from the protein/milk combo. You can mix with water, but it doesn't taste nearly as good.<br/><br/>If you're looking to pack on some muscle your diet is as important as your workout. Supplementing my protein is about the only way I'll get 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight. Doing this I went from 140 pounds to 165 pounds in a 3 month period. I've sort of plateaued in terms of weight and mass gain, but I lift 3 hours a week. I could gain more if I wanted to put in more work, or add in performance supplements like creatine. I've lifted for the majority of the last 15 years, if you take away one thing from my review, let it be this: protein builds muscle. I didn't change my diet and supplement my protein until 3 years ago. I didn't see big gains until I did. So, if you're trying to build muscle, but you aren't looking at your diet, you're doing it wrong.
 As an athlete and phys ed trainer, I have tried a lot of different nutrition supports and supplements, including protein powders. There are a ton on the market nowadays. So far this one is my favorite. It tastes good even alone, and blends very well with anything I've mixed it into. I usually make a morning shake with this, some skim milk, and fruit, either fresh or frozen. A lot of the other protein powders I've tried either had a noticeable texture or a distinct (not too tasty) flavor. The name of this one says "Gold Standard" and it probably is. It's definitely the best-tasting I've tried, and it fills me up in a way that I like. (Years ago I bought one, I don't remember the manufacturer, that made me feel bulky and bloated after I drank it that I ended up throwing the whole thing away.) For the price and for the reasons I've listed, I think this one's the best on the market. I recommend it to my colleagues and students. I feel I can stand behind it.
 I HATE whey protein. HATE IT. They all taste chalky and gross, and that's been my opinion for a VERY long time. Finally, though, i've found a protein powder that (when mixed properly with milk) is actually good tasting and easy to drink! The flavor i purchased was "Vanilla Ice Cream". It's delicious, but there are a few small kinks that should be known.<br/><br/>1. It doesn't really taste like "vanilla ice cream". It tastes great, but the flavor reminds me more of a cheesecake or something along those lines. Definitely tastes like a dessert, though!<br/><br/>2. It tastes HORRID in water. I will only drink this powder mixed with 8oz of milk. 8oz milk + 1 scoop of this stuff = creamy goodness. No protein aftertaste whatsoever.<br/><br/>Other than these two small kinks, though, it's an incredible product and i recommend it whole-heartedly. Will purchase again!
 Absolutely delicious! I was very worried based on some of the reviews but I'm so glad I took a shot at this!<br/>I've been using it in the morning and evening (one around breakfast and one instead of a dessert shake). It's been fantastic, I feel better and am Fuller longer. I have a really slow metabolism so this has definitely helped kickstart it, and it's really easy to throw into my routine.<br/><br/>PS: I got the cookies and cream flavor, tastes kinda like Oreo filling but is EXTREMELY versitile in my evening shakes (fruit or what have you)
 Taste: The extreme milk chocolate is exactly that - extreme.  It's a bit too sweet for my palette.  It's not bad per say but I like to mix fruit into my shakes and this flavor overpowers anything else I mix in.<br/><br/>Mixability: Extremely good - I use a Ninja blender to mix my shakes with ice and frozen fruit.  Past powders I've used typically leave you with a chalky residue at the end / bottom of the cup despite how well you attempt to mix / blend.  This powder has been the best I've seen.<br/><br/>Contents: Great mix of protein, great selection of flavors (most I've seen of ANY brand), stout container and scoop, low mix of carbs / not excessive.<br/><br/>My rating is a 4 our of 5 with my only CON being the taste is too sweet.  It's still very easily mixed and digested without tearing your gut up or leaving a nasty after taste.  Superb value in terms of servings per dollar (around 76 cents / ea).  I normally buy my supplements from another well known supplement site however its $8 cheaper here if you have Prime :)
 I have tried several different types of protein powders (the GNC brand and Designer Whey being the worst offenders) and could not stomach them because they were so chalky even when I tried blending them with fruit or peanut butter and milk to make a shake. This ON powder is completely different. It makes a great shake ( I like it with almond milk, peanut butter or PB2, ice, and a little butterscotch pudding mix) or it is ok on its own mixed with water in a shaker cup. While it is expensive, I think it is worth it since I don't feel like I am choking it down. My husband and I both use this a few times a week to supplement our protein intake and the 5 pound bottle has lasted us a while. I have only tried the double rich chocolate, but I would like to try some of the other flavors in the future.
 To be completely honest, I have never been a fan of expensive supplements.  I feel like you can spend hundreds of dollars and receive a product you'll never use to it's fullest potential.  My friend turned me on to Optimum Nutrition after I had been using Muscle Tech for years (mainly because it was cheap and available at Sam's Club), and it works really well.  From reading the label it has less flavorings and more solid nutritional components which help your body recover and build more muscle.  I use this sparingly, but I could see it being used for packing on loads of muscle too.  I would compare this to a whey protein powder I used to get that came in a silver container with a black lid (if anyone knows what that brand is, feel free to let me know).  This product seems to work just as well and it tastes pretty good for protein powder.
 After going through multiple brands of Whey Protein, I think I have finally found my niche. This product is not only of a great value, but it is great quality as well! I mix one scoop and maybe half a tablespoon more with 1.5 cups of skim milk every day, and sometimes twice a day. The consistency of the shake is more like chocolate milk, something I was NOT expecting in the least. Granted, I use more liquid than mix, so that may be why, but I am still convinced it is thinner than most other protein shakes. The taste is definitely as the name says, it is a rich and chocolaty. I am very pleased with this product, especially with how much you get with how (relatively) low the price is. Definitely the most bang for your buck.<br/><br/>My only fault with this product is that the mix doesn't always seem to get fully mixed in as well as it should. There are usually small clumps of chocolate, small in number, but is weird to have in the drink. I am now used to it, but it definitely nearly made me gag the first time I had it. Just a little more shaking tends to get rid of this, so it is not much of a problem, but it does take at least 45-50 seconds of shaking to minimize the clumps. But don't let that push you away from this product, it is well worth it, and I will be ordering this again when the time comes.
 This is the first time I ever took Whey.<br/><br/>I'm two weeks in drinking/eating this and I'm noticing more definition in my body especially my ABS!!<br/><br/>I feel so toned and stronger<br/><br/>FYI. I do have a meal and exercise routine/plan and sometimes a cheat meal on the weekends.  I make up with Cardio and sleeping don't worry ; )<br/><br/>I'm 26 btw
 If you want to make get some serious results in the gym , you need to have this sandbag filled with protein in your house and in your diet. I drink three shakes a day and this product helps me get my needed amount of protein throughout the day. You can get creative with how you make your shakes. I throw a full bannana , a scoop of peanut butter , low fast milk and a scoop of this protein in a blender and it tastes amazing !
 I have gone through at least five tubs of this protein powder. I normally get the vanilla flavor, but decided to try the vanilla ice cream flavor. I like it. Mixed with water it has a pleasant flavor. When I mix it in a smoothie, usually with a lot of spinach, etc, it adds to the flavor.<br/><br/>It does has 1 gram of sugar per serving. I am not a protein powder expert by any means, but I like this one and I have been making good gains towards my goals, so it looks like this make be working just fine. And it mixes easily.
 This is a great protein powder! I have used it for over a month now and can tell that it is helping me with my workout goals. The taste is good and mixes very well. I sometimes add in extra 100% Cacao powder in order to make improve the chocolate flavor. The 5 lb. size is definitely going to last me a while and I am planning on purchasing this product again in the future.<br/><br/>As far as the amount of protein per serving this is one of the best protein powders out there on the market. Since supplement companies are not regulated by the FDA, they have been getting away with a process called "amino spiking". This process allows them to put in cheap amino acids, such as glycine and taurine, in order to boost the protein content. This means the claimed protein content is higher than the actual amount of protein per serving. However, I have done research and found that this company is clean and with a simple ingredient list, they are not "amino spiking" this product.There are lots of articles around the web that can explain this scam better than I can, but I am just trying to get the information out there.
 Lo mejor de lo mejor.
 I got the vanilla ice cream flavor, which has become my new favorite!  I really enjoy mixing this with almond milk and shaking it up in my blender bottle, as it makes it very creamy.  I've also mixed it with just water, which is good, but just a little less satisfying.  I haven't tried this in smoothies, but I HAVE tried it mixed into overnight oats, which is great for a boost of protein in the morning.
 This brand is the best - have tried others but my friends and I always go back to this one. Not much else to say, but am confident to give this one a good review.
 If you're looking to lean out and lose weight this is an excellent protein. Yes there is little chunks that won't mix but it's an isolate so you got to expect some. Tastes good and mixes good too. I lost a good 18 pounds of flab on two 5 pound jugs of this. Of course I worked out with it too though but it definitely helped me get there.
 Not a huge fan of this flavor. I bought it based on a few reviews I had watched where people said it was delicious and tasted like iced coffee and I wanted a break from chocolate. It tasted more like vanilla flavor to me than coffee and I really couldn't stand the vanilla flavors in the past. I used almond milk, unsweetened, and unflavored to mix with. Still came up with some chunks after normal mixing and it seemed to have more of the cookies and cream texturing (the little specks of cookie mixed in) which was ok but not preferred. I got through most of the 5lb tub but just couldn't drink anymore so I'll be going back to the extreme chocolate flavor.
 I was happy I found gluten free powder as I have stomach problems and have to be gluten free. I have had no issues with that aspect, but the sucralose in the flavoring has caused me nausea and headaches. I didn't realized the flavoring had sucralose when I purchased it; I was merely looking for the smallest amount I could purchase to try it out. I will probably try the flavorless as I think the only issue is in the flavoring.
 Great protein! I take 1 spoonful during/after I workout. If I remember correctly I had to dig quite a bit to find the spoon, but it was there. The chocolate flavor is good and I haven't really gotten sick of it. I will probably reorder once I finish it off.
 Past experiences have made me very leery of any type of protein shake because of texture, after taste and (because I have Celiac ) hidden gluten.  On the advice of my son I gave this a try and am very happy with it.  It is easy to blend either by a shaker or mixed with fruit in the blender with no chalkiness or after taste and good flavor (I purchased the vanilla ice cream) .  I will certainly purchase again.
 Do your research and see what's out there...You'll find your self back to Optimum Nutrition whey protein. Back when I was lifting, this was my go-to protein supplement after tons of evaluation. My results were good and what I expected. Not lifting anymore but my wife has adopted it as her meal replacement/supplement. No more wasting money on slim-fast or any other nonsense. She loves the double chocolate and it helps with the appetite, can't really go wrong with this stuff...Unless you buy the wrong flavor. Trust me, stick with the chocolates....I've tried several of the other flavors and 5 lbs is a lot to go through when it tastes nasty. Just wish it was a little less expensive.<br/>-<br/>Hope this was helpful.
 Rockyroad was much too sweet for me but some people seem to really like the sweeter flavors. Other than that ON makes great quality protein powders as far as mixability but if you are like me and prefer a more mild protein I would go with their regular chocolate flavor.
 I have always been a huge fan of optimum nutrition protein. Theirs is held to high standards and is always a very clean and pure protein that tastes good and is not in huge clumps. I wanted to buy a lot because you get a better deal when buying it in bulk. So when I read that the coffee flavor was a limited time, I went ahead and bought 5 lbs of it. (For those wondering, I use two scoops after lifting weights) The taste of it is just alright. I enjoy coffee for the most part, and this is not really like a cup of coffee (then again, you can not expect it to be). I have had a few of my friends try it and a lot of people like it, but to me its just ehh. It tastes like coffee but its not high end coffee. I honestly prefer the chocolate over it, so I advise you, if you already have a flavor you like, stick with it. If you are going to get this flavor, I would advise first getting a smaller size amount and if you like it, buy more. Like i said, I do not really enjoy it, but I have no problem taking down two scoops every other day.<br/><br/>I would not buy again (I would get a different flavor).
 I use this whey protein powder all the time. It tastes great. Dissolves very easy with a spoon/fork in a cup. Don't even need a shaker bottle. Also, I believe this specific brand/model has the cheapest price/serving. Be careful as a lot will say price/ounce and I would really find the best value by getting the item with the cheapest price per serving because at the end of the day I would think having more servings will last longer.
 New formula tastes gross and makes me nauseous.<br/><br/>I had a previous jar of this Optimum Nutrition Vanilla Ice Cream flavored protein powder, which was exactly what I wanted from a protein powder. It had a lot of protein per serving, had a good consistency, tasted decent, mixed well, did not upset my stomach. With this new formula (which apparently now contains sucralose) only maintains the first benefit - of packing a lot of protein.<br/><br/>Now I am stuck with about 4.9 pounds of gross protein powder.
 Very chocolatey flavor and when combined with milk, amazing flavor. I didn't have any muscle before using this. But combined with working out and drinking this twice a day, I gained a lot of muscle really quickly. I was working out prior to using this but did not get much growth. I would highly recommend this product if you are trying to either gain lean mass or bulk.
 Granted, I haven't tried them all, but of those that I have, this one is by far the tastiest. I've only had Double Rich Chocolate, but it's the perfect chocolate flavor. It's delicious mixed with water, but I could see how that would taste "too watery" if you are going for a chocolate milk taste. It dissolves quickly (I always shake in a mason jar, then use that as my drinking glass), doesn't have a weird aftertaste like the Costco brand, and only has 1 gram of sugar per scoop so it's not like candy with some protein mixed in. However, I often treat it like dessert because it tastes so good! I haven't yet tried baking with this stuff, but I've heard good reviews for that (such as for protein brownies). I actually look forward to my protein shakes every day with this stuff, and though a tub is expensive, it is SO worth it for cheap and easy protein intake, especially for those who don't eat a lot of meat and don't want to suffer through 15 pounds of beans a day (or make their significant others suffer even more).
 Pros: It's great on its own, but also great when combined with bananas, peanut butter, or spinach in a smoothie. I usually add a little bit of raw cocoa powder (about 1/2 tsp) to beef up the chocolate flavor, but it's not necessary.<br/>Cons: Mixing it with cold liquids creates lumps unless you whisk really vigorously or use a blender.
 I use the Chocolate Malt flavor after lifting weights.  Just be sure to not add to much powder to the water.  It won't dissolve well if you do.  You can make a somewhat healthy malt by adding this to ice cream.  I also add chopped pecans.
 Hands down the best whey out there. Smooth, easy to mix, great taste (actually tastes like you are drinking chocolate milk even though it is mixed with water. I have tried many of the other brands and I finally found the one I can actually drink regularly.
 Not really a gym rat, or a nutrition head. I'm constantly active between waking up early for the gym, and work. Needed something to supplement my breakfast so I wouldn't get so hungry before lunch time. This did the charm. Mixes well, and tastes great, even with just water. I mix one scoop, with two packets of breakfast essentials, and roughly 2.5 cups of 2% milk for my daily breakfast.
 I noticed the lean definition of my muscles within a week. However, I have not found a product within "Whey" that relates to weight or mass gainer. I recommended the gold standard whey to a close friend who is a yoga instructor and since doing some minimal weight lifting for arms, shoulders and chest while using the protein powder he looks great.  He is very satisfied and happy with his new look. Total new upper body definition and form. I will return to using it once I have achieved a acceptable weight with what I am currently using + diet. I am weeks away from starting the whey protein again.
 Strawberry tastes great! Perfect blend of strawberry, with just the tiniest sour bite. Actually tastes like real strawberries, not super synthetic like many other brands. Only problem I have with it is it requires 4 oz of water. So I can't add other stuff easily in, since my glutamine is pretty thick and requires 12 oz. To me the taste is comparable to Adaptogen Science's Strawberry Creme.
 Fantastic taste, great quality, easy mixing. This stuff is an all around win. I stick with what I know when it comes to flavors like strawberry, vanilla, and chocolate, and I use them in recipes as well. I got adventurous one time and purchased rocky road.....ewww....never again, but thats just personal preference, I shouldn't be expected to enjoy every flavor. Helpful tip: when using in a recipe this product will burn at low temps, so always add it in as the last ingredient when making stove top protein bars, and remove from heat.
 Extreme Milk Chocolate is definitely my favorite flavor of protein powder out there (especially with almond milk - yum!), and it mixes up well. The price is great, and the value is even better (especially when buying it in 5 lb. jars!). The container is too big to fit on my counter (but they didn't sell this flavor in a smaller amount), so I just put some of the powder in a plastic jar I bought to keep on the counter and keep the huge can of ON in the closet. :)
 By far my favorite protein powder. Every flavor I've tried from this brand has been good and I'm one who normally chugs a protein shake for the shear fact that I hate the taste of them and am trying not to gag. Definitely not a problem with this powder. It also dissolves in water incredibly smoothly, even if it's just a cup. I wish I could have a lifetime supply of this stuff it's that good!
 Not impressed with the flavor, when you call it double rich chocolate it should tase like double rich chocolate. This tastes like a very light chocolate, even with with 2 scoops. Disappointed, firts time trying this product and it wasn't a great first impression. It's still drinkable,not horrible tasting but it can definitely be improved taste wise.
 I've tried a lot of protein and I've learned that Gold Standard is easily the best. I put it in a regular water bottle and shake it. No clumps, it mixes so easily. They taste pretty good, even with water. Out of the ones I've tried, this is the order based on taste:<br/><br/>Rocky Road<br/>Cookies and Cream<br/>Extreme chocolate<br/>Cake Batter<br/>Vanilla ice cream<br/>Double chocolate ( not even close to their best flavor, although it sells the most out of any flavor)<br/><br/>Make sure you are drinking this immediately after you are done working out. Science shows it helps the most if it's right after, versus a few hours later.
 This protein was a great price and the flavor (banana) was easy to drink.  Although the flavor is a little weaker than I like.  I normally buy Wheybolic Extreme 60 from GNC, but since it's so expensive, I wanted to give this a try.  It did the job, although I'm not sure I would buy it again since the Extreme 60 gave me better results (but it does contain more ingredients).
 This rating is on the quality of the product, not the taste. The protein is great quality, low sugar and calories. **However*, I'm not sure why everyone rants and raves about the 'Cake Batter" flavor. It's like a low sugar  plain vanilla flavor. I have to add stevia to get my desired sweet taste (I'm used to using muscle milk). While I can appreciate the high gram of protein to calorie ratio (24 g and 120 calories ish per serving), the taste is a huge let down. Also, my inside seal was open when I received the package. Wasn't too impressed by that easier! I would buy the product again, just maybe not from this seller or this flavor.
 ed his it's the first time that I am buying whey protein. Did a lot of research and asked a lot of people who lift weights and were in the gym which brands they recommended. Optimum Nutrition was on most of those lists so I decided to go with the strawberry banana mix. I found that the less water I mixed with it the more flavorful it was. The first time I mixed it I used 20 ounces of water and it was very watered down and didn't taste that good. The second time I mixed it I used about 14 ounces of water and that made all the difference. I use a Blender Bottle to mix the powder and have had no issues with clumping there is no sand texture towards the bottom. It dissolves nicely and tastes pretty good. I will definitely buy this again when my current supply runs out.
 TASTE<br/>I was fortunate enough to be able to review the chocolate flavor. I'm not a huge chocolate enthusiast. However, I do enjoy the taste of chocolate, especially in the form of chocolate milk. This whey protein was not as good as chocolate milk, however, for a chocolate whey protein it did taste pretty good and was quite satisfying. More importantly, it contains very little sugar or fat, which is good news!<br/><br/>Good enough so that I looked forward to drinking it as a form of desert. Therefore, flavor wise, I award Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Whey Protein a score of 7.5/10.<br/><br/>MIXABILITY/TEXTURE<br/>Although I blended this whey protein, rather than using a shaker, I only did so for a few short seconds and it was good to go. However, most other protein powders I've tried have taken longer. Therefore, mixability/texture wise, I award Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Whey Protein a score of 8/10.<br/><br/>EFFECTIVENESS<br/>Whey<br/>As with any protein supplement review, it is difficult to evaluate the overall effectiveness of the product. The reason is, unlike creatine and pre-workout amplifiers there is no immediately noticeable effect.<br/><br/>The purpose of protein is to either get extra calories in your diet or to be used as a meal-replacement when you're in a rush. Also, protein supplementation may be used in place of an unhealthy meal, which would be detrimental to an individual seeking an improved physique.<br/><br/>Since I began working out, protein shakes have been a part of my daily diet. The convenience of a protein shake is too good not to take advantage of.<br/><br/>OVERALL REVIEW<br/>I have failed to find an Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Whey Protein that didn't taste good; I have thoroughly enjoyed each and every flavor. Also, the flavors I have tried are; vanilla, chocolate and cookies n' cream.<br/><br/>Furthermore, this whey protein has a high protein content per scoop. More importantly, it has ingredients that blow away most of the other competition. Most notably, this whey protein has low fat, low sugar and high protein per scoop.<br/><br/>Other than a taste which is good but not quite perfect, I am unable to find many negatives associated with it. Therefore, in light of all of this, I award Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Whey Protein an overall score of 9/10.
 Each scoop contains just 120 calories and 24 grams of protein. I drink at least one, and sometimes two, glasses of this protein shake. I've had great luck increasing the amount of muscle in my body between walking and consuming this protein shake, plus trying to watch out regarding other items I eat. My nutritionist is really pleased with my progress because I am obese, and even though I still indulge in carbs, because I walk and drink this protein shake daily I am seeing good results.
 Not sealed! Pretty sketchy , powder all over the container. I buy these regularly from Costco, they have a sealed tops/lids, This is bs
 I advise making your shake the night before, or using a blender.  The french vanilla has a different texture from the one i bought last (chocolate) which was powdery and mixed well.  The french vanilla is lumpy and sticky in the jug almost like the texture of brown sugar.  Anyway, tastes great, and good value for the money.
 My daughter doesn't really eat meat but she is 8 and needs protein so I got this to add to her fruit smoothies and things like that. It adds a creaminess to the texture of a smoothie, I don't notice a change to the flavor of them but there is a noticeable difference. I like that this has a small dose of BCAAs in it too as she is a swimmer and does martial arts, each serving is 24g of protein which is awesome. If you are going to use whey in smoothies and similar go with vanilla un-flavored whey means no flavor is added, whey protein powder does have a taste and it is not something anyone would elect to eat.
 Absolutely love this! I was reading the reviews and came across the highest rated review by Sumer and read the whole thing and that was the deciding factor in my purchasing this. If you want the science behind it definitely read his review. I had been some trouble getting enough protein for my workout needs and I had tried some other proteins but I hated the junk they put in it or the weird chemical aftertaste they had. I have the Extreme Milk Chocolate flavor and it is so good. So far I have only mixed it with water and I've found that it mixes very easily and even though it doesn't taste perfectly like chocolate it's by the far the best I've ever had. Normally proteins taste pretty gross when mixed with just water. I will definitely be purchasing this again when I run out.
 Been using this product as a post workout supplement for months now. On easier days I'll use 1 scoop post workout while using two on harder days. The taste is actually really good but the key is to use less of whatever liquid you decide to use (water, milk) as the flavor really stands out this way. I personally use water as I feel it mixes the powder easier and I get less clumping this way. With about 6-8 ounces of water two scoops of this goes down easy and the effects can certainly be felt. This supplement also has enough amino acids for a standalone supplement giving you an even greater boost to recovery, especially if used pre workout.
 Grabbed the rocky road flavor on recommendation from another buyer, and it's pretty damned good.  Get one of those little shaker cup things, add it to some milk (or you could use water, I guess...), and it really does taste like a damned milkshake.  Pretty easy way to ensure you can reach protein intake goals without having to spend forty dollars a week on chicken breasts, and it's certainly a healthier way of satisfying a sweet tooth than getting a scoop of ice cream or a snickers bar.<br/><br/>One note, the jug is comically huge; I swear it's probably like ten or twelve inches in diameter.  Probably be pretty useful for storing stuff once it's empty.  What, I have no idea, but I'm sure I'll come up with something...
 Chocolate Mint is one of the worst flavors of ANY protein powder I have ever tasted. Taste like chalk. Go with Chocolate Coconut.
 I started using this product for weightloss.  It mixes well in water or milk.  It is not all gritting.  The chocolate tastes pretty good.  I have not used any other protein powder to compare it to.
 This is hands down the best tasting and highest quality protein that I have ever used. I never plan to use any other brand of protein. It disolves great in both milk and water and tasted absolutely amazing! So far I have tried the chocolate malt, extreme milk chocolate, and mocha cappuccino flavors. All three have been great and are a good choice for a chocolate lover. I personally love to make my shakes with chocolate milk, especially during bulking season. This is the best protein all around, it may cost a little more than other brands, but it's worth it!
 Tried the Extreme Milk Chocolate flavor for the first time, this is definitely the best tasting protein powder I've used and the best flavor of O.N. Gold Standard powders I've tried.  Tastes great just mixed with water, mixes well in the blender with no clumps to deal with.  My usual concoction is mixing the protein powder with greek yogurt, cottage cheese, spinach, blueberries, almond milk, and unsweetened cocoa.  With the Extreme Milk Chocolate it tastes very much like a good milkshake, really delicious!
 I could barely tolerate the vanilla.. but the extreme milk chocolate is pretty decent. GNC's stuff still ways WAY better (and every flavor of theirs is good), but Optimum Nutrition is a bit cheaper and works very well. Taste should be pretty much the last factor on your list when choosing supplements anyway. This stuff makes a noticeable difference and performs on bar with, if not slightly better than, GNC's whey. Also as shown in some of the customer pics, its purity is very good as well. Some people don't care, but I do think it's important to pay attention to all the contaminants and keep them at levels as low as possible. I would rather not be consuming a bunch of heavy metals and other toxins multiple times per day in my supplements. So in that respect, for the most part, more expensive IS better.. do NOT go with the super cheap stuff from other brands.. stick with the well-respected ones like GNC and Optimum Nutrition.
 Don't consume enough proteins in grams a day and decided to try a whey supplement. After researching a couple other brands I decided to give this one a try and simply will not need any other brand after this one. The taste is great "double rich chocolate" and mixes really well with soy, water or regular milk. Even with water it didn't taste bad! Yes, still tasted like a whey protein shake but 100 times better then what I was used to. I've also noticed after correcting my protein intake and the use of this product I am seeing gains quicker. This is a great supplement and great tasting one at it too! Would definitely recommend to anyone that is looking for gaining mass through whey supplement. Just know how much you would need to intake and it will do the rest!
 Rocky Road is my new favorite. I have tried mint, mocha, toffee, rich chocolate, cookies and cream and vanilla. Consistently the best protein I have ever used. Mixes great, minimal clumping. Flavors are good but not to over powering. Yes, there are other proteins with less additives and other proteins that are cheaper.  I have tried many other varieties over the last 10 years but always come back to ON Gold. (Even though the price has doubled in the past 10 years)
 While I typically buy 100% protein isolate proteins, Gold Standard contains a solid amount of isolated whey and this product is definitely my go-to protein when I'm looking for something consistent, high-quality, and well-priced.
 Tastes great and dissolves easily.<br/>As for the effects, nobody can ever be sure unless they are scientific about it.<br/>When I bought this, I had just begun a new lifting regime (already lifted, just a new way of programing).<br/>I saw larger gains than I did on my previous regime &amp; protein. I think it was probably a little of both.<br/>This one tastes a little better if it's VERY cold, so throw a little ice in with the milk/water
 I have been using this stuff for years now, and it never fails to get the job done; all while tasting great!<br/><br/>I know Optimum's stuff has a strong reputation, and thats for a reason. It mixes extraordinarily well, and tastes great! I have stuck with the Extreme Milk Chocolate for about two years now, and it not only tastes great in plain ole' water, but it goes well in shakes with fruits, I've baked with it, and much more!<br/><br/>I have gone through periods of not taking this protein (due to being a broke college student) and I definitely noticed the negative difference of not taking it.
 This is my second batch of ON's Whey Isolate protein powder. I'm really loving this product--it's expensive, but the ingredients check out and my personal results are extremely encouraging. I'm currently on a bulk regimen and I firmly believe that having 1-2 of these shakes (I use whole milk) a day is absolutely working for me.<br/>I got Rocky Road first and now Cookies and Cream. Both are very tasty, however like all things it's easy to get tired of one after a while of prolonged use. I recommend buying a second flavour to change up the routine once you're satisfied with your first purchase!
 By far my favorite protein powder. I've tried about 6 other including Sytha-6 and Nitrotech(most were decent). So when I run outta this stuff(which takes forever) I don't think what protein powder am I going to try next time, because I know I'm going to get this brand. I might start thinking about what flavor I am going to try next. It dissolves with no problem in a shaker bottle, it has amazing flavor(coffee), it alleviates my soreness and builds nice muscle bulk. I'm very impressed.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-Taste is great<br/>-Multiple flavors<br/>-Easy to dissolve<br/>-Great for muscle building<br/>-Very good price for the quality you get<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-None that I can think of (other then ALL company's should some how attach the scoop to the lid...).
 I've tried many different brands of protein powder, and they were all thick, slimy, and didn't dissolve well. That is not the case for this protein. After being told by a friend about how good this product is I decided to purchase it. I was skeptical at first, but I soon found that this is the best protein powder I've ever had. The powder dissolves extremely well and tastes very good. No more forcing myself to drink slimy goo in the morning...Amazing product!
 Been using Gold Standard since 2007ish. It continues to deliver great results. Every protein is great, some are just not great for your body. If this doesn't work for you, maybe its not what your body wants. But Gold Standard has been the top of the market since I can remember for a reason. Its a very good product with a very good company.
 This is the best protein powder on the market. Yes, it's more expensive, but it's high quality whey, tastes fantastic, and mixes instantly with water, with no clumps, and rinses easily from your shaker. Because of these qualities, it's one of the few protein powders that I find myself using more often and very consistently, which is exactly what you want in a supplement. Something you don't have to force or remind yourself to take. Unless you're a real bargain shopper, you'll never be disappointed.<br/>Only downside to ordering online is that it might take you awhile to find the scoop. If it's not at the top when you open it, close the lid, roll and shake it around. Look again. Repeat until the scoop is visible! Archaeology playtime!
 The taste reminded me a little of perfume, I got a 5 lb. It was huge, but the taste was not for me. I had done research on the flavor, saw so many good reviews, yet to me it did not taste all that great. I always end up gulping it down within a minute so I do not have to taste it. The protein content though is fantastic for how many calories it holds, so I give ON props for that.
 This is by far my favorite brand of whey protein. I've tried a ton that were edible but I never really enjoyed them. This stuff is delicious and actually dissolves, even with just a spoon. The chocolate not flavor is like drinking ice cream. Some protein powders are terrible when mixed with water, but this has a great thick texture. It keeps me full for hours while delivering the protein I need for my macros.
 Finally a protein powder that tastes good without gas bloat! The taste isn't as sweet as some products, but I've experienced no bloat and the shake tastes good and shakes out smooth. And it seems to work as good, if not better, than other proteins I've tried. Highly recommend!
 I have been using this product for awhile now and have tried a couple other flavors, but I like the banana cream best. I use it to supplement my diet as I am trying to lose a few pounds but don't want to lose muscle, therefore the need for protein. It tastes good and mixes easily (with my BlenderBottle). Rather than using the scoop as a measurement tool (which it is not), I put water in the BlenderBottle and set them on my food scale, zero it, and then add in 31 grams of powder. A couple of notes though: I get this real sweet after taste like my saliva is made of sugar and that can last for quite awhile. Also, taking without regular food sometimes seems to upset my stomach, so I now always take it with a meal. I intend to continue using this product.
 Strawberry flavor tastes like strawberry. The chocolate flavor ON offers is nasty but strawberry is very good and mixed good with orange juice, yogurt, iced strawberry’s, and bananas. Easy to blend, tastes great. Good protein to buy. I usually get 5lb worth of this tub and lasts me about 70 servings, that is if you use it everyday one scoop. I’m also going to try their all natural flavor strawberry since this is artificial and natural but I’m not sure how to know how much of it is natural and artificial. Also part of the reason I’m looking to buy all natural flavors the next tub.
 I've been using the ON whey for many years nows and I been great. I initially bought this as a post work out supplement but have using this as a meal replacement.<br/><br/>I don't think the ON whey is a the best tasting but its amongst one of the best in providing what they advertise on the label. That said the Chocolate varieties are pretty good.  I'm more concerned with the nutritional value more than the taste so its not that big a deal to me.<br/><br/>Overall a great product that I plan to be using for a very long time.
 Great protein! The only downfall is that it has sugar replacements in it that cause me horrible stomach pains and other intolerable effects I'd rather not describe : )<br/>My husband uses this protein daily. Our favorite way to make it is to use the powder with almond milk, a tablespoon of chia seeds and some raw oats. Mix well and put into the fridge and leave it sit until it becomes like pudding. It is like eating a dessert three times a day; I just wish I could still indulge in such a healthy treat after exercise!!
 I'm giving it 5 stars because it is one of the healthiest whey protein and has the most quality protein I could find in a product for this price. It is great protein and has the potential to give you the results you want if you use it right (Meaning its not a substitute for your meals. I drink almost 3 shakes a day, 2 scoops per, along with 4 meals before I could finally see result,though I have had an EXTREMELY hard time seeing results, I'm FINALLY SEEING REAL BIG RESULTS, My other issue was not giving my muscles time to rest and heal. If you do any of these wrong you wont see results no matter what supplements you take). The issue is, I got the "Delicious Strawberry" and it is not so delicious after half the bag is consumed. Yuck... but it deserves 5 stars because its a good solid product and a great price and despite the taste, if your dedicated you will deal with it.
 Best whey protein on the market. I've been using this stuff for 5-10 years and will continue to do so for as long as they produce it. Best nutritional facts of any protein I've used -- high protein, low calories, low sodium, low fat, low saturated fat -- with a really good taste. This is also the best mixing protein powder I've ever used.<br/><br/>After the gym I mix 2 scoops with roughly 12oz of water and it tastes and mixes fine. If I have more time I make a thicker shake with: 6-8 frozen strawberries, 2 scoops of whey, 12oz skim milk, powdered peanut butter and 1/2 of a fresh banana -- it is AMAZING. You can thank me later.
 Great value from this purchase. I for some reason decided to get the cookie dough flavor which I personally do not like very much as far as taste goes - my bad for straying away from chocolate. Five stars because the powder mixes quickly and because it has helped me stick to my diet as good as any other protein I've tried. Go chocolate FYI.
 I’m amazed at the taste of this stuff! I have tried every high protein powder in existence and FINALLY found one that doesn’t taste like spackle. I’m lactose intolerant and it sits well in my tummy, which is a definite plus (just ask my family). I tried both the strawberry and the double chocolate and I’m confident that other flavors are probably just as good.
 ON never fails - love the stuff. I mix it with unsweetened almond milk and find that to be the best after a workout. I also love that it's low carb and high protein so it works great with my keto diet. I bought the Chocolate Mint, which isn't too bad (looking forward to it for the winter, might make a pseudo hot chocolate with it). My favorite flavor is still Rocky Road, however. Other flavors I've tried were the French Vanilla (8/10, minor aftertaste problem) and the Double Rich Chocolate (6.5/10, good in a pinch but has a synthetic flavor to it).
 I am a longtime user of ON's whey protein and really wanted to try the cake batter flavor.  It tastes just like it sounds, but I don't think I will be purchasing this flavor again.  It is definitely sweeter than most of ON's other flavors, and the bottle does mention that it comes artificially sweetened.  I know the vanilla and cookies n cream flavors are sweet, but this is sweeter and some customers may not like that / tire of it over time.  Aside from the flavor, the protein is as awesome as it always has been.  It is great for shakes, protein pancakes, etc.
 as always super fast shipping like literally hours later. I prefer this chocolate the sweetness plus amino acids are in balance and the price is pretty competitive,<br/><br/>do not buy chocolate malt it taste soooooo bad, stick with normal chocolate. My shakes are super green so I need a strong masking flavor, and this protein powder taste so bad it makes the greens even worse.
 I'm​ one of those Protein users that don't really care for brand.. I'm a amateur bodybuilding so most of my protein comes from foods anyways. so I didn't really cared for brand like I said. but now I stopped competing and decided to just try to keep myself in shape. after 1 year without using any protein shake so decided I needed one. Got this On Whey to see what was all the noise about. have to say. best protein I've ever use. not because of the effects. the effects are the same if you ask me regardless of what brand u get. the difference it's in the taste. how easy it is to swallow, how well it blends with the water. It's just supperb.  don't think I'm changing this protein anytime soon.
 This is one of the only protein powders I can stand the taste of. It's really great for hitting macros while I'm losing weight and a perfect supplement for my boyfriend when he goes to the gym. We both agree on the double chocolate taste and have already bought several containers. It doesn't have the weird chalky after taste that I find with a lot of other supplements.
 Optimum Nutrition Whey protein is the best protein available. The flavor is amazing and easily mixes with water, milk, nut milks, etc. I use it for post workout shakes and home made meal replacement shakes. Chocolate is best with almond milk, some peanut butter, half of a banana. It makes a great smoothie.
 This is the second Optimum Nutrition product I've purchased (the first was the double chocolate protein powder), and I've really liked both.<br/><br/>My initial reason for purchasing this brand is the ingredients list...or lack thereof.  This product has far fewer ingredients than most other protein powders out there, and doesn't include Sucralose (Splenda) which I'm trying to avoid.<br/><br/>Both the Double Chocolate and the Chocolate Mint mix relatively easily with water / milk - sometimes I use a blender, sometimes I don't.<br/><br/>The flavor is good, though definitely not as strong / rich as other protein powders.  But to me, that is an easy tradeoff considering the relatively few ingredients that are included.  If you are used to a different protein powder and only mix it with water, you will likely find this product thin / weak.  Blend it up with some ice or mix it with milk (or some other thicker liquid) and it's great.
 I have tried many protein brands out there and I keep coming back to this brand! One thing I love is that this thing just works! After a hard workout I noticed that I don't even get sore and I'm even ready for another workout. Another thing is that it dissolves really easily-unlike most protein shakes out there that end up with lumps! Great flavor and super easy to drink.
 There really isn't much more to say.  Everyone knows ON is top tier.  You can argue other's taste better or are cheaper, but thats because they're loaded with all kinds of other crap thats not whey (sugar, soy protein, vegetable protein, fat, etc.).  If you want WHEY PROTEIN, ON Whey is just that, no protein blends here.  I had switched to using Muscletech Whey for a year or so, because I can get a 5lb bag at Sam's club for $35, and I'd say it actually tastes better than ON whey.  But the muscletech has soy protein in it (among other things), and I'm intolerant of soy, so I was always on the can after ingesting it.  Switched back to ON whey, and I'm not looking back.  This flavor is pretty good.  Its creamier than the other chocolates.  As always, it mixes very easily.
 Such great protein. It's very tasty and I love mixing it with just water after a workout. Mixed well the texture isn't too think nor thin. It would depend on how much water you add. Also I love using it in my breakfast with oats and granola and some sort of fruit. I used to use honey but have no substitute it with the protein and it saves you big bucks as well as sugar calories!
 I buy the double rich chocolate,the taste its very good mixed whit water its like a cocoa or ovaltine drink.The product mixed very well i dont need a blender,i use only a shaker cup.I drink this after my workouts(best moment for drink),and helps me to give some protein for my body 24 grams per scoop(its like eat a piece of chiken or meat).Use a combination of high protein foods and suplements for building muscle.I play basketball and go to the gym and this product its the best whey protein i drink.After 3 months of hard training i gained 5 lbs of muscle(specialy shoulders and biceps)<br/>OVERALL:<br/><br/>TASTE:very good(go to the basics Chocolate,Vainailla,Strawberry)<br/>MIXING:dont need a blender if you shake whit water<br/>PRICE:I buy 2 lbs. for $15 bucks its a gift<br/>DIGESTION:Good<br/><br/>PD:Trainig hard,eat good,drink whey(after your workouts)and sleep 8 hours,is the best way you bulding muscles.For 15 bucks you have a good dose of protein,sometimes the people spend this money in beer in weekends.
 Great flavor.<br/>Great value.<br/>Would buy again.<br/>Can't speak to results but I am seeing some decent gains over the weeks I've been using it.<br/>After doing a lot of internet research I decided to give this product a try based on the overwhelming number of positive reviews.<br/>I haven't tried any other protein powders so I don't have anything to compare it to.
 ON is always the brand to beat in whey protein. It has the best performance, tasting, and amount of protein in each serving.<br/><br/>Since ON has introduced 2 more options in this category, I'll add in my comparisons. The cheaper alternative being Performance Whey, the standard being 100% Whey Gold Standard, and Platinum Hydro Whey.<br/><br/>Performance Whey does it's job. It does deliver a good amount of protein per serving. However I notice that it does perform differently. It feels like I'm absorbing weak ingredients and much more slowly. It definitely tastes sweeter than the other two. If you want cheap powder, I would still recommend this over any other brand. Also by far it is much better than any generic GNC or Vitamin Shoppe Whey. However, for that money I would invest in 2 boxes of protein bars.<br/><br/>100% Whey Gold Standard is the most reliable for me. If you can afford to buy performance whey, I suggest paying a little more for this. Compared to the others, Gold Standard Whey is more versatile. Since it is somewhat fast absorbing, but not too fast, I can drink it anytime during the day. This one I've used it to get "cut" and also to gain mass (with added ingredients of course.<br/><br/>I must say the Platinum Hydro Whey is my favorite. It is much finer and absorbs much quicker than the rest. It is the best IMO for post workout only. I see most results for 2 months of Hydro Whey.
 Good bang for the buck whey powder.  Taste is okay but the Platinum Hydro-whey definitely tastes much better.  Over 70 servings per container, so this lasts me a couple months quite easily.  Good protein to grams per serving ratio, indicating it's pretty pure with less filler.  Also has good amount of essential amino acids.  The only thing I suggest is holding on to your scoop from the prior tub.  For some reason, ON likes to bury the scoops pretty deep down in the container.  The scoop in this tub was way too far to have gotten there from shifting during shipping.  It was over halfway to the bottom. I'm not in the mood to dig and search nearly all the way to the bottom of the tub for a scoop.
 This is by far the best protein that I have ever had. The most important thinks in regards to protein powder to me is taste and quality. It mixes easily by just shaking. Any other proteins powders that I have purchased in the past have a slight chocolate flavor and can taste like chalk, this one really delivers the chocolate and has no chalky taste. It is nice and creamy even if you just use water, of course milk is better and making it in to a true shake with ice and milk is even better. The one thing I will say is for me I need my protein shakes to be ice cold for the best taste. Anytime I have ever had a protein drink that was lukewarm it was not as creamy, still taste like chocolate but the flavor is much better when I cold. The protein they use is a high quality Whey protein. It has a higher pure protein percentage. 100% whey protein contains 23 grams of protein, only 2-3 grams of carbohydrates and 1.5 grams of fat. I do purchase this from Amazon when I buy, it is about $30 cheaper than you can get in my store (unless there happens to be a sale).
 I've tried a few different Whey Protein supplements over the past few years, and more recently have began counting macros on a daily basis and what I can say, for the price and macros, nothing beats ON Gold Standard. It mixes well by any means of preparation and the double rich chocolate is by far the best flavor - taste and texture wise. Non gritty and mixed with water or milk, it mixes perfectly. at 30g of protein per serving, with minimal carbs and fat (~1g each), it really is the gold standard
 This product is a really good value. I normally use a different brand but recently decided to give this one a try after seeing it on discount and a better value for me. Let me say that I was pleasantly surprised at the content and overall taste of this powder. It goes down well and mixes well with just water. I normally use it in my daily protein shake, but it is easily drinkable with about 4 ounces of water for a scoop. Give it a try if you are serious about good protein, you will like it.
 I've tried many, many different protein powders. I like this product because it is refined protein without fillers and keeps the cholesterol, sodium and carbs to a minimum. It also adds some amino acids including glutamine, so it eliminates the need to always add in separate powders to your shake, unless of course you want MORE than the amino acid serving size in this powder. Taste is okay, but never is "great" drinking in water alone. Mixing or blending with other foods is ideal.
 After reading many reviews since I'm new to protein powders I purchased the double chocolate and it is delicious with unsweetened vanilla almond milk. It can be super sweet so I add a little more than recommended liquid. It reminds me of a yoohoo drink but not as sweet. It dissolves very well in a shaker cup. I could drink it all day! Will update later on actual results.
 Originally I gave this product a bad review... because stupid enough I misread the expiration date. But this is a great protein, have purchased it before in the past. Only complaint, the chocolate may be comparative to ass water when watered down too much. I hear the Mocha is great though. Good protein for the money.
 Look, I'm not gonna try and convince you it's actually delicious. You're not gonna come home trashed from the bar thinking "man I could really go for a DRC protein shake right now". But compared to a lot of the other garbage out there that tastes like dirt and/or death and/or LD50 quantities of artifical sweetener, ON Gold Standard DRC is pretty damn good. And for the price, I don't know anything that beats it. Just don't try to make it without a blender bottle.
 Great product.  I added twelve and a half pounds of solid muscle.  Downside is I need every oz of it to fight off the women attracted to my awesome abs.  Or....or, you can believe it's just a nice protein supplement to hold the appetite in check and it makes for a really good smoothie (with frozen fruit)  or shake.  Believe what you want.
 I'm really liking this whey protein. (Double Rich Chocolate)<br/><br/>The taste is not bad at all. With water the taste is definitely not quite as strong and not quite as good, but with milk the taste is really good. Almost like a light chocolate shake kind of taste.<br/><br/>It does seem to mix differently though. It mixes perfectly with water and I recommend using around 6-8 ounces of water if you're going for taste. With milk on the other hand I use around 10 ounces because it doesn't mix as well. It mixes good but there are random small chunks that don't mix nothing bad though, and the taste helps when you do get those small chunks, but again very minor. This is all done using a blenderbottle.<br/><br/>It's hard for me to say how good the protein actually works, but as far as I can tell it does seem to help muscles recover faster and better.<br/><br/>Mine did come with a scoop for you non believers, it was at the very bottom though so be prepared to dig a little. I used a fork which seems to work just fine at finding the scoop.<br/><br/>Overall great product!
 Whey protein is basically a must have for anyone working out. It helps to increase recovery time and giving your body the protein it needs to assist in rebuilding. Gold standard is pretty much the best brand ive tried to date. Its just a little more pricey than others but worth the cost. This brand has the best flavors all around that I have ever tried. No dusty taste or nasty aftertaste here! I even caught myself drinking it a little slower to enjoy the taste! I highly recommend this is anyone and everyone with an active lifestyle.
 This product packs a protein puch for how small the serving size is. And I was very impressed how easily it stirred into the milk and disolved without the use of a shaker cup. No other protein powder I've used has mixed so easily and what little floaties it had were easily drinkable. Well done! I usually give products a vomplaint or reccomendation, but I have none!
 My wife was looking for a protein to supplement her Crossfit workouts.  A friend recommended this protein powder.  It tastes great!  We are using the chocolate more, but the vanilla version is good too.
 Overall this gets my approval. I had been using a vanilla protein powder by herbalife prior to trying this product but decided to switch after I moved away from a location I was buying it at.<br/><br/>Overall the powder mixes well. I use a blender and toss in some ice cubes, frozen fruit, and milk. It makes for a tasty drink and doesnt is smooth with no chunks or dry parts...slight bit more frothy then the other mix I had though.<br/><br/>In terms of actual effectiveness I have continued to gain weight (my goal) while having one of these shakes each day. I eat 6-12 eggs a day so I am guaranteed to get some traditional protein intake.<br/><br/>I sometimes drink a shake prior to a workout and it sits well enough that I can run or be active and not have an upset stomach,<br/><br/>I still prefer the herbalife protein mix but this product is a fifth of the price and is therefore a much better value. I give it my recommendation to at least be worth trying,
 I bought this for my wife after we had found out that she was allergic to many common foods, including most proteins. After constantly searching past many vanillas and chocolates (also allergens), it was relieving to finally find a good source of protein for my wife without the hidden allergens that was typically found within every other strawberry flavored protein shake. She enjoys the flavor and feels the relief of having some extra protein during the middle of the day.
 Like many of you I have tried numerous protein powders over the years.  Buying a 5 pound tub is quite a commitment when you are switching from Myoplex, but based upon the reviews I figured it would be good.  The taste is solid, although not revolutionary but the protein vs. calorie content and carbs is excellent.  Mostly though, after I workout-I can tell that I am building muscle with this product which I drink twice a day.  Also, it mixes perfectly in a shaker with the little metal thing.  I can have one in the morning and it will keep me fairly satiated for several hours.  I will mix in some Chocolate Halo Top Ice Cream (which is low cal high protein and amazing, by the way) and a half or whole banana.  I am just about finished with this tub and purchased a 6 pound version of this at Costco.  This stuff is legit.
 One of my favorite flavors! Product came intact, fresh date, and good packaging. I use this to supplement or if I have a heavy workout. I mix it with either water or milk and both ways it still tastes great. I even put this into fruit and green smoothies to give it that extra nutrition.
 I could not get over the flavor of this.<br/>It tasted like very, very dark chocolate. Quite bitter, verging on burnt-tasting.<br/>I have since switched to ON's Pro gainer, which I think tastes basically perfect, and is better for my fitness goals.
 This is a really good shake but I'm not trying to be the next Arnold guy haha. I use this to ensure I get my daily protein. It's goes down so smooth and I mainly take it with whole milk. I haven't tried it with anything else but you can literally add it to anything. I did not realize how many flavors they have until I bought it already. I'm going to try strawberry banana next. I'm gaining muscle by just walking to work everyday and feel like I'm getting my much need protein.
 I'm writing this from the perspective of someone who has never been fit and is now trying (once again) to change my lifestyle. I drink two shakes per day made from a single scoop of this protein plus about 8 ounces of water. It gets me my sweet fix and satisfies my appetite (along with a couple of tablespoons of peanut butter). I highly recommend this flavor for anyone who is not used to "healthy" foods.<br/><br/>As for the nutritional value, this brand seems to have a good edge over any competition. From what I have read, the protein is sourced directly by the company that makes it in the U.S. It may have a couple of extra carbs over some other brands, but it's relatively negligible; just park your car a couple of spaces further out and you'll burn it off entirely.
 I recommend checking the listed ingredients on ON's website for the flavor you're planning on buying. Each flavor has its own recipe, and some flavors use the new recipe that doesn't have aminogen. I got the 5 lb tub of double chocolate, which had the aminogen as listed on their website. It mixes well in a simple shake bottle, no clumping/grittiness/after taste. My only complaint is the double chocolate flavor is rather weak, and I'm using only 4 oz of milk to mix (the minimum recommended).
 The tastiest flavor compared to the others I have tried "Double Chocolate" and "Strawberry"
 Gotta get those gains homeboy
 This whey protein is ok but after trying many many different brands I finally found a company who has it together, I highly recommend NutraBio Whey Protein. I have it daily now and love it!
 This is some great stuff.  Low in carbs, fat and high in protein.  THIS IS NOT A MIRACLE PRODUCT.  You wont gain muscle just by taking this product.  You need a proper workout routine and proper nutrition first, whey is just an aid in that process.  Its a fast and convenient way to get protein in your body.<br/><br/>One of the best things about gold standard whey is its flavors.  I've tried 5 so far, double rich chocolate, extreme milk chocolate, malt chocolate, vanilla ice cream, and cake batter.  the only one I didn't care for was the vanilla ice cream (left an odd aftertaste).  But it still tasted better than any other whey protein product I have tasted.  All the others tasted AMAZING.  Cake batter and double rich chocolate especially. ON gold standard whey is also made and sold directly from ON.  This is very important.  Most whey products are made in other countries where toxic materials are accidentally added to the whey through the process (mercury, arsenic, cadmium and lead).  Gold standard has passed all tests for these toxins.<br/><br/>Great product and cheap price here on Amazon!
 I have only ever bought ON Gold Standard Whey, but I have never had a reason to look elsewhere. I started with this brand because it seems to be lower in cholesterol than some of its competitors with a relatively low price-per-serving amount. The powder is not chalky (as I hear some other powders described), and works well for shakes, pancakes, oatmeals, and more. I have tried the Extreme Milk Chocolate and Double Rich Chocolate flavors; I definitely prefer the Extreme Milk Chocolate flavor.<br/><br/>I will definitely continue to buy this powder, and will almost certainly continue to purchase it through Amazon.
 Many individuals stuff their body with various protein powders all day long and I don't want to do this, nor would I want to spend that kind of $. I use this with Gold Standard's creatine powder, 1 shake per day after each workout.<br/><br/>Gold Standard's 100% whey protein is one of the few powders that seems to deliver. It definitely speeds up recovery and with the regular weigh-lifting, it does increase muscle tissue. Don't expect instant results with little effort. It's not magic powder, but it does a great job as a supplement and the flavors are great, particularly Mint Chocolate.<br/><br/>Good value for money, especially the 5 lb tub.
 To me this is the standard protein that I...ahem....weigh, all the other proteins against.  I've bought more of this brand than any other and am amazed at its consistency, price, nutrition profile, and good flavor.  When I get a craving to try  a different product I usually pull this one up, see the nutrition profile of the contender, realize the contenders seem to like to add a lot of sugar and or fat, then click buy this one again.
 My brother swear by this protein, as it has great flavor and makes great shakes.  Even though it is a little expensive, the bag lasts forever, even if you are making shakes every day.  Great value and and even better way to get extra calories in before or after a workout.<br/><br/>Pros: Tastes great, lasts, and is a quality product<br/>Cons: slightly expensive, but worth it in bulk
 Have been ordering this in Vanilla Ice Cream flavor for years. Always had a nice taste. But just got a new tub that advertised "new, improved taste" and when I mixed it as I usually do, it was way too sweet and artificial tasting and didn't have much vanilla flavoring. You have to add lots of extra liquid just to dilute the taste, and then you still get an overly sweet after taste that lingers for a long time. Nasty! Not going to order this anymore.
 The image with the ingredients list on the 5 lb tub is removed as the ingredients have changed recently and they want people to think the box has old ingredients. What limits to go to deceive people into buying a once great rated product by making money off people's trust thinking they would not check the ingredients list again once the product is well established and quietly go back and mess with the product and add "Unoptimum Nutrition" ingredients. Shame.
 I purchased this in the Chocolate Mint flavor, and I absolutely love the flavor. Although, it has this sort of airy, kind of light taste to it that I also really enjoy. Also, there are no unnatural flavorings such as sucralose, and that is what really made it great! I usually make about a 30 oz shake with 2 scoops, a banana, and some ice, withe the base liquid being unsweetened vanilla almond milk. I can already see some major improvements in my physique due to this supplement!
 It has been a long time since I've used protein powder, and comparing what I used to take to this product, protein powders have come a long way!!  This product mixes easily (I use a shaker with a ball in it), it tastes good (especially with milk, not so much--although still not too bad--with water), and it doesn't give much flatulence/gas/cramps.  Whether or not it assists with my exercise goals only time will tell, but for taste, convenience, and  cost I heartily recommend this product.
 This tastes great! It mixes well in a shaker bottle, in smoothies, oatmeal cookies, everything! It's got a better flavor and texture (less chalky) than meal replacements, so I usually do half this, half that. I will continue to by this!
 A colleague at work turn me on to this.  I've been using it for a awhile and seems to have a positive impact on my post workouts.  I am still in a work in progress, so it will take some time before I full see the results.  So far, so good.  For the amount of servings and the quality of the product, I feel its a decent price.
 Taste great high quality product, Gold standard has been around forever it seems. They are expensive but so are the ingredients they use, don't sacrifice quality just to save a few dollars. This is an American made product that is tested for quality and purity, however a portion of the ingredients do come from international sources. I've been using gold standard protein since I discovered it 10 years ago, I've used a ton of other products over the years, but I've always returned to this one.
 Compared all of the ingredients and percentages and such and this item measured up to some of the better protein supplements on the market.  Very competitive price.  All else was identical; easy of use, how well it mixed and tasted, consistency, etc.
 I purchased this product because I wanted to give it a try. I've been weightlifting for about 3 years and I occasionally switch up my protein supplement and buy a different companies product just to try it out. This is, without a doubt, my favorite protein powder. I mix one rounded scoop of this with one teaspoon of their creatine powder in with milk immediately after getting home from lifting. I also believe I have had the most overall benefit from this product.<br/><br/>I have tried both double rich chocolate and I currently have the extreme milk chocolate. Between the two I prefer double rich chocolate, although there is not much of a difference. They both taste great and are among the best tasting powders I have tried.
 Fitting into my macros this really comes in handy. 24 grams of protein per scoop isn't to shabby. Another thing I noticed was that with cheaper brands I would have protein clunks in the bottom of my shaker. I havent really had that problem with Optimum's brand.  This protein is my go to protein before and after my workout and their Casein protein is what I take before bed. My advice is to spend the extra money and get quality nutrition supplements. The old saying goes " you are what you eat".
 I love how easily this dissolves. I used to drink muscle pharm cookies and cream, which understandably was chunky and was a lot harder to mix. I wanted something that tasted just as good, but wasn't always so chunky and tasted good even if my water wasn't ice cold. This stuff is amazing! Tastes just like chocolate milk for me and I've even added this into my milkshakes or smoothies.
 Tastes artificial and disgusting. From other reviews, it seems they've changed the formula to include the artificial sweetener sucralose, which is probably why. Do not buy this garbage until they change it back. I find it hilarious that the manufacturer is commenting that other brands use artifical sweeteners. I don't care, I can find ones that don't. This tastes terrible, and that's that.
 Not fully sure how I feel about this protein. It mixes rather well, easily goes down and isn't gritty or anything....buy it's taste is not on spot. It in fact at first was a bit repulsive. I had t mix this with less water to keep it a little thiker and flavourful compared to other brands or flavors I've had. I typically get a chocolate or vanilla.This  has been the least of my favorite chocolates yet.<br/><br/>Points are for mix ability and actual ability to drink, not taste.
 I usually get the Double Rich Chocolate flavor, but I read a review on here comparing all the flavor offerings and stating Rocky Road to be the best, so I figured I'd try a new flavor. Let me say: It's delicious, and I highly recommend it. Look no further! As a vegetarian, it can sometimes be difficult to ensure I get enough protein everyday, but I take 2 scoops daily, and it's easily one of the best ways to increase your protein intake. ON really nailed it, and they've earned a customer for life.
 Many protein powders can be chalky tasting but the Op Nutrition Double Rich Chocolate is smooth for a powder. While it says Double Rich, it's not overly rich, which is nice. It just tastes like Chocolate.<br/><br/>I have a magic bullet blender, so with some milk, a scoop of powder, a tablespoon of peanut butter and a few ice cubes and you end up with a tasty smoothy.<br/><br/>Per container there are 74 servings of 24 grams of protein/scoop which equates to .73 per smoothy (excluding milk and pnb). I haven't tried it with water or used a shaker to check the solubility because the magic bullet works magic.<br/><br/>You just can't beat the price or taste. Whether you're working out or not, it makes for a nice supplement to get you to your next meal.
 Like many, I've tried multiple brands of protein powder.  Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard is my final choice for protein, for both performance and taste.<br/><br/>The Double Rich Chocolate flavor is the safest bet in terms of flavor.  I love it!  I mix this with water after a workout, and sometimes have it with Almond Milk if it's available.  Even with just water, it has a great taste.
 I went from around 200 lbs, down to 140 lbs and realized that now I was now way to scrawny. Time to beef up with some help from this whey protein.<br/>I love to use it in the morning with some fruit and peanut butter for a wonderful shake that's filling and helps me with gainz.<br/>I also like to do things like sprinkle it on oatmeal, and I've even used it to make my own homemade protein bars.<br/>Highly recommended.
 I have been using this protein for years and love it! I had a problem with my order, which ended up being my fault. After I emailed the company, April called me back, yes, CALLED me back! NO email or auto response BS! She called to address my concern, figured out the problem and fixed it! This is why I LOVE Optimum Nutrition! There is so much S#$T out there these days in the supplement world. This is why I  have and will continue to trust and use Optimum Nutrition products!
 Great Product, just received and immediately opened to try after reading about bad taste. I was pleasantly surprised, tastes great, very easy mix, absolutely no complaints. I’m putting in an order for 10 pounds next time, very happy with the product, it has an excellent protein to calorie ratio.
 i love this product! this is my 3rd time to order. i ordered 1lb the first time (to see if i like the flavor, and i so loved it right off the bat!!) bought 10lbs after, but i calculated and it's cheaper to buy 5lbs lol. 😜 but my point is, i've been using this for a year now and it helps me a lot with post-workout meal for energy and i feel like it helps me gain muscles too.
 I'd say it was an acquired taste. After the 3rd or 4th time I used it, I thought it actually wasn't that bad. I usually mix one scoop with 20oz with water. The faint taste of strawberry is actually pretty good. I think I might even prefer it over the chocolate!
 Great taste, can be used in baking recipes, and super high quality protein. This stuff has been around forever. Try some fancier, newer proteins if you'd like. Some of them are pretty good. But this stuff has always been the best.
 I am 50 years old and i have been taking ON double rich chocolate for the past four months it taste really well, mixes great, not to sweet,low in saturated fat, sodium and cholesterol which is very important to me at my age.I work out three to four times a week with weights taking the my protein as the second thing in the morning that is after my glass of water and after i work out.I even take it on the days i dont work out but once for the day first thing in the morning to feed those hungry muscles. I drink it with plain water and so far so good my gains have improved but i will give myself six months to really see if there is any great difference. But i must say  i can see and feel the difference.A lot of people take different proteins but they dont give them enough time to see if they really work and they just blame the brand.My advice is to check the label and do some research. The only down fall is the artificial sweeteners but if you check most products on the market you will see the same. My brother has the natural but i dont really like it.IN Two months i would come back with a new review because that is also when i do my full blood test.
 Best deal and taste for the money. I am not usually picky because it IS protein but my boyfriend had some of this and I was very impressed! I had to immediately order my own!! The extreme milk chocolate is excellent. Super easy to mix and has not caused any "digestive side effects" that I have experienced with other protein supplements. It tastes just fine when made with water but when mixed with a little bit of milk (I usually do half water half milk with a bit of crushed ice if I'm in a hurry) it ends up with this creamy frothy layer that makes it that much better. If you have time to put it in a blender, (handheld works too) its amazing. Try putting half a scoop in with a serving of plain cooked oatmeal and some strawberries for a super quick and very satisfying breakfast.
 This protein is very tasty and is something that I personally look forward to after my workout. I recommend mixing it with milk because it makes it taste even better. Optimum Nutrition is a brand I am very loyal to and it's because you always get the same quality everytime you reorder. This protein helps muscles recover after intense workout and has dramatically made a difference to me. It's something that also motivates me to workout so that I don't eat chocolate I know I can drink this after a work out.
 I've used several different brands of whey protein over the past few years and I must say that a lot of the advertising is just to get you to spend the extra $20 or so that most brands charge.  Sure, people might have their opinions or their favorites and I won't knock that at all but from my personal expierence I have gotten great results off this product, just as much if not more than I have any other brand of whey protein and it's one of the cheapest out of all of them so I have been using this consistently for about a year now.  "If it ain't broke, don't fix it".  This product works great, once you figure out a flavor you like (not all taste good) I highly suggest and reccomend this product to anyone that is looking for an excellent whey protein supplement!
 Coming from the Extreme Chocolate Milk On's Whey Protein, and let me tell you this is so GOOD I'm making the switch from milk chocolate to the White Chocolate. For me the the taste is well balanced and it is really smooth to drink.
 I haven't really used protein powders before so I was a little concerned about flavor and consistency (I've had shakes pre-made from the store that are just awful). This stuff is pretty decent. It has a mildly chocolatey flavor that isn't too overbearing, so it's easy to down one after a workout without feeling nauseous (if you are prone to that after a workout). It's good with both water or milk, but the milk rounds out the flavor a little better.<br/><br/>It mixes well, even by stirring or shaking, although some little chunks float to the top. Nothing bad though. If you have the opportunity to mix it at home and have one of those hand blenders, that is the way to go for sure. Mixes nice and smooth.
 I have purchased this product twice in the last 9 months. It truly saves you money and time.<br/><br/>The product itself is a great protein supplement.<br/><br/>No, it doesn't work magic or turn you into a muscle God overnight (you'll need an actual routine and proper bulk diet for that).<br/><br/>But the money and time you save with the 10 pound bag of Gold Standard makes it unbeatable. This will be my go to every 3 months.<br/><br/>FYI - I've purchased the Vanilla Ice Cream and the Double Rich Chocolate... The The Double Rich Chocolate tastes WAY better than the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor. When I mix the DRC with milk, I truly feel like I'm drinking chocolate milk. Haha!
 One of the worst protein shakes I have ever had. The nutritional facts look good but the taste is so bland. I just screwed myself over because I have 5 lbs of this and it will take a very long time to finish. Once I’m done though, I’m going back to muscle milk.
 Normally protein powders taste awful but this one tastes great. It mixes easily compared to other Whey proteins that I have tried. The 10 lb bag is very cost effective. Love it for my regular whey protein needs.
 Something was off about the tub we got. I can’t remember if it was the taste or what (double chocolate flavor) don’t know what really, but we hardly used it because of that. We’ll just keep getting this from our local vitamin store instead of online.
 This is the only whey protein that doesn't upset my stomach. mixes well and doesn't taste bad. I would rather spend a little more on a quality product than a protein powder that makes me sick or I can barely drink
 I hadn't used any powdered protein drinks in a few years so I thought I'd get back into it since I started working out again.  I'm not sure if it's adding any muscle mass or not (that might be all attributable to lifting free weights), but for me it's an efficient way to get 1/2 my daily protein for the day.  The Extreme Milk Chocolate flavor is pretty good too.  Tastes like I'm drinking a somewhat watered down chocolate shake.  Tastes better when I mix it with milk, but I normally just use cold water.  Tip:  Use a shaker bottle and put the water or milk in first...then add in the powder.  Seems to mix better that way for me.
 Fantastic protein powder. It tastes really good and dissolves very easily with water or milk. Its a very good standard protein and I don't see a reason to switch to any other brand. I have been drinking this for a couple of years now and it has stayed the same, ON is a tried and true brand that never disappoints.
 I mix 3 scoops of the chocolate flavor with 3 cups of milk and a spoonful of peanut butter to make a delicious shake with ~95g of protein after every workout. I've been building muscle WAY faster ever since and it tastes delicious. Note: MUST use a blender, mixing by hand is a no-go.
 I purchased this product about 2 mouths ago before that i had the double chocolate one which was much better taste like chocolate milk didn't have a weird taste at all and was very good. The cookies and cream takes some time to get used to because has a strong oder and is kind of overwhelming but taste is not bad at all i rate it a  4 because it is not as good as the double chocolate.<br/><br/>  Sense using whey protein products i will not change to any other i like you read reviews on much of the things that i buy online because i don't want to buy shit and waste my money.  This product will help you build mass depending on the size in which you already are if you skinny and want to put on muscle i would probably go with a different product which has more calories because this product is not full of calories it is very easy to digest in your system not a lot of side affects to using this product this price is great on amazon GNC is very over priced so i never would get it there same stuff almost 80 bucks well you see the difference.<br/>Well hope this helps you find the right protein for you there are tons other products out there but this one is great if you dont want to gain weight and build healthy mass.
 I'd stay away from the cake batter. I knew better to always get a chocolate flavor protein. The cake batter is pretty gross but hey I just slam it anyways. As far as the powder itself On is a trusted brand and you can't go wrong.
 Good protein powder but the Cookies &amp; Cream flavor is awful. Trust me, just avoid it. I can mix it with other stuff and can drink it, but it's not a good flavor. Won't buy it again! Vanilla Ice Cream/Extreme Chocolate are much better. Chocolate gets a bit rich after a while so prefer the Vanilla as you can mix with other stuff if you want.  Haven't tried the other flavors. ON is good quality overall.
 I love the optimum nutrition line. I have been using there products for years. Their protein powders taste great and not chalky like others. The choclate tastes great and for the price i think that ON is one of the best choices. I use this as a recovery drink and take some in a shaker for work when i cant have lunch or get hungry.The 5 lbs lasts a good three months.
 This is a good protein at a relatively decent price. There are some cheaper options out there but Optimum seems to have a good reputation for quality. The powder mixes easily in milk and water. I use a Blender Bottle, without the wisk, and there is no clumping or mixability issues at all. Also, I've had no issues with digestibility, again in milk and water. I'm somewhat lactose intolerant so this was something of a concern for me (I only drink it in 8 ounces of milk once a day to avoid any GI issues). Also, the double rich chocolate tastes really good. Mixed with water it's okay but mixed with the Skim Plus milk that I use when I take it before bed, it tastes as good as any chocolate milk or milkshake. I wish I could say the same for the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor, which tastes terrible. I bought a 5-gallon jug in an attempt to mix things up but the flavoring is terrible. I'm definitely not looking forward to choking down the rest of that jug. I started to mix one scoop of this flavor with the vanilla to make it more palatable but now I'm just looking to finish it off as quickly as possible.
 All 3 flavors I've tried were completely flavorless!  No other brand of protein I've tried (7-8 brands) has been close to such a lack of flavor.
 I used Cytogainer in high school and put on 35lbs in 4 months, went from 6'4", 160 to 195lbs. It worked well to gain weight considering its a meal replacement. Fast forward 7 years and I started lifting again using cheap Costco Cytosport 100% Whey. It helped my put on 10lbs in 9 weeks but it just seemed to be of poor quality. I decided to start cutting and switched to ON Gold Standard and I could tell right away the quality was much better then what I had been using. I only use Protein powder post-workout and I felt much better an hour after taking Gold Standard then an hour after taking Cytosport. It works great, mixes very well, and tastes good. I also started using the ON multivitamin, fish oils, and CLA's which seem of very good quality as well. I'll definitely be sticking with ON for these products.
 Surprisingly great tasting. Did not even notice that it was Whey. Did not have a gritty taste like most do.
 Great product. Tastes great (I've tried the chocolate and vanilla and enjoy both), dissolves quickly/easily by shaking, high protein value and good mix of amino acids. I recommend this highly.<br/>If I could change one thing, it would be to have the company reduce the cholesterol content. (Soy has no cholesterol, but I prefer the whey for overall nutrition).<br/>All in all this is a great product, best whey product I've found, used it daily for years and will continue ordering unless/until I find a lower cholesterol rival that tastes and mixes as well with the same high protein value. Recommended. (Works great as a blender smoothie with bananas, strawberries etc, and also works well mixed with just hot water; tastes then like water-based hot cocoa).<br/><br/>Great for backpacking or for travel; get up, mix a shake, start your day.
 Drinkability 10/10<br/>Protein Count 9/10<br/><br/>I'm not even much of a chocolate guy, but this drink in 8oz of water with 1 scoop of the mix is very drinkable.<br/><br/>I read some reviews about some sweeteners in this mix and how it's slightly unhealthy but honestly I think this is a great mix of high protein count per serving along with taste. I had some Nectar Orange mix before this one and I can tell you the difference is amazing.<br/><br/>If you're a hardcore gym rat trying out for the World's Strongest Man competition then you should probably consider the advice of these sweeteners. If you're a normal guy just trying to build some muscle while not getting sick of the 5 pounds of mix you just bought, this is a great way to go.
 My first concern when considering any supplement is taste.  If the taste is intolerable, I wont use it.  One scoop of Gold Standard whey protein mixes with 6-8 ounces of liquid.  I simply mix the chocolate-flavored powder in water with a spoon and drink it in 5-6 gulps.  You could use a blender or a shaker cup, but the taste is so good that I don't mind a few small clumps.  I always take one scoop after a workout and usually one in the morning depending on my breakfast.  The manufacture date is on the bottle and I was pleased to find that my bottle was made the same month it was shipped.  I trust that the protein itself is of high quality.  I will never buy another protein supplement again.
 Cookies &amp; Cream is a great flavor. Really enjoyed this one and it's probably the best tasting version that I have tried to date!<br/><br/>As I have stated previously, I have bought a bunch of supplements from these guys and I'm never disappointed. That's why I keep coming back! There are a lot of options in the supplement game, but I'm sticking with Optimum Nutrition!
 This is everyone's go-to protein, and most people here will already know how good of a product it is. Great price, great calorie:protein ratio if you're cutting weight. I'm mostly here to review Mocha Cappucino flavor and I have to say it's really good. It's a bit strong, so if you're a two-scoops kind of dude it might be a little overbearing unless you dilute it a little more than usual but that's a very minor complaint. I put shots of espresso in it as a pre-workout drink since I'm doing IF right now for cutting.
 Truly is the gold standard of whey protein. Great tasting, and mixes great with water or milk. The price is extremely fair and you get what you pay for. Most cheaper proteins are loaded with fillers and sugars, but not this one. Great protein ratio, 70+ servings, great tasting... you cannot beat this product.
 Worth the money.  It's excellent protein for what I wanted.<br/><br/>PROS<br/>It's 100% whey protein.  Not a blend of inferior proteins and marketing gimmicks.<br/>It tastes good and blends easier than any other protein I've had before.<br/>Optimum Nutrition is a trusted name in the market and offers a full range of excellent products if you want to go all out.<br/><br/>CONS<br/>It's not really a con to me because I knew what I was getting but I think it's worth noting since I previously used things like Muscle Milk before and other supplements that were more or less all in one.  This is just protein and can be expensive to use extensively.
 The best quality of protein in the market, none of that fake hyped up stuff the guys at the nutrition stores try to sell you, I’ve lost 65lbs working out &amp; replenishing with this protein &amp; doubles in each of my gains with this bad boy powder decreasing my soreness &amp; building my muscle along the way, love it, no other protein matters. Oh! And the Mocha is the best flavor HANDS DOWN!!!
 This is the first protein mix that I've bought. I've tried plant-based protein mixes and this is 100 times better. It was shipped nicely and arrived early. It tastes great. This is perfect for someone who's just starting out trying protein mix. It tastes like chocolate without tasting to gritty. Definitely going to be buying the second when I run out, but it won't be for a while because the containers are huge! I would definitely recommend :)
 Hands down this is the best protein powder I have found. Its great in water or milk and is a fantastic edition to smoothies! Be sure to add it to your Subscribe and Save to save an additional 5%/15%! There really isn't a better deal out there.
 I didn't realize this had sucralose in it. It's surprising to me that a product marketed to health-conscious people would contain this nasty chemical. Can't use this, especially now that I'm pregnant. It sucks that protein powders often contain sweeteners. I wish they were left out so I could add my own as needed.
 This stuff. Is awesome. Why is it awesome? Because unlike other protein powders I have tried it mixes evenly with whatever I put it in and it lasts for a while. I still have the first one that I bought a few months ago because I am not incredibly regular with it and don't always need a full scoop. I had a powder before that made me gag when I tried to get it down so it is really nice to have this. It even mixes with water (I got the cookies and cream flavor) evenly. While it doesn't taste HORRIBLE in water It isn't something I look forward to doing. However, try mixing it in coffee. It works quite well with the taste of coffee. Though you will probably find yourself just wanting the coffee flavor now and again. I plan on buying again most likely in a different flavor just to try it.
 I've tried my fair share of protein powders and have to say this is one of the best.<br/><br/>The POSITIVE:<br/><br/>Good Taste - The Double Chocolate tastes more like rich chocolate milk then the generic brands.<br/><br/>Mixes Well - This is a big one for me... I hate when there's chunks no matter how well you try to mix it. This Gold Standard Whey protein seems to mix well, especially if you blend it.<br/><br/>Cost - The price isn't too bad especially if you buy the 5 pound container. It's not as cheap as you'd find some generic brands, but there's a reason it's cheaper.<br/><br/>The NEGATIVE:<br/><br/>Nothing I can really think of... I'm strictly speaking about the Double Chocolate flavor though.<br/><br/>OVERALL:<br/><br/>It's a great protein powder. I definitely recommend it to everyone.
 Great value for the price. In general I love the brand Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100%, but I wouldn't recommend their banana cream flavor. The artificial banana taste is very noticeable and unfortunately lingers in your mouth.
 I got this in coffee flavor and I have to say--not bad :) The protein goes into the liquid well, regardless if it is water, milk or tea. There is just a tiny bit of a funny aftertaste to it. But not at all bad comparatively to many other protein shakes out there that I tried. I have to say so far this is the most "user-friendly" one.<br/>I'm a climber so I take it with me to the wall. I usually use a 28oz mixing bottle (BlenderBottle®), I just put in 2 scoops and top it of with skim milk---perfection. After workout on my way home I follow it with a banana.
 I 'used' to HATE protein shakes.  This stuff is very tolerable, I mix it with Carnation IB, brownies, fruit, schnapps, and milk to get a nutrient drink down my damaged esophagus.
 the best protein I know. I get results. My Doctor did tell me that I should consume actual food and that this is just an industry trying to take advantage of people. I still take it hahahahh. I had a kidney test and I passed it so I guess it cant be that bad. I hope I don't get cancer or something major.
 The Best Protein you can buy. I'm lactose intolerant and it's easy on my stomach. I can take two doses a day with no problems. Taste is second to none (either Chocolate flavor).
 Excellent tasting protein powder. This is some of the best protein powder I've ever used. It mixes well with water or skim milk. It clumps up a bit more in fatty whole milk or eggnog, but is still tasty. I'll definitely be purchasing this brand of protein powder again.
 The first whey protein I used was ON, and I've never changed since.<br/><br/>I'm not one that goes too in-depth on the nutritional facts like the one-star reviewers complaining about the changed formula. As an average person looking to aid in protein intake for workouts, I just see 24g protein per scoop. As long as the price is right and it tastes good, I'm happy.<br/><br/>The strawberry banana flavor, when mixed with milk, tastes pretty authentic to a milkshake. It is a refreshing change to chocolate chocolate chocolate.
 Not good tasting. Not even close to "double choc". Did not matter what you mixed it with. Just my opinion and my taste. I will not buy again.
 I am not a nutritionist so I can not verify the nutrition of the quality of this whey protein, however, I can give you the perspective of an average non-weightlifter. I read the reviews and comparisons for this product and other whey protein powders and finally chose this product. It was a great choice, I can see why it is #1 on Amazon. I love the taste of this powder, it is not too sweet, nor does it make me feel the need to puke like other powders I have tried. This goes great with chocolate milk or almond milk. I have not tried it with other milks or beverages, but my friends drink it with skim and says it still tastes fantastic. This is a lot of protein powder. I have used it maybe 4 days out of my week. I will certainly buy this product again one day when I finally finish this massive amount of protein powder. The quality and quantity for this cheap price of this product is amazing.
 very satisfied.  ON products are, in my opinion, the best.  they offer a great balance of quality with affordability.  are there better tasting shakes?  sure, but be prepared to pay up to THREE TIMES as much, especially when drinking 2-3 shakes a day.  the ON vanilla ice cream flavor is one of our favorites.  my husband uses them to supplement his diet because he needs like 4000+ calories a day; i use them occasionally as meal replacement shakes.  if you buy those expensive name or store brand premixed meal replacement shakes, or even their powders to mix your own meal replacement shakes, check out ON whey - the ingredients are better (imho) and the nutritional benefits are better.  these shakes have significantly less sugar and much more protein than highly marketed 'meal replacement' shakes.
 This is the absolute best protein powder I have ever tasted! It's not all chunky and grainy like some are. The taste is divine and the protein grams are significant. I normally use almond milk with a little cow's milk for variety. I bought the huge bag in order to save money. Definitely recommend this product.
 I have been using this protein forever. Seems to be good quality although I don't exactly have a lab at home to test the purity. The coconut chocolate flavor is average. Its more of a coconut aftertaste.  I think I will go with just straight chocolate next time.
 This is a great protein powder.  I have bought some of the 10lb bags to try and save money.  The zipper doesn't seem to work on them, but otherwise it isn't that much of an inconvenience.  I am very bummed by the price hikes- like others I may move to another powder as this was so much cheaper when I started buying it in 2013.  I recently found another powder in a brick and mortar store that was pretty comparable and slightly cheaper, but the taste isn't as good.  In the end my wallet may win out, especially once my current supply gets low.
 I love the flavor of this protein powder. I was a bit skeptical of chocolate mint flavor based on bad experiences with terrible tasting protein powders in the past, but I'm glad I tried it-so good! I mix it with water and drink it post-weight lifting, and I think it tastes great like that; I'm sure it'd be even better with milk. I imagine it would also be a good way to beef up baked goods-I'm thinking some mint chocolate protein brownies sound pretty good.
 I like chocolate, but chocolate protein powders are typically not very tasty. The Extreme Milk Chocolate tastes great.  Not too sweet, or too thick, or just funky tasting.  Has a nice chocolatey taste that works great mixed with water, and I drink over ice.  The low sugar and calories with quality protein is a great thing. Works great added to a smoothie.  I like one scoop of extreme milk chocolate with half a banana, some frozen blueberries and strawberries, 1/2 of a low fat/sugar yogurt, (like the Yoplait 100 calorie variety.  I use vanilla or strawberry banana.),1 big teaspoon of peanut butter, chia/flax seeds, almond milk and crushed ice.  Blend it up and enjoy.
 Optimum Nutrition has the best tasting protein shakes I have ever had. I have tried my fair share of protein from cheap to overly priced and not much can compete with the flavor. I have had the regular chocolate, double chocolate and French Vanilla Creme, all of them awesome. Also, they have very low sugar content so the shakes aren't overly sweet. and 24g of protein per serving is competitive with the others. Defiantly going to have to try some more flavors.
 Hands down the best tasting protein mix you can buy.  It also mixes very well.  No chalky texture.  Tastes great.  Been using this for years and won't buy any other brand.  Always buy the rich or milk chocolate.  You get what you pay for.
 I am very pleased with this product. When i recieved it there was a dent in it, but the product was otherwise fine.  I like the flavor this french vanilla. It blends nicely as does the coffee flavored whey. They both taste fine in water, and fantastic in milk; if you mix it with milk. If you mix it with oatmeal french vanilla is much better than the coffee whey. Sometimes i like to add just a sprinkle of cinnamon for a great coffee cinnamon combo.
 My number one choice for a post workout protein shake. The normal routine I do is a total body with three sets of 30. The other product I used left me feeling muscle soreness several days afterwards. With this one, I might have a tiny bit on day two after the gym. Plus the best part, it is delicious.
 I use milk, not water to make the shakes, but it's surprising just how good the regular chocolate flavor is. All this without a ton of sugar either. Dissolves pretty well if you shake it, not as well if mixed with a spoon. I don't even use a blender bottle, just a mason jar with a lid.
 I do Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and your general sort of fitness training 5-6 days a week. For competitions I have to cut weight but still maintain the muscle I've built as well as extremely high energy levels. Over the past year, this protein powder has helped me do just that. I've tried 4 other protein powders in the past, none of which have provided these results (plus, they all tasted horrible).<br/><br/>In terms of flavor, I've tried the strawberry banana, cookies and cream, chocolate mint, cake batter, keylime pie, and french vanilla creme. I hated both the strawberry banana and the cookies and cream. To me, they both had a sort of artificial sweetener taste to them that I couldn't get past (although my boyfriend loves the strawberry banana). The chocolate mint is a pretty solid flavor, but tastes much better with almond milk than with water and I needed something to mix well with just water. I found that cake batter was terrible on its own, but delicious when mixed with other flavors (e.g. 1/2 scoop cake batter and 1/2 scoop strawberry). Keylime was good, but was a strong enough flavor that it couldn't really be mixed with anything else, which meant that by the time I got down to the last scoop, I was SO sick of it. Finally, the French vanilla creme is by far my favorite flavor. It is sweet, but fairly subtle compared to some of the other flavors. This is nice because it can be used as the base for many other flavors when I am craving something a little different (e.g. I've mixed it with peanut butter, mashed banana, blended berries, added it to chia seed pudding, added it to pancakes and waffles, etc.). All-around, fantastic!
 I put that "I love this" product, but I'm not so sure. I'm a big believer in Optimum nutrition and their products and have bought numerous products from them for years, but I read recent research that claims that their claims don't stand up when tested. This does not contain what they say, but you'd be hard pressed to find a protein that did I'm afraid. I'll be switching to Pure Pharma after this bottle is empty.
 This is a great protein powder, doesn’t have a weird taste like others. It tastes good and have a great fragrance. You can mix it with mix or even only with water or make a smoothie with it, it goes perfectly with everything.
 Hands down one of the best quality proteins you get for the money.  If you are watching carb intake, this is one of the best, with only Isopure being slightly better, albeit significantly more expensive.  At the end of the day, you can compare numbers all you want, and no two products will identically match up, BUT...<br/><br/>Bang for your buck, Optimum Nutrition makes a great product, and I will be ordering again when needed.
 Optimum Nutrition is known for producing high-quality, affordable supplements. The Gold Standard whey protein seems to be their staple product, and for good reason. I use the double-rich chocolate, which tastes just fine, and doesn't cost as much as the more... exotic flavors (banana cream, anyone?). I've noticed that I often end up with a bit of an after taste on days when I use it following my early-morning workout (hence the 4 stars instead of 5), but it is not terrible. I'd recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a solid base protein supplement.
 This has been my go to protein for years, the price is great and the flavor is as well. It even has lower carbs then a lot of proteins I've seen so i am still drinking it with almond milk while on the Keto diet since I lift daily.
 I actually wasn't impressed with the cake batter flavor. I wasn't impressed with the rocky road either. So far, chocolate peanut butter has been the best. This protein is amazing. The reviews speak for themselves. No bubble guts, no bloated feeling, and great results. This is the third 5 pound tub I've bought. I gave muscle pharm a try, but want as impressed. The cookies and cream want that great either. In the end, optimum nutrition is the best
 Never before was I dissapointed at at a Gold product except for this one purchase.  The Mocha Flavor just does not come thru. Taste is not bad, but not strong enough for me.  I tried it for 4 days  with different amounts and different ways trying to find the right way to bring out the flavor. Regular milk, water, smoothie, almond milk, coconut milk and always ended with a decent flavor but not the coffee taste I was looking for.
 It works really well and tastes pretty good.  I have used other protein powders, so when I first started using this it threw me off as I was using way too much water.  I was used to using a full glass, but when I did it was obviously watered down so you will have to find the right level for you after you start using it.
 I got the extreme milk chocolate but let me start off by saying I am REALLY picky about the taste of foods or drinks,I've tried a bunch of whey protein and threw up on each one I tried. I couldn't stomach any of them or even hold my nose and deal with it until now!This taste nothing like a protein shake and taste like chocolate milk. I usually add bananas and skim milk with a little nestle cocoa powder and it adds so much more flavor. For the price this thing taste amazing and is a huge container, I would recommend this to anyone looking to try whey protein!
 I am not an expert on protein powder, but from many of the articles I read, this was ranked one of the best. Also, this chocolate flavor is probably the best tasting protein powder I've tried - I usually put it in almond milk, but I have even put it in water and it still tastes great!!
 After doing much research, I started buying Optimum Nutrition's Whey Gold Standard protein several years ago. This is my new favorite flavor (although I've only tried about 5 of their many flavors), and I am on my fourth or fifth container of it. My favorite mix of it is with water, a touch of fiber powder and a little bit of liquid coconut oil. It mixes easily in a shaker with either cold milk, cold water, or hot tap water. I plan on adding fruit and maybe yogurt at some point in time. I would highly recommend any flavor of this protein mix, and this one in particular.
 Being someone who works out 4 times a week lifting weights, I've been taking a Whey Protein to supplement my training for the past couple years. I've generally taken 2 brands/types, Syntha6 and Organic Protein. I have to say this one sits in between the 2 when it comes to taste. While all 3 have enough protein and nutrients with relatively the same amount of calorie, the fact is, if it doesn't taste good then it's not a good experience. They're all going to do the job but the key is the taste which determines the experience of using this.<br/><br/>I chose the chocolate version of this one and in my opinion, the taste is a bit off. I prefer the taste of Syntha6 and will probably go back to it once this massive container is done.
 By far my most favorite protein out and I've tried many. Cost, flavor and mix ability are all great. I saw great gains over the past two months of using this protein. But everyone is effected differently and this is just my opinion, will continue to buy and most likely have it added to my monthly subscription.
 These huge bags are the best. The last a long time. My only gripe is my parents wanted Strawberry which I personally find disgusting. Go chocolate all the way. Seems like the only flavor whey manufactures don't screw up. You can buy better, more pure protein, but it will come in much smaller quantities for the same price. Need simple whey protein for pre or post workout shakes? This is best. It also blends very well, even when adding other supplements to it. I mix it in a magic bullet and it comes out perfectly. But even a shaker is enough to mix this great protein.
 I ordered the vanilla ice cream flavor of this product. Since then I have been having one scoop per day on average. Although it is not a meal replacement, I do notice that my body has been healing a lot faster after my workout with the extra daily protein. The big jar is a very good value and comes with a scooper. I have not tried any of the other flavors, but this one works great at satisfying your craving for sweets.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this product to a friend.
 This is one of the top products in the market. If you are into chocolate milk shakes, try the Extreme milk chocolate. for 53 bucks, you get a really quality protein powder that doesn't taste like medicine. Not just the taste, the results from using this product is also great.<br/>This product won't make you gassy or have other stomach issues. You can mix it with water or skimmed milk(if you mix it with whole milk, it will taste just like a chocolate drink). It mixes well and you won't see any lumps and goes down your throat smooth. In my opinion, best price and best quality and best results.. Get this if you are looking for a protein powder after you got tired of trying other yucky products in the market.
 This is by far the best protein I have purchased in a long time. It isn't too sweet, mixes well, and tastes great! I usually have to put someone in with my protein (fruit, oats, pb, etc) in order to like the taste, but the Double Rich Chocolate on its own tastes fantastic! Almost like Ovaltine or the SF Swiss Miss...I am actually going to try making hot chocolate with it this winter! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
 great product if you are into workouts and building muscle or even losing weight. 24g of protein, 5.5g BCAA all in one small serving is valuable for the $46 price tag found in amazon.com and free shipping beats GNC and other supplement shops. So far i have only tried the vanilla ice cream and strawberry flavor (strawberry is banging!) and i must say they both taste great, i bet the other flavors are just as tasty, so many to choose from. Blends well with water and can be used to mix with other food like oats, fruits etc. I take 2 scoops a day (1 scoop while at work and another with creatine after working out) remember that this is a "supplement" do not replace your regular high protein  meals with shakes, use it with 4 or 5 daily meals and you will get gains!
 I purchased this for my husband who works out avidly, to use post workout. The flavor was spectacular and he said the quality of the protein is fantastic and very noticeable, as he has tried others in the past. The price is amazing. It seems quite steep but keep in mind you are paying pretty much the exact same as you would for an inferior quality protein at walmart, that is almost all fillers. Will definitely purchase again, and try a new flavor.
 I was able to push myself hard in the gym with no worries about the next morning because I knew I would feel fine after taking this after my workout. And as indicated by my gains throughout the use of this product, I believe it is also effective in building muscle as well.<br/><br/>It mixed exceptionally well, just a few shakes in a shaker and it was good to go. I had the cookies and cream flavor, and it tasted very good. No stomach issues or bloating problems after using this. I believe that all the accolades this product gets are well founded, as I had a very good experience using this product. An effective product at a great price, not much more I could ask for, I give this a perfect score and would highly recommend it to anyone.
 The taste of this is HORRIBLE!! Threw it away. Smells good dry  but it’s bad.
 I have had the product only a few days and I am already seeing results compared to my last protein powder. A little expensive but well worth the price. The flavor is delicious too. Shaking is a little bit longer than my last product but not an issue. I would continue to buy this product.
 Chocolate coconut...uuhhhh!!!  DROOL!!!  At first, tastes like my mom's home made tapioca pudding. Then, my wife tried it..she said it tastes like the Samoas Girl Scout cookies. YOU CAN'T GO WRONG with that combo.<br/><br/>The consistency is typical of Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Whey...blends easily, I usually use an empty 16.9 oz water bottle so I don't have to carry around a blender bottle.  The directions will have you use 4-6oz of water and I simply use a funnel to put the powder in my water 16.9oz water bottle, then fill it up with water. Even with the added water, it tastes delicious.<br/><br/>Not too chocolatey too! If you don't like that over chocolate taste of some powders, but you like coconut, this one is for you!
 At first I was using the cheap 5 lb bags of EAS protein from Sam's club.  When Sam's stopped carrying it and replaced it with MuscleTech brand, I switched as well.  I found the MuscleTech to be absolutely awful and when looking for a replacement found that the Optimum Nutrition NATURAL Whey was on sale, so I picked up a tub of that in the Chocolate flavor.  It was leaps and bounds better than both of the brands I had tried previously.  It tasted much better, but the biggest difference was that it mixed much, MUCH better.  I usually use 2 scoops in 12 oz of milk (sometimes 3 scoops in 16 oz milk) mixed in a blender bottle, and it mixes really well with maybe 10-15 seconds of shaking.  No clumps at all.  I ran out of the ON NATURAL and bought this tub of ON Whey in the Double Rich Chocolate flavor because it was cheaper than the NATURAL this time around.  It is every bit as good as the NATURAL in all aspects.  In fact, I can barely tell the difference between the two.  I actually mixed the rest (a dozen scoops or so) of the NATURAL Chocolate in with the Double Rich Chocolate to avoid having two giant tubs of this stuff lying around.<br/><br/>This stuff is considerably more expensive than most other proteins out there, but as a pretty big part of my diet - it's worth it to spend a little more to get something that tastes and mixes so much better.
 I've used a lot of different protein powders over the years, including muscle milk, monster milk, and syntha-6. This stuff is by far the best bang-for-your-buck item you can get. The taste is great (French Vanilla and Double Rich Chocolate are my favorites), it mixes extremely well with water and a blender bottle and it gives you ~48g for two scoops, which would take about 4 scoops of the other products. Doesn't have all the carb/fat fillers and ON is a fairly well respected supplement brand (gets much better reviews than BSN or Cytosports gets on their protein powders in terms of actually giving you what's on the label). If you're looking to bulk, just blend in some fruit or mix with chocolate milk.
 Great product, working as intended however I must say. If you are used to getting heart burn from other protein powders (those who have had this happen and deal with this know what I am talking about!) then this is no different most of the time. However I have found a way to subdue the issue. Make sure you aren't putting to much water mixed with it, also adding yogurt (greek or any flavor) to make a smoothie will almost always stop you from having heart burn. Not sure what it is that causes my issues with powders but I have to say, this one is at least worth it and taste good in smoothie form.
 when it comes to protein this is the standard powder that everyone wants. I love the available flavors, they are numerous and taste great. As for those wondering how effective this product is however I cannot really say. I tend to believe that protein powders are useful so I keep buying them but is it worth paying around $60? I think this item is totally overpriced so I may not come back to it in the future.
 Unfortunately I ordered this product and it is the nastiest tasting portion powered I have ever bought.  Will never buy again.  Wish I could send it back.
 I have been using this protein for about 3 years. I always buy it in the coffee flavor and mix one scoop with 6ozs of water then break it down in a blender bottle, then add a splash of milk and ice. The milk helps make it more creamy like actual iced coffee and not all watery and weird. It is actually a very enjoyable and affordable supplement. There is a massive supply in this thing it usually lasts me about 3 months. The results are there if you workout hard.
 I looooove the coffee flavor, both with water and with milk.  Mixes well.  You can even mix it with coffee and it tastes great, BUT don't mix it with hot hot hot coffee.  It will cook and gel up into blobs haha!  My dad put a scoop right in with coffee coming strait out of the keurig... I think I knew better, but it was still funny lol
 I think over the years I have tried about a dozen protein (whey, etc) powders.  Some tasted good, but were chalky or gritty.  Some dissolved great in any liquid but tasted nasty and others were just not cost effective per oz.  This product in my opinion is GREAT.  It tastes good, dissoves in a shaker cup or with a spoon, doesnt clump and Per serving is the best at the price I have seen.  The other major bonus is the amount of protein per serving, which meets or exceeds pretty much about every other one I have tried.  The flavors are pretty good also.  Personally I have tried vanilla and chocolate, which were both awesome!!
 About eight weeks ago I embarked on a transformational journey starting to go the gym six days a week, increasing my calorie intake dramatically (with healthy food) and taking a supplement stack including Optimum Nutrition's 100% Whey Gold. In the time since I started, my results have been amazing - I went from ~14% body fat and 149 pounds to over 160 pounds and 11% body fat!<br/><br/>While I can't easily isolate the impact of any one variable, I can say I've been having a shake of two scoops of ON's whey product after every workout day over those 8 weeks as a dietary supplement, so they have contributed to my amazing success. What I can isolate is the taste of ON's product, which is very good and much better than other similar products, as well as the percentage protein, which is higher than other products.  A definite must for people serious about building muscle.
 I have not tried every protein powder available, but compared to the ones I have liked this one the best.  It also isn't loaded up with sugar like many other brands, which is cool.  I actually prefer the vanilla ice cream flavor.<br/><br/>It says instantized so that it mixes readily with a spoon, but you need to really whip it to get the chunks out if you're just using a spoon to mix it into water or milk.  But yeah, totally mixable with a spoon, which is also cool.<br/><br/>I read the one star reviews, and they're all complaining about the taste.  Again, check the nutritional label:  there's only 1 gram of sugar.  It is not sweet, at all.<br/><br/>I didn't like the sugary, more calorie dense "better tasting" powders like Body Fortress and stuff.  I'm not using a protein powder for the delicious flavor of whey products, I'm using it to supplement my protein intake, period.<br/><br/>I'd really recommend drinking the vanilla mixed into milk.  It's definitely not awesome in water.<br/><br/>When mixed with water, I'd add some other vanilla flavoring to pump it up.  If I'm in a hurry for breakfast I'll throw in a no sugar added Carnation Instant Breakfast Vanilla flavor, and the two vanilla powders in water are 100% potable and inoffensive.
 Coffee is great for morning sessions. Best mixing product on the market. Best flavor for the macro profile it contains. Typically other manufacturers incorporate more flavor using sugars. I like that this is great tasting, while being mostly protein isolate.
 It doesnt mix well with water. You can feel the gritty powder in the water. It is a bit more tolerable in milk.<br/><br/>I think you need a blender for mixing, but on the instructions, it says you can use a spoon but it does not mix well if you do.
 Easy to mix up and the White Chocolate is good enough to spoon straight out of the canister and eat off the spoon............but go ahead and mix it with OJ or your liquid of choice<br/>JUST SAYING it is great tasting
 I have used other ON protein products with success - I don't care for the flavor of artificial sweeteners, but have learned to deal with it.  I have tried this product only 6 times since purchasing 6 months ago.  I didn't want to believe that it was causing stomach upset, but today's use has confirmed that it is this product and not a cold or some other food.  Not good when you use right before going to the gym.  I did some research and found that a number of people have stomach upset with this product - it could be that it is just spoiled, but there is no way to really tell.  Recommend buying a small size if you have not used before.  I am stuck with 5lbs of whey.
 The image of the ingredients list does not list sucralose for the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor. I am used to the double rich chocolate which does not use any sweetener. The Vanilla ice cream is easily one of the grossest flavors of whey protein that I have ever experienced. Maybe it would be ok in water, but in milk it tastes nasty.
 Loved this shake. I always have a hard time finding protein shakes that aren't too rich and gross and I've found the perfect one with whey. I can drink it without gagging and mix with peanut butter and other ingridient pretty well without getting an overwhelmingly sweet concoction. Definitely will buy another.
 I've been using this protein powder for a few weeks now. I was previously using a beef and egg isolate and definitely like this one better. It mixes very easily which is key, especially if you've ever had one that doesn't.<br/><br/>However, the flavor is extremely bland, which isn't terrible. Even though it is bland is pretty easy to drink which is a huge benefit.<br/><br/>I will most likely continue to use this type of powder. I feel pretty good after drinking it and it doesn't taste awful.
 The Whey protein is an excellent product; especially, the chocolate coconut! However, if you are like us and order on a routine basis, be careful not to simply log in an reorder from the previous shipment. Recently, we reordered the above simply by longing in from my app on our iPhone. Didn't give it much thought until the shipment arrived. The vendor was fine, but they had inflated the shipping costs so high that it was actually cheaper to buy the product at our local Vitamin Store and pay the state tax - 9.75%. Had I been more careful, I would have searched Amazon and discovered that I would have been able to order the product cheaper and was eligible for Prime. So, long and short, be careful! This was purely my error and I can promise I wont make the mistake a second time.
 Should've listened to the other 1 star people. That dude that posted recently is a liar. Double chocolate tastes like dirty laundry water.<br/><br/>If you're looking for something that has some flavor, this isn't for you. Stay away from this product if taste matters to you.
 Since my weight loss surgery I have tried may different kind of protein powder and I<br/> Have finally found this is by far one of the best tasting protein power in market
 I have used the ON products in the past and have been impressed with them; until now. Based on reviews and personal curiosity I wanted to try a new ON protein supplement. I chose the Whey Gold Standard in Vanilla Ice Cream flavor. I looked for something with high protein and low sugar. This one fit the bill but I overlooked the Sucralose they now have in these. The Vanilla Ice Cream flavor is a bit overpowering and the aftertaste from the Sucralose and other artificial sweeteners is not good. I'll go back to the naturally flavored line of ON Whey protein supplements.
 I'll let you in on my super secret Peanut Butter Chocolate Banana recipe, and you can thank me later. This smoothie is a guilty pleasure of mine without too much guilt.  Blend all of this up and enjoy it til your lips fall off your face.<br/><br/>1 Cup Almond Milk<br/>1 Cup Grek Yogurt<br/>3 Handfuls Spinach (you won't taste it, I promise, cross my heart and hope to die)<br/>2 TBSP Natural Unsalted Peanut Butter<br/>1 Banana<br/>6 Ice Cubes<br/>3 Scoops Mint Chocolate ON Powder<br/>Couple Dashes of Cinnamon<br/>2 Pinches Himalayan Sea Salt (cuz it comes from a freakin' mountain!)<br/><br/>If you don't like this receipe, you can go jump off a bridge...make sure it's only like 20 feet high though...and has water to cushion your landing. But seriously, you probably hate dogs and babies if you don't like this smoothie.
 After taking this product I completly understand why this product gets such great reviews. it really does it job well. I have seen such an improvement in my body and workouts. Very happy with. A huge confidence booster really.
 Amazon had a sale for OP whey protein. I was lucky enough to catch the sale when I was getting low  on it.<br/><br/>Taste wise, this is the best compared to the previous ones I've tried. I am sticking to this one for sure.
 This is my first time consuming Protein. My trainer recommended me this ON whey and is really good, it doesn't leave you a bad aftertaste (at least the Double Rich Chocolate don't). I really like it but next time I'll get the vanilla flavor because chocolate can't be mixed with many fruits and another things like the vanilla one can.
 My husband uses this brand as he is into muscle building. He swears by it and has been buying this same brand for the past 3 years. I will drink it also in the morning as a breakfast substitute but I'm not completely a fan of the taste. He loves it though.
 Many protein powders don't mix well--this one does. Many protein powders don't taste good--this one does. Many protein powders upset the stomach and/or cause bloating--this one does not. IMO simply the best.
 Being the best selling whey protein on the market, I really expected a lot more in the flavor deparment. This is the most bland and tasteless vanilla protein I've ever had.<br/><br/>ON has an incredible reputation and the specs of the protein are impressive. It's also actually the cheapest protein on the market per serving (this container comes with 77). I still take it several times everyday and just try to spice it up with peanut butter, stevia, or splenda, and anything else I can think of to mix in.<br/><br/>I'll continue buying the brand, just in a difference flavor next time
 The flavor isn't bad, but it gets old quickly. It also seems to be thinner then their other flavors. Hard to describe but their standards like chocolate seem to mix thicker.
 Definitely a great tasting powder. Dissolves in milk really well. Havent used it long enough to determine if it is working with strength, size, etc....It was a great price for the size. I was previously using the GNC brand (same type). I believe this one had better Nutritional Details about it such as sugars and such than GNC. Either way its protein and is what it is. I recommend this to anyone who likes that shake before/after a workout.
 Our favorite protein powder. It mixes a smooth, shake like breakfast or after workout drink. Lower sugar than other protein powders. Tastes great.
 Tastes great and when working out consistently and eating right, you see results quicker!  Highly recommend
 I love this protein powder! It doesn’t have a nasty aftertaste and is actually quite delish! I love to blend this with frozen bananas,  peanut butter and almond milk. You can even just shake it with almond milk and go. This container will last you a while and you won’t be disappointed.
 Love this protein, it's the right amount for me and the vanilla flavor is great tl mix in my fruit and oats with.
 Was shipped fast and free of any damage. ON Whey is a great tasting protein powder for building Muscle mass. I drink it twice daily, 2 scoops in the morning with milk, and 2 scoops in the evening with water about 30-45 minutes before I lift. At night I sometimes like to drink it with 2 scoops, milk, peanut butter, a banana, kale and spinach, all mixed in a blender. Amazing for getting my nighttime desert fix.
 The flavor is terrible. I have purchased and enjoyed the chocolate and the vanilla versions but this one tastes very fake and for some reason has a harder time mixing especially if you blend with ice.
 This, add bananas, milk (or soy/almond milk), and peanut butter, and I swear I have never looked forward to breakfast or an after workout snack more. It's very delicious, though I prefer it in milk, I don't like it in water. My husband can drink it, but it tastes weird to me. You don't need the extra ingredients, it's good by itself, but that's just what my preference is. Definitely makes me feel full all morning.
 I don’t know if the formula for this product has changed or my tastebuds 😳, but the strawberry flavor is so terrible! I purchased it a year or so ago and it was delicious, almost like a milkshake. This time I could barely get one sip down because it unbearably sweet. I got an instant stomachache...I would not recommend this product to anyone anymore
 My favorite protein powder. I have this every morning and had it delivered to my hotel to have it waiting there for me when I arrived for my vacation. Great fast shipping and exactly what I wanted!!
 Tough to write a review for something base on taste alone, which is pretty much what this review amounts to. I haven't recognized any increased ratio or fatigue differences between this and my previous choice, but they both have essentially the same content so am assuming (and feel like) I am getting what my body requires.<br/>I do like the taste of this supplement and it isn't too thick, which I like.
 The coffee flavored protein is like drinking a coffee with cream and sugar.  I am a black coffee drinker so i don't actually know what that tastes like but I can imagine that is what ON was trying to replicate.  The protein mixes very well in a shaker cup with water or milk.  Just a few shakes and all the clumps are gone.  I have mixed it in a cup with a spoon and that also did a decent job of removing all of the clumps.  The reason I gave 4 stars is because I am not a huge fan of this flavor but ON 100% whey protein is definitely my favorite protein on the market.
 Update - Added image for scoop size. 30g is almost equal to whooping scoop<br/><br/>I'll start off with those who are complaining, I chose amazon as seller. Dont buy from 3rd party sellers. Most of them sell near-expiration products or even fake one. You can see from the other images that most of them are even half empty tubs, clearly they have been re-packaged.<br/><br/>Amazon sent me a month old manufactured protein with expiration date exactly 2 years in future. The tub had ON Authentic seal on the top as shown in the images. Fresh new opened tub has good quantity of protein powder inside, not till brim, but lets say 70-80% of brim. NOTE - these do not have vacuum seal inside the lid.<br/><br/>As far as the flavor is concerned, I like to rotate alternate days between two flavors. This one - Strawberry banana is one of my favorites and produces slightly thicker with more froth than Mocha or Double chocolate.
 I bought this for my son and he says it's DISGUSTING!  He tried it a couple of times, and asked if I could return it.  Is it possible to return and order the double chocolate (which he loves)?  Otherwise, I'd have to say: Waste of money.
 I have been using ON 100% Gold Standard whey for about 15 years.  I think it is the best tasting whey with minimal sugar and other additives hands down.  ON 100% mixes well and digests well.  The chocolate malt is especially tasty.  I think I am going to make this my standard flavor.  ON is also when of the best priced proteins on the market.  The price here on Amazon is comparable to everywhere else.  It may be a little cheaper (a dollar or two) than anywhere else.  With the free two day shipping with Prime, this is the best deal on the protein you can get.  I am, for some reason, always surprised when I run out, so prime shipping is great.
 I have been using this for about a month and let me tell you it is great. I purchased the vanilla ice cream and the flavor doesn't get old. It taste great. I use mine post workouts and it really fills me up. I have lost 10lbs of fat and gained more muscle in the past month. My workouts consist of running and light lifting and it has worked great. The taste is wonderful I have yet to get tired of it.
 Overall I like this Whey Protein.  It tastes good, mixes well in my shakes and I can actually tell a difference compared to some of the other Whey Protein mixes I have been using.<br/><br/>The only draw back, for me, is that there is soy in this Whey Protein, which I am intolerant of.  If there was no soy, this would be a mainstay Whey Protein Supplement in my closet.  But as it is, I will have to look for another alternative.
 A good bowl of oatmeal mixed with raisans, ground flaxseed, and a scoop of whey protein is the perfect way to begin the day without those mid-morning cravings. This product has all of the essential amino acids needed for mood, sleep, and overall health. I recommend it highly as an addition to oatmeal or in a fresh glass of almond milk.
 This is huge! My boyfriend is a big fan of the flavor. He described it as creamy/like strawberry milk. The powder is less clumpy than the chocolate variety and is much easier to clean out of glasses.
 Great flavor and adds a nice thickness to my morning smoothies. The Chocolate flavor makes the strawberries and blueberries in my smoothies extra yummy! Hides the spinach too. :)
 this tastes so good with chocolate milk.  I just add one scoop of powder and roughly 8 - 10 oz's chocolate milk and blend on low for about 30 seconds and it's really delicious.
 Not much to say about this that hasn't already been said... I exercise regularly, compete in bodybuilding, and have tried at least 10 different brands, and 20-30 different types of protein. ON makes a quality post-workout protein, at a fair price, with a great nutritional profile, and the mocha cappuccino flavor in particular, is phenomenal if you like a chocolatey taste. 5/5 stars, all day long!
 This is the best tasting protein powder I have tried hands down. I lift to gain muscle mass so I use this every day. I try to make fancy shakes but when I’m lazy I just mix this with water in a shaker cup and it still tastes great.
 This product is awesome! It tastes good! I used this daily.  It has everything in it needed for training. I usually mix it with cool water and shake it up. It mixes well. I have noticed that my muscles are growing with the training I do. Don't take this product without working out, you will get fat! Eat right, train hard, sleep, repeat! It will take time to build mass. This will help you maintain muscle help with recovery. I like it, just not the price but it beats GNC asking for $80. Get this protein if you're looking for a good quality product.
 When I saw this product I thought it was going to turn up small like the Whey that is sold in wal mart once I got my package today on August 8 2014. I was like dang this is hung to me of course. However, I hope this does something since i'm on a low carb high proteins diet. I started going to the gym the first of July. I already I lost 3lb off my stomach. im going to get my beach body before next year. However I hope this product can help me along the way. If it helpful god bless if not god bless.
 I've been using this protein powder for over a year and it is one of the best tasting and highest quality powders you can get for the price. I buy this every few months as I take daily protein with my workouts and it comes in handy not having to run to the store every other week when i'm out (and the powder they have at walmart tastes like sludge, not to mention it's about the same price or more expensive than this!). My personal trainer recommends this and I haven't had any problems, only gains. Really happy with this product - will continue to get it. The last time I ordered I even got a cool recipe to go along with the included free trial pouch of their Casein protein (picture attached) - it was delicious! My wife even likes this stuff, Thanks guys!
 I have been using Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Whey protein mix for many years.  Several years ago, I did research and tried a few different brands.  The Optimum nutrition had the best amount and balance of protein for each serving (I don't quite remember anymore what all of my criteria were) and also tasted and mixed better than the other options.  I will continue to use this product and have been very happy with it over the years.  I can definitely tell a difference when I use the product (vs when I do not) after hard workouts or when trying to build up strength after taking some time off.
 Great protein! This is by far one of my favorites. The flavor is great, and I have seen some crazy nice gains! I have been losing fat (which for me is pretty difficult, I already am pretty skinny) and gaining muscle! This stuff is the way to go. Other proteins have caused me to have gas but this stuff for some reason hasn't caused any of those problems. Needless to say I have become a fan of this product. I highly recommend it!<br/>-any questions? feel free to comment below
 This is good one. I have been using this for sometime and big fan of this. Good thing is that this product wont give you belly "mass" unlike the weight gainers
 I am really disappointed this time.<br/>I buy ON for the last few months and I like it.<br/><br/>This time I tried strawberry flavor and it is one of the worst flavor.<br/>You can feel the synthetic taste.<br/><br/>The webpage shows Banned substance free but it is not present in the strawberry flavor I ordered.
 I'm a female athlete and I needed to add some protein to my diet. This was perfect, lots of protein, but few calories. It actually tastes good and mixes well in a shaker for a smooth protein shake. Also works great in smoothies/milkshakes.
 This is by far me favorite whey protein powder.  They have many flavors to choose from but if you are going to mix with just water, the extreme milk chocolate is the best.  This stuff mixes very easily and it has a fairly smooth texture for whey protein powder.  I don't tend to mix it into meals but I would assume this would work out great.  I did make ice cream out of it once and it actually turned out really good.  Just mix with some almond milk and sweetener and throw into an ice cream maker.  It is far from the texture of ice cream but it is still a good frozen treat.
 Maybe if you don't have time to eat actual whole food.... Still shouldn't really rely on these powders, or any for that matter. This is better than many others if you absolutely must get some
 I've been taking this protein for over 5 years now and I absolutely love it. I've tried just about every flavor and I think they all test good. I just ordered the rocky road and it's definitely in my top 3 favorites. I think for the money and what you get you can't go wrong. I'm a huge fan of all ON products.
 Good Stuff. Even with 2 scoops in a blender its not too think. Excellent amount if protein with minimal sugars and excess calories. I definitely saw some "gains" in my physique and also in my numbers. I drank this regularly (4-5x a week, Monday-Thursday sometimes Friday) and did not do a lot of cardio.
 I got into lifting weights almost a year ago. So I went through a variety of protein products, ranging from Muscle Milk to Protizyme. I asked a colleague of mine that was into weightlifting and he recommended this brand. I tried the Double Chocolate and mixed it according to the directions with water or I would try with Soy milk. While I had no problem drinking it, the taste was absolutely gross. I then gave it a shot using Almond Milk and it turned out to be AMAZING. But by that time, I was already done with the canister.<br/><br/>So, I decided to give the White Chocolate Flavor a shot. THIS STUFF IS AMAZING with Almond Milk. I haven't had it with water yet, and I don't plan to. But I will say, I actually look forward to drinking this protein. I use it pre and post workout as well as before I go to bed. It's delicious and the absolute BEST value for a quality protein product that fits MY needs at the moment. I'm not trying to look like The Rock (at least not yet).<br/><br/>Again, A.M.A.Z.I.N.G. product &amp; flavor. I highly recommend it, and I think I'll be sticking to this flavor, even though it says that it's a "Limited Edition" I guess that means that I'll have to double up on my future orders!
 I've only had ON and so far they've been great. The only reason I'd switch is because their cookies &amp; cream tastes so bad that I've been using it as a punishment for my rest days from the gym. Trust me, it has a strong acrid chemical smell and taste with a mild plastic aftertaste. All the other flavors I've tried are great.<br/><br/>I've tried Chocolate Mint, Vanilla Ice Cream, Mocha Cappuccino and Cookies &amp; Cream.
 This powder mixes in quite easily. Husband used to get a protein powder from Costco and he likes the flavor of that one better. But this one is good and mixes way better.
 Must have changed formula, tastes horrible! No matter how strong i make the shake, still tastes like watered down chocolate milk.
 Hate to say it, but this is "one" of the best flavored protein powders out there! (I believe they have the largest selection of flavors too?). Also, it mixes up better than most every other brand I've tried - (and I've tried a LOT of brands out there!).<br/>It also has the most grams of protein in the smallest scoop out there! And their flavors are the best as well!<br/>There are better brands out there, but they cost a LOT more money, and if you're not going for Mr. Olympia... why waste the money? Believe me, you won't be disappointed!
 I used to be a wrestler/football player back in HS (3+years ago), Been awhile since I worked out and got serious, I now have worked out every single day for a month and gained 13lbs as packing very strong muscle definition/tone. I take two scoops of this with 14-16oz of milk with a shaker bottle and feel great the next day to do it all over again. I have only tried double rich chocolate, I dont plan on trying other flavors since this flavor tastes great and works wonders! ( Be sure to drink good amounts of water with excess protein during and after workouts! )
 This stuff is truly great. It is definitely one of the best Whey's you can buy. ON is known for their clean formula. They have the least amount of additives. As their name says they are truly the gold standard for whey. This can greatly supplement your daily protein intake if it is insufficient. But even if you are getting enough protein, whey gives the most bioavailable to build quality muscle. Also a great way to cut your appetite for those trying to lose weight or cut.
 Protein is one of those necessities after a workout or during the day if you're training.  I've tried numerous brands and I've actually stuck with ON's for quite a while.  The profile is nice for a protein but the best part is, it's delicious with just water!  Some protein powders, I find myself mixing with milk or making a shake to get the taste right.  ON's protein tastes pretty good with just water and in a shaker bottle, it's so fine that it is easily mixed -- gone are the times of clumps of powder in the middle of the bottle.<br/><br/>Overall, good buy and for me, I've only tried chocolate and I'm enjoying it!
 I bought this after reading reviews of various protein mixes in health publications. I like that it is low on fat and carbs while high on protein. The chocolate flavor is great. The one complaint I have is that other reviews described it as dissolving easily when mixed with a spoon - this is NOT my experience at all, although maybe it depends on whether you are mixing it with water or something else (I have only used soy milk). It mixes better when shaken.
 I needed to boost my protein intake without ingesting a lot of additional calories and chose this product. The flavor is good. Kind of reminds me of powdered chocolate milk mix from when I was a kid.<br/><br/>I've found that it blends well in my blender cup. I've used plain water and almond milk for mixing liquid and both worked well. I will say that it seems to blend better when the temperature of the mixing liquid is more toward room temperature to cool. It clumps in very cold liquid in my experience.<br/><br/>Also, you have to be sure to rinse your glass after finishing the drink. This residue smells foul if you let it set.<br/><br/>I will buy the product again, though I might experiment with a different flavor.
 Was recommended by a friend and now my turn to recommend it. I really like this product, the chocolate flavor is delicious and the price is right. It is not expensive but that does not mean it is not good. There are other products cheaper but do not recommend them. Not a good taste!!<br/>I have used it for several months and these muscles have been growing naturally. I take it with milk, but also I have taken with water or soy milk. Always tastes good!<br/>The protein dissolves perfectly smooth.<br/><br/>I can tell you that the product is not the best but I give it 4 of 5 stars.<br/><br/>There are several flavors to choose which they like Extreme Milk Chocolate, French Vanilla, Double Rich Chocolate, Vanilla Ice Cream, Cookies N 'Cream, Chocolate Mint. I have tried them all and are good and soon find their Favorite. Mine is the Double Rich Chocolate<br/><br/>I drink a glass of milk in the morning before going to work and a cup in the afternoon after my workout.
 Use with unsweetened almond milk for great filling breakfast,
 So in the past I've bought various protien bars at 30grams per bar. Those things were difficult to consume and the flavor least to be disired. Now I'll get into the double chocolate. I knew from past reviews that consuming a suppliment could cause problems. But no problems for me. Some complain about the sweetness of the product. For me its not sweet and its not bitter. That's why Im giving four stars. I usually don't hand out five stars but that's just me.<br/><br/>Some complain about mixing it. Find a local discount store or amazon to get a inexpensive stick blender. It does give a little bit of "froth" on the top of the drink. Essentally, with 24grams protien per serving, it will kill the hunger for a while. Its not intended to be weight loss. I am getting back into running while diabetic 2 and my handouts on diet suggest high protien snack before the run and carry carbs during the run to mitigate low blood surger.<br/><br/>that's what I am doing. Do not be afraid of the cost of the 5lb product. Go into a health food store and I found the tub to sell between 85 and 90 dollars. When you get it, look for the mfgr seal and experation dates, if its brand new and from a good seller, this should check out well.  I like it alot.<br/><br/>If your worried about how it affects you, get a smaller version like the 2lb product and try it out. from my past experience with protien suppliments (the bars), I knew I had nothing to loose, and I won't have to spend about 3 dollars for a 30gram bar again. :)
 First time trying this product is pretty good and I am sure delivers the levels of protein as indicated.  The flavor is not as good as others I have tried though it is not unpleasant just not as good.  It does not seem to mix as easily, it leaves small chunks in the drink after mixing.
 This stuff lasts me forever! Also, the malt chocolate flavor is pretty good - compared to other flavors at least. I haven't gotten sick of the flavor yet, and I get excited to work out because I love drinking this stuff afterwards. I know not everybody's a fan of the flavor, but for me it's the best I've tried so far.
 The product ingredients list Aminogen in the formula which was the primary reason I spent more for this product. Both the photo and the item description under "Important Product Information" list the ingredients as including the Aminogen. After receiving and using the product I realized that the ingredients on the product I received do not include the Aminogen in the ingredients list. I found this to be very misleading. Not very satisfied with my purchase.
 Ive been a figure competitor for 5 years and have used this product for 2-3 of those years.  It's a favorite of mine because it has good (mild) taste, mixes well, and goes great in all the smoothies I make.  It's high in protein, low in carbohydrates, and has a little bit of fat which improves satiety.  My only complaint is the artificial sweetener used in this product causes bloating...but most artificial sweeteners will.  I will continue to use this product and stopped buying it on Bodybuilding.com because I get free shipping through Amazon Prime making it less expensive to buy on the Amazon website. Of note, It ships and arrives just as fast from either location.
 I love this stuff. It is expensive but you get a lot of servings. It definitely lasts much longer than the Syntha-6, however the Syntha-6 does have a  better taste (and more sugar). It mixes so well you don't even need a shaker bottle or bottle at all. I simply stir my water or milk while pouring in the protein and a minute later, it is thoroughly mixed!
 I am very happy with this product. Very nice flavor. I don't have to add any sweeteners to my smoothies just scoop of this powder. Handful of strawberries and frozen blueberries and scoop of Whey protein. No water or milk. Very nice taste. My kids were asking for it. Very happy, will order bigger bag.
 This is my go to Whey Protein.  It isn't the best tasting Whey Protein in my opinion but it's not bad.  Plus, wouldn't you be suspicious if your whey protein tasted too good?  It would probably have too many fillers in it.  I use this several times per week before and after workouts.  I've used this brand for about 5 years and have switched every now and then to NOW's unflavored protein which is also good.<br/><br/>I've tried many of the flavors and chocolate is the best by far.  Sometimes I mix the chocolate with vanilla for variety.  The strawberry and cookies and cream were too sweet for my taste.
 great price for the product and excellent for those that work out every day. And if you are lactose type person this is probably one of the best items that will not affect you; but read their label anyway. I was buying Walmart items for $20 a canister, which wold be about $75 for one to equal this item, so cost wise this is great. I did the milk chocolate and love the taste. Worth a try, but understand it is a large container. Not sure what the return policy is but I see no reason other then to buy another soon.
 Hands Down the best brand for Protein.... The best flavors, mixes the best, no gross clumps or balls of gunk at the bottom of your shake. This chocolate coconut is the best of the best!!!! I am choking down the other 5 or 6 brands I have to finish off the buckets before I open this one again, I always wish I would have just gone with Gold Standard... They make shakes I actually look forward to drink and not because I have to!
 I have tried it couple of years now and this one gives the best result. Best shake with lowest calorie and highest protein content. Keeps you energized throughout the workout period. Encourages to go the extra mile and the best part is the way it mixes with water. Just one shake in the blender and it's all set unlike the other products which settle down as chunks and get wasted. Perfect 5 star product.
 I’ve been using this protein on and off for years now. Works wonders, you can feel your workouts are a lot better and you got more energy. It really feeds your body. You can also feel the gain much faster. I will keep buying this product.
 This has definitely become my favorite flavor for protein shakes! The texture of other protein powder brands don't hold a candle to Optimum Nutrition - don't even bother with the others. If you're looking for a top of the line brand, snag an ON powder. If you're looking for great flavor, you can't go wrong with Chocolate Coconut. The Double Chocolate is good but this one takes the cake.
 Rocky Road is my favorite over Cookies and Cream, Vanilla Ice Cream, and Cake Batter.<br/><br/>As for quality, this stuff is amazing. I've seen quality improvements in my recovery, and my strength has dramatically increased (all 18 amino acids and near identical to GNCs Wheybolic line - just cheaper).<br/><br/>To be absolutely fair, I've recently started working out harder in the last year, but at 150 lbs I'm able to leg press 500lbs and deadlift 315. I'm not saying its the protein, but these gains likely wouldn't have been actualized with a cheaper brand.
 Easiest to mix of all the protein brands that I have tried.  Five stars is the overall score, but there is some variation to take note of:<br/>Vanilla: 5/5 Very good,  Mixes well with milk, too.<br/>Chocolate: 5/5 My favorite.  I like to mix one scoop with one scoop chocolate flavor egg protein powder and it tastes amazing.<br/>Tropical Punch: 5/5.  Is best for mixing in fruit for a smoothie, the punch flavor doesn't conflict with most<br/>Strawberry: 3/5.  Decent flavor, but the pink food coloring is awful; it stains my shaker bottle like nothing I've ever seen before.<br/>Cookies and Cream: 5/5.  Not as good as chocolate, but tastes fine.  The "chocolate chip" bits don't dissolve much, but it didn't bother me.<br/>Chocolate Mint: 0/5.  Terrible.  The worst tasting protein mix I've ever tried.  Tastes like aspartame mixed with medicine.  Just get chocolate.
 Vanilla is boring but it's the only flavor to buy... you can turn vanilla into ANY flavor.<br/><br/>Vanilla plus the following:<br/>chocolate and peanut butter powder =reeses cup<br/>Orange juice and milk= Creamsicle<br/>Fruit=smoothie<br/>Poprocks= fun...just trust me.<br/><br/>That being said this is the BEST protein. It mixes with everything great Consistency
 I love this protein powder! It tastes so much better than other brands and doesn't leave a chalky after taste. I drink it after every workout and usually mix it with Almond milk. It tastes just like drinking a chocolate milkshake without the guilt.
 I have been using this product for a couple months now and am very happy with it. I often take this in the morning to start my day and make a morning drink to get me going, which consists of 1 scoop of Gold Standard, 1 - 8oz cup of skim milk and 2 shots of espresso. Packs in plenty of protein (32g) and the caffeine to get me moving. I always follow up my workouts with this product and it mixes very well with just water. No powder-bombs like many other products and does not have a chalky taste to it. One of the best whey protein products I have used and plan to stick with this for a while!
 Aside from the product arriving late and damaged, I don’t think the new taste is remotely like the old one.  As other reviews have mentioned, the new formula isn’t what it used to be.  ON should consider going back. I’ll be trying another one of the dozens of strawberry proteins out there next time.
 I love this stuff. I make a smoothie with 2 scoops of powder, a cup of non-fat milk, a dollop of non-fat Greek yogurt, 2 cups of frozen berries, and a banana, and have it for breakfast every day.  It keeps me going until dinnertime. The Delicious Strawberry flavor goes well with the added fruit.
 Heard a lot about other brands but this (ON Gold Standard) has been my favorite for the past 5 years in a row. Easy to digest 2 scoops of protein with all the essential Amino Acids and BCAAs and a long lasting taste. Well, I have only tried Banana Cream and Double Rich Chocolate and they didn't disappoint one single bit with the taste.<br/>2 scoops in the morning, 1 scoop in the evening. Works great as post/pre-workout. I might be a little pricey but once you use it, you wouldn't change the brand :) (which is what has happened to me)
 25 years ago when I used to use protein powder, the taste was awful, but this tastes just like chocolate milk to me, whether mixed with water or milk.  Mixes up pretty well with just a spoon in a glass.  The only downside was I had to dump out most of the powder to find the scoop when it arrived.
 This has been my favorite whey protein product for several years now and for good reason! First off, the delivery was very exceptional arriving a week after ordering, and I was in a rather remote location at the time! You can't beat the free shipping when you're halfway around the world at the time. Next, the biggest issue most consumers of whey protein have is the ability to mix well with either milk or water. This is not an issue with Optimum Nutrition's Whey Gold Standard. The protein mixes well with not only milk, but water as well. Finally, the taste is what is most often sacrificed for a decent protein shake, however, this protein comes on top again when mixed with either milk or water. I mostly used milk with this protein for a creamy, rich taste. The times I had to use water is taste just fine.<br/>For the price, you get quite a lot of protein. I've always been a fan of buying in bulk, it just makes sense most of the time. This product I will continue to buy for that reason, especially using so much throughout the month.
 I started working out few months ago and I can already see the results.<br/>I really like the taste of it and it blends really easy.<br/>Highly recommended!
 Coffee and whey together? I was sold when I saw the flavor. I was even more sold when I actually tasted it. When mixed with milk, it tastes absolutely delicious. It looked like coffee with cream in it and with the milk, it tasted like an iced coffee with sugar. It doesn't taste as good with water. It tasted like a watered down coffee, but whenever I drank this in the morning, I would drink it with milk because once I went milk, I didn't go to water. Highly recommended!
 With a consistent workout schedule that I kept to, I saw noticeable results within 2 weeks that my muscles were loving the extra protein. I got this product because it was low calorie, low carb, low sugar, decent grams of protein, and solid ingredients. No proprietary blend crap that you get at Wal-Mart. The price was also reasonable. Taste is good too. I've had only maybe one or two I can think of that tasted better from different companies, but the calories/carbs/sugar/protein ratio wasn't good for me. Definitely the best taste for the best product.
 Pretty good flavor, thought it would be more chocolaty though. It's not bad...has a hint of chalkiness. I use with milk for creaminess.<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Optimum-Nutrition-Gold-Standard-100-Whey-Double-Rich-Chocolate-1-Pound/dp/B00G4MA4B8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Whey, Double Rich Chocolate, 1 Pound</a>
 I won't comment on the effectiveness of this or other protein powders as that's controversial and you can look it up for yourself. Based upon flavor alone, I'd give one star for the chocolate but five stars for the other flavors.
 My favorite whey supplement product. I always get the double chocolate flavor because in my experience, it's the best tasting. Out of all the other whey supplements I've tried, this one tastes the best out of all of them as well.<br/><br/>Prices seem to fluctuate with this being a bit pricier in the summer months it seems like. Overall, this really is the gold standard.
 This protein has the absolute best nutritional values on the market, plus great flavor and it mixes better than anything else I've used.  It's by far my favorite protein powder.  Unfortunately, it costs an arm and a leg, so I only buy it when it's on sale or I can find a great deal on it.  Up until about a year ago, it was half the price it is today, but Optimum jacked it up when they introduced their "starter" line of protein powder to make this stuff seem more premium.  The lower costing stuff still tastes good, but it includes a lot of extra fat and carbs.  Highly recommended if you can find it for a good price.
 This one is the second best I found.<br/>This flavor has only 10kcal (maybe 20kcl) more than the best protein in found (which is Legion Whey) and a few more ingredients. But l get 74 servings and 24 G of protein with this one for $57 vs 30 servings and 23g of protein with Legion Whey for $39. Just a matter of budget.<br/>In my opinion, the white chocolate tastes great with water, it tasted too sweet and weird when l first tried it with milk.
 I like the convenience of ordering online, but will wait for when I see a sale. This tub is huge, so make sure you have a place to store it that wont interfere with the wifes cooking.
 Still high quality whey protein, quickly mixes (no clumps)  and digestion friendly (minimal gas and bloating), but the taste is lacking. I care about what I eat, but this is the first time that artificial sweeteners have ruined something for me. The entire flavor is artificial, to the point of grossing me out. I will not be buying this flavor again and am going to start trying other brands to get away from this artificial taste that makes me feel sick.
 The stuff is so weak that I have to add two scoops to 10 ounces of water to make it taste decent. I would return it but they are going to charge me 5.74 to ship it back.  Not going to buy this again.
 Mmm, this product is original, taste Excellent and it feels good after drinking the smoothie in a way that I don't get hungry again that fast. The price was alright on $58 almost the same on other walk in stores like gnc. But being a loyal Amazon customer here I ended up purchasing thru Amazon, service is much better so far.
 I started out drinking Muscle Milk Light Vanilla Creme. I really liked the taste, but didn't want all of the "extra" ingredients they include. I just wanted plain protein.<br/><br/>After reading reviews of Optimal Nutrition (ON), I gave the ON vanilla ice cream a try. I mixed it in milk, and there was very little added taste to the milk. It tasted like I was drinking plain milk.<br/><br/>I gave French Vanilla Creme a try next, and found that it has a little more vanilla flavor. I prefer it over the ON vanilla ice cream. However, still not as good of a flavor as the Muscle Milk.<br/><br/>With my weight training, the ON protein has helped me to add lean muscle. Plus, I don't find myself hungry later, and end up eating all kinds of junk.<br/><br/>By the way, the cost per serving is less with the ON. So, that's what I'm sticking with for now.
 <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Optimum-Nutrition-Gold-Standard-100-Whey-Protein-Powder-Extreme-Milk-Chocolate-5-Pound/dp/B000QSTBNS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Whey Protein Powder, Extreme Milk Chocolate, 5 Pound</a><br/>Had to stop using it because the chocolate and color was making my teeth yellowish.  Used it for over 8 months.  It does the work as a supplement and has good ingredients.  I got great results from it and going to the gym.
 This is my go-to protein powder. High-quality product with great flavor and lots of protein. I use for morning smoothies to amp up my protein intake. Definitely recommend.
 I like the reputation and value of this protein powder, along with the low calorie count, and low contaminant level (as measured by consumer reports).  But I did want to point out this isn't the best tasting powder (Double Chocolate Flavor), and it doesn't mix thickly in water.  I just came form  a powder I bought locally, (1st-phorm level 1), which mixed well with 4 oz. of water and tasted like a shake. It also cost $43 for 3 lbs.! I previously mixed my shakes in milk because they didn't taste all that good with water.  I haven't tasted many different current powders, but I can say this isn't the best tasting stuff out there.  Due to price and reputation, I'll stick with ON, and will just keep trying different flavors.
 I'm torn on this one. I like the flavor, and I love that this mixes without my blender, but it's a pretty mellow flavor. I have to use double what I use on other protein powders to taste it at all. Not sure if I'll be buying again.
 My son is an athlete and loves this stuff! He has tried many products like this but this one has the best flavor and doesn't give him .... shall we say - socially unacceptable and odoriferous gaseous emanations! A bit more pricey than some other products but worth it if I want to have him in the room watching a movie with me in the evening!
 I shed forty pounds without any exercise at all and this powder was a big part of it.  Two scoops mixed with some fruit and milk makes a great breakfast.  Just as filling as bacon and eggs and even more satisfying because i know it's good for me.  One shake like this holds me over until mid-morning when it's time for a Kind bar or Cliff's Bar.  The banana cream goes great with frozen mango chunks or an actual banana.  You'll never mistake it for a milkshake but the taste is actually pretty good.
 It is in fact the "gold standard" of the market. They use great whey protein isolate as main ingredients for this product.<br/>I felt stronger in few weeks by taking the product daily after the workout<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>Very slow fat<br/>Great taste!<br/>5 Grams of BCAA per serving<br/>Mix amazingly well<br/>High amount of high quality protein<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>The cholesterol amount isn't as low as expected for whey isolated<br/>A bit expensive if compared to competitors<br/>Bag isn't easy to open.. perhaps I got too strong and ripped it off =/<br/><br/>General Thoughts:<br/>Buy it! Worth the "investment"
 I have used this in the past and it works well.  Also the stuff is pretty clean.  What I mean by this is that the ingredients are good quality.  Some protein powders are not so clean.  I have read some even have very high levels of lead in their product which is obviously not good.<br/><br/>Taste is good.  I don't have to plug my nose when I drink this.  Tastes just like nestle quick chocolate. Yummy!  I grew up on nestle so taste is good to me.  I'm happy with this product and will continue to order more when I run out of my 5 lbs stash<br/><br/>Cheers!
 Great flavor and mixes in extremely well. I can quickly make a protein drink to go with just a cup and a spoon. No chunks. I like the French vanilla flavor as it's good by itself, or I can add fruit (in a blender) or even Mio type flavors to switch it up.
 Love this protein but my 5 gallon tub was not sealed like it has been in the past? The lid was not plastic wrapped and the opening was not sealed. It's almost like it's already been opened..? This is not ok.
 One of the better (and pricier) protein powders I've used. Consistent taste and texture every time. Use 2 scoops and a milk in a shaker cup in the morning and blend it on the way to work. That's usually my breakfast. Use it again at night depending on how my diet is set up. Great flavor, easy blending with no chunks or dry globs.
 I've used the Gold Standard Whey for many years now- nothing else seems to come close. A fair amount of protein, glutamine, and other BCAA's are packed into just one scoop. This stuff is great because many competitors out there just make their containers bigger and make it seem like you're getting more, but really you would have to use 3 to 3 scoops to get the same result because they put a lot of extra, unneeded garbage in their formulas. All things considered, Optimum Nutrition has the goods! It's been a great supplement to my martial arts, rock climbing, and weight training
 I didn't realize that they changed the formula. When I replenished my supply of protein powder this year I noticed that I started getting slight headaches after lifting and drinking my protein shake. Originally I thought it was blood pressure issues and didn't think much of it. A friend of min, who I recommend this product to, was looking through the reviews and pointed out that people were saying the formula changed. I checked the ingredients list on my container and sure enough, there was a bunch of added crap, most importantly sucralose. Sucralose gives me headaches that's why I purchased this product originally since it didn't contain it (at least last year it didn't). Oh well. Guess I need to find a different protein powder. Now I have $57.00 worth of powder I can't even use. Such a waist of money.
 I bought this based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews.  I can't really say much that hasn't already been said but what I can say is that the double chocolate flavor with milk is really good.  I almost feel guilty drinking it but its not bad for you at all.  I use fat free milk, about 6oz with 1 scoop.  The milk adds an additional (don't quite me) ~6 grams on top of the 24g of this protein mix.  That's 30g of protein!<br/><br/>I will add that I find this mix kind of hard to drink with water, it does not taste good at all but with Milk it is amazing.
 My friend recommended this brand of whey protein, and I have to say it really is one of the best I've tried.<br/>Mixes great and has a great taste.  I picked the Extreme Milk Chocolate flavor since it had a taste rating of 9.1/10 at Bodybuilding.com. It was like drinking Nesquik even when I mostly just mix it with water and on occasion with milk.  My friend says that Mocha tastes really awesome as well.  I don't believe any of the other flavors taste ratings fall below an 8, based on Bodybuilding, so I would think the others would taste just as good as well.  It just depends on a person's preference of flavor.<br/><br/>Well enough of the flavor lets talk about the protein.<br/>I did some research on whey protein and basically they produce them in 3 types; concentrated, isolates, and hydrolyzed.  They are basically are just based on how fast your body absorbs them (hydrolyzed&gt;isolates&gt;concentrated). Gold standard I believe lies in the category of isolates.  Optimum Nutrition makes all three types and all seem to have a good amount of protein per gram with also a good amount of BCAA's and glutamine &amp; glutamic acid.<br/>All in all Optimum Nutrition's Gold Standard has really great quality of Whey Protein Isolates for a good price. This product should be definitely be taken notice to people who are looking for great quality whey.  I believe it's an awesome product and recommend it to others.
 Works great. I can honestly say I never gain so much muscle within a single month (with supplement combined with 1 hour daily exercise).<br/>This product also seem to help muscle recovery. After a day of weight lifting and punching sand bags I feel sore as hell but while taking this, I recover within 2 days (which is huge since its usually a week for me before)<br/><br/>I do not recommend this to anyone that does not exercise.
 Oh. My.  God.<br/><br/>This stuff is delicious.  It's low in sugar, high in flavor and protein.  There is absolutely nothing better than after your workout, shaking this up with some milk in a blender bottle.  You cannot tell that it's a protein powder and is very finely grained, so it blends quickly.<br/><br/>I've made shakes with this protein, milk, strawberries and bananas and you'd swear you were drinking something devilishly bad for you because it tastes so good.  I love it.
 GREAT product, I've used it for months and I love it every time I take it, it provides a quality amount of protein per serving and is inexpensive for how many servings you receive. It provides over 5g of BCAAs and 4g of glutamine and glutamic acid for optimal protein synthesis and repair. I've been buying this for months and will continue to buy it
 I don't have any business speaking to the nutritional aspect or health advantages of this product but for those with similar criteria to mine I will say that this is one of the best tasting and easily mixed protein powders that I have used. Progenex is the only brand I have found that surpasses Optimum Nutrition in both categories however it is much more costly and currently unavailable via Amazon. A more fair comparison might be with ON's Platinum products but I have not had any experience with them at this point. I am particular about taste and texture and the Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard meets my expectations and fits my budget. I went with the double rich chocolate and would recommend a shaker bottle for a thorough mixing, a spoon just doesn't cut it.
 For the amount of product given the price, this is definitively my new go-to.  The taste isn't overwhelmingly great, but it's definitely better than most.  The Cake Batter flavor has the slightest off-/after-taste, but this is easily washed down with a separate glass of water.<br/><br/>I've used more expensive products in the past (Syntha-6, Pro-NOS, and a few others) that did taste better than Gold Standard.  However, whatever wizardry ON applies to their powder certainly allows for trouble-free mixing/stirring - it only takes about 10 seconds.  I do the slow-pour-and-mix approach and the only clumping that occurs is on the spoon at the waterline.<br/><br/>If you're looking for an expensive milkshake, go buy a damned milkshake.  If you don't want to feel ripped off by something as simple as a protein supplement, I'd say this is the best value you're going to find.
 Love this stuff
 Cafe mocha is hands down the best protein flavor I have ever had. Optimum whey, gold nutrition is the best protein I've ever had. And I've tried many types protein powders. The consistency is second to none and the flavor is like drinking coffee. Will continue to stick with this protein for years to come. Yeah, the price is high end but that's because it's a high end protein powder. Its awesome putting down one of these every morning and after workouts. Makes me feel great. Also, I'm somewhat sensitive to lactose and this gives me zero side effects.
 Been using this protein for years.  To be honest I haven't tried very many but this protein is consistently good, well priced, tasty, and mixes easily.  Never have a complaint.  Good company, good protein.
 This is my go-to protein powder. The taste is excellent and it doesn’t cause the digestive issues that many protein powders can. Most importantly it gives the nutritional and energy boost that I need.
 Let me start by saying that I have been using Optimum Nutrition products for as long as I can remember. All ON products have been of the highest quality and value. And this protein is no exception. I have tried other whey protein supplements over the years, but I have never found anything I like better. The taste is great, plus no gas or bloat. Mixes great with water in a shaker cup, and excellent for smoothies in the blender.
 Great product. I have been using <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Optimum-Nutrition-100-Whey-Gold-Standard-Double-Rich-Chocolate-5-Pound-80-Ounce/dp/B000QSNYGI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard, Double Rich Chocolate, 5 Pound, 80 Ounce</a> for about a year now and believe me the results are very visible and they speak for themselves. I'm writing this review after confirmation that this product has been good to me. I have equally tried a couple of other products recommended by professional body builders but Gold Standard is my favorite; from its ingredients to its taste (I really enjoy the Double Rich Chocolate which I sometimes mix with any soft/fruit punch, milk, or water). I will recommend this product if you workout and want to build muscles and gain muscle mass.
 A good product for a good price. This is my "go to" for protein powder. It works well mixed with water or milk (any kind of milk - dairy, soy, coconut, almond). It also works great in smoothies. I prefer the chocolate flavors for just mixing with milk. The vanilla flavor works well for fruit smoothies and is easily hidden in oatmeal, baked goods, and other foods too.
 I love optimum nutrition gold standard whey protein, I went through two 5 lbs bottles of chocolate and decided to switch it up to cookies and cream and it taste delicious.  I have even used it in my magic bullet with ice and milk and it doesn't taste like a DQ blast it is tasty.  great flavor!
 This stuff is as good as it gets.. just get it.  I have no idea what people are blathering on about.  I've been buying this for years and it's as good today as it it has always been.
 I have tried several brands and flavors of protein, this is BY FAR the best I've tried.  The taste is incredibly good, the texture (when mixed with a shaker cup) is amazingly smooth.  Even mixing with a spoon is ok, but I recommend using the cup, you will not be disappointed.  I've tried both the Strawberry Banana and the Double Chocolate, and highly recommend both to anyone looking for a protein powder that will give you the results you are looking for.  There are many more higher priced brands on the market, but none can compare to the value of ON.  I will be buying more and have already turned several of my friends and former Marines on to this product.
 The best protein for your buck on the market hands down! I have gained tons of muscle mass with this. I drink 2 a day to keep my protein intake high. You want to take in as many grams of protein as your bodyweight or even 1.5 grams for each pound and this makes it easy. I have tried many flavors and have to say the chocolate is not very good. The best flavors have been mocha cappuccino which tastes like star bucks and banana cream which tastes like muscle milk.
 More chocolate-y than minty. ON gold standard still remains the best bang for your buck in my opinion when it comes to protein powders. No extra carbs. I take mine with 50/50 milk and water. Tastes good and mixes well, no clumps.
 I normally take one to two scoops of product to an eight ounce glass prior to working out and one cup in  eight ounce after work out.  This gives me energy to complete a 1/4 mile run in addition to a one hour cross fit class.  The product easily dissolves in the water and enters your system within 15 to 20 minutes to give you the needed energy and recovery.<br/><br/>I prefer the Vanilla ice cream when mixing in smoothies or taken alone in quick shots.  I have also tried chocolate which was a bit thick in flavor for my taste and cappuccino which is a good change up if ordered in small quantities.  Vanilla is the most versatile flavor if ordering over 2lbs. IMHO of course.
 Not as gassy as I thought I would be. Completely satisfying. And does its job.
 Whey protien now days is the way to go wether your a body builder or cross fit enthusiasts. Builds healthy lean muscle and the best part it taste great with milk or water. Great for my busy schedule just 2 scoops and some water and I'm out the door sipping on my protien shake. Dissolves great no nasty clumps or build up on the bottom of your shaker cup. Great for the price definitely recommend this product for anyone who wants lean mean muscle and a healthy body.
 I have bought this multiple times now &amp; have liked it each time without getting bored by the taste.<br/>I personally prefer white chocolate flavor, after having tried chocolate &amp; strawberry. White chocolate seems to have a light, non-overwhelming feel to it. Tastes great chilled!<br/>I picked Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard over other common brands because it is lighter in terms of calories, for the same delivery of protein. And nice nutrition specs overall. The 5lb pack is a nice deal...
 Best meal alternative solution and the chocolate flavor tastes good even with water. There are a lot of brands out there but Optimum Nutrition knows a thing or two about whey protein.
 If you're looking for a protein supplement that doesn't taste bad, get this. Get this right now. I've tried it in water and milk, and iIprefer milk. I get double rich chocolate or extreme milk chocolate, and they both taste great! It a very convenient way for me to get my daily protein needs since I can't always make time for lunch when I'm at college or work.
 It tastes great.  According to different sources, it is one of the better protein sources.  I don't care about the absolute best protein in the world, but I do care about taste.  Even in water, this stuff is still good.  Use it with bananas and a water/milk mixture and you have a milkshake worthy of the Dairy Queen menu, yet you don't have to feel guilty about it.  Ten pounds is also killer so you don't have to keep buying it every week.  A little more expensive than some others, but worth it in my opinion since I don't want to throw it up afterwards.
 Rewrite:<br/>The double rich chocolate is ok. The whey is of lower quality, mostly junk to get fatter, I wouldn't recommend it.<br/>The sugar levels are acceptable; lucky this isn't pure sugar like other drinks.<br/><br/>What gets me is the Coconut + chocolate flavor, always ends up making me sick.<br/>I don't have the same issue with the double rich chocolate; but the coco-chocolate mix my body repulses.<br/><br/>Please, do yourself a favor, and get better proteins in your body than this!
 After years of trying so many different protein shakes and suffering shortly after (upset stomach and the runs) I've finally found the one that doesn't upset me or make me go often.  Now I don't have to be afraid of taking the necessary amount of serving a day after a workout and have the fear of needing to make multiple bathroom stops during work.  This product also tastes great.  I highly recommend the Extreme Milk Chocolate.  Just picked up my second tub.
 I have used this for pre workout and find I'm not as depleted during or after. It seems easy on the guts -- no stomach issues for me.<br/><br/>Only thing is it seems to have a hint of a bitter aftertaste, which I remedied usually with a tablespoon of maple syrup. But I know there are other whey powders that are easier on the palate so I'll keep searching.<br/><br/>Don't commit to the 5 lbs (like I did) until you're sure this is the one for you.
 Before i found this i was small and gainless. I prayed to Brodin, "lord, show me the whey". And then i found this. Now that i am swole af, i shall spread the word of Brodin in the swoly bible.
 FAST SHIPPING, TASTE IS AWESOME..I ordered Cookies and Cream.
 I have tried a lot of protein drinks and this one is by far the best. I love the double rich chocolate.  it tasts better than drinking a glass of chocolate milk.
 The macro ratio and the mixability of the power alone gives this five stars. Amazon doesn't have the cheapest price but it comes as expected.
 The Vanilla Ice cream flavor is just to sweet.
 I drink two of these a day with water to supplement my diet with protein. Double rich chocolate is my favorite and has a good taste when using just water. Definitely better when really cold. I've lost a lot of weight so far by counting my calories and balancing my macros and this powder has helped a lot since I don't eat much protein outside of eggs and the occasional chicken breast.
 A lot of people seem to not like the flavors since sucralose was added. However, this is my FAVORITE strawberry flavor I have ever tried, and I have bought my fair share of brands. If you are on the fence, try a 2lb jar, you will not regret it.
 Taste was really bad. I tried it then tried it again and I could not get over the bad, artificial taste. It made my stomach hurt too. I had to end up switching back to my previous brand.
 Great protein powder! 24 grams in each scoop and ON has a ton of flavors to choose from. This vanilla flavor is good on its own and great to add to muffins, oatmeal, and other recipes when you need a little protein. The container is gigantic sitting on top of my fridge, but it's a better value than the smaller 2 lb one.
 Way too much sweetener in it......
 The packaging was decent, but the cookies taste is absolutely horrible and makes me throw up. Waste of money for me. I still give 3 Stars because this is really high quality whey, and I know many people that dont throw up in this. Another thing that is quite annoying is that the scoop is burried at the bottom, so you will make a big mess trying to find it
 The only brand of protein I ever get. Great tip - If you like iced coffee and you like this product, mix them :-) Usually get a large dunkin donuts coffee w/o sugar and add a scoop or two of this two it. You'll save the calories on the sugar and make up for it with the flavor and protein goodness.
 solid protein complex and tastes great! i put it in my oatmeal i put it in my smoothies and I drink with water after a quick work out. it is a little pricey for me so I will be buying a difference product in the future but this does not effect my review. 5 stars is what it deserves!
 Great powder. Tastes good and is by far the easiest to mix powder I've bought. It stirs in easy with just a spoon. Also great if you are on a low carb diet.
 Best protein powder we've tried so far. My husband did a ton of research and this was the best nutrition for what he was looking for. It seems to blend better than many of the other brands too. The milk chocolate has been the best so far, followed up by the strawberry. Cake batter was ok too.
 Optimum Nutrition is the mark of excellence. Their health products are as good as they come.  I purchased the extreme milk chocolate whey and it is delicious.  I use it with skim milk and shake it up in my shaker cup.  It doesn't taste "chalky" and it does not clump.  In fact, within 15 seconds of shaking it up, it is smooth and ready to enjoy.  Definitely would recommend this product - and certainly will purchase more in the future.
 I use this as a meal replacement usually instead of breakfast and it keeps me full for 3 to 4 hours. I use 2 scoops with 8 oz of milk. The taste is amazing and will definitely buy again
 this is the best protein I've tried. I've tried a lot. This protein is so easily mixed and no clumping. Best taste around. I recommend the Vanilla. You can mix with anything. Especially cereal in the morning, even eggs, and also oatmeal. I also got mocha cappuccino and I've bought this 3 different times. I'm not going to change. Best price for serving amount. Lasts me about a month and a half taking daily.
 I was buying BSN Syntha 6 for more than a year and decided to switched to this.. I am pretty happy with the switch. I noticed right away that my body seems to handle this much better than Syntha 6 (e.g. I don't feel bloated / etc when taking this). I also like the fact that it's cheaper per serving, as well as lower calories and sodium per serving (compared to Syntha 6 which is the only other product I've tried).<br/><br/>I personally think it tastes really good. I know that's subjective though.
 I love this product and the Mocha Cappuccino flavor is amazing!...you definitely notice a spike in your energy levels right away!...I mix it with coconut milk and a banana but I have mixed it with water alone and it still tastes great!  I will definitely reorder again!
 Good neutral flavor, seems pure (whey concentrate or cheaper isolates give me some digestion issues) I would probably give it 5 stars in the chocolate flavor was a bit richer. I think the "double rich chocolate" description is a bit false advertising.  It tastes sort of like kid's chocolate milk.  Lots of good quality protein for the serving size.  I usually add a little bit of collagen hydrolysate to it to balance out the amino acids.  Blends great.  Definitely the best whey isolate on the market for the price.
 LOVE this protein shake.. cheaper and better than most others.. I bought this the first time from a Body Building website and paid over $8 in Shipping ( 8 days to get to me..BOO!)and it was "ON SALE" for the same price as it was on Amazon (Free 2 day shipping with Prime!..YAY!)...this is a NO BRAINER!! This is a good flavor too!!
 This is the best tasting and best mixing protein I have ever bought. I've only ever tried the extreme milk chocolate and the mocha cappuccino flavors. Both are really good mixed with milk. You do need a shaker cup with a blender ball OR a few ice cubes and a strong arm to shake it up. You will get that sweetener aftertaste though.
 My go to protein powder, especially post workout for quick absorption using only water, which it dissolves easily in a shaker.  Also place in smoothies using my ninja.  High quality protein powder.  You get what you pay for.
 I've been buying this product for years and I've always enjoyed it. soft protein that mixes well and doesn't upset my stomach
 I purchased this item on sale and with my amazon coupon so I only paid about 25 bucks. For the amount of servings you get out of this product it is well worth the money.<br/><br/>Pros- A lot of Servings, good taste, mixes very good and doesn't stay clumpy like other powders I've tried<br/><br/>Cons- honestly none because it was cheap and was exactly as described<br/><br/>Highly recommend for an affordable, long lasting protein shake that mixes well<br/><br/>Shipping- fast &amp; easy
 I purchased 5 lbs of the double chocolate gold standard powder and this is my 4th time purchasing it and I can tell a vast difference in the taste.  It's very bland and the smell used to be rich and smell delicious. This hardly smells nor tastes like anything.  I purchased from amazon.  Not sure if it has changed or of it's a bad batch or a fake...
 Tastes great with 1% milk in a shaker cup with ice.  Noticeable energy surge that lasts 3+ hours.  With some added nutrition this could be a meal replacement for people wanting to lose weight.<br/><br/>I like to take it about 20 minutes before a workout.  I feel 10 years younger and have the energy to complete a 60 minute workout again.  Back into P90X and having a great time.  This product makes a difference.  Cake Batter is yummy to boot!
 Protein is protein. I used to buy cheap walmart protein and when I switched to ON, my muscles did not increase or decrease. However what did change was the happiness of my taste buds. ON does not taste bad like other protein powders. It taste more like chocolate milk if anything. Don't buy into the hype that people will tell you that if you want to grow muscles you will need this product. What you need is hard work. There is no way around that. I take away 1 star because of the taste.
 I've tried many protein powders and the coffee flavor is by far my favorite (when mixed with water at least). While none of the optimum powders have much sugar, some of them taste very sweet, which I don't like. The coffee flavor is nice in that it isn't particularly sweet at all. Next time I buy more protein powder I'll be looking out for a deal on this flavor.
 I like Optimum Nutrition protein powder but I don't care for this flavor as much as the extreme chocolate flavor.  I don't care for the sprinkles in it.  It does mix well with water unlike other protein powders which taste grainy.  The flavor isn't horrible....but they make better flavors.
 Ok, first I made my fiber drink with this.  I just used 1/2 a scoop to my normal drink of fiber, and fruit and ice and 1 cup of SF punch.  It was like drinking a shake.  Fantastic.  Next I will try the pancakes.
 This stuff may be more expensive than other after-workout protein shakes but it's worth it.<br/><br/>Most other protein powders I bought were full of fillers. This has fewer calories and the ingredient list is much smaller than others. At least with this product I know what is going into my body... whey protein and cocoa powder. I bought chocolate and love the flavor. It also goes down easier because you only need one scoop and subsequently, less water.
 Will not mix well with milk. Doesnt matter what kind of milk, I've tried whole, 2%, fat free. I've tried using more and less powder. I've tried blender bottles, mixing by hand. The only thing that works is using an actual blender, which completely aireates the milk. Then you're drinking so much air that you have disgusting protein burps and farts.
 This whey product is the best of about 10 different ones I've tried. The pure whey with no added vitamins, minerals, etc. is so good, rich and chocolate.  I take multi-vitamins so I don't need anything else in my whey, and vitamins taste awful to me. I make a 12 oz. drink for breakfast and stay good until lunch time with no hunger pains. Very good chocolate flavor but sometimes I add choc syrup just to be decadent. Excellent source of protien, and I use skim milk so very low fat.
 The flavor is so good that you can drink it in water, although I don't.  In water it tastes, well, like the chocolate water that you can buy.  In almond milk, it tastes like the best chocolate milk ever.  I gave it a 4 out of 5 because it's lower in protein than my other brand and it actually makes me crave chips or cookies so I can't continue to use it.  My usual brand needs a little doctoring, however, to cover up the taste.  So, it's a trade-off.
 This is the best protein powder on the market. It mixes well, tastes great in milk or water, and has the optimal levels of protein and BCAAs for an after workout supplement.
 Came with a hole punctured in the bag and protein powder all over the box... I was skeptical to even try it obviously because of this but it appeared to be good. I probably should have returned it, God only knows what punctured the bag.... but I was too lazy and poor to deal with it so I just decided to pray it wasn't diabolically contaminated by some evil scientist... the bag is gone and I didn't get cancer or become the Green Lantern, so I guess all is well.  The protein was ok, I've had better, but as described, good value.
 ON Protein sets a high standard for quality, affordable protein. Better yet, the flavors don't taste like dog shat and taste nearly as good to me as a milk shake. Maybe when I become Mister Universe I'll think its worth spending my kidney black market money on a fancier brand. Until then there's ON. It comes in all kinds of flavors so you can pick the ones you like. Personally I find the traditionals like vanilla and chocolate best. There's really not much else to say. It's good, it's healthy, and it makes you want to work out so you can have another.
 ON Gold Standard has been a very reliable brand for me, been ordering for years from various places, always very satisfied with the quality and the price.  This was a good deal on a pretty standard flavor that is very versatile.
 Definitely see results from their product line. The flavor of these mixes are also delicious, especially with Vitamin D milk (gotta get the gains somehow).<br/>In fact it's so good, my brother and I joke that we must "work for those milkshakes."<br/>This flavor is weird at first, but I definitely liked it after a while. Just different, you know?
 Been using this brand for a while both for bulking and cutting weight. I tend to go through it quickly since I don't have the desire nor appetite to eat six meals a day and this is probably the most bang for your buck you will find at present.
 Optimum Nutrition makes a good tasting product. I'm unable to confirm any gains from using this, but if you're going to take whey protein, ON is a good start.
 I have always bought my protein from optimum nutrition, but this tastes nothing like it used to. I cannot get the disgusting taste out of my mouth. It tastes like pure whey without any flavoring in it. I’m returning it and I probably won’t buy optimum’s whey anymore.
 obviously you gotta like coffee in general. In my opinion coffee is the only flavor that doesn't taste horrible. at first I tried double rich chocolate. Biggest regret in my life. It's actually still half full and I am not willing to finish it. Cause it's not worth it. It taste like a kid that just drowned in willy wonkas chocolate river just vomited into my blender bottle.
 Whey is whey is whey is whey, honestly other than flavor and macros I don't know why people make a huge fuss about their whey protein, but ON happens to be my favorite in terms of both the flavor and macros.  Double chocolate is my favorite but most of their flavors are pretty solid, you really can't go wrong with this product.
 The best protein out there. I’ve tried numerous brands but I keep coming back to ON Gold Standard. Great flavor, great mix ability, and great ingredients . You can’t go wrong choosing this protein.
 Purchased this brand a lot, last few orders the jugs looked different and unsealed. Hear all the stories of fake brands, worried this was happening to me.
 I love Gold's Standard and I've tried a few different flavors: double chocolate, chocolate malt, vanilla, and rocky road. The first three are good, and I think I like the vanilla one the best-it's versatile, can be flavored with berries, cocoa powder or peanut butter. The rocky road is absolutely foul. The artificial almond flavor is very strong and difficult to mask, and it gives a soapy taste to any shake or bake. I absolutely do not recommend that flavor. Other than that one though, the other ones I've tried are pretty good. They're all easy to digest, no bloating and no stomach pains. I've tried a few different powders (from different vegan formulas to other whey products), and this one is so far the best in terms of cost and flavor.
 tastes awful
 I have been using a variety of low cost proteins before but this one definitely beats them all. Even in terms of economicality, this product is great as one gets a lot out of one pack.
 I picked this protein powder after reading reviews here and on other fitness/weightlifting websites and am very glad I did.  Consumer Reports recently tested protein powders for harmful chemicals/metals, and Optimum Nutrition tested as one of the best.  Not only that, but it is very tasty.  I have only used French Vanilla and typically blend it in smoothies with frozen fruit, coconut milk, spinach, yogurt, and ice.  The one slight negative is its mixing ability.  When I shake it in a mixer with just milk, it leaves lumps...not a big issue for me since I rarely make it that way.
 Merchandise was shipped promptly and was well packaged.  Merchandise worked exactly as expected and would trust both the manufacturer of said merchandise and the seller of said merchandise again.  A great product at a great price with great customer service.  Would happily buy again.
 Great for low carb diets. Mixes well and no upset stomach. Completely lacking in flavor though. I would recommend getting a smaller size and tasting before buying the 5lb tub.
 So I actually don't take this, I take the "natural whey" version which I highly recommend although be prepared for a far less sugary taste.  This tub I got for a friend, his words follow:<br/><br/>The protein itself was 5 stars.  The taste is faint with water, really good with milk.  It also mixes well.  One thing I really liked is that I was able to stop taking my glutamate and BCAA supplements since this protein incorporates those (unlike the prior protein I was taking).<br/><br/>One star reduction for a weird chemical smell.  The smell didn't affect the taste but I wasn't too keen on trying it the first time I mixed this flavor up.  This did convert me to an ON person as this brand seems to have a lot less filler than the other ones in my price range.
 Pretty much the only thing that has worked in making me gain weight.<br/>I have worked out in conjuction with BSN mass gainer, both the tub and bag, and saw little result.<br/>This actually helped me go from 130 lbs to 142 lbs. I did end up losing soon after stopping consuming it though, dropped back to 132-135<br/>So it does work, the tastes not bad, its actually pretty good and its not a hassle to mix like the BSN. i can see why its the gold standard haha
 Prefer this brand bc ingredients aren’t as scary as other brands. Taste is pretty good or at least you get used to it. Not a lot of sugar. Recommend.
 Bro. DO YOU EVEN LIFT? For 90% of you out there this is all you need to supplement a healthy diet and putting in work at the gym. Don't buy into the crap gyms and vitamin shops try to sell you with all the mass gainers test boosters etc. The best whey money can buy. Some of the flavors taste better than others depending on whether you use water or milk, but in the end it's all preference.
 I've been using ON for years now. I experimented with some other flavors initially, but always went back to double rich chocolate. It actually tastes pretty good, especially if you use some coconut or almond milk.
 CRONC LOVE WHEY  WHEY MAKE CRONCS ARMS BIG BIG  CRONC NO LONGER CAN TOUCH BACK  IS OK CRONC USE TREE TO SCRATCH
 This is the best value protein I've found. And the best flavour is extreme milk chocolate. Tried double rich chocolate and it was okay, definitely not as good as extreme milk chocolate. Cookie and cream was pretty gross.
 There was no seal on the bottle. I’m not sure if they changed it but when I used to buy them a year ago there was a seal on the bottle. As far as the flavor goes, I didn’t really taste the mint.
 Extreme Milk Chocolate. All day, every day.
 I have bought the Extreme Milk Chocolate flavor several times and like it. Decided to try to Double Rich Chocolate flavor since it was the most popular flavor on Amazon. Boy, was I wrong. It has a weak chocolate flavor. When drunk cold, the flavor is even worse! It has a metallic taste then.  The Extreme Chocolate flavor taste even better cold. I'll have to choke this down till I run out, then switch back.
 It's been a while since I've used ON's Whey. Usually I buy chocolate with their products because the vanilla is bland. Tried the vanilla ice cream hoping it would be as good or better than Syntha-6's Vanilla Ice Cream. I was wrong. I know most of us aren't using this for the taste but if you have to choke it down, what's the point in repeat purchases? If ON would sweeten it up some, I'd keep buying. ON was cheaper right now than Syntha-6. Next time I'll just fork over the extra cash for better taste.
 This flavor actually tastes great. ON has been a go to Whey supplement for me for years and I have been a gym rat for over 10 years. Most of the flavors they have are pretty good with or without milk and you get a pretty good bang for the buck.
 For the amount of protein and the small amount of carbs per serving, this stuff can't be beat.  Except in the flavor dept but if you care about flavor go for something like Syntha-6, which has like 5x the carbs.  The size of a scoopsky isn't too big.  It's really a great product and one of the few that doesn't give me a grumbly tummy.
 Vanilla ice cream flavor mixed in with a little chocolate syrup and a cup of milk and you wont be able to taste a difference between a protein shake and chocolate milk. Delicious. This is a great protein
 I've only had 5 or 6 different brands of whey protein powder and this one is so far my favorite.  It seems to get the texture right without lacking on the flavor.  Closest one in taste to chocolate milk!<br/><br/>I also would mix this stuff in with frozen strawberries, frozen blueberries, and vanilla greek yogurt for an amazing smoothie.  Tried that with other powders and they work, just not as great of taste as this one.
 Optimum Nutrition means, You get what you paid.<br/><br/>One thing I didn't like is that the package was damaged a little bit. It was leaking a tiny little bit.I couldnt understand where it was leaking. I mean there was powder inside of the box. Luckily, It was not a big leaking at all, but it was disturbing enough. So I put the whole protein package into a big plastic bag, just in case. Then problem solved, no need to return it back.<br/><br/>So, my advice is to amazon.com, you should better to do the something smilar like me before shipping.<br/><br/>What if the tear was big enough the  leak the whole package ?
 I order this product every month. My husband and I use it daily. I mix mine with water and ice and drink it for breakfast when I don't have time to cook myself something. I also use it after my workouts. My husband mixes his with water and drinks it after his workouts. Sometimes I blend it with ice and milk for my kids for a treat.
 Great stuff. Some reviewers said stay away from the double chocolate, so I got the milk choc to try and I like it. May try double choc next to try something more strong tasting.
 I had tried other whey protiens from my local grocery stores and GNC.  After seeing all the great reviews for this product I decided to give it a try.  It mixes much better than other proteins I tried and the flavor is awesome.  The vanilla ice cream tastes really good mixed with milk on my morning cereal I have since tried the double rich chocolate and it tastes so much better than store bought chocolate milk. All around a great product without all the extra junk found in other whey proteins.  Amazon and Optimum Nutrition are now my goto source for my future suppliment needs.
 Simply loved this. The flavor is great, something I can stomach drinking everyday. I usually make a shake with bananas, almond milk, strawberries, yogurt, and oats. With this powder, it's even better. One concern is that the first few days and occasionally now I do get bloated and gassy, but I guess that is to be effective. I've lost weight and improved by strength by using this product while exercising and dieting. It's great to get your protein intake in such a tasty way.
 I've tried several brands and flavors.  This is the best bang for the buck.  Great source of protein.  If you mix it with a spoon, let it set a bit and mix again, unless you don't mind a few chunks.  It doesn't bother me, but my wife can't stand it unless you put it in a blender, which whips it up and certainly makes it smoother.  Also, for the double chocolate, add some peanut butter powder (PBR2 is one brand) and you get more protein and it tastes really, really, good.
 Great brand of protein. Does what I need it to do. Best tasting protein I've had. Reasonable for the price too! I recommend it to a lot of new people trying out protein for the first time.
 This used to be my go to, but I recently noticed all their powders contain SOY LECITHIN.  A cheap nasty byproduct of soy manufacturing that is created with chemicals. To make soy lecithin, soybean oil is extracted from the raw soybeans using a chemical solvent (usually hexane, which is also used as a solvent, paint thinner, and chemical reaction medium.) Thousands of guys are using this with bodybuilding and not realizing an ingredient in it can increase estrogen in the body.  OPTIMUM NUTRITION PLEASE START USING SUNFLOWER LECITHIN AS YOUR EMULSIFIER!!!  Sunflower Lecithin is cold pressed without any harsh chemicals.
 This is the best protein powder money can buy!  Been using it for one year and I have learned, nutrition is as important as going to the gym if you want growth!
 I've tried many protein powders, and this one isn't so bad, but it isn't good either. I have the double rich chocolate one. However, points for this because I am seeing some gains after using this product and don't feel "dead" anymore after I hit the gym from an extreme workout. I took off one star because it will give you gas... I mean very loud gas. I consume this in the gym right after my workout, so by the time I'm walking out of there, I'm creating a hell of a storm behind me...
 I spent a long time researching protein but everything is just an opinion on the internet. There is no real evidence or proof that one protein works better than another. It's also not regulated by the FDA... that being said, I've been with this brand for a while and it seems to work. It tastes okay. It's not too great on my stomach these days. They make a "natural" one which is easier on the stomach, but this one gives me gas and makes me feel bloated...
 The industry standard when it comes to protein powder. Been using this for 2 years and haven't even considered any other product. This product has spoiled me to the point of where I start to take offense when other people don't want to try this. You can't go wrong with anything ON
 I always liked this product! I think I bought 5-6 of the same brand/size but two different flavors over the years (double rich chocolate, and cookies&amp;cream). I always prepare it the same way. I generally use cookies&amp;cream when I prepare a smoothie with frozen bunch of fruits (whatever I have at home: honeydew, strawberry, banana, blueberry, peach, apple) and rarely with frozen vegetables although I still yet to learn to make a great vega-protein smoothie. I actually tried double rich chocolate powder with frozen fruits only once and the taste was not much different. I didn't get the chocolate taste. Anyhow, but my chocolate-rich protein smoothie is something else, yummy!!! I learned it this year, get you addicted (1c milk, 1 banana, 1 heaped tbsp skippy's reduced super extra chunky peanut butter, 1 tsp no sugar added Hershey's cocoa, a little sugar-free Torani's hazelnut or vanilla syrup with 5 cubes of ice).  Why 4 and not 5 stars? Pricey but not so much compare to other quality and tasty (!) brands.
 First and foremost, let me say that this powder blends very well. I was really impressed with how light and easy it is to mix this. I actually ended up funneling it into a water bottle and carrying that with me to mix at a later time, and it did fine just shaking the bottle. Second, the flavor is also very light (depending on the mix ratio) but doesn't taste bad. I was very happy with this and will be trying other flavors soon.
 Very impressed with this drink mix. Tastes very good. All the reviews I saw for this were good. Taste good with just water! I have drink a shake every morning.
 Great flavor. Cannot take picture because I have ate it up. :P
 Optimum Nutrition Whey Protein. the best there is out there on the market. I use to buy whatever brand the store (Walmart) has in stock because it was easy quick and convenient. But this is better.<br/><br/>I bought Mocha Cappuccino on a whim -- I never tasted it yet, but it smells good...i'm pretty sure I'll like it.<br/>I use to always buy Vanilla because it goes so easy and well with everything...but wanted a slight change.
 I've tried a lot of different flavors. I usually would need to change flavors after each 5lbs due to the flavors getting old. This is the first flavor that I've used back to back besides their Double Rich Chocolate. I'll be ordering my third in a couple weeks.<br/><br/>The mint flavor is perfect, not overpowering, not artificial tasting. I mix it with some coconut almond milk and coconut oil. Honestly see myself using this combination for quite a long time.
 I never do reviews but this protein powder was so awsome I felt like I had too..  First of all it mixes very well with water or milk in a shaker cup with a wisk ball..  Couple shakes and it's winning..  I've had so many others that don't do this..  So that was a win..  2nd it actually tastes pretty good..  I'm actually happy to drink it..  3rd it has 4g of glutamine per serving which is essential for not so sore muscles..  This stuff is the winner for a post workout or meal replacement..  It's fast acting and digests quick so perfect for post workout..  Buy it..  You'll be beast mode., :)
 After just 6 workouts, I am already noticing a difference in muscle gain.
 I try a different flavour every time I order more of this, and they've all been great. I use it as a supplement for cardio and moderate free weight exercise. It makes a difference. I'd suggest getting a shaker/mixer for protein drinks, as stirring it with a spoon doesn't work as well, and leaves clumps.
 I love coconut, so the combination of chocolate and coconut is a treat for me. The only weird part is that it didn't come with a scooper...
 2 stars which represents: "I don't like." I am specifically reviewing the banana cream flavor. I could only get through using this a few times normally before I just had to start plugging my nose and chugging it quickly.
 I love this stuff. I take it 3 times a day; first thing in the morning and pre and post workout. I have mixed it with whole milk before and it was fantastic. I currently mix it with almond milk and it is very good. Easy to mix and tastes great. I tried the 'Natural' version but it had weak flavor and although healthier was not worth the difference. I have gone through about 20 of these 5 pounders and will continue to use them unless the price rises.
 I've been using this protein for a few years and it is my favorite! Last time I checked it was rated #1 on bodybuilding.com. This company uses high quality ingredients in their products! The flavors I've had all taste great and they have a lot of different ones to choose from.
 DELICIOUS!!!!!!! I'm so happy I went with chocolate coconut! It's a tasty flavor that isn't sold at any GNC or Vitamin Store I've visited so it feels unique haha. But really though, ON makes the best tasting protein out there and so far this, vanilla and chocolate is good. I'm thinking of trying strawberry but a little scared too haha!
 Who knows if it's working, but it sure tastes awesome! Only one I've ever really liked. One rounded scoop in 8oz. of water in a Blender bottle. Send it for a spin, and down it in one gulp. Great stuff that I enjoy drinking like a chocolate dessert. I guess I'm gaining muscle mass too.
 I have been using this ON protein powder for 10+ years.  The texture is perfect for making milk shake, adding bananas or other fruits.  But they changed the formula since last year. It is now thin and watery.  This is my second attempt to buy the original ON that I have loved for so many years.  I guess I this is my last try with ON.<br/>I will start trying out other brands.  Good bye ON.
 Unlike some other products I've tried in the past, his does not have a chalky taste even when just mixed with milk.  Nowadays I mix it with milk frozen fruit to make a post-workout smoothie.  The only downside is that it tends to leave a slight aftertaste, but that is a very minor complaint.
 I have used protien for years and generaly use Syntha 6 as that was always the only one that would not give me an upset stomach.  I did not ecpect this one to work as it seems like the standard type of protien. I just could not keep paying so much for the other kind. This has actually worked greart for me, no issues at all and has a great taste.
 At first I found with Strawberry that I was burping up the flavor. But then that stopped, I mix it with milk and find I am enjoying it.
 It's been a great supplement and meal replacement for me. The taste is good, not great, as it is pretty sweet. But I bought this more so for the function than the taste. Reduces fatigue after workout and keeps me going throughout the day when I get a bit hungry. One star deducted for the taste, but it would be closer to a 4.5 if I could do that.
 I have never bought a protein powder before but was recommended this by a friend.  The taste is great and you get a huge quantity for a very reasonable price. I mixed this with a banana and some ice and was looking forward to my shakes.
 A really great protein powder. It's hard to find one that hits the mark on just about everything - from how well it dissolves, to it's taste, to even how it leaves you feeling after consumption. I purchased the chocolate flavor and it was perfect just mixed with water (even better with a milk or similar). Really look forward to trying other flavors and even getting fancy with making more protein ingredient-based dishes (like pancakes or muffins with maybe a Vanilla flavor!)..
 I wish protein powder wasn't so expensive. That's my only complaint and it's a complaint with the whole industry, not this one brand. This particular product tastes amazing and makes me feel great.
 I'm a weightlifting enthusiast, so I need a lot of protein in my diet to ensure maximum muscle growth and development. I've been taking this Optimum Nutrition whey supplement for over a year now, and I have to say it's great. The taste can't be beat (I mix two scoops with 1-1/2 cups milk and an ice cube—it tastes just like chocolate milk), and the powder easily breaks up in liquid when I use my Blender Bottle. Even just using a spoon to stir the powder in with milk doesn't cause too much clumping. I've been having two ON protein shakes a day for over a year (so I have to reorder a 10-lb bag every 3-4 months or so), and I have yet to tire of the double rich chocolate flavor. Plus, it can be mixed with lots of other stuff to give healthy snacks like banana protein pancakes a kick of chocolate flavor!<br/><br/>Don't let the price (which really isn't even that bad if you buy 10 pounds at a time) be a deterrent; you really get what you pay for with this stuff.
 Great taste, slow absorption. Some people see the absorption as a negative since many brands advertise how quick theirs absorbs. But for me when I am in a weight cutting phase the slow absorption is perfect because I use this as a meal replacement and it keeps me feeling full for longer. Get a blender bottle though because this powder, like most powders, does not mix well.
 Bro, let me tell you about this stuff. Protein? more like BROTEIN. when I want Almighty gainz, I turn to this stuff. gets me yoked like an ox and buff like a fox. I DON'T CARE IF IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE!! you want to be a little girl? DON'T BUY THIS BECAUSE YOU CAN'T CHANGE GENDERS THROUGH A WEIGHT GAINING SUPPLEMENT. but it will definitely give you the protein you need to get the bulk you want. and it mixes well.
 I've been loving the ON/GS Whey lately and decided to give the Chocolate Coconut a try this time around.  I've never been a huge fan of chocolate but this flavor is not overpowering at all- really smooth.
 As many other of the critical reviews state, there are stomach problems, a weird fatigued feeling and headaches when I use this on not totally full stomach.  Even worse is that when I try to match it with some food and stuff I still have a slight adverse reaction.
 This is my third time to purchase this product. I am very happy with it and will continue to use it as my go to protein powder.
 The taste is good for a protein drink. I really enjoy it as a shake with banana and other fruits blended in it. Very tasty!
 It is extremely hard for me to put on weight I have an extremely fast metabolism, I eat in my lunch at work and about 20 minutes after I have to go. TMI, but thats how extreme It is. Anyway this stuff helps me a lot and its delicious I take two scoops at night before bed with cold milk, its the best shake ever. At first it was kinda hard getting used to the taste, but after a hard working out session this is what your muscles are starving for. Highly recommend this stuff. And it is cheaper than at GNc. It is not magic though, I work out 4 or 5 times a week and do heavy lifting and I am starting to see results, if you are a hard gainer like me this will greatly help along with a good diet and lifting sessions.
 Would recommend this to anyone looking to step their game up at the gym.  ON has amazing products and has yet to disappoint me with anything they sell.  Within a the first month of taking this to aid and repair my muscles I can see a big difference in my weights.  The taste is very good, it has a bit of a cinnamon/pumpkin taste/after taste, but I like it.  Also it mixes very well.  I have mixed it with a spoon in a cup and it works very easily, and never leaves chunks.  With a blender cup it is just as easy!  When I am out I will plan to be buying the same product!
 Value: 8/10 :: not the cheapest, but still really affordable and offers some good macros<br/><br/>Taste 10/10 :: I had one of the chocolate flavors can't remember which, but it tasted great.<br/><br/>Mixing 7/10 :: I would frequently have chunks with a blender bottle but with an actual blender no chunks<br/><br/>Macros 9/10 :: Came out to about $1 per 33 grams of protein. Not bad. Low cal/ low carb/ low fat. Nice aminos<br/><br/>Overall 5/5: Would/will buy again
 This is my son's 2nd order for product and really liked the flavor. It mixes really easy with water or milk which dissolves quickly.
 Optimum Nutrition has great products in my opinion, not just taste but quality.  Having had access to trainers from around the world, many different regimes ect this product is one of the best proteins I've used.  Only a couple of things with this product for me are, if you mix it with water it seems pretty thin.  Not saying that's bad, and it still has good taste with water.  Just don't expect it to blunt hunger for any amount of time.  If you're eating right, it won't matter anyway.  Mixes well with creatine, cost is great comparably and I will buy it again.  My opinion is that some of the other proteins add fillers, and say it has a lot of other ingredients to make it more appealing and ON doesn't do that.  If you want straight up protein that taste great, low fat, low carbs, then you will be happy with this purchase.  If you're chasing more of the all in one product, this isn't your bag then.
 Ok, so after doing tons of research, I bought a big 5 pound jug of this stuff, double rich chocolate. I just had my first "shake". It smelled great in the jug, did mix well without having to use a blender, but when I took a sip I nearly spit it out. Gross. Tastes like no chocolate I've ever ingested before. Hugely disappointed. If you have the resources to mix this with other ingredients, it will probably taste fine, but with plain water (or regular coffee like I used), it tastes horrible.
 The only thing I have changed with my workouts is my protein, I've gained so much muscle in a short amount of time that I've actually been asked if I'm juicing, haha no but I did switch proteins. This stuff is amazing totally would recommend to anyone. I feel  stronger last longer and I'm seeing awesome gains.
 I love love love this flavor! It tastes like a light coffee/chocolate milk flavor. It mixes really well, you don't even need a shaker bottle. I usually mix mine with almond milk or coconut/almond milk. I have also thrown it into oatmeal or my coffee in the morning. I am never disappointed by Optimum Nutrition products.
 The product tastes great and does the job. No question. But the best thing about it is that the product is a powder that DOES NOT fly through the air so easily like other brands, and mixes quickly and completely when stirred. That's great for me because I do not use it in any fancy way. Just 2% milk and I'm off to the gym. Awesome.
 Even though its a pricey product, i feel that it is worth the money. I've been searching through multiple websites and asking a lot of my gym friends about which brand i should go with, i got back a ton of brands but this one came up quite often. I've tried a  few different brands and this one really does what it says. The flavors I've had match exactly as the real thing so if that's your biggest concern, fear not, it tastes great!
 This is my second purchase of the tub of the Rocky road flavor, it tastes more good with milk rather than water.<br/>I’ve tried the muscle pharm combact of the flavor cookies n cream which tasted more sweet than than the ON rocky road flavor.
 It is gold standard.. What more is to say? I've been using this for over 3 years. It is nice to not have to eat so much protein from meats all the time. Also if you are broke as a joke, like I was. protein + ramen noodles, is the prison bulk diet. 60$ a month and you can put on some decent size.
 Good nutritional info. The Rocky Road taste is really weird; they tried too hard to add a "marshmallow" flavor into it and it just ends up tasting like some sort of fake sugary cherry / marshmallow mix. Probably should have stuck with plain ol' chocolate but I read another reviewer's take here that this was the best flavor he had tried and went for it.
 Few and far between do I write reviews, I've had GNCs brand of Chocolate Whey proteins, including ONs Double Chocolate, and by far and away, the Chocolate Coconut is amazing.  It's like drinking a chocolate coconut milk shake.  It's actually enjoyable to drink.  The Double Chocolate is a bit protein rich tasting for me, I have finished off a couple 5lb'ers now, but I will be sticking with the Coconut.  If you like coconut, you'll love this.
 I really like this product. I drink it every morning with a little almond milk. Dissolves fast and completely!
 I'm just loving this. Still into my first bottle but it really helps during my workouts. I workout 3 days with a day off and this has kept me going so far. I'm going for a second bottle as soon as this is over.<br/><br/>Update 05/04/2016 : Going for my second bottle. Works great as usual. Imma stick to it from now on.
 This has been the best protein I've tried by far. The flavors are (mostly) fantastic, the profile is spot on, and it's one of the few that doesn't taste bad when mixed with plain water. My only complaint would be consistency, about 10% of the time I get tubs that are "clumpier" and have some trouble mixing in a blender bottle although a quick hit with a wand blender takes care of those rare orders. It's also one of the few proteins I've found I can drink during training without getting a heavy or bloated feeling. Mix in a little peanut butter or maybe some berries and banana and you also get a good meal replacement shake.
 Was as described but did not seem as thick as other similar products (e.g. Muscle Tech version).
 I have used this brand and flavor for years.  It tastes great and I really like the quality protein.  I'm not a weight lifter or anything.  I like that Whey protein is very healthy for you and digestible. Purchasing it online saves a ton of money over buying it at the brick and mortar stores, especially if you get a good deal on the shipping.
 Great taste - I bought the banana flavor.  It's a nice flavor for fruity shakes.  This protein has less calories than the last one I used, which is exactly what I was looking for.  This is a very popular protein and for goo reason, can't go wrong here.  Pick a flavor and enjoy.
 I like it. I add fruits, almond milk and this protein powder to make a shake/smoothie kinda and its yummy
 Great protein long lasting if you have a good routine and diet you will see results. Taste good I mix mine with coffee or almond milk and some oats.
 Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Whey is a great-tasting source of supplemental protein for individuals looking to increase their protein intake but who cannot do so through conventional food sources alone.
 I usually go with stuff that is rated very high on Amazon and I've never been let down. When I first tried this protein, I bought it from the store after finding out it was popular on Amazon. If you don't know a whole lot about protein powder, and frankly dont care much but want to take a good one..This is it. Out of all the flavors coffee is the only one I've bought more than once. It taste like coffee with a little cream and sugar, not even like a protein drink at all. The other flavors are good too, but I'm trying all of them out. So far coffee is the only one where I've taken 4-5 times in a row and not gotten sick of.
 One of my favorite proteins. You cannot go wrong with this one. Plenty of flavors, I recommend the milk chocolate. It doesn't have any fillers like many others. I take this for breakfast lunch and before bed and it works great. You can also mix it with food to make a chocolate treat.
 Flavors not that great, but ingredients are good and at the end of the day that's what you buy it for
 Wasn't sure this would actually taste like coffee, but it does and we love it.  Just wish the flavor was slightly stronger, but I like my coffee pretty strong, so not a surprise I would want it to taste like the darkest, boldest coffee available.  I will probably order it again when we run out.
 Good taste, though you to get a bit of "formula smell" when taking the first gulp. I like strawberry banana the best, but this good once or twice a week to change things up. What I don't like is the sodium amount given I consume 5 scoops over the course of the day including pre and post workout. But again this is good as a 22nd flavor so I don't get sick of the first one.
 The taste is ok. Very weak if you add even an ounce too much water. I can not take this, due to it causing severe stomach issues.
 Great testing mixes well.. Simply one of the best protein shakes out there.  If your reading this review then you prolly already did your research on it so don't hesitate just buy it.
 I love this protein powder and this brand.  I have used many different brands of protein powder and have been lifting weights for about 9 years now.  Chocolate malt is definitely the best tasting protein shake I have ever had. Each serving also has a proper serving of bcaas and glutamine.
 Speaking purely to taste/texture, this is by far the best tasting protein powder I've tried.  It's actually enjoyable to drink.  If you put it in a cold blender with ice-cold milk, it forms this almost cream-like texture.<br/><br/>It also goes well with coffee - in the mornings I take a scoop of this, a teaspoon each of instant coffee powder and creatine, and a cup of milk, and mix it all up in a shaker bottle.  After about 20 seconds of shaking, it's very smooth and tastes pretty good.
 soooo good man i gain some weight use this with me smoothie. i can use this for like one bottle for a month. so i will surely buy this again as soon as the one i have is over.
 The best protein powder for me and I have tried tons! Great taste, great for leaning out and muscle building, I got super ripped by drinking 2 shakes a day combined with other things such as proper nutrition and training, consistence is key and this protein helped me a lot, great flavors too, my fave is extreme chocolate and cake batter
 I've never been dissatisfied with Gold Standard 100% whey, the extreme milk chocolate is my favorite!! I highly reccomend!
 Mocha Capucchino is the best flavor in my opinion, not that flavor should be an essential in a supplement like this. Mixes well (I recommend blending with ice and milk; it's also nice to add frozen blueberries). Put it in your blender bottle at the beginning of the day and you're ready for that afternoon/evening workout.
 Can't Beat it. It is the best that I have used, and I have been working out for years.
 Reputation speaks for itself. Top shelf protien that tastes great for a supplement. I have used for years and will continue to. Many flavors but chocolate is amazing. I mix with 2% milk and add my Optimum Nutrition Creatine in with it. Just cant beat the quality. Thats what matters in a protein.
 extremely tasty! pair this up with vanlla soy milk and you have pretty much a chocolate shake.  if you are working on a tough workout and need something kind of light you probably want to use water, but if you are like me and want to eat this at home post workout, the vanilla soy milk works great.<br/><br/>this mixes well so dont worry about chunks so much.  it does have a lot of fake sugar probably so make sure you are OK with that.
 Very happy with this product. Have lost 12 lbs in about two months.  The chocolates are good when they are really cold. I substitute ON for one meal a day &amp; drink about a cup at bedtime if I'm hungry.  Mixes well in a shaker bottle for a powdered protein; not perfect but okay. I shake it again each time before I drink it. If there's not any made up ahead of time, I add ice to cool it down.
 Not very good product. Honestly, I do not feel any benefits taking this product after a long bike ride.
 Great taste.  Top notch whey.  Mix in a shake bottle and enjoy.  Add a scoop of peanut butter and blend also.  You will love the taste.  I highly recommend the double rich chocolate.<br/><br/>* Please let me know if my review has helped.  Thank You.*
 I tried ISOPURE and I couldn't get past the taste it was DISGUSTING and almost me gag while drinking it, and leaves you with a artificial bitter aftertaste for hours after drinking it (Creamy Vanilla). ON is the best tasting protein powder Iv'e tasted so far. (Extreme Milk Chocolate) and you get an extra 2 pounds for the same price as ISOPURE!
 The best tasting protein I have had, after trying many!!!<br/>Couldn’t be more pleased!<br/>It tastes heavenly if you add banana and strawberries!
 So far I've tried the chocolate malt, delicious strawberry, and now the vanilla icecream.  The chocolate malt is my favorite so far, but the vanilla icecream is a very close second.  The strawberry wasn't bad either.  Optimum Nutrition in my opinion is the best there is.  I crave this after every workout.  It isn't something I have to force myself to drink.  It dissolves well in milk, but you will have to stir it for a while as well as a couple of times while you drink it.
 Every person is different so find the best flavor yourself.<br/>Find that scoop first using a dry slotted spoon.<br/>I was able to gradually increase the weights which I thought impossible before.<br/>Don't expect it to do wonders without doing a regular workout and healthy diet.
 This protein powder tastes pretty good and is not chalky or gritty. I drink it with water and sometimes I add a banana and it blends up very smoothly. I'm not using it to build muscle or mass so I cant comment on that. I consume this to ensure I get enough protein after my work outs to maintain my weight. I will continue using this product and although the strawberry is very good I may try a different flavor.
 Quite tasty and blends pretty easily in a shaker bottle.  The strawberry flavor is enjoyable enough that I actually enjoy drinking it and will take my time.
 I liked the product. It is original. Taste good. I bought double rich chocolate and its pretty good.
 Great product.
 Best protein powder I have tried over past few years. Switched from Six Star Pro Nutrition Whey Protein Plus Elite Series. Didn't like that Six Star included creatine (ads don't show it, but Six Star you get from Amazon is different formula and has 2.5 g per serving). Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard, Extreme Milk Chocolate flavor is very good, compared to other brands and mixes quickly with no clumping.
 Excellent product!
 Let's face it:<br/>After a good workout WHEY protein is what you need - nothing else.<br/>This product is relatively reasonably priced (considering the ingredients) and its definitely worked for me.<br/>(I work out daily and take 3 protein shakes in addition to 4 meals a day; I have tried pretty much ALL Whey proteins, but this one seems to give me the best results)<br/><br/>To all insiders - no issues with excessive "gas" here! :)<br/><br/>Top product which I will continue to use.
 The taste is not that great I've had much better tasting chocolate protein powders but it works you can tell.
 This stuff tastes great. I've used Muscle Milk before and you cannot even compare the taste. Muscle Milk has this weird, bitter, slightly metallic? aftertaste. I got the Extreme Milk Chocolate and it just tastes like cocoa powder. If you compare the ingredients, it seems healthier: Less sugar, more protein, less fat compared to the other brands.
 This is just lovely, the flavor and aroma is great. French Vanilla cre'me(cream).<br/>I was worried I was buying too much, but it is just right.<br/>I was buying pre mixed protein drink from the stores-just awful. I might not have been buying the right kind.
 Helps me recover after a strenuous workout!
 I LOVE this protein.  We got the vanilla ice cream favor and it is yummy.  I would use this anytime - not just as a supplement to my workouts.  I really is good - I plan on ordering it again when we run out.
 Lots of good stuff in this Whey and its low in sugar withough sacrificing taste which is tough to find... But If you're still skeptical about it not tasting good, rest assured. It's pretty tasty as far as protein powders go. But if you want a REALLY good protein infused treat from time to time, Mix this powder with about 12 ounces of "Coco Libre" or "Vita Coco" Coconut Water. It tastes amazing. Usually mix that with some Chai seed &amp; baby spinach as a morning breakfast shake on recovery days.
 way too expensive. Probably never get it again, but it definitely is a good protein and tastes great. So, con is its price.
 I love this protein powder. The price is just right, and the quality is spot on. Some of the flavor aren't the greatest so you'll have to maybe get smaller versions of different flavors before you decide to buy the large container. The reviews ranking certain flavors are helpful so i'd look to those for your guide.
 One of the best tasting powders I have tried.<br/>I lucked out as hubby is lactose intolerant, but bought this and could not use it - so I inherited it.
 Tastes good with milk although you can use it with water.Not too sweet and has a good taste . Easy mixable with water and easy digestive.
 I'm new to the protein powder world and started with some from trader joe's and one from sun warrior. This by far tastes the best, especially against the sun warrior which I believe is a vegan powder. I usually take it at home blended from a magic bullet with either water or milk and half a frozen banana. Tastes wonderful! Lots of protein, low on the carbs and fat. With milk tastes just like chocolate milk. Its like dessert!
 It works exactly as it should, and it tastes great! I have noticed a difference taking this product!<br/><br/>I recommend taking one scoop after your work out, about 15 minutes after, which is the prime time to take it (within that 10-30 minute window after a workout) and one as soon as you wake up, because since you haven't eaten in 7-8, you’ve had no protein during this time and you are at risk for becoming catabolic (meaning you’ll start to break down muscle for fuel.) By drinking a protein shake with some simple carbs (like orange juice or a banana blended in) as soon as you wake up, you can stop this muscle breakdown dead in its tracks.
 This protein is easily the best I've had in its price range.<br/><br/>We've had the extreme milk chocolate and rocky road flavors. My wife and I stick to extreme milk chocolate as  Rocky road is just a bit too sweet for us.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-it tastes great<br/>-it mixes very easily (even with just a spoon)<br/>-48g of protein per 2 scoops!<br/>-good amount of bcaas<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-contains lactase for those that are lactose intolerant like myself.  It really doesn't bother me though so there must not be much.
 No inner seal to indicate this is a fresh product.
 I won`t give a detailed review or a bunch of copy and paste garb like those liking to hear themselves talk. But if you want or need Whey, this is it. I use only products from Optimum Nutrition, it clean and not filled with crap. Cookies and cream also tastes pretty good. I normally mix it with 8 of skim milk, it does the job its suppose to. I highly recommend this product to weight lifters and those missing needed protein in their diet.
 I don't know why they made an improvement to the flavor.  The old flavor was great, and now this new and improved flavor is not very good.  I guess I will just have to look for another brand/flavor when this one is used up.  I thought I finally found one with a good taste on the old flavor, and then they had to change it.  Why don't people just leave alone something good they have.  I would have given a 5 star on the old flavor.
 I would reate ON Nutrition Gold Standard 5 stars in general. The lower rating is for this particular flavor, Cake Batter. It has a chemical taste, which is not overwhelming but noticeable, resembling the taste you get if you chew a Tylenol pill. It's hard to completely ignore. Other than that the cake flavor would be pretty good.
 I have purchased this on several occasions. Not only is it suppose to be one of the better products, it tastes pretty good weather you use it with water or milk. I've tried the strawberry and the chocolate and personally prefer the chocolate (especially with water because the strawberry doesn't go too well with water)...<br/><br/>As with any protein though, get ready to be gassy if you are drinking more than 2 scoops a day!..
 No complaints. low sugar. low carbs and good amount of protein. just what I need
 Over the past few months I have experienced persistent moderate pain in nearly all of my joints - shoulders, wrists, elbows, back, knees, ankles, wrists - pretty much everywhere. I initially chalked it up to "I'm just getting old and stuff is wearing out....". It's bound to happen, right?. As the pain got worse I knew something was up - I'm pushing 40 but I'm not 80. I was having trouble sleeping and simple movements such as getting out of bed or crouching to pick something were preceded by me tightening up in anticipation of the pain that I was in for.<br/><br/>I contracted Lyme disease a couple years ago and although I was treated for it within days of the appearance of outward symptoms I wondered if it might somehow be recurring. While not as severe as Lyme, the pain and soreness throughout my entire body was very similar.<br/><br/>I've never had food allergies or, thankfully, any significant medical issues. I did opt for a "vegetarian" diet about 9 months ago but that was an elective and conscious decision to do so - not because of some intolerance to anything that was I previously eating.<br/><br/>In a well meaning attempt to balance the lack of protein in my "new" diet I started regularly drinking protein shakes. I thought I had sufficiently researched protein powders (I read dozens of Amazon reviews therefore considered myself an expert, of course...) and settled on this one. What I neglected to see - even though it was staring me right in the face - was "Acesulfame Potassium" in the list of ingredients.<br/><br/>I didn't realize it at the time but now looking back it's very clear. I really ramped up my intake of protein shakes about 3 months ago, precisely the same time the joint pain became constant. As obvious as it seems now I never correlated the two. I recently decided to change brands of protein powders to one with zero artificial sweeteners but still didn't link it with the joint pain. Within two days of switching protein powders the joint pain that had been unrelenting for months was magically gone.<br/><br/>I remember standing up out of bed that morning...bracing for the wave of pain that never came. I comically looked around, sort of waiting for it, skeptical that it was not there.<br/><br/>It's been nearly two weeks since the switch and I'm still pain free (or at least as one can be with a body that hasn't been 20 years old in nearly 20 years....).<br/><br/>This is obviously not a scientific study and if I wasn't afraid of doing more harm than good I'd be tempted to start using the artificially sweetened protein powder again just to see if the joint pain comes back. I have little doubt it would but I'm not so curious to confirm it that I want to go through that again.
 Tastes great. Great value. 24 grams of protein per scoop. Scoop sizes are not that big so you are able to add more indredients to your shake if desired.
 These protein powders are great. Vanilla ice cream is by far the best flavor and most versatile (tastes good in water, overnight oats, etc). Cake batter is pretty good. Strawberry is terrible - tastes very artificial and is undrinkable in water.
 The flavor is absolutely delicious. I add this to shakes and yogurt for my husband as he has cancer and needs the protein. A great way to give him a protein boost a few times a day.
 I ordered the banana cream and have to say the flavor is soo smooth! I've tried the double chocolate, cake batter, vanilla, and cookies and cream and this flavor by far takes the cake! :)
 I was worried about the packaging issues many are having were the case is already opened or damaged. The protein came intact and sealed, no damage or anything. I ordered the chocolate coco and the taste is good, don't expect the flavor to be as premium as lets say a chocolate bar but it does taste like chocolate and an after taste as coco. I will update the review in one month to tell you guys my results with the protein.
 I started out with this protein. It serves its purpose, but it is definitely the lower-cost option. IMO, you get what you pay for. Platinum costs a little more, but it's worth a little more because of its increased bioavailablility . When I started taking Platinum hydro whey, that's when I really started to notice that my recovery from workouts was better. It also upset my stomach less than this.
 You get more servings out of this 5 pounds jug then you will out of others because the serving scoop is smaller and you stull get the same amount of protein. There's no garbage or creatine in there.  The flavor is outstanding and the texture is much higher quality and it mixes much easier with no clumping. The quality is top rate. There's a reason why it has over 10,000 5 star reviews. It's by far the best whey you can buy for the money in chocolate, vanilla, or strawberry.
 I have tried many different brands of whey protein shakes. However, this brand is worth the extra money.<br/><br/>First- the flavor is amazing!<br/>Second-It mixes very well<br/>Third- I am lactose intolerant, but this powder is one of the few that DONT upset my stomach. (good quality ingredients)<br/><br/>I would recommend to Anyone!
 very tasty I got rocky road and really havent gotten tired of it. I usually get fed up with the same flavors over and over again this was surprisingly different
 Delicious! Mixed it with water, PB Fit and a frozen banana and it was the yummiest shake I’ve ever made!
 I love this protein. It makes is great with water or milk using the shaker bottle. It tastes awesome and the nutritional benefits are second to none. My buddy and I split this bag down the middle and I couldn't be more pleased. The bag itself is durably constructed with a nice Ziploc seal.
 I mix this with strawberry, banana, and blueberry shakes and it is actually really good.
 The flavor and consistency of this protein powder was extremely poor. I purchased one container of Chocolate and one container of Banana Strawberry, both of which were sub-standard. The Chocolate was okay, with a mild flavor, but clumped seriously when shaken. Even with a blender bottle and a great deal of mixing this powder still has clumbs and uneven consistency. The Banana Strawberry flavor tasted very fake and chemically, and had the same clumping issues. When mixed with water both flavors had no thickness to them like some higher-end protein powders. Mixed with milk these were slightly better, but overall I definitely wouldn't order this brand again.
 Best protein mix I've had, I've even had GNC and multiple other big name's and I highly recommend this. So far I have the double chocolate and cookies and cream, I will try other flavors once I run out of both which maybe some time hahaha 5 labs each will last a month or so with 74 servings each I take two scoops daily and on both, the chocolate for my meal replacement shakes in the morning and the cookies and cream for post workout.
 Just a single serving of Whey Protein is 24 grams! That is the equivalent of FOUR hard boiled eggs. I would highly recommend only using half serving or half a full scoop with 10 Oz water, when you first start drinking it for about a week. The thing is people are paying like 60 bucks for this thing and start complaining that its bloating their stomach and therefor protein powder is very bad for you. This couldn't have been far from the truth, 24 grams is ALOT, you need to take your time drinking it, instead of chugging it down your throat. Imagine you did that with 4 eggs, you would be bloated and you would feel awful for quite a while. I also recommend Protein Isolates, they cut out almost all of the fat and lactose content in the milk, as that is what this is, literally milk powder. Also for the best results use unflavored whey protein, the other ones can have added sugar and that can upset your stomach.
 My second order for this product. Started bodybuilding 4 weeks ago, was 177 pounds, I took 1scoop as snack in the morning, 1 scoop in the afternoon for snack and one before bed. Now I'm 194 pounds (I'm 32 years old and 6'2). Always had a hard time to gain weight (fat included). This product together with hard training and a good diet really helping me.
 I've been using this brand of supplements for years with great results. Wide array of great tasting flavors, mixes very easily and just plain works. Great amount of protein per scoop, good amount of BCAA's and no added junk that you don't need. This is one of the things where you get what you pay for. Love it.
 The best protein but a little annoyed at how my last two jugs arrived
 It's the first time I use whey protein and I am a fan now. It tastes like chocolate milk and no weird flavour at all. 24g of protein in a drink of 115 kcal is great for me.<br/><br/>I use it as a quick and lazy breakfast replacement and after-exercise drink. It helps me to cut down reliance on using meat as a protein source.<br/><br/>My aim is to trim body fat and I've lost 5 kg thanks to a high-protein and carb cycling diet programme. This supplement helps a lot.
 Have tried quite a few protein powders.  This is the best for flavor, ease of mixing with soy milk, and seems to have a pure pedigree.  I am on my 3rd or 4th large tub of this, as I usually have one shake each day before strength training workout  Also goes well in a 50-50 blend with Nutiva hemp protein powder (much to my surprise).
 I add this to my smoothies for long lasting energy and good weight control.  No high glycemic rushes either.
 For price point and quality this is simply great Whey protein. With the amount of flavors they have you can switch it up and not get bored.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- Hard to find better at the quality and price point.<br/>- Lot of flavors to choose from.<br/>- Mixes well with water or milk.<br/>- Is to the point: Whey protein, low fat, low carbs.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Really hard to find one unless you're being a douche.
 I always enjoy this whey protein. Mixes smooth and taste great with Vanilla Almond Milk. I have only tried the double chocolate flavor so far.
 Flavor: The best flavor in 5lb is Rocky Road. I really wish they made the Chocolate Peanut Butter in 5lb, because that one literally tastes like Reese's Peanut Butter.<br/>Quality: The quality of the protein is the "Gold Standard" among protein powders and I wouldn't ever consider purchasing another brand.<br/>Mixability: I never have any problems with clumps when mixing the powder with water. I usually use a shaker bottle so I can't say anything for using just a spoon.<br/>5/5
 Love love love the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor. I have also tried Extreme Milk Chocolate and Rocky Road. Highly Recommended for any body building/weightloss regimen. This is pure GOLD!
 I used this whey before, so I knew it was good, mixes goid in shaker cut, taste good too.
 1. High quality protein, made in the USA and inspected/regulated thoroughly. 24 grams per scoop is great, I take 2 scoops daily but I might up my intake during the next cycle. I like to get my main bulk of protein from the foods I eat.<br/>2. Its delicious. Get the Double rich chocolate flavor and mix two scoops with low fat milk in a blender bottle (any shaker bottle works really), it tastes like chocolate milk or even a milk shake!<br/>3. Drink plenty of water, a lot of people don't realize this, but protein is Nitrogen dense, and hence your liver will be busy processing it. You should drink plenty of water always, but especially when ingesting protein rich foods such as protein shakes.<br/><br/>I just ordered another 5lb tub, my first is coming to an end. I'll keep you guys posted if anything changes. Work hard, get strong.<br/><br/>-Goku
 I have been using ON forever.  I have tried others and this brand has by far the best flavor.  Other than that, it also has less filler and carbs for those looking for the cleanest protein!
 Been using this product for a long time.  Similar products can't beat the price and taste.  Usually get chocolate or strawberry banana.
 This is the best stuff I've tried so far, it's not terribly sweet or thick and it mixes with just about anything! The serving sizes are smaller than most other supplements, but it still has quite a bit of protein (24g), some fat(1g) and few carbs(3g), the serving size is only 30g which leaves room for only 2 grams of filler or stabilizing agent. I'll definately be buying this again.
 I just ordered my 2nd order of this protein. Not only the taste is really good but I finding that my health overall and my body is responding a lot better and last more since is so much in the container. From my muscle tone to loosing unnecessary fat in my body, I just use 1 to 2 scoop daily. The price is absolutely incredible  if you compare what my local gym is charging for it saving over $25.
 Optimum Nutrition is one of the best tasting out there. I will always use their product.
 So glad they offer a 10 pound bag. I hate having to purchase more protein every month. This will last me several months, which is exactly what I wanted. Highly recommended if you can afford the straight up price. Ends up being cheater in the long run and saves you some time purchasing more every month!
 This is the best protein powder I've tried. It taste great, has a great amino acid profile, great macro nutrient profile (almost no carbs or fat but still great tasting). And from what I've heard/read coming from independent laboratory analysis's, it has some of the highest purity of protein concentration compared to other protein powders.<br/><br/>Edit: The cookies in cream flavor is terrible. Stick to the simple flavors - chocolate, vanilla or strawberry
 Waiting for the 10 pound bags to go on sale again for under $90 each! I grabbed 2 of these at that price and it was a steal. The only protein powder and the only flavor I will ever use.
 I've tried many protein powders over the past 15 years and this is the best by far! Not only does it mix better than any other I've tried but it's absolutely delicious! I combine it with almond-coconut milk and frozen fruit to make a great post-workout smoothie! Would 100% recommend to anyone looking for a great tasting, perfectly mixing, and full-on protein packing, post-workout drink!
 Good grade protien, I always enjoyed this makers flavors and quality
 We definitely did not get cookies and cream. It taste like butterscotch. It’s still good though, so we  kept it.
 Love the taste. Most protein powders taste terrible. Not this one. This one is fabulous.
 Bought for my husband and daughter who need to gain weight (me, not so much) They said it tasted good. Much better than the junk that Dale got from the GNC store. Will buy again
 This isn't the best isolate on the market, but it's far from the worst.  It's also relatively cheap comparatively.  I ordered the "Delicious Strawberry" flavor and I really like it.  The flavor is good, and it's not an over-bearing, too sweet flavor which, for me, makes it easier to ingest after a hard workout.<br/><br/>I recommend this stuff to everybody because, as far as price vs quality is concerned, ON Gold standard Whey is a winner.
 The best protein powder in the market , low in carbs , sugar and calories, and has the most protein of any other in one scoop! And the taste is the best!!!
 This tastes awesome! First off, ON Whey protein shakes mix very easily in general. Secondly, I love the quality of ON Whey in general and continue to use their products relative to other companies. Thirdly, if you need a break from the super sweet chocolate or vanilla-esque type of flavors and you love coffee, this is such a great flavor.<br/><br/>Whey is not supposed to get you jacked or lift heavier, it is a convenient food source to hit your protein intake goals for the day. The aspects that I look for in protein shakes are if it mixes easily, if I can enjoy the flavor, and if it simply doesn't mess with my stomach at all throughout the day. This is perfect for me.
 This stuff is great - mixes way easier than other powders I've used, and the chocolate supreme is delicious. I tried mixing it with almond milk, cold brew coffee, and smores tea - all tasted great!
 I just don't like this flavor.  I think the protein itself is quality, but it does not taste like vanilla ice cream.  I'll say, if you add some cinnamon it makes it a little more drinkable.
 Delicious, nutritious. No added gunk. I blend with kale, oatmeal, banana, milk, and ice and has been extremely helpful in keeping up my supply for breastfeeding!
 I have bought two big 5lb bottles of this protein shake: a double chocolate and the cookies n' cream flavors. The double chocolate tasted great, while the cookies n' cream was a big disappointment. Even though the cookies n' cream doesn't taste that great, I can still drink it, but it taste nothing like cookies n' cream.<br/><br/>I only drink this immediately after my workout. I only take one scoop and put it into my cup shaker. I give it a shake and I down it within a minute. I found that taking one scoop, rather than the serving size of two, will make this bottle last a good 4 months. If you don't mind dropping $50 every two months on a protein shake bottle, then take the serving size. If you feel like 25gm of protein right after a work is sufficient for you, then 1 full scoop should work fine.
 Kind of thin and runny.  Doesn't have a lot of taste.  Like other whey products better.
 Got the chocolate mocha. Right when I opened up the container it smelled like coco mix. One of the better tasting protein powers I've tried. Highly recommend.
 Good value.  Tastes great.  I got the french vanilla flavor which mixes well with just about everything.  I like the extra glutamine included.
 Great taste, mixes very easily. Just know it is still a whey protein powder, so doesn't taste exactly like your Starbuck Frappe. If that is what you're expecting you better head for the drive through.
 This is a keeper.  I recently got back into my workout routine and this time I'm incorporating weights into my cardio.  I don't eat a whole lot of protein so my husband mentioned giving this a try.  He's used it for a long time and now I get why.  I mix it with milk and drink it after my workout, so it feels like a reward for all my hard work.  I may try the other flavors later on, but for now I'm sticking with the double chocolate.<br/><br/>Update 4/9/16 - I went through the tub of double chocolate and I really liked it, but after having the same flavor for 3 months I decided to try the coffee flavor.  I did not get a strong coffee taste, but it's still nice.  My husband, who is not a coffee person, had some this morning and we were trying to describe the flavor.  He said "Those Starbucks drinks in the glass bottles that you see at the grocery store" and I think he nailed it.  It's more creamy sweet than coffee.  I'm not complaining at all as it mixes really well with unsweetened vanilla milk!
 Classic protein powder that all my serious gym friends use. This specific one has less sugar, and the flavor is still pretty good. I like to mix mine with a plant milk (only because I'm a bit allergic to dairy milk - but not whey protein).
 First time trying this protein powder and am really happy with the taste and how easily it blends. Will definitely buy again.
 This is great protein powder. I really love the Double Rich Chocolate flavor and have ordered it multiple times. Amazon has a great price.<br/><br/>My only issue is that the 5 lb container is heavy and bulky. Does that mean it's not working?!
 I've been buying ON whey protein for several years now.  I find it has the best combination of price, flavor, and mixability among all whey proteins I have tried.  It's tough to comment on whether or not it "works" as a protein supplement, as it is one of many sources of protein in my diet.<br/><br/>The cake batter flavor is pretty good.  Some reviewers commented that it is indistinguishable from vanilla, but I disagree.
 This stuff is awesome.  Optimum Nutrition is always an amazing product.  I got this because strawberry is one of my favorite tastes regardless and this stuff is good.  It actually doesn't have as strong a strawberry taste as I wanted but I use two scoops post workout and same amount of water I get the taste that I'm looking for.<br/><br/>This is the best bang for you buck.  If you're going to buy protein then get the 10 pound bag because it's going to last you a long time.  Definitely recommend this stuff!
 I've tried a few different protein powders and so far I'm really enjoying the ON Gold Std Whey.  I mix in my own additives, so I'm not concerned about the lack of aminos etc.  I've tried vanilla, banana, chocolate and currently on Rocky Road.  I'd say RR reminds me of a chocolate malt, so if you like that flavor, I'd say it's worth a shot.  I've found most powders clump and while this one does a little, I find it usually works itself out pretty quickly.
 Chose Strawberry flavor. The first protein powder that does not coax a gagging reflex upon consumption. Surprisingly adequate.
 Great taste and blends very well.  Get's a little foamy/bubbly, but better that than chunky.  Little more money than some of the others, but the calorie to protein content is hard to beat.  I'll continue buying this as my go-to protein powder.
 Optimum Nutrition's Gold Standard 100% Whey is a great product for those looking to get/maintain lean muscle. It contains only 1 gram of fat and 2 grams of carbohydrates while packing 24 grams of quality whey protein in just 110 calories per serving. However this product is probably not what you are looking for if you are searching for a product to gain a high amount of muscle mass. ON's Gold Standard along with a healthy diet and adequate exercise will help you to lose more fat while developing more lean muscles than diet &amp; exercise alone. The only thing I would suggest is that you chose a flavor other than strawberry as I have found it to be the least appetizing.
 The taste is impressive. I can easily mix creatine or other "unflavored" powders with this protein and not taste them at all. No digestion issues. Mixes very well in a normal shaker cup. Price is reasonable. I recommend.
 is just okay. You see, I'm lactose intolerant. This product advertises that it contain lactase which is the enzyme I lack to digest lactose. So, I didn't take my lactase pills while consuming this product and I got severe abdominal pains and of course the trots to go along with them. So, this product is deficient at best with its lactase. It tastes well enough, but I won't buy it again.
 In my humble opinion, this protein is the standard by which I measure all other protein supplements. This is the most delicious with the least amount of useless junk you don't need. Mixing with milk is a LOT better than mixing with water, FYI. I usually just do 8 oz of milk and one scoop of this protein in a blender for a few seconds within 30 minutes or so of a workout. Can't beat it!
 This protein is all around great. The taste is great (I use water to mix my protein). It mixes really well without feeling like your shaking a paint can and the price for the amount is fair as well
 Love this whey protein powder, low in sugar, tastes really good using water only! My fav is Doubel Rich Chocolate.
 Let's start by saying I've always been reluctant on writing reviews only because we're all different, we all like different stuff, and what might be great for me it isn't for you. That been said, this protein is by far the best protein I've had. Forget the fact that it taste awesome ( double rich chocolate is the flavor I chose) but just something as simple as blending... If your protein still has lumps after a fair round of shaking you need to consider what you're drinking. This product is really, Really, REALLY high quality. Very satisfied...that's all I can say
 I have tried other proteins, from local stores and from walmart (6 star), but I have had very good results with ON. I have used one 5 lb package and now on my second one. Nothing has changed in my workouts except the protein. I have built muscle and my one rep max has gone up.<br/>I am 55 years old and have been lifting steady for a few years.<br/><br/>I wish I would have had protein supplements when I was younger...I am now trying Casein at bedtime...
 There is no way I could ever choke down another brand of Whey protein drink after switching to Gold Standard. Mixes extremely well, has better content the the competition and tastes good and has a smaller dose than the rest. I would recommend this to anyone who is pushing their physical limits.
 Tastes great. I don't have a Science lab so I can't tell you if the ingredient and information labels are accurate but I am seeing results.
 Longtime user of ON products, and I love their Gold Standard whey.  I've tried several flavors and this one is one of the worst.  Keep in mind that I normally love mint/chocolate flavored things.  It's going to be tough working way through all 5lbs of this.
 Bought this for my son. Great product.  I think it should be cheaper but it seems to be good quality. The flavor is pretty good.
 what can you say? awesome stuff<br/><br/>Update: i ususally by the chocolate flavored one since you can't go wrong with that flavor, but recently bought the Mocha Cappacino. Glad I did. Prob one of the best flavors I've had besides the chocolate. I put ice, banana, almond milk, a lil water and 2 scoops of protein...then I use a blender.  Its soooo good!
 I've been buying ON's products for well over a year now and have been very happy with them.  In fact, when I shop for protein powder, creatine, etc, I first look for something from ON's line.  But something must have changed recently, because while this is the same protein powder I've bought before, this recent shipment is really disappointing.  It tastes bitter, and doesn't mix well at all.  What happened?  Something definitely is off.  I wish I hadn't bought a 10 pound bag of the stuff, it's not going to be pleasant choking this stuff down for the next few months.
 Taste is very good.  Probably the best protein drink I've ever had, smooth, and no after taste. Big size is economical, but after a while, you want a different flavor just to change things up. It would be great if they would include some sample packets of different flavors when you purchased a big jar so you'd have an idea on what you would like to order next.  It's a lot of money to invest on something you're not absolutely sure you're going to like.
 Best whey protien on the market. Have used it for years!
 The ingredients are good.  Not too much sugar/artificial flavor, but still tastes pretty good (doesn't taste as good as BSN Syntha 6, but still acceptable).  I'm not a scientist or a nutritional expert, but I would say from experience that either this protein, or BSN Syntha 6 are solid choices.  I haven't tried it yet, but I just ordered Optimum Nutrition Platinum Hydrowhey.  I got it on sale, otherwise it seems too expensive, but I'll try it and update.
 After my gastric bypass surgery, I've been on a quest to find the best protein shake base.  I always seem to come back to Gold Standard.  I've tried EAS, Syntha 6, Dynatize Elite, Cytosport (Monstermilk and Musclemilk).  None of them taste as good as Gold Standard Double Rich Chocoloate.<br/><br/>Soooo.  I'm done searching.  I'm just going to buy this 10 pound bulk bag and get my protein as cheaply as possible!
 This is the best product I have ever used and I have used a few. The only downside is this caused acne around my face, so I stopped using it. People react differently, so this product doesn't deserve a bad review just because I don't react well to it in terms of breaking out. However, it did helped in the rebuilding process of my muscles.
 great product - especially when dealing with someone who has to maintain a certain weight while being unable to always eat due to illness
 This is the powder I remember. Smaller scoop to get to 25g of protein than the cheaper substitutes available in Wal-mart. Creamier in the blender and a taste I'm familiar with. I've been using whey since the 90's on and off depending on my training volume. My shake is a banana, egg or two, almond milk and this. It's the best. Thanks!
 Tastes good, mixes up easily. Clean taste that's not too sweet. Good with water. Even better with almond or soy milk.
 The ON Gold Standard should not be a standard. It is too sweet and extra sugar makes my stomach cramp. Some people love sweets so maybe it works for them. If you are going to eat a few of scoops a day it may effect your sugar balance etc.<br/>Protein quality is very good on the other hand.<br/><br/>I just ordered different brand on Amazon -  NOW Foods Whey Protein Isolate with no sugar, additives or flavors, just pure protein.
 I have been working out on + off for the past 8 years. I have used 4-5 different powder and liquid protein supplements. I usually have to force myself to drink up the shakes from other powders but not this one. Extreme milk chocolate tastes amazing! Since it tastes great I end up using it as often as possible. Honestly, taste is the most important factor for me, besides the ingredients. I have bought lots of other powder supplements  and eventually I always find myself gagging and forcing myself to drink my shakes and then eventually I quit taking them, which is obviously a waste and Im not getting as much from my work outs.<br/><br/>I have done lots of research on protein brands in the past 2 months and after reading countless reviews and ingredient tables I came to the conclusion that Optimum Nutrition makes a great product. I then researched flavors (since Im very picky) and found lots of people loved extreme milk chocolate.<br/><br/>I have seen the 5 lb container on sale for $43 on amazon, so you are paying a pretty penny for this product but I have to say it's worth it.
 I mean, it's pretty straightforward. I use this because I simply don't get enough protein in my diet and it really does make a difference. I'm not big on chocolate but this ain't too shabby.
 The Rocky Road flavor goes surprisingly well with McD's iced coffee (sugar free vanilla for me).  Plus with the ice already in the cup, it also acts as a 'mixer' for the powder.  A happy accident if I do say so myself.  Oh, and don't try mixing this powder with 'hot' coffee.  I tried and it didn't turn out well. At all.  It clumped and I ended up throwing it out.
 Good taste whether mixed with water or milk and mixes well for a smooth chocolate taste.
 Lower review rating based on flavor.  I was looking for something good for mixing in smoothies and I felt the vanilla ice cream flavor was too strong and creamy.  A couple tablespoons was too overpowering in fruit smoothies for my taste.  Unfortunately there were no other vanilla choices available on Amazon at the time.
 The flavor, it's okay, A nice change from the vanilla, chocolate, strawberry. I don't think anyone would want to try any other flavor than the basics. Maybe cookies and cream but some of them are out there. Cake batter? Why would I need to feel like I'm drinking cake batter? No one in the history of the world ever said "I wish there was a drink that tastes like cake batter". Anyway about the product, Maximum results, stop looking for protein supplements because this is the best out there. Mixes well and tastes great. More BCAAs than leading brands. This supplement has a Complete branch chain Amino acid complex with maximum protein per serving. Low carb/calorie and almost no sugar. Great for building muscle mass.
 BUT ALL THE OTHER PRODUCTS I BROUGHT I GIVE THEM A FIVE STAR.  GREAT WHEY PRODUCT, I WOULD BUY FROM THEM EVERYTIME, GOOD STUFF.
 Before I found Gold Standard Whey I was using cheap brand stuff,and I must say this is 1000 times better! I'll never use anything but Gold Standard Whey from now on!
 I am a fan of the Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Whey! Does the job &amp; the Chocolate Coconut is very tasty! Like any flavor, if you take multiple shakes a day, you may get tired so I suggest always having two different flavors to switch it up.  I am a coconut fan and this did not disappoint!  Highly recommend!
 This is my go-to brand for protein when I order from Amazon. Optimum Nutrition offers a great variety of flavors at a really good price. I'd say my favorite part is the minimal packaging as well. Other products slap a bunch of weird stats everywhere or try to make the product look extreme, which honestly is just tacky and a little sketchy. I just want good tasting protein without all the fluff, and that's what I'm getting here.<br/><br/>I'm reviewing the Delicious Strawberry flavor. This is about the 5th unique flavor I've tried from ON so far, and I have to say it is definitely one of my favorites. I usually mix my protein with unflavored greek yogurt to make my own flavored yogurt. This flavor is the perfect pairing with greek yogurt. The flavor reminds me of Chobani's strawberry greek yogurt, but with less sugar and way more protein. It also tastes great by itself in a shake with milk.<br/><br/>Results wise, I've always made good gains in the gym while taking this protein. It keeps me full throughout the day and night and helps me easily reach my daily protein goals. This is my go-to recommendation for protein in terms of value, taste, and performance.
 I am highly pleased with this protein.  For years I had bought stuff at GNC, but this is just as good (if not better) and you way more for your buck.  The Rocky Road flavor is awesome.  You can smell the chocolate &amp; marshmallow as soon as you open it up.  Tastes great in my post-workout shakes and even in my morning smoothies.
 All around great product. I tried the double rich chocolate flavor first and that flavor was super good. The product itself was simply awesome, no weird side affects or aftertaste and it gave me good results. When I finished that one I wanted to try a new flavor so I went with the chocolate coconut since I'm obsessed with coconut, and that one is even more delicious! I always mix it with coconut water in my shaker and I think it brings out the flavor of it so perfectly. Probably won't ever switch to any other protein brand, and I can't wait to try all the different flavors!
 Arrived at the end of the delivery date range, which is fine. I've been using the product for years, but this is my first time buying from Amazon. Love the convenience, considering the fact that I always manage to live far away from any GNC's or Vitamin Worlds. Love this stuff, but use it responsibly (as directed). Too much of this stuff on a regular basis can harm your liver...as will any supplement.
 Arrived on time and worked as described
 Yes. Perfect. It's delicious and it's worth what you pay for
 This is the first time I've tried the Extreme Milk Chocolate flavor. As dairy products don't normally sit too well with me, I usually mix with water and not milk. The Extreme Milk Chocolate flavor is significantly better when mixed with water than the more popular Double Chocolate. It tastes much richer, but still has the same content of carbs/fat/protein, so this has definitely become my favorite flavor.
 It’s a perfect one for everyday gym goers. 24 gms of protein with great taste in each spoon makes it perfect for daily use. Easily disestable and extracts of whey isolate. Good to have everyday once or twice.
 Due to a medical situation I needed to start using protein powders. I have been through 23 different brands and flavors. I hate the fake chocolate taste that some of them can leave you with. But not this one, it's delicious!!! Even with straight vegetables and no fruit, it is still enjoyable. I highly recommend it.
 Wonderful flavor as always. gets dissolved in cold water without any lumps and has a favor of cold coffee which is refreshing along with providing the essential protein boost.<br/><br/>One suggestion would be, (and this applies to almost all protein powders) is it to have simple technique of temporarily attaching the scoop to the lid, so that we need not keep searching where the lid is hid in
 My friends at work told me about Optimum Nutrition Double-Rich Chocolate when I asked them for their recommendation of the best protein powder. They drink it all the time and told me about this Amazon deal. It is a big bag so you will want to try a smaller container first, just to see if you like it. I tried it and liked it so I got the big bag. This stuff is delicious. I used to mix it with skim milk, then a combo of skim milk and water, now just water and ice. It reminds me of the drink YooHoo but it's good for ya.
 Hate the taste and there is "No Return" policy. Rather use samples first before buying the whole bulk.
 Best whey protein for the cost.<br/><br/>Tastes good, good macro ratio, and I trust the ON brand enough to actually believe the ratio on the label is right.
 This did what it was supposed to and tasted great like it was supposed to! It also lasts forever and were splitting it between 3 people
 Best Protein Suplement ever...<br/><br/>Testing flavors in scale 1 to 10<br/><br/>1. Double Rich Chocolate: 8/10<br/>2. Vainilla Ice Cream: 8/10<br/>3. Extreme Milk Chocolate: 6/10<br/>4. Cookies &amp; Cream: 7/10<br/><br/>i have not tasted the others flavors, but i will test it soon and will update this small review.
 Everything you want in protein. It mixes very well, tastes fantastic (I got the chocolate mint and my roomate got the French Vanilla Creme - yes, he loves his too). Upon eating lots of food, lifting hard, and drinking 2 scoops with whole milk after each work out, I gained around 10lbs in weeks. Seriously, it tastes so dang good I could drink it for that reason alone instead of getting a milkshake from Culvers. Great stuff, select a flavor, do yourself a favor,stop thinking about it, and order it. Enjoy.
 I’ve read the lab results from Thriv protein and was a little disappointed that the ON Gold Standard Whey was a few grams of protein off of their label.  However, they are fortified with added Amino Acids and they were still the best product for the price.  Price per gram of protein and the quality combine to make this product my first choice. Yes, proteins like Thriv are better but I’m just trying to keep in shape and not an athlete that would require the absolute best regardless of cost.  This is the best protein for the price.  The flavors would get 3 1/2 stars as they’re kind of plain but there aren’t many options in this size of container so they get 5 because they’re the best flavors in the industry when buying bulk sizes.
 Flavor: strawberry banana<br/>I had only ever tried chocolate flavors, so buying $57 worth of strawberry banana was a risk.<br/>It was worth it! It's a very fake, candy-like flavor, but I really like it. Tastes the same in water or milk. Go for it if you like this taffy flavor.
 Amazing. Low carb, high protein, great value.  Pricey but you get a ton and it’s high quality.
 Awesome! Muscles are twice as big now and I can lift 20 times more weight and girls love me now!
 Everything i expected and more! Being a college football player i am always looking for the most effective and safe resources to fuel my body. After intense workouts this product is the answer. Not only can i feel the increase in size and strength of my muscles, but others around me are noticing it to! I have building on muscle as well as toning out from the help of this product. An additional factor is the glutamine content which helps with not only with muscle recovery, but decreasing soreness the next day! This product is a must have for athletes, body builders, and anyone else who works out and wants to improve their physique!
 Mom loves this.<br/>I bought this for her twice now!<br/><br/>She is taking it as a supplement to help heal after hip replacement surgery.<br/><br/>She said it tastes like Nestle Quik. :-)
 If you can get past the taste than this is a really great protein supplement. Vanilla is much better for smoothies and everything else.
 Switched over from a different brand that was high in cholesterol and I didn't even realize it. A little more expensive but I have noticed a difference with my weight. Tastes good (the cholesterol laden one tasted better, go figure) and mixes well in a blender bottle if you shake it right away before it clumps
 I purchased this as a meal replacement for breakfast. While it's not terrible, but I had my hopes a little high based on how good the "Nature's Best Zero Carb Isopure" (  ...] ) tasted when mixed with water. I am sure that if I mixed it with milk, it would become "creamier," but for my purposes (calorie reduction), it does the job, but doesn't make it super pleasant.<br/><br/>If you want to mix with water, and don't mind the higher price, the Isopure product is phenomenal. If you want to mix with milk or make shakes, I am sure this will suit your needs while saving you some cash.
 Best whey protein powder that I have found in 10 years.  I've used this for the past few years at this point.  I've tried several, but this is the first that I was happy with.<br/><br/>The flavor is great, it mixes great, the calories per gram of protein is very good for cutting, and it's affordable.<br/><br/>Recommend it to everyone looking for low-cal, great-tasting, protein supplements.
 Here's my opinion on this product- Shipped within 2 days! Thats extremely fast considering I used free standard shipping. It's as described, straight outta the box. For you people claiming that your scooper is missing, look again! I had to dig down into the tub to get it, but it's there alright! Follow me at Allenboyy12 on IG! Also, I bought the Chocolate Malt flavor and it tastes great! I totally recommend this product to anyone looking for a cheap high quality protien powder. Goodjob ON for making such a great protein! My only problem with it is that it doesn't have an expiration date. Hopefully I'll drink it all before it expires, but who knows.
 I've been using Gold Standard for several years now, and have never been disappointed (the mint chocolate is not great with water, though).  I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a lean protein shake.
 Being a bigger guy i go through this stuff real fast... this container lasts me 1 month... and as much as i like chocolate... i needed change. The chocolate coconut scratched that itch ')  It's as good as any "good" protien mix, little sweet but the coconut is a good change for anyone who is getting bored with plain chocolate. I drink protien for the benefits not for the taste, so any perks (flavor enhancements) are just bonus's.  Because lets face it everyone, you aint goina be comparing this to a chocolate malt from the diner down the road haha..
 Love this protein. I just wanted a simple flavor without an aftertaste. This has great macros.
 Cookie and cream taste more like French vanilla cappuccino which I don’t mind
 Great quality protein! This is a quality protein I have used for years. All the flavors I have tried taste great. It mixes very well and there are no clumps. It has a good amount of whey protein along with BCAA's and Glutamine for recovery. This is low in fat and low in carbs. Great protein for after workouts.
 Wash your cup, it smells when left sitting
 Protein powder is gross, let's be for real. Even the best flavors, I'd rather be drinking a milkshake. But if you're looking to add protein into your diet in a drinkable way, this stuff is pretty good. Flavor is about as good as you can get and it's not too gritty.
 some protein powder taste bad but not this one.  It works well.
 I like how it taste I use it with almond milk no complaints
 This is my go-to protein. Good flavor, relatively inexpensive.
 Awesome my husband loves it  I always buy from this seller who is awesome too! Thanks
 I ordered trial size of Vanilla Ice Cream, my first time trying product.  I am very impressed with the taste, and that it has the AMINOS that I require my shakes to have.  I noticed there appears to be no fiber, also, it clumps (probably from the xantham gum) so I used my magic bullet to blend--no big deal .  I used skim milk and ice.<br/>  5 stars because it tastes GREAT!  Thick and creamy and smooth (not gritty).  I used my berry flavored greens powder to get a nice flavor. And may use strawberries next time.  Understand that the vanilla is a great flavor.  I will definitely purchasing the chocolate flavor in hopes that it will be just as delicious!<br/>  My ONLY complaint is that the trial offer and 3 lb offer is limited to only 1 or 2 flavors, and there are no sample packs.  I'd rather try a small bag of Chocolate Coconut before I purchase the 5 lb bag. :-(<br/>  Not sure if this was original or newer product.
 Bought this for my boyfriend, the strawberry banana one, and I ended up using it just as much as he does. So good. He uses it to gain and I just use to tone, does well(:
 Delicious and only somewhat clumpy when mixed with milk.  No complaints.
 Best price and highly rated. I searched and reviewed a lot of products before I settled on this. Vanilla is good, but strawberry is my favorite. I am stationed in Afghanistan, and this (and most of my Amazon products) come to me within 10 days. Considering packages from home take up to three weeks, this is revolutionary service!
 Product is high quality, fair price, and mixes well. This is my favorite protein powder, and I have tried many over the years.
 First, let me start off by saying this is a great product. I've been weightlifting for 5+ years and this has been my go-to protein for a few years now.<br/><br/>I love that it's mostly whey isolate, which means it's easy on the stomach. It has lots of good flavors, the double rich chocolate, vanilla ice cream, and strawberry banana are all great. The product mixes well which is a definite plus. It has a great macro breakdown (high protein, low carbs/fat), and it's a great price for the quality (ON is owned by Glanbia so they have access to a ton of high quality whey, unlike some of the other lower priced whey proteins out there).<br/><br/>My only complaint is that sometimes it upsets my stomach. So just a minor complaint, an easy work-around is that I started using a naturally sweetened 100% whey isolate product for my post-workout shakes. I either make a shake with blueberries, milk and peanut butter or I mix it with just milk or with just water.<br/><br/>Overall this is a fantastic product and deserves all 5 stars. Hope this helps!
 Double Rich Chocolate i will buy again --- i hated the cookies and cream from any brand not just ON
 I've been using ON for a while now with no issues, but I recently purchased a 5lb tub of the Vanilla Ice Cream and it tastes awful. In fact, I'm wondering if the milk I use went bad or something. It's really bad. I just finished up a 5 lb tub of Cookies and Cream and it was tasty. Honestly, if I get home and find out my milk didn't go bad (highly unlikely since I drink about 2 gallons a week), I'm tossing this junk in the garbage.
 We got the Mocha Cappucino flavor and love it.  Whole family with very active kids loves this drink.  We mix it with almond milk (about half of the calories as whole milk) and it is a very nice drink after practice or a workout.
 Have had Vanilla Ice Cream now and Double Rich Chocolate. I'd probably go back to the chocolate but this is very good, too. Looking forward to trying others. Goes well with milk or in my protein shakes I make. Don't mind that it doesn't stir in completely/easily (I don't use a shaker ball) because it tastes really good even when you can taste the powder.
 I love my Rocky Road, I used to buy this locally but now order it online... Awesome taste.. and masks the tastes of some rather unpleasant powders that I mix in my shake... good stuff...
 We love drinking our whey protein , we drink this after working out . fast shipping and item as describe.
 I've purchased over a dozen of these 10lb bags. The taste is by far the BEST of every protein powder I've ever had. The product also works great. I went on a mass gain cycle and put on 20lbs in 12 weeks drinking 3 of these shakes a day with skim milk. I put this in my oatmeal every morning with skim milk and peanut butter and it tastes like a peanut butter cup.<br/>Definitely Recommended.
 Excellent source of whey protein. Mixes better than any other when protein that I've tried. The taste isn't very sweet, but it's not bitter or bland. I personally don't prefer overly-sweet drinks as it is. There's a nice balance to it; I never get tired of the same flavor before the container is empty.
 I would give 5 stars but I will probably try another brand without Sucralose to see if this uncomfortably full feeling goes away. I like the strawberry better than the chocolate.
 Seriously delicious and high quality.  Yes, I do worry about the chemical sweetener, but man this stuff is good with milk.
 I switched from premixed EAS shakes to this. I was looking for something that:<br/><br/>1. Didn't taste bad.<br/>2. Reduced the cost per serving.<br/>3. Was a neutral flavor, so I could play with different recipes.<br/><br/>This accomplished all of that.<br/><br/>It is part of my workout schedule, but I don't know anything about how much it helps with muscle building verse another protein. I just know that it taste pretty good when mixed with almond milk, fruits, and/or peanut butter.
 I've used the product many times in the 5 lb. size and had good results. Recent order was for 10 lbs.  (supposedly) 10 1 lb. bags (easier to store and use). Was sent 1 ten lb. aluminum foil bag, which is difficult to open and to reseal. The biggest disappointment was the product is not the same. See other posts. It's not as chocolate tasting and has a lighter color, is fluffy and harder to pour. Don't buy this product.
 I thought that protein powder cannot be delicious until I had this one. Still, you need to use cold water first and then use hot water to heat it up to taste its true flavor.
 Have used this product for the past two years and have not found a better product on the market that tastes as good and provides the high protein count and low calorie count.  I use this product every morning pre workout and change to the Chocolate Malt flavor for my post workout.  The powder breaks down easily from a hand shaker in water to my ultimate smoothie in my vitamin.  OUTSTANDING product, highly recommended!!!
 I tried this brand due to their great reputation as a quality whey protein.  It also is a good value where price per serving is concerned.  I'm the type who would buy a chocolate malt over a chocolate shake (If I was on a free day :) so I like this flavor too.  I've also purchased the Rocky Road flavor based upon another reviewer's recommendation, however I find this one superior in taste.
 yummmmmmmmmmo for the Mocha Cappuccino! It is so delicious! I usually have 2 scoops after my workout and its a treat. I mainly drink this drink after I work out. It was helped with shakiness and I have seen a lot of muscle definition. It is literrely the first protein drink I have bought and it will be the last. I am going to order my next bottle soon.
 Tastes good, very good calorie/protein ratio. A lot of whey proteins are just so loaded with unnecessary calories, this one is 78% pure protein. It's 24g protein per 120 calories, try and find another like it. More protein for you money, less fillers and the price isn't bad either. I'll buy again, probably will try other flavors since it really is a huge container, takes a while to finish it all, and by then you're ready for another flavor.<br/><br/>But that's just a personal preference as the taste goes. Like the taste of a fresh plump white guy, nothing beats it. That white meat is the best, all zombies rave about it. I tried a latino once, and I didn't like it. Couldn't even finish the forearm, had to waddle away. ;)
 One of my favorites.  Mixes well and has good flavor
 Tastes decent, and an industry standard. My only gripe is that it uses sucralose as a sweetener, but that's a personal preference.
 Tastes great and provides adequate protien, though I wouldnt take any to cut weight.. eggs work just fine.
 Best tasting, easiest mixing protein powder I've ever tasted. I used to be cheap and buy the stuff at Walmart but honestly? This might be more expensive but if you're serious about eating this everyday, get this and thank me later. Rocky Road all the way.
 Mixes rapidly with milk. Mix is thinner than my former whey. I don't like the chocolate taste as well as my former. Overall it is OK.
 I've been taking the whey protein from muscle milk from costco before I bought this product. I know alot of people use it and it has good reviews so I decided to give it a shot. Taste wise it doesn't taste bad but its a little on the bland side. If I mix one scoop with 8 oz of water it tastes pretty watery. Which isn't bad, I kind of like it (reminds me of nesquick), but the taste isn't strong. It mixes very well though. Definitely seems like a quality protein powder.
 I got this product to supplement my recovery while running. Overall I liked how it supported my recovery, but the taste seemed almost  diluted. So if you do not want a strong flavor then i'd recommend this product.
 I switched over to this when I gave up on GNC. To get a good (?) price you always have to buy their Gold Card<br/>and then watch for a "sale." - Otherwise the price is still too high. And the price kept going up.<br/><br/>This here is just as good and I don't have to wait for a "sale" to get a better price.
 Been using it for a while, i have no digestion problems or symptoms as sugested by other users. The taste is nice and it is well dissolved- no shaker is needed.
 Always have approved of this whey protein. It is a relatively clean and low fat, low carb high protein supplement which is ideal for my goals. I love their chocolate or similar flavors, though I had their Vanilla Ice Cream, that was horrible. other then that, good flavors for the most part, good quality, served it's purpose.
 quick delivery, blends well and tastes good.
 If you are a fitness junkie who takes whey protein, I have this as my "to do" drink after every resistance training workout. Amazon has the best prices either themselves (via Prime) or through one of their merchant sellers. I will continue to order this product as it works and the price is great. I tend to order the largest size possible as I can't find them (4-5 pounds) at my local Vitamin Shoppe.
 I thought it tasted great and worked well. I actually found out I was allergic to something in it so I stopped using it and gave it to a friend. They absolutely love it<br/>As to my allergic reaction, my throat would swell and I would have uncomfortable lumps in the back of my throat. If I didn't have these symptoms I would have definitely continued using this product
 I have been buying protein powder for a couple years now and have come to like Chocolate as my favorite. I happened to have a large amount of credit to amazon so I decided to try ordering it online instead of buying it in the store. I don't know what happened, but this stuff does not taste the same, it tastes really gross actually. I've tried it with milk (which is what I normally drink it with), water, and coconut milk and every time, it still tastes gross so I know the liquid isn't the problem. Would not recommend buying it from this buyer.
 My nutritionist recommended this brand and its great! Low carb higher protein! I haven't tried them with water I always use Fat Free milk. The cookies-n-cream satisfies my sweet tooth. And if you use a shaker bottle and it gets frothy is the best! I also mix 1/4 scoop with those yogurt smoothies as an afternoon snack. I also have had no digestion problems with this protein like others I have tried. Double chocolate is good. The Chocolate mint was good but you get tired of it quick if you get the 5lb but we switch from the two for variety.
 I've tried almost every major protein product on the market and this is the best by miles.  Easy to mix and pleasant to drink (Some flavors even with water) you can a ton of value for your dollar. When you mix most protein powders you get clumpy parts but this dissolves pretty easily and makes taking your shake simple and enjoyable.<br/><br/>5/5 Stars for me and a perfect product to take before/after you workout or as a quick snack.
 Love this stuff! The Vanilla Ice Cream flavor adds a nice flavor to your shake. I blend it with almond milk, peanut butter, and frozen fruit. The shake ALWAYS comes out great!
 I only have this four stars because, while it's extremely tasty and does speed my recover after runs, it tastes way creamier if you use milk instead of water.  I was hoping I could achieve that same taste with just water, but to no avail.  Still, this is one of the best chocolate whey protein powders I've tried.
 This is the powder I stick with.  I've had both double rich chocolate and banana cream.  Both are good but I usually get banana cream to mix with smoothies and drink plain.  Chocolate is not overly sweet, and banana has a natural flavor.  Both flavors taste fantastic mixed with milk, but are also just fine mixed with water which is how I normally drink them.  All I need is a scoop put into a shaker bottle.  Definitely recommended.
 Fist protein powder I tried and I will buy again. The flavor it pretty good, too.
 The only protein we buy, mixes nicely. Good flavors, and no aftertaste.
 Great value.  In terms of protein per scoop, calories, taste, and price....this is some solid protein.  120 calories and 24 grams per scoop are some great numbers.<br/><br/>However, I won't be buying it again.  I recently took a blood test and found my cholesterol to be high.  After re-evaluating my diet, I found this particular protein to be sitting at 13% (40mg) of my recommended daily intake.  With four scoops a day, I was hitting over half of what I needed.
 Bought this many time, works good for me.
 tastes real good. Use it with milk and it is a good supplement for your post workout.
 Great deal for a great product. I've been using Gold Standard ever since I started working out and I love it. It's somewhat expensive if you look anywhere else, but Amazon has an amazing deal on it. Buy your Gold Standard here!!!
 Way to thin of a protein drink. Flavor is okay at best.
 The chocolate powder tastes wonderful! I always make sure to put 2 scoops of this into my blender bottle, mix it with milk, and drink it after every workout! I love this product.
 I use this protein after workouts. Seems to help me.
 For the price this is an awesome protein. Fast absorbing and full of amino acids. The only reason I give this product 4 stars is that it does not taste as good as my last protein (wheybolic extreme by gnc). I had the vanilla and it tasted really good. The second reason is it does not mix very well in a blender cup and is clumpy. Other than that this will help you grow raw muscle and is one of the best deals out there. Cheaper and many more servings than most proteins. All in all a great product, just a few minor things that could be better. Would highly recommend to all trying to grow muscle.
 Use to be the best protein by far. They changed the formula to having more artificial sweeteners and fewer servings per can, and now it is not nearly as good as it was. It is still one of the best deals considering decent taste and protein amount per serving.
 I have been buying this brand of protein for 15 years and still feel that it is the best bang for your buck. The price on it has gone up significantly over the past 10 years. I used to be able to buy a 10lb. bag for around $76.00 and last time it was at $104.99. But this still is the best tasting out of any protein powder I have tried (I get the Double Chocolate)
 Not much to say other than the fact this is a quality protein at an excellent price. Purchased on Amazon for 53 bucks, when I went to GNC to check the price of the exact same product it was 99.99. I couldn't believe it. In regards to the product though, it dissolves very well. I usually use a shaker cup with a blender ball in it and it has done a fine job mixing it. I mix the protein with skim milk usually and I personally love the taste. Over the month or so that I have been using the protein I have experienced gains in strength in the gym. Definitely will be buying this product again.
 This is with out a doubt absolutely the best Mocha taste!  I mix mine in cold brew black coffee and use coffee ice cubes... been using it for over 10 yrs.  Wish they did have more vitamins and mineral (ie 100% of all the daily requirement) but love that it is low carb and low sugar!
 This is some of the best protein on the market in my opinion. And at the price they sell it for on here its great not to mention free 2 days shipping. Way cheaper than GNC. Only other protein that compares to this is MTS at tigerfitness.com. But Amazon is the best place to buy this product never had any problems with shipping and even if you do amazon has some of the best customer service.
 But I can use the smaller bottle next time
 I love the taste &amp; creamy texture.  I mix it with either milk or coconut milk.  Unfortunately I get headaches with drinking it everyday because of the artificial sweeteners, so I only drink it twice per week. I will probably switch to a different product since my body does not seem to like it.  I would love to get this product with stevia as the sweetener!
 This stuff tastes fantastic — especially with milk — and I've seen moderate gains from it. Great as a meal replacement.
 I like the cake batter flavor.  It tastes very similar to vanilla creme to me.  All in all not too bad.
 Finally found a brand i like. Great taste, works well for post workouts. The only brand I'll ever buy again.
 Mocha Cappuccino is amazing.  If you like chocolate flavor you need to try this.  It's a great spin on the chocolate flavor.  I put it in my oatmeal with peanut butter -- amazing.  I put it in my coffee -- fantastic.  Bear Grylls could put this in his piss and I would drink it.<br/>BUT<br/>Cookies and cream tastes like ass
 I like the flavor.<br/><br/>Probably a little overpriced, but the protein profile isnt stacked with garbage.
 I am a 25 year old Male who works a desk job trying to get into shape.<br/><br/>After going through a variety of different proteins powders and doing research, i was turned onto ON and its product line and will not buy another brand ever again. The Banana Cream flavor is a bit strong taste wise, but mixing it with OJ is amazing and I can drink this daily without a chalkie after taste.<br/><br/>Highly recommended!
 Not the worst protein powder but still tastes a bit too chemically for my preference.
 Great product! Cheaper than buying it online off other websites and taste is really on point. Add it with some milk and it tastes just like chocolate milk (basically is chocolate milk). If you're just starting to work out, this is a great protein powder to start on :) .
 This is my second favorite brand of protein.  But definitely the best priced!  The first order just disappeared, but when we notified Optimum Protein of the problem, they had a replacement order here in 2 days, along with a little bonus apology gift!
 had cookies and creme before this, hated it. Took me 2 years to get through a 5 pound tub of that flavor.<br/><br/>Extreme Milk Chocolate basically tastes like nesquick (all the online reviews were accurate), and it's the first time I've been consistently motivated to take protein consistently because I enjoy it now!
 Pretty tasty, not gritty, only slightly foamy. Just add one scoop, eight ounces water/ice, and blend.
 This stuff is the bee's knees. Mixes super well with milk (or water, but love yourself and do milk) and tastes great. Nice for those days where I just don't quite get enough protein.
 I was taking Pro Complex by ON, but the price of that was just too much. I decided to try these instead and love it. Not only is it affordable, but it tastes really good. I usually mix it with fat free milk and it pretty much tastes like a chocolate shake with a hint of the protein taste. Although this has less protein per serving compared to Pro Complex, it will benefit most people who use it in their diet and workout routine.
 I ordered the Mocha Cappuccino flavor and couldn't have been happier. It works great when blended with milk or water although I prefer milk with this flavor. Its like having my fav drink plus the added protein benefits after an intense workout.
 Perfect for persons that want superior protein!
 Mixes really well, tasty, smells great, works great.<br/><br/>I recommend a little milk, mostly water, and maybe a bit of chocolate milk for taste and for extra taste/bulking maybe melt some peanut butter in the microwave and add it, I also suggest using a blender bottle. Can't beat it. The name speaks for itself: Gold Standard
 I've been a long time fan of optimum nutrition but this bag was really watery and flavorless. I bought the doubled rich chocolate. Ironic, right?
 If you're looking for a protein powder that doesn't taste like mud and make you want to spew, look no further.  I have been a bodybuilder/athlete for 25 years, and I have had the misfortune of tasting every kind of torturous concoction these manufacturers have dreamed up.  They will tell you 'New and Improved Taste' on the can, but it all tasted like poo.  Most wouldn't mix well either, and you'd have to shake the bottle until your arms hurt.  However, I tried the Optimum Nutrition Extreme Chocolate about three years ago and I've never thought of trying another brand since.  This tastes like regular chocolate milk to me (when mixed with milk).  And there is the added bonus of being relatively low in calories.  It mixes well too, which means you don't have to gag and hack on a clump of mud that inevitably sticks to the bottom of the mixing bottle no matter how long you shake it.  I've experimented with some of ON's other flavors, and they're OK, but I keep returning to this one because it just tastes so good.  I really can't recommend this stuff enough!
 This is by far the best Protein out there! Also some of the purest! the taste is amazing even thought that's not their main focus! the protein to carb ratio is amazing! also for the price you get a lot more serving than you do with other companies! Ive had the chocolate, vanilla, cake batter, banana, french vanilla! and they are all pretty good! I loved the cake batter, but the chocolate I could make really good shakes out of it! I also seen a lot more gains when adding this to my daily workout/cardio! Like it says on the tub you must consume you body weight/more in protein threw quality proteins spread out threw the day to gain maximum gains ha! I would definitely buy this/recommend it!
 I really don't like the taste. Tastes like artificial milk powder from hell. Won't be buying again.
 I bought the Chocolate Coconut mix and I make it with fat free milk and it tastes SOOOO delicious!  It's like a treat!  It's a great motivation to get me to work out!  I only drink it when I work out, so I have to work out to drink it!  It seems to work, I have lost weight and have gained muscle.  Maybe it's because I work out 3 days a week, or maybe it's because of the drink, or maybe it's because of both!
 A very nice flavor, there is sucralose in this item, but it tastes much better than Stevia. You can water it down for a thin chocolate milk taste or use less fluid and have a thicker shake
 she is looking to forward to use it
 Love this product and flavor.  Good protein with a nice taste.  Mix this with dark chocolate almond milk, a little peanut butter powder and a couple frozen strawberries.  Yum!  Excellent quality product and best price on it I had seen anywhere.  Fast delivery.
 Tastes good, but hard to dissolve in milk unless you heat it up. It would save time if I didn't have to stir so much too...
 I have been using this protein for years and though i dont like the price changes they have done I have found its still the best for the money
 This has been my favorite protein powder for years and years. I add a few teaspoons of soluble fiber and my creatine. Whole milk, almond milk, coconut milk. Personally don't care for water only but maybe I could get used to it. I use a Bamix blender and mix it right in the glass I drink it in for less cleanup. I remember when I could get this for around $30, but such is life. I wish they would switch to Splenda sweetener.
 Wow, just opened my first container and it really smells good, mixed it with bottled water out of the fridge, it mixed well and tasted like a thin milkshake, next time i will try milk, i will have no problem continuing this, very happy so far
 I dont know it felt like that quality of the powder was rather thin and more refined compared to when i purchased it last time from GNC. from GNC it used to be a thick texture with milk. Well I have gotten used to it now, may be it was just a not so perfect batch in production. I dont doubt Amazon for quality.
 This is going to be as straightforward as possible. Is it whey protein? Yes. Does it taste good? Well, I can't speak for any of Gold Standard's other favors but french vanilla créme sure tastes good to me. For a protein supplement, this brand gets five stars from me.
 The scoops aren't very big, but they have a lot of protein per serving. Previous shakes have been extremely filling. This one has the same amount of nutrients and you don't feel bursting full after drinking one. Mint and chocolate tastes much better than plain chocolate.
 Product ingredients have not changed for mine. No artificial sweeteners added. I have used ON product for about 6 months now and have worked well so far.
 One of the better proteins that I have have tried. Taste is pretty good, the mixture is sometimes slightly on the thicker/foam my side as far as texture goes. But overall I would recommend.
 Love this protein! Will be buying more
 So I've tried many other brands of protein powder but I've never tried a cake batter flavor. I would say that the powder definitely taste it like cake batter. I've never been much of a chocolate guy so I like to try the other flavors. This powder does mix very well although it does come out to making a thin Shake. But I believe but that's how it's supposed to be considering the calorie count. It's not as thick as Muscle Milk but it's half the calories so everything's a trade-off I guess. I would describe the flavor is good but I'm still looking for my ultimate favorite flavor.
 This is probably the best tasting protein powder I have used. I have only tried one flavor, double rich chocolate, and don't think I'll be switching to another any time soon, since this tastes exactly like chocolate milk! I use 1 scoop of this + 16oz of whole milk after working out. If you prefer sweeter, you can mix it with 8oz of milk. Either way, delicious. It also doesn't feel very filling. Although you won't be too hungry right after drinking this, you can still eat plenty. And you will get very hungry around 2 hours later.
 This is a five star elite protein, with 5.5g of BCAAs, an 4g. Of glutamine,  with an amazing taste.
 Works great in developing more muscle and strength. I prefer cookies and cream flavor, which is pretty good. Well worth the price!
 Seller delivered just as promised. Thanks to the additional supplement, I'm allowed to increase my intensity of marathon training due to protein shake. Recommend using organic, whole milk for creamy taste!
 This by far the best tasting chocolate protien powder I have tried.  It is not "artificial" tasting or cloyingly sweet.  I make my wife a shake each morning with bananas or strawberries and she loves it.  We tried a few other barnds and they just tasted aweful.  This mixes well too, no clumps.  And if you use Almond milk it does not foam up at all, even in a high speed ninja blender.
 I love this stuff and have been using it for years. Last batch I had was the vanilla ice cream which was terrible. Probably the worst flavor they make. I ordered some Rocky Road and I love it! It taste amazing. The Banana cream is very good as well. It dissolves well in water and taste even better in milk.
 This is the best chocolate flavor protein I've ever had, and I've tried a lot of different brands over the years.  The quality is good, the taste is great. I end every night with one of these shakes - I get to feed my sweet tooth and my muscles at the same time, boom.<br/><br/>1 scoop chocolate whey<br/>1 half banana, frozen<br/>6 ice cubes<br/>1 cup of almond milk<br/>1 serving of Peanut Butter<br/>1 tablespoon of cocoa powder (if you don't have the double chocolate flavor protein which sells out a lot : (
 I first ordered the 2 pound size to try out. My husband and I liked it so much, I ordered 5 pounds. Our favorite recipe for 2 people is: 2 cups milk, 1 frozen banana (sliced), 1 tbsp. ground chia seeds, 1 tbsp. ground flax seeds, 2 scoops vanilla ice cream protein powder ( our favorite) combined in a food processer. This is so delicious and refreshing and my husband says it gives him added energy.
 I have tried most protein powders available and Optimum Nutrition has always been the bast tasting and it has great texture when mixed with water. My wife and I have seen great gains with this protein. I no longer buy on Amazon though because Costco sells it for a little cheaper and goes on coupon a couple times a year, so we stock up on it at those times.
 Double rich chocolate is not my favorite flavor, but it mixes well and is a good value at the price.
 My previous favorite flavor was Extreme Milk Chocolate- this is now my number one!  It tastes very similar to a Starbucks Frappuccino Mocha and with a much better macro profile.  I would buy this again without hesitation.
 I have been using ON's Whey for at least 10 years. This was the first time I've tried Cookies and Cream, and I must say it is DELICIOUS. This is a great hunger-killer and helps you fill those moments where you need protein fast and don't have time to cook.  I only mix mine with whole milk and the pair were a match made in heaven.... AKA Optimum Nutrition's lab.
 I have ulcer and sensitive stomach issues. This is the only protein powder I can drink without my stomach killing me afterwards. Also has a good taste (double chocolate). It's a staple in our house. Also love that it is low carb.
 Important to use this as a SUPPLEMENT. Won't flat replace your protein sources, but it taste great in water or milk, container is durable, comes with a little scoop. I've noticed increases in strength gains. I do recommend this!
 It tastes really good and mixes well with my Bullet.
 My son bought a small quantity of this to trial and really liked it. It actually smells like it would taste okay- not chemically at all. The value for quantity of this is a plus.
 We are repeat buyers of Optimum Nutrition whey powder.  It is a low fat product. The whey is easily digested and at 24 grams of protein, that aspect alone is highly appreciated.  The cookies and cream and the chocolate are favorites.
 I use it in a banana berries smoothie recipe. It blends well and does not give any peculiar taste of its own, so I get the protein and taste of my smoothie remains intact. I feel refreshed after having it. I have it daily after coming back from gym and it definitely energizes me.
 It's been around for a long time and theres a ton of reviews for it, and it's basically the standard.  Comes in a bunch of flavors, ive tried the strawberry, caramel toffee fudge, and the cookies and cream.  They're all good.  Mix with a little bit of cold water in a shaker and chug it after your workout.  (and throughout the day, if you're looking for some easy protein).<br/><br/>I like it, good stuff.
 This is a must have for my athletic son. He loves the taste and it is really helping him put on some much needed muscle weight.
 Great stuff. low calorie protein for workouts and end of day refresh. Great taste.
 I liked the amount for the price, but I did not like the taste.  I added cocoa that helped but I detected an after taste that was not to my liking.
 I absolutely love this protein.  It is low in carbs and high on protein and tastes really great!  I have tried several flavors but always come back to the Double Rich Chocolate.  I usually add two Truvia packets to it.  I like it sweet, but it is fine without it.  I also drink mine with low calore almond milk.  But it is FANTASTIC with regular milk.
 The best protein supplement.
 Lives up to it's name. Solid product and has delivered results for me.  Wish the cost was less but cheaper brands have fillers that trick protein counting machines.  ON does not do this.  Do a web search and you will see a certain other popular company is currently being sued for throwing in junk cheap aminos to save money.
 This product worked well that I bought another one but larger. The taste is amazing and I recommend mixing it with milk. It tastes great and has helped me gain me mass and muscle.
 Its Optimum Nutrition....<br/>Whatever flavor or product you buy from them is going to work well compared to other products.<br/>However the reason im giving this one a 3 star is because the mocha cap. doesnt mix very well.<br/>regardless of how hard i shake theres always clumps left over which usually doesnt happen with ON products<br/>Kinda disapointed but i know that its probably just this one because ive been taking ON whey for a couple years now
 Good stuff! This mixes very easy into any liquid you choose, the taste is good as well is the product.
 I have a problem with getting enough protein.  When I drink this daily, I get good test results
 I was told about this from my daughter and son in law. They use many different types of protein powder but I am new to using it. They knew it was something I would love. The other powders I have tasted have a metallic and vitamin taste to them. This one is delicious. My husband and I use it almost every day, in fruit or just milk, and it always tastes great!
 I've tried a lot of different brand of protein and I think this one is the best. It mixes well and easily, no clumping. It tastes good, one of the best tasting whey proteins out there with both water and milk. Price, mixing ability, taste, and amount of protein is all that really matters to me. So in my book, 5 stars
 I am revising my previous comment after having a chance to really try it. I don't like it. It has a phony artificial taste and I am sorry I bought the 5 pound size. I thought I was saving money but because I don't like it I really didn't save anything.
 Great taste for an after workout mix.
 Great taste and good product if you are lactose intolerant watch out. Giving 4 stars instead of 5 for twisted sneaky advertising. Not 100% protein isolate. This is 80% non-isolate. 20% isolate from what I gather online.
 Strawberry banana tastes a bit chemically.<br/><br/>I had previously given this product a worse review because it is very thin mixed with water.  However, I didn't realize that all whey proteins are like that because that's what whey is.  The protein I had used previously was a mix of types that included casein.
 Very nice taste and low in sugar. Very pleased. I make two shakes a day to support my protein intake.
 They taste great and don't mess with my stomach. It's the Gold Standard for a reason. :)
 Product as described. Delivery was on time.
 I don't understand the hype around this protein.  I prepared this protein shake like I have with other brands but there were huge clumps--it was like mixing oil and water.  Won't purchase again.
 Title says it all:<br/><br/>"Great taste, reasonable price, quality ingredients"<br/><br/>I've used many other whey powders, and I think this one may be tops on my list as far as all around whey goes.  Hydrolyzed whey isolate is quicker digesting (perfect post-workout) but the price is through the roof, so I use it sparingly.  Besides post-workout and bed-time, I use this whey throughout the day when I need a good quick quality shot of protein and aminos.
 This shake blends better than any other. It tastes great and it does work.
 I'm not a workout junky, but this powder works great when I do hit the gym. With no additives like creatine or caffeine, this powder allows you to control exactly what goes into your body. The taste isn't as magical as some people describe it. However, it still tastes good.
 This is the first time I've tried this protein. It mixes very well and the taste is an 8/10 in my opinion. I normally buy Beverly UMP. By comparison this mixes better and is better bang for your buck, but nothing tastes as good as UMP.
 great protein.  I add it to my pro gainer mix.
 Strong, authentic coconut flavor. I needed a break from the chocolate/mint whey, and I'll probably stick with this flavor for another few orders.
 Take after workouts. It's a pretty heavy protein and would take an isolate before working out. In other words I think it works best as a post-workout supplement.
 Purchased 1 pound of delicious strawberry and it is indeed very delicous. Mixing this with milk tasted similar to nesquik but has a bit of after-taste. Overall the taste helped me get it down faster and that is exactly what i need.
 By itself (and with water only, ice cold), the mocha/coffee flavor is very weak. After adding instant coffee powder (Nescafe Taster's Choice House Blend), it becomes so delicious that I would drink it even if not for the nutritional value. It mixes okay in cold water, with a spoon. It comes with a scoop inside, but I had to fish it out with a long spoon. The cost per gram of protein is similar to cheap meat from a supermarket.
 The tip is your only part.
 Didn't like the chocolate flavor much but I'd be open to trying the other flavors
 So far I've tried 2 different flavors double rich chocolate  and extreme milk chocolate  to my palette the double rich tasted much much better but both are drinkable I just won't be buying another extreme milk again.
 Worth the price if you have the money for it other than that there are better alternative
 I have been using ON for a while now but the most recent bag I bought tastes nothing like it should. The product was not eexpired and it was stored in cool/dry place.
 I just got this so I can’t say whether or not it works yet but it is by far the best tasting protein powder I have ever had.
 I enjoy Optimum Nutrition products, but I think I'll need to pass on Chocolate Coconut. I enjoyed this flavor the first 10 or so times I drank it. After a while though, it gets pretty gross and you get over the novelty. Extreme Milk Chocolate is definitely the best whey protein flavor, and it's also the most simple tasting -- which is the best way to go in my opinion! I still have about a 1/2 tub of this stuff, so I'll chug it down for now! Will be opting for Milk Chocolate the next go-around.
 Double rich chocolate is so good I'm afraid to try any other flavors!  I especially love this protein powder since it's much lower carb than many others.
 Quality whey with good flavor.
 Sorry but I didn’t like the flavor.
 Tried and true. Love the consistency of Gold Standard Whey. Such a variety of flavors, bound to find one you like. I'm a coconut chocolate fan, but like to mix it up with Extreme milk chocolate. I just blend a scoop with 5 oz water, shot of protein immediately post workout.
 I recieved an email from Amazon saying sorry I was disatisfied but it was too late for me to return.  I do not know why because I have not reported disatisfaction with this product.  I am satisfied have bought twice will buy again.  The reason for four stars instead of five ... I wish the flavor was more intense, I wish it tasted as good as it smells.
 I have been lifting weights and using protein powder for 15 years.  This by far is the best protein powder I have ever used!!!!
 Good nutritional profile, ok price, good taste, mixes well other than in hot beverages. I've been buying this for years and though I have found a few other brands that are a bit cheaper I haven't found others with as good nutritional profile for the price.
 5 Pounds of chocolatey goodness! This is a huge tub that serves the purpose if your looking for a good protein powder that does the work! It works good for me with some almond milk, ice, and a blender. I mean if your considering buying this, it's because you want a big tub of powder and I gotta say look no further.
 Perfect price for this product
 This protein powder immerses very easily. It is very high quality protein and has a excellent taste
 Best stuff on the market. Very easy to mix and always tastes really great with anything ou mix it with.
 Great tasting whey from a good company. The Whey is of very good quality (mostly Isolate blended with concentrate) for a very good price, compared with other crap you may find that packs more concentrate and taste too sweet (ehm, cytosport) or blends with soy! Can't go wrong with this one even at regular price, which is why it's considered the #1 Whey protein in the market today.
 I mean.... it's Gold Standard protein. Always pricey. Always good.
 This is real tasty.  Not as tasty *maybe* as muscle milk, but has a lot more protein bang per calorie that whatever taste loss there is, I'm more than happy to put up with.  And really, I have both this and muscle milk around still, and I usually opt for the ON.  I think that's saying a lot.
 I ordered this in the mocha cappuccino flavor and it is ANAZING! I always look forward to my post - workout protein shake but this just makes it even better! I've tried a few of the flavors and so far this is my favorite. Mixes well with water or milk (I use almond milk). Does not upset my tummy in any way. Love it!
 Work great as my breakfast shake. No issues that I can think off.
 Good protein, the taste isn't the best but definitely not the worse. The grams/serving are great. I'm not sure if it's the milk products in there or what but I noticed it makes me more gassy than other proteins I've taken. Let's face it though, if you have been taking protein and are on a high fiber diet this is to be expected. I usually bought Syntha-6 which is by far the best tasting and in my opinion "fart free" protein out there without getting into the all naturals(vega sport, sun warrior, etc) but I wanted to try something I didn't need two/three servings to get my desired amount of protein. So over all, it's a good standard all purpose protein supplement.
 They sent me a new one after told that the package is damaged with a blade mark right in the middle of the package. I returned the old one.<br/><br/>The new one also have a cut in the middle but it did not leak the content. So I kinda compromised!
 probably the best tasting whey protein i've ever had. it blends in water really well  no grainy texture] and the flavor is actually very easy to take down. i buy this every time and would recommend it to anyone!
 Whey is the "way" to go. Lol but seriously I use whey to meet my macros and when you mix it with milk it literally just tastes like chocolate milk. What I like about Whey is that it doesn't have that metallic flavor some proteins have.
 I didn't like this stuff at first, but after going around trying other protein supplements, this one is the best. The coffee flavor definitely has a chemical taste if you're not used to it. But if you are used to it... this one is so mild compared to other protein powders/bars. I actually look forward to having this for breakfast. I make really concentrated coffee, then add a scoop of this and pour it over ice. It's like a commercially made lattee. I'll probably try vanilla next.
 This is a huge bag o' protien. It is the best buy as far as whey. I signed up for the automatic reorder, and I couldn't use it all before they sent me another. I use this stuff all the time, so it might be better to split with someone if you are going to do the auto reorder thing, but it is a quality product, and pound for pound the best deal on Whey I have found anywhere.
 I take this everyday in morning after my workout with banana / grapes and non fat skim milk. That's my breakfast and it keeps my hunger at bat till lunch.
 Tastes pretty decent (cookies and cream), mixes easy enough, 68 servings in the size I ordered (5 lb tub) for a decent price. All in all no complaints
 Great flavor. As a trainer i only send this to clients
 Not my favorite flavor, but perfect for making "peanut butter spread" with PB2.  Great for shakes with bananas as well! Powder is fine, doesn't clump.  Mixes easily in a shaker cup/blender cup. Macros are great for low carb and low sugar diets.  Good price for the product.
 Tastes great mixed with fat-free milk as a post workout recovery drink! Also in a banana, peanut butter, chocolate smoothie!
 It is a tossup between this and the Natural Pro Complex Chocolate as to which is my favorite.  The Whey Gold mixes a little easier and is less expensive but the Natural Pro complex uses stevia instead of artificial sweeteners and has more nutrients (in addition to the protein).  Both taste better than the others I have tried.
 The coffee flavor is great! Highly recommend. Love this brand
 The Gold Standard! Absolutely the best. Try the Banana Strawberry it is like having desert everyday. If you want to put the best in your body Gold Standard is the only one. Nothing else taste as good Nothing.
 ----Introduction----<br/><br/>We all know that whey protein works. It's one of the cheapest and most convenient ways to reach your protein goals if you can't get there with meals. "Cheaping out" on your whey doesn't always pan out, as anyone who has choked down a less expensive (but clumpy) tub of protein. Paying top dollar doesn't always guarantee positive results either. I've had some "premium" protein that I didn't care for because while it mixed great, it tasted terrible! I always seem to come back to ON whey protein because it fits the bill on all accounts (at least for me).<br/><br/>----Ingredient Profile----<br/><br/>It's got whey! (hey!). Around 24g of protein per scoop (~31g) you get a fair amount of protein, with the rest left over for "other stuff". The "other stuff" being 1g of fat and 3g of carbs, with one gram of those carbs coming from sugar. All this is from ONE label that I found (chocolate malt flavor), but if you look around the net at other labels of this product, you'll see slightly different numbers. What's up with that? The variance is most likely due to the MANY different flavors ON has on the market. The flavor will also affect what sweetener is used, as I have seen acesulfame potassium and sucralose (better known as the brand name Splenda) both alone and in combination depending on the flavor. It's good to be aware that this variance exists, but for most it shouldn't matter too much. I'm sure you can find other whey's with a tighter carb/sugar/fat/protein ratio, so if you're micromanaging your macros you might be concerned. But overall I think it's pretty good.<br/><br/>On the topic of artificial sweeteners: I feel that artificial sweeteners are safe for the most part. Some people might disagree, but much of the clinical literature I have read (regarding aspartame, saccharine, and sucralose specifically) has indicated that they are safe in most people. Most problems I have heard are that people have trouble digesting large amounts of the stuff and get diarrhea. However, I feel that they are better than the amount of sugar (I.E., empty calories) it takes to achieve a similar sweetness. These are just my own thoughts and opinions, so use your best judgment.<br/><br/>----Taste----<br/><br/>Here is where a protein powder can really shine, in my opinion. With upwards to 24 different flavors, you're bound to find one that you like. I've tried a handful of them and they were great. My go-to has been the double rich chocolate, as I can add some peanut butter to it if I want to add some more calories/make it taste even better. I would recommend that you pick a flavor that you REALLY like before investing in a 10lb bag (strawberry got old after a while).<br/><br/>----Mixability----<br/><br/>ON's Whey always mixes easily and cleanly in both milk and water, with very little (if any) clumpage. The labeling states that you can stir it up with a spoon, but I recommend sticking to a good ol' shaker bottle. Full marks here.<br/><br/>----Dosing----<br/><br/>Dosing is easy peasy, just scoop up however much you need. One scoop per serving is pretty standard for most powders, with 24g per serving being normal as well.<br/><br/>----Effectiveness----<br/><br/>I can state with great certainty that ON's protein is effective. Working in the field that I do, some jobs in the past have had me working 12 hours a day with no breaks. Oftentimes, this would be my only source of protein (and sometime my only source of nutrition, period). Despite these conditions I was still able to hit my daily protein goals. I did have some digestive issues when I first started supplementing protein, but that was mostly because I made such a drastic change in my eating habits. Those have long since subsided, and my gut bacteria enjoy processing my protein without complaint.<br/><br/>Also, Labdoor.com (an independent supplement testing lab) gave ON's Gold Standard 100% Whey Protein an A-. I feel that the "minus" comes from the inclusion of artificial sweeteners, which labdoor.com marks as "controversial". As I've said previously, I feel these claims are overstated.<br/><br/>----Value----<br/><br/>The best value is to buy in bulk, and ON offers a whopping 10lb bag for around $110 on amazon. That averages out to about 75 cents a serving, so I feel that I'm getting my money's worth. The most commonly carried size by most brick-and-mortar stores is the 5lb tubs, but sizes go all the way down to a 1.8lb package if you aren't a monster consumer like myself. Do note that not all flavors are carried in all sizes, as the 10lb bags are limited to around 5 flavors.<br/><br/>----Side Effects----<br/><br/>You might experience some cramping if you're new to supplementing protein, but that's usually because your body is getting used to processing protein in such a large bolus. It should pass fairly quickly. For those that still have problems, you might have issues processing whey in general. I have heard of people having success in switching to other protein sources such as soy in these cases.<br/><br/>----Conclusion----<br/><br/>If you want a whey protein that is affordable, mixes well, tastes great, and works, look no further. While you can probably find some other whey's with a slimmer carb profile, it won't beat ON's Gold Standard by much. Highly recommended.
 Pretty much one of the best tasting protein powder in the market. I do it with milk usually. I'd buy it again soon
 my absolute favorite whey protein. taste is amazing. chocolate is delicious. the macros on this is great and I use it almost every day
 Purchase went well and item arrived fast, all as expected!<br/>I'm leaving 5 stars but I'm not paid for this nor do I get items for free.
 I've only used one 5 lb jar to date so I can't comment on the results yet.  But I'm definitely not gonna reorder the chocolate mint.  I also have the Platinum Hyrdo Builder in chocolate flavor and that's a lot better tasting.  I'll probably try vanilla or strawberry next.  The Gold Standard Whey does mix well with either water or no fat milk.  And it does replace a noon meal for me which keeps me away from pizza and sandwiches.
 Great Product.<br/>Definitely good for gains,  and muscle recovery. Put on 9lbs in 2 weeks taking (2 scoops) four times daily; every four hours. Really high quality protein, and doesn't get thick. Definitely didn't like the french vanilla flavors taste though.<br/>- Cookies and cream is pretty good. Would definitely recommend this product.
 This whey protein mixes perfectly in a blender bottle and tastes great. Chocolate peanut butter is my favorite, but Rocky Road tastes great also. I thoroughly enjoy my protein shake when I mix this product with whole milk. Tastes much better than any other brand I have tried.
 I purchased this as a post workout drink.  I've tried numerous other Whey Supplements (i.e.: BSN Syntha6, MetRX, MusclePharm, etc) and found they didn't work as well as I'd hoped.  They had high sugar contents, didn't blend well and some even had the chalk taste. ON Gold Standard Whey mixes evenly in a blender bottle and still tastes great with water.  I also take a thicker, heavier shake in the morning by mixing it with 50% Milk and 50% water; awesome stuff.  The vanilla allows you to get creative on those days where you have more time to make a strawberry vanilla fruit smoothie or make a vanilla peanut butter banana almond shake; great for Saturday mornings.  This stuff is great and will last you a good while! I will not be switching proteins again.
 The ON Gold Standard Whey protein in French Vanilla Creme is AMAZING. I like to add it to almond milk or regular milk and use a blender bottle to get the best results. I also like adding the protein shake to cereal as an alternative to normal milk.
 Good stuff.  Mixes easily with water, doesn't stay clumpy.  The taste is not my favorite, however there is no bad aftertaste and certainly no chalky feel with the drink.
 Favorite protein.<br/>Taste: Milk chocolate is good in water and GREAT in milk<br/>Texture: mixes very easily<br/>They have a great selection of flavors and the Natural Gold standard is also worth buying.<br/>The protein is high quality, and very fast absorbing so is great to take immediately after a workout but would recomend a blended protein for before bed ( like Syntha 6, pro complex, etc
 I always buy my protein from ON on Amazon. Its cheaper than GNC and ON has so many flavors to choose from. Always taste great and low enough in calories that I'm not worrying about going over my daily goals. Also low in sugar which is helpful!
 It mixes well, but it's a bit too sweet - for the milk chocolate flavor
 It does the job for protein but doesn't taste very good. It mixes really easily even without a shaker ball in my bottle but I won't buy this product again.
 This is my go-to brand.  I can't count how many times I have re-ordered and tried various flavors of ON Whey.<br/><br/>Vanilla and coffee are my two favorites.
 This tub of protein is the best I have ever tasted! I think this is the best tasting protein shake hands down. I have the milk chocolate flavor and it is just so good with soymilk! I use soymilk because it is thicker than milk and makes it have the consistency of a milk shake :D! Every workout I use this, but have recently stopped due to the steep price of this and have now gone to Dymatize !
 Works great in my smoothie for breakfast. Nice taste.
 This product is awesome.  It is at a great price for such a good product, and it is super helpful and efficient.  I can just scoop out a baggie to throw into my backpack for after an intense yoga session or workout.  The protein count is awesome, and it tastes pretty good too.  It's so versatile too!  Personally, I think this is one of the best investments you can make.  You'll save money in the long run.
 This product tastes just like those instant cappuccino drinks. My go to is mixing it with chocolate milk to get a chocolate mocha flavor. Make sure to wash your water bottle after using this otherwise it will start to stink.
 Not the greatest flavor to be honest but apart from that 5 stars.
 The white chocolate is the best flavour I've tried to date. I usually mix one scoop in 10oz of unsweetened almond milk twice a day. Tastes fantastic!
 My favorite Whey protein!!  This is the first time that I'm not a fan of the flavor that I've picked but that falls on me and my taste buds, not the quality of the product.  I take a scoop pre and post workout.  Can definitely tell that I'm gaining lean mass.
 Taste freakin good, not perfect, but freakin good. Good luck looking for the scoop.
 I bought this stuff as a way to stay full during the work day as my job is very hectic and I rarely eat lunch. It works amazingly well as long as you use a blender bottle. If you stir it with a spoon then it's terrible. Maybe I have a bad batch for that but "Instantized" does not work for me.
 Ok, I'll admit it: somedays, the only thing that gets me through my work out is the prospect of drinking this delicious protein shake afterwards! What could possibly be better than sugar-and-carb-free chocolate milk loaded with protein? My only complaint is, it is sweetened with sucralose. No, I don't taste it, because the chocolate masks it well, but for health reasons, I think I might've preferred it sweetened with something like xylitol. Unless, of course, that would change the flavor...
 We bought this while they're was a prime deal, so we got an amazing price on it!!
 This protein is very satisfying after a hard workout, especially when I add a banana , some milk.<br/>It's a good deal, as good or better than competing proteins you'd get from say...Walmart .
 Price could be better.  Can get the same product at Academy sports for a few dollars cheaper.
 I've been buying the 2 pound previously, have been using for a few months and am very happy with this product.  The double rich chocolate is by far my favorite flavor, tastes like milk chocolate mix and dissolves easily.  Just to be warned, the 5 pound container is significantly larger so check the dimensions so you are not surprised.
 I've been using this for a few years now.  I like thew flavor, even though it's pink, and it helps me maintain my muscle mass.
 ON is a great quality protein powder.  Have been taking 2 to 4 scoops per day for about 14 months.  Lost fat and gained muscle (also maintained a good diet and exercised daily).  Love having strawberry flavor to mix things up.
 Love the rich chocolate taste.  Mixes easily with no lumping.  Very satisfying.  I have just re-ordered.
 Great whey protein. I use the product along with weights to get naturally big.  I now look like Phil Heath and am very happy.
 I've had lots of different whey proteins over the years. The tastes range from decent down to insufferable and gag inducing. This is by far the best tasting whey I've ever had. I could swallow the vanilla without much drama, but the chocolate in particular is amazing. If you gave me a glass of the double rich chocolate and told me it was chocolate milk, I'd believe you!<br/><br/>I actually have a dairy allergy. I'm not allergic to whey, but I am allergic to the proteins in milk the whey is separated from. I've had some protein shakes that have actually made me sick because it wasn't pure whey, yet I've never had any issues with Optimum Nutrition. With the exception of a couple supplements not offered by ON, they have become my number 1 trusted source for whey and workout supplements. While they may not always be the cheapest, you get what you pay for and their products are still vary competitively priced.
 The name is accurate, this really is the gold standard of whey protein. low in calories compared to many brands and the  "extreme milk chocolate" is almost as tasty as muscle milk brand.
 This stuff is great.  I mixes well with anything, though it taste way better with Milk or Almond Milk or whatever Milk.  I use it in my smoothies and have nothing bad to say about it.<br/><br/>*NOTE* This is by far the best whey protein for me.  Optimum Nutrition has great credibility in pretty much every category.  But if you are a looking for the Purist of the Pure Whey protein, you will see some ingredients that are not whey protein.  In fact, for the chocolate flavor it even has "Artificial Flavors" listed!!! Now I don't care, and these ingredients are in such low amounts I don't believe they could ever be harmful.  I only mentioned it cause I know some people, like my girlfriend, are into no artificial anything.  If that is what you are looking for I would suggest Kaizen Whey protein, but it's not available on Amazon so you will have to go out to a store and purchase it yourself like we did in the 90s :).  But for me, and practically everyone I know this is the best Protein.
 Great Whey product. Have been using for over 5 years.  Blends well with a Vita Mix or by a hand 'whip'.  Does not clump like others. Mixes to a very smooth protein drink.<br/><br/>We use the vanilla ice cream and it is great with fruit or fruit juices.<br/><br/>Highly recommend this product
 Came on time, good product. Purchased the chocolate flavor, only downside is you are limited in what you can add to your smoothies. No complaints.
 For protein in general, you cant go wrong with ON Whey. They make the best tasting powder out there. In the past I've had the Extreme Chocolate Milk, and it was incredible. One of those things you crave during the day, because it's that good. I love mint chocolate chip ice cream, so I thought chocolate mint was a no-brainer.<br/><br/>It turns out the other reviews were right. It's still tasty for protein, but its not perfect. You need to mix this one thoroughly for it to taste good, and even then the mint flavor is verrry subtle. Compared to the Extreme Chocolate Milk, there's no contest. With that one, you could eat chunks off the spoon and they'll still taste delicious, not so much for the mint. If it's not mixed in all the way you'll get a bit of a chalky taste in your mouth. If you think about mint chocolate chip ice cream it helps pull in that vibe, but it's not exactly comparable.  I probably won't get it again, but downing the 5lb tub wont be bad, because as I said it's still pretty good. It's worth trying (in a smaller size) to get your own opinion.<br/><br/>Extreme Chocolate Milk - 10/10<br/>Chocolate Mint - 8/10<br/><br/>Worth noting, I take my protein with milk instead of water. Tastes better that way!
 This product is always a solid choice, when looking for whey protein.
 Good protein, I recommend!!
 This is a really good protein mix. I think next time I will try a different flavor. The double rich chocolate flavor has a very artificial sweeteners flavor (I'm not usually one to notice this). The flavor is much better with skim milk. This is a great protein for post-workout. I have seen it on a couple of body building sites also. I will definitely order this again!
 Yummy &amp; great protein amount included.
 Great product and service!
 Works for what I need to use it for. Breakfast, snack, after work outs, even after a long day of work and not wanting a big meal for supper. Will continue to buy.
 Great taste, love it.
 Receiving this Whey made my day. First of all, it came literally overnight. It was supposed to come in 5-7 days, but it literally came in a day. That says nothing about the product itself, though. I've just finished a tub of the extreme milk chocolate, which had a sickening, cloying fake-chocolate taste and I was eager to get rid of and unsatisfied with. I love coffee, and this Whey -actually tastes like good coffee-. I was simply blown away at how high quality the product was, I don't have much more to say.
 No sucralose? Nice! Tastes awesome. Not that incredibly bloaty feeling from other shakes. Definitely fills you up for a bit, though. Love ON now, using a couple of their things. Will be doing business again.
 Optimum has great whey and this is my favorite flavor.  Mix it with the white chocolate on special occasions.
 Great taste and lots of amino acids.  I take two scoops twice a day with cinnamon powder to add those extra protein grams I need to body build.
 Taste Good, Smells Good! :0
 Tasty stuff, especially after a 30 mile bike ride
 I have been drinking protein for years and have tried all kind of formula. I am vegetarian and building muscle so I need to drink protein shake. I worked at GNC when I was in school so I knew @ different protein types and brands. This is good testing protein with minimal sugar and carbs.
 Pretty good protein I've seen gains with this brand and it mixes well, I have bought 3-4  of these tubs and they all have been a good experience. Dark chocolate is my favorite others seem to make me gag.
 I got the "Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard, French Vanilla Creme, 5 Pound" I have never tasted a Whey product that tastes this good with just water! I look forward to working out just so I can have my whey protein :)
 Always buy this brand. Very good flavor and bakes well also. If it's not the vanilla i buy the chocolate. But my go to shake post workout is the vanilla with a scoop of pb and a banana. No digestive issues.
 This is my favorite whey protein.  Double Chocolate is the best.  Mixes well, not too sweet.
 It is nasty tasting I could not return it so I threw it in the trash. Nasty
 I am not trying to get huge, I just use this to limit some of the muscle soreness and help with recovery.  This does those two things fine.<br/><br/>FYI: This protein makes your b---hole smell really bad.  Don't workout to get big, then take a scoop, and go on a first date unless she is upwind from you at all times.<br/><br/>Myoplex is more expensive, but it doesn't give you horribly smelly gas.  I like Myoplex more than this, and will pay extra to keep people hanging out with me.
 Would not recommend Rocky Road unless the buyer really enjoys the taste of vanilla extract, because that's all I was able to taste. I have been using the Double Chocolate for about 2 years and like it pretty well(4 stars imo), but thought I would change it up to try a different flavor. Was not impressed, and immediately ordered another Double Chocolate.
 Great Brand but I wish they can make these from Grass Fed Whey
 Good boost for before or after work out. I am able to eat less by drinking this. I been mixing it with one glass of milk and it gives me lots gas.
 I am a coconut lover and after reading some reviews people said it tasted like almond joy which I totally disagree with. The coconut taste is very faint but it isn't completely bad. I bought unsweetened coconut flakes and poured into the whole tub to increase the taste.
 Pretty much everyone knows this is one if not the best Whey proteins ever made. So the only thing I'm going to mention here is the Mocha Cappuccino flavor. Oh boy, you have to give it a shot. It's absolutely delicious.
 My son says the stuff is the best.
 Tried French vanilla and didn’t really like the taste, but once mixed with other ingredients, it makes it much tastier.
 very satisfied!
 Im not big into flavors for my protein so I love the basic taste of vanilla. I don't use a shaker and the protein mixes pretty easily by just pouring it into a bottle of water and shaking it up. It doesn't leave me gassy or give me any stomach issues. I used to use syntha 6 but I think I'll stick with this for a while.
 Good product, but will order a different flavor next time.
 Very good product I c changes in my body and I’m useing this product for only a week
 Seriously good. I have high metabolism, so when I'm doing any sort of regular exercise, it's hard to not feel lethargic during the day. I drink these only after intense workouts (along with a proper diet of course) and I feel good the next day.
 1 week into using this and I got an upset stomach with diarrhea 😶😶
 Favorite flavor by far!
 I love the way it taste. Came right away and was packaged good. I wasn't able to use this product as much anymore because I found out that I have some bad side effects with this product. This should be good for everyone just for me it makes me urinate like crazy, but for the person I gave it too he loves the product.
 Optimum nutrition is my go to protien brand based off of sheer quality alone. My friend persuaded me into trying the coffee flavor and I was blown away. Mixes perfectly in a blender bottle, and the coffee flavor goes down smooth. Highly reccomend for your everyday protien drinkers who like coffee and need a new flavor that doesn't get old.
 This tastes great and goes well in smoothies, milk, and yogurt. I would definitely purchase again!
 My husband works out all the time and has used this protein for years! He uses it after a work out or even as a meal replacer. I like to use it in banana peanut butter smoothies!!!!!
 Nice
 Great fast service and the flavor is exactly as described. Vanilla Ice Cream. Mixed with milk this is like melted ice cream. I may try to freeze it.
 GET RIPPPPPPED.<br/><br/>Its serving sizes are super small for the amount of protein. Which is great, since i literally drown in powder from muscle milk's large serving sizes.
 Doesn't taste like banana cream, tastes exactly like a banana laffy taffy. OK with water and much better with milk. Best mixing protein I've ever had and it's easy to chug because you don't need as much water/milk. Next time I'm going back to rich chocolate.
 The positive customer reviews are true! The Mocha Cappuccino flavor is delicious and the product dissolves quickly and easily in Almond Milk or water using just a shaker bottle. I take two (2) scoops in the morning with Almond Milk and one (1) scoop with water immediately after a workout and I feel great and look great. Solid product with a great price.
 I've only had experience with a couple of different protein powder brands, so my review can be taken with a grain of salt. However, I have to admit that this brand is good quality and this specific flavor, Cookies and Cream, is really delicious. When mixed with non-fat milk, it almost tastes like a milk shake. It gives it a creamy texture, and it even has tiny little cookies bits (kind of like Oreos). Even with just plain water, the taste is above average. You're not going to crave the water+powder combo, but it's most definitely drinkable and doesn't taste unnatural like some other powders.<br/><br/>I mentioned that it's good quality because it mixes so damn well! I use a shaker that has one of those metal ball blenders, but honestly I could just leave it out and the shaking alone can mix the liquid and powder. Even with cold liquids, like milk, there are no chunks at all.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this protein powder. It tastes great and mixes well, what more can you ask for?
 Gave this to my son for his birthday. He's now out on his own and items like this for birthday or Christmas now seem WONDERFUL to him as they are often now not a part of his budget! LOL
 best flavor - coffee. ordered four plus times
 My favorite protein powder, the banana flavor is awesome and the powder dissolves easily in a shaker or with a spoon or straw with ice
 Excellent Nutrition and exercise supplement! Great Taste, Smell, energy. Used to drink 2-3 cups of other products ; now just once before and after has made a huge difference in muscle bulking. Highly recommended. Won't go back to the others. Recommended to a bunch of others friends who have switched to this already.
 Oh my god. I this supposed to taste that bad? I mean, I bought the dymatize iso 100 double rich chocolate and it was great, this Gold Standard double rich chocolate just taste insanely bad.
 Good product with great taste! Very easy to mix and doesn't leave a gritty texture. However, I am lactose intolerant and found that this really really upset my stomach, created horrible cramps and made me very gassy. Not that I wouldn't recommend it, however for those with sensitivities - please beware!
 The taste is awful.. is hard to drink it..
 I'm a girl who is using this product along with the One Day Diet -- drinking about ten "protein waters" a day. I like the taste of the double rich chocolate mixed with the water. It tastes like watery chocolate. I'm sure that it would taste delicious with milk (like a milkshake), but for my dieting purposes, it's great too.
 very good product, I recommend. after the whole package I am a little bit tired of taste but there is a visible effect when you take it continuously. I got definitely more muscle<br/>My Recommendation:<br/>Straight after training (within 15-30 minutes, but the best really straight after) take one or one and half – exceptionally two – units of product.
 very tastey,also mixes well.
 I work out early before work so I mix a scoop or two in with some cold coffee I brewed and refrigerated the night before, and 1/2 cup unsweetened almond milk. It feels like I'm cheeting it's so delicious.
 Really a gold standard Whey Isolate protein...!! go for it. Expensive, but you pay for what you get.
 When searching for the best protein powders on the web, this one always comes up as one of the most recommended. I've been using it for at least six months now and it's great. It mixes well with milk using just a spoon. It tastes great and goes down easy. I also believe it has helped me build muscle mass. I'm seeing gains, although I can't attribute those gains to this supplement in particular. It's great, though. I recommend it for anyone who lifts.
 Extreme Milk Chocolate has a great taste.<br/><br/>But you can barely taste the coconut in Chocolate Coconut.
 Well this is my first whey and as I read and heard comments from some friends I decided to try this.<br/><br/>Bought the strawberry-banana one and just opened it let me tell you: it tastes soo good with water only. I'll be looking to see the results and will be updating my review in some weeks.<br/><br/>Amazon has the best price available and will definitely but once again until I get all the flavors!
 I love it!  Had been off working out and really focusing on it due to laziness and excuses.  It was hard to relocated from Miami to NJ and get back on track.  After 2 weeks of use it sure helped me heal my sore muscles.  I am on a mission but this is a great way to get my goals!  Thank you.
 I don't typically go for protein powders with too many ingredients because I like to add my own flavors by adding fresh fruits. This brand actually allows me to do so and provides an excellent protein ratio per serving. They also add allot of other lean muscle building compounds to help give you that extra boost to your workout routine. It's a staple.
 I love this stuff, truely! Even husband approved. No icky aftertaste, not chalky. It's just good. Now is it a Zestos chocolate shake? no it's not - but it's pretty good whipped up with vanilla almond milk &amp; some ice. Love the calorie count &amp; protein. Mixes just as easily with water in a shaker cup and blends out smoothly.
 TIP! Mix in ICE cold water and use the smallest amount of water possible to dissolve!!!<br/><br/>With a name like double rich chocolate, I was expecting it to taste good! I've had other flavors from Optimum Nutrition and have always been happy, I decided to take a chance on this flavor and I was disappointed. Tasted more like semi sweet chocolate. Hard to choke down.
 I use this one to two times and day and love the flavor. I add it to 8 ounces of milk in the morning and it keeps me fueled till my mid morning snack. When I have a sweet tooth in the afternoon and make a shake and it is exactly what I need. The mix can get clumpy if not shaken or blended.  I share this with my husband and it lasts us 2-3 months.<br/><br/>My husband has added oats, strawberries, egg etc to this and still loves it.
 It tastes really good- don't get me wrong, but I think I'll try a different one next time. I think I preferred the mocha one a bit more.
 So I'm a first time protein powder purchaser.  This product came highly recommended from a friend.  It tastes great (I got double chocolate) and is really easy to mix.  You don't really even need a shaker.  I'm just starting out with a weight lifting program and one of the key factors for choosing this whey was it's quality.  The calories are low, there really isn't any junk in it.  It's pretty much pure protein.  I will definitely buy again.
 Great product
 Does not taste like medicine even when mixed with only water. With two scoops or more it has an awesome chocolate taste. It rocks when you add a banana.  It dissolves easily and does not leave any chunks even after a few shakes. This bulk buy is relative inexpensive compared to others bulk sizes. At 10lbs this is the best deal out there.
 This powder mixed very well with water. Very smooth, no chunks. I ordered the cookies n cream flavor and while the taste was not what I was expecting, it is very good. I was expecting a darker, more cookie flavor, where as the color is more of an off white and the taste is more cream. Still good.
 Great product! Quick shipping!
 This is a wonderful, tasty protein powder.  Use it alone with water or milk, or blend it with fruit. I love making a smoothie and tossing in a scoop of this stuff.  It also helps with muscle recovery, so you're not as sore the next day following an intense gym session.
 LOVE it, did  not think I would like banana as much as I do.  Tasted great, and goes down smooth.  love it!!!
 I prefer the natural gold std whey, but I was bored with the lack of flavors so I bought this.  It's actually really tasty with milk (I use vanilla soy milk).  Its not that bad with water either.  I think buying the 5lbs was an over kill.  I will probably try something different if I can actaully get thru all this.  I still use the gold std whey natural vanilla as my go to post work out drink.
 Purchased the Rocky Road on a whim due to the lack of reviews I have read for this flavor. The first sip and each bottle after is just absolutely delicious!!!! Just just like your rocky road ice cream and it blends very easily in my shaker bottle with milk. This is just so flavorful and amazing. I'm glad I got the 5lb jar!
 My favorite protein, and the only one I've used for years.  Mixes great and tastes great and easily digested.  Other protein supplements would really mess with my stomach.  I'll usually mix it with almond milk and ice cubes in the bullet blender for a tasty post workout shake.  No chalky taste at all.  Also, very low caloric intake for the amount of protein you get.
 This stuff works amazingly! I drink it right after I'm done exercising. It is delicious. Banana Cream is my all-time favorite. It prevents me from getting overly sore. If it is a hard work out, I still wake up slightly sore. But before I drank this whey protein, I could barely move the day after work outs. It's worth the price! Mine is only about half way done and I've been using it about 5 days a week for the past 2 months.
 I love this stuff and it's my default protein shake. I would recommend
 Great product.  Use it daily
 LOVE THIS PROTIEN. Used for post work out shakes great flavor and mixes easily!
 The strawberry flavor is amazing, and I just started to use this product to replace the GNC brand I used to buy. This is more affordable and comes with the same results.
 Chocolate water flavor. So so. Although good amount of protein for the calories.
 Great protein fix between meal or after workouts.  Tastes OK.  Impresses your friends when they see the giant bottle on top of your fridge.  They know to leave you a wide berth, lest they incur your wrath.  :)
 Best tasting whey I've had. I reorder all the time.
 me gusto, lo volvería a comprar
 Best flavor ever!
 Very good product
 Good product
 Love this protein. It is definitely the best in terms of nutrition and actual benefits. Don't get anything else a lot of it is full with unnecessary fats and sugars to boost taste.
 I got the cake batter 5 pound whey protein. This thing tastes amazing! I used to drink chocolate flavor from other brands, but didn't enjoy them. I drank them for the protein. This cake batter though, I enjoy drinking because it tastes good. I could drink this thing all day.
 This product is delicious!! Really is helping me hit my macros. I love that it's low cal, too. I usually mix with unsweetened almond milk and the cake batter just tastes amazing.
 As always, ON is the best in my opinion regarding all product lines.  I trust them extensively.<br/><br/>Their forays into multiple flavors are often tasty.  This was manageable but nothing to brag about.  Keep in mind, however, that as a heathen I only mix with water so I am surely missing out on some delicious options.
 Rocky Road tastes exactly like hot chocolate mixed with water and is quite enjoyable. White Chocolate on the other hand isn't good at all, and tastes nothing like white chocolate.
 This protein is one of the better quality ones in my opinion. Has a nice rich chocolate flavor. Tastes really good with milk.
 Great product, but maybe too good. I added 20 pounds in about three weeks. I will adjust the intake to balance muscle mass against fat gain. Will buy this again.
 This protein works really well. I take it after my workouts in the morning and it makes me feel great. I never get headaches after working out thanks to this protein. I will be buying this again!
 Best tasting and best quality ingredients by far! #1 only protein i will get anymore and ive had many different brands over the years!
 I personally did not like the flavor at all. I keep trying it to see if it will get better but it doesn’t.
 One of the better quality proteins I've had. More per price, not many gross ingredients, great flavor, and it doesn't destroy my bowels for the next 24 hours, though it still does cause some SBDs. Great in fruit smoothies. Even good with just water, hence the high score.
 Tastes great
 I have had bad luck trying to find a whey protein that wasn't completely awful. The rocky road flavor was okay but I feel like it could be better. It had too much chocolate flavor and not enough nutty flavor like what I expect in a rocky road ice cream. I preferred the Gold Standard fruit punch mixed with fruit juice which went down easy for me. This is still not a bad option if you are looking for a different whey flavor to change things up a bit.
 Always great
 I liked this product alot. It taste great to begin with and it mixes well in my shaker using cold, sometimes ice water. And compared to other protein powders i have tried, the sugar content is very low.<br/>I noticed the taste right away after finishing a tub of muscle milk, ON was not as sweet. But I got used to the taste and I enjoy the milk chocolate taste.
 This is the real deal.<br/>I love the taste(double rich chocolate) and I've been using it for the past 3 years.<br/><br/>I tried Strawberry once and the taste was not great. was too sweet/artificial for my preference.<br/>So went back to my good old "Double rich chocolate".
 Great
 Awesome!
 this stuff is great, vanilla ice cream tastes so good. i have been drinking it after working out for over a month and i still cant get enough of the flavor, it tastes like a milk shake, its best with cold milk, highly reccomend
 great taste when I add it into Vanilla soy milk and it mixes pretty well, but the chunks are tasty as well.  not sure just how good the protein content is but I guess it is awesome as many serious body builders seem to use it... very good pricing on AMAZON and with PRIME and free shipping, it is total awesomeness as most AMAZON purchases are for me...
 Tastes great and good quality
 mixes well with almond milk, will buy again
 I've been using whey protein for a while now but this is the first time I got the French Vanilla Creme, it's definitely become one of my favorites already. It tastes like vanilla and caramel so if you're into that you'll be happy with the purchase.<br/><br/>Tastes especially good with cocoa powder or peanut butter (I use powdered pb) and using milk (almond or regular) always tastes better than water for whey.
 I've been using a lot of the more expensive brands and always just end up right back here at ON since they're one of the best products I've used at one of the best prices.  I usually buy this at my local HEB for about the same price as it is here on amazon, but they only have the double chocolate and vanilla there and I need a little more diversity in my flavors!  I went for the Chocolate Malt and was not disappointed!  It seriously tastes like those chocolate covered malt balls, and I love it!  Forget double chocolate, this is going to be my new fall-back flavor!  I've gotta try some of the other fun flavors offered next time because I'm excited to see what else I may be missing out on.
 Tastes almost cheesy if mixed with milk. Also kinda funky if mixed in water. Just drink it fast and try not to think about it.
 Great product
 Love Optimum Gold Standard Whey. I have tried so many different Protein powder and love this one the best. Taste good and helps you build muscle. Of course you must lift heavy and bring muscle to failure in my opinion to gain muscle. Also, I use it when I dont have time or just can't take another egg white in morning. Awesome for weight loss as well.
 ON is the only protein that I have been able to drink with water. This flavor is actually quite tasty with water, and with milk or in milkshakes it's out of this world. Highly recommended to anyone with a sweet tooth. I don't have to say anything about the effectiveness of the product itself, because this is already the gold standard for protein supplements.
 I love it but you can get a much bigger size at your local GNC for about the same price.
 This is the batch of protein powder I've ever used, so I don't have much of a background to go on. But I think the taste is okay. I just mix it with a bit of 2 percent milk and I'm good to go.
 I buy Optimum Gold Standard for my whey protein all the time. There aren't very many whey proteins that are better. A good place to check for ratings is bodybuilding.com they constantly have tests, ratings and reviews from serious body builders and people who train hard. Price is the selling point on this though. Just four years ago you could ge the ten pound bag for under $75 on Bodybuilding.com. It is at or above $100 on all sites now. The positive of getting it on Amazon though is the free shipping which will cost you at least $15 on BB.com. So I buy it through Amazon now as well.
 ewww! Tastes terrible will stick with chocolate! What a terrible waste of money next time will not buy such a large tub will buy smaller to taste test!
 I bought this protein as advised by a friend of mine. The taste is decent and it seems to work as expected.
 best protein out there
 I have never used protein shakes before so this is my first try.  It tastes wonderful and the price is much lower than expected per shake.  I mix mine with almond milk light.  It adds a little thickness and tastes even better.
 My favorite these days, low carb, just protein, tastes ok, blends easily...
 Foam lid under the plastic cap was not in tact.  Protein was spilled in the shipping container.  Kind of disgusted.  Just throwing it out.  Probably has germs in it.
 My go-to whey protein powder, in my favorite flavor - mocha cappuccino. I've done my research, and like the quality, purity, flavor, price and availability of Optimum Nutrition whey above all others. I've been buying this brand, flavor and size for years now and have yet to have a problem.
 The first protein powder I tried. Tastes good with milk!
 Tastes more like straw then berry... Could be better if you mix it with something sweet
 This is the only protein I buy.  Good flavor if mixed with almond milk.  It tastes like a musketeers bar.
 Great product.
 Consistent flavor at a good price.
 Drinking it every morning. Not sure of the results yet, but it doesn't taste too bad...
 I have been using this powder for quite a while now.  It's by far the best one that I have tried.  I mix it with skim milk and I don't even need to use a mixer ball inside my cup.  I just shake it up and it dissolves quickly and w/o major lumps.  I also noticed that it's quite a bit thinner when mixed than other brands.  Makes it go down easy.
 I am usually happy with a protein powder if it tastes good and mixes well, and this is great on both counts.  I use protein powders because I am eating at a calorie deficit to lose weight, plus I am a vegetarian and don't really care for most protein-heavy foods (too many eggs just don't agree with my stomach, nuts and butters are super high in calories although I do eat some of those, etc.).  That puts me at huge risk to lose muscle mass, which I don't want to do.  One way to overcome this problem, or at least basically keep up (maybe not gaining, but certainly not losing muscle), is to consume additional protein.<br/><br/>I have found one good way to get protein is to make a smoothie in the morning.  I take 8 oz of unsweetened almond milk, plus ground flax seed (or sometimes hemp seeds or chia seeds, depending on what is in the pantry), some type of greens powder or moringa, matcha, PB2, cacao, and protein powder and blend it all together.  Then I add a half cup of frozen mixed berries.  That way I am getting a lot of protein and antioxidants all at once, without too much sugar, but the chocolate/peanut butter/berry taste seems quite decadent.  This is the protein powder I have been using lately and it is one of the best I've tried.  It has a great chocolate taste (this is a review for the double rich chocolate flavor, by the way), and it is such a fine powder, it is easy to measure out and it mixes perfectly without clumps.  (I do use an immersion blender to mix.  I find mechanical means better for such things and it is easier to clean than a standard blender.)<br/><br/>I love that this is supplemented with BCAAs.  I have recently become a big fan of BCAAs.  They work so well for me in reducing delayed onset muscle soreness, and I have been lifting heavy (for me) weights lately in an attempt to preserve muscle.  So I have experienced a lot of delayed onset muscle soreness, but I feel that the BCAAs are doing a good job of helping repair my muscles and ease the soreness.  That is a nice plus from this product. Plus, vegetarian diets may be low in BCAAs (although some are found in dairy and eggs).<br/><br/>I also like the macronutrient balance here.  This is pretty low in fat and carbohydrates.  Although I am not strictly tracking macros, it is nice to find a protein source that is pretty much just protein and not much else -- I get plenty of fiber in my diet already from fruits, vegetables, beans, and grains, plus that way I can get my fat somewhere else (since fat does taste quite good!), like in using actual butter or olive oil to roast vegetables (instead of cooking spray) or maybe having a little real peanut butter instead of just PB2, having an avocado on taco night, etc.<br/><br/>I do like that this is made in the US.  I feel there are better quality controls in the manufacturing process.  Plus, you know, I only feed my pets food and treats made in the US, and I should have standards at least as good for myself!<br/><br/>In the end, I highly recommend the double rich chocolate flavor, in particular, as a palatable, easily mixable, nutrient-balanced vegetarian protein formulation.  Once I make it through all the protein powder samples I have accumulated, this is a top contender for a repurchase.
 Good taste, good amount of protein for the volume and calories. Not quite the amount of flavor beyond chocolate that I was expecting, but still good and nice for a change from the plain flavors.  A slight hint of artificialness to me, but still good.  Good value for the size.
 Clean gains!
 Best protein on the market and one of the best values as well. Has one of the lowest "filler" values among all whey proteins. Most serious lifters I know stick with this brand. Flavors taste great with water or milk.
 Update:  I finally got a shaker bottle, problem solved (with the clumping and not mixing) and stars updated.<br/><br/>For 99% of people taking protein powder as a supplement, protein is protein is protein.  So this review won't go into the "quality" of ON's protein mix relative to others.  This review and the rating I gave are based strictly on ways that you can clearly tell the difference between ON and other types of protein I've tried - taste, ease of mixing, value.<br/><br/>1.  Taste:  I stick to chocolate flavored proteins, and so far has tried (in addition to ON) Cytosport 100% Whey (from Costco), Gaspari Myofusion, and Muscle Milk.  In comparison, the ON does not taste bad, but is much lighter in taste and flavor than all others.  When mixing one serving size with frozen berries and milk in a blender, the ON Chocolate flavor is almost completely hidden by the sweetness of the berries and milk flavor.  The Cytosport flavor was much stronger and tasted overall better with the same preparation.  The Myofusion flavor was overpowering, and did not taste quite as good as Cytosports.  Muscle Milk's was somewhere in the middle.<br/><br/>2.  Ease of Mixing:  This is my biggest beef with ON's powder.  Its claims of being "instantized" are worthless, since this powder absolutely refuses to mix with water if you try to stir with a spoon (as the label suggests you can do).  I currently have one serving sitting 12oz of water next to me, which I began mixing about 30 minutes ago.  Attached you will find a photo of what that "mix" looks like after periodic stirring in cold water for 30 minutes.  There remain pebble-sized chunks that will not break up without smashing them with your finger, then it just becomes a solid pancake.  Relative to the other 3 I've used, ON is absolutely terrible for mixing.  In a blender, ON's thickens noticeably more than the others and will give the blender trouble where no other mix I've used ever has.<br/><br/>3.  Value:  there's certainly a lot of servings in one 5lbs tub of ON, and I do like that out of a 30g scoop, a full 24g of that is protein.  However at $53 / tub, this is significantly more expensive than the 5lbs offerings from Cytosport and Myofusion.
 Great product. Good price
 This has a good taste and mixes well if you use a shaker with a blending insert. It keeps you feeling full for 3-4 hours.
 I love my optimum whey protein powder
 Great value
 This tastes pretty good and not chalky, similar a vanilla milk smoothie. I usually mix it with almond/soy milk in a Blender bottle with the mixer ball, and use less liquid to amp up the flavor. Great for a quick breakfast or dinner when you don't have time.
 Me encanta su sabor delicioso, muy bueno!
 Best powder out there
 Best tasting protein powder out there. Not excited about the new formula to add more fiber since it increased number of calories, fat, and carbs without increasing protein. Even so, it's still best taste for the money
 Needed a quality whey for a weight gain program. With working 15 minutes a day this product helped me to muscle up easily. I didn't want to eat a whole bunch of food so this is what I used. Dissolves easily in milk, no problem. Added some fiber and fruit and that is it! Tastes good, not chalky.
 I just got a tub of extreme milk chocolate, it tastes awesome, and I would definitely recommend it if youre picky or particular about choosing flavors; I had half a scoop of their cake batter protein left and mixed it with extreme milk chocolate and that tasted great as well! It's literally cold hot chocolate. Great product!
 Gold Standard is one of the most trusted companies.  This protein is good especially the chocolate.  Works very well with no complaints.  Doesn't have all those fillers that other protein has.  One of the best 100% whey out there.
 I did the research and tried a few products, and this one is by the far the best I have tried for post work out recovery with absolutely no stomach upset.  I won't go into the science of why I chose whey isolates protein, you can do that online all day.  Suffice to say that once you get here, this product is superior for recovery and lack of stomach irritation and/or indigestion.  And as a bonus, I received it the very next day after ordering it with Amazon Prime.
 I'm very happy with the vanilla ice cream flavor.  Not too sweet or hard to drink.  I drink it with water but sure it'll tastes just as delicious with milk.  Give it a shot.
 Great protein, wonderful flavor.
 This stuff is delicious!!!
 Great Whey, mixes well and tastes so good with milk.  A lot shorter ingredient list than many other brands, so that is what attracted me to this mix.  I have since switched to another powder "ProMix" that is grass fed based, does not contain gluten, and is also soy free.
 ON is the nutrition powder I keep coming back to.  I thought I'd try a different flavor - natural chocolate - but never again.  I always mix my protein powder with a spoon, and this mixes horribly.  I get clumps of powder every time I mix it.  I'm going to go back to the milk chocolate which mixes much better.
 Ordered Cookies and Cream.  The label on it says cookies and cream but it tastes like Mocha :/<br/>**UPDATE**<br/>Well the top portion of the protien whey tasted/smelled like Mocha, but as i get closer to the middle/bottom, it starts to taste like cookies and cream.
 Shopping for whey? The first question you should ask yourself is what's more important to you, taste or results? Hopefully the lot of you chooses the latter. However if you chose the former I wouldn't recommend this product and would instead recommend "Syntrax" nectar protein. That stuff literally tastes as good as Koolaid. I have been taking Gold standard Whey for about 6 months and I have appeared to have gotten better results. I know for sure my arms have grown in size. As far as taste goes, a majority them taste OKAY, but nothing thus far has been amazing. I will update my reviews as I try more flavors.  ****Note**** I drink my protein with water only so it may or may not taste better with milk/almond milk.<br/><br/>Chocolate Mint - 6.5 out of 10. After suffering through a 5 lb tub of Cake Batter I next tried Chocolate Mint. I would say the of the flavors I have mentioned thus far this is my favorite. The chocolate flavor is definitely more pronounced than the mint, which is subtle.<br/><br/>Rocky Road - 6 out of 10. For me Rocky Road was a tad better than tolerable. It definitely wasn't scrumptious or anything, but I thought it was much better and sweeter tasting than chocolate malt.<br/><br/>Chocolate Malt - 5 out of 10. I couldn't say this tasted like a chocolate malt truthfully. It tastes about as close to a chocolate malt as the bubble gum flavored medicine did back in the day. There are worst flavors though.<br/><br/>Cookies and Cream - 4 out of 10. I thought the flavor was slightly tolerable. There are small granules that I suppose act as the replacement cookies in this. Sometimes you notice them, sometimes you don't. That was really the only unique thing about this flavor.<br/><br/>French Vanilla Creme - 4 out of 10. I thought overall the flavor was slightly tolerable, but definitely wasn't one of the better tasting ones. Also wasn't the worst so I guess that's something right? I will say it definitely was closer to an actual French Vanilla Creme flavor than Cake batter was.<br/><br/>Cake Batter - 1 out of 10. Not sure what cake-batter flavor they were trying to replicate here, but they swung and missed greatly with this attempt. I would say the initial taste was slightly tolerable, but the impending  aftertaste is horrendous. I would liken the aftertaste to soap. Unfortunately I just bought a 5lb canister of this flavor. My goodness this is going to be a LONG wait till I finish this off.
 I've been using Optimum Nutrition Whey Protein for years and absolutely love it! Has all my protein, glutamine, and BCAA's that my body needs. The Extreme Milk Chocolate flavor tastes great. Btw, $49 for 5 pounds is a steal because they charge you $29 for 2 pounds, which means you save about $15 with the 5 pounds. Keep it up ON!!
 Works for me!
 Hard to be ON protein. Love the chocolate flavor more than the cake-batter.
 This is the best stuff.
 I've tried Whey Gold Standard before in the chocolate flavour but I have to say the Rocky Road flavour, which I tried this time instead, is much nicer. I usually mix it with a banana and some fat-free milk in a blender and it's so damn delicious! If you're looking for a chocolate flavoured protein shake then I highly recommend this one.
 Alway order this all the time.
 Good product. As advertised. Thank you. A+++++
 I've gotten great results from using this after workouts, and it tastes wonderful. Not too strong of taste, and it mixes super thin, so I haven't gotten sick of it after long periods of usage. Definitely gonna stick with this brand/flavor.
 French Vanilla taste great in a smoothie!
 It's a great source of protein although I didn't like the vanilla icecream, didn't taste good at all.
 Best protein on the market in my opinion.
 Grandson loves the flavor.
 Perfect protein powder.
 Feel full all morning and love the double chocolate flavor!
 Great product. I saved over $10 by ordering it on Amazon.
 The taste is very good when compared to other protein, and it is full of gains.
 I've always been a slim guy with a fast metabolism. I wasn't very athletic through my teens and didn't begin working out until I was about 18. Now I'm 28, I work quite often, and work out as hard as I can whenever I can. When I do have time to work out, this protein satisfies my body's need for a quick absorbing protein. It's delicious mixed with whole milk, and almost tastes like cookies and cream.<br/><br/>Since I work quite often, I haven't been able to work out as much lately. I have made some serious gains over the last few months that I really want to keep! Along with Optimum Nutrition gainer for breakfast, the gold standard whey provides me with a quick protein fix. I drink 3 scoops with 20 oz of whole milk each day around dinner time while I'm at work. This combined with my morning gainer shake, I have held my strength and size without losing any muscle gains, and it's been about 2 weeks since I've worked out. I'm fatigued because of work and lack of sleep, but as long as I hydrate, sleep, and eat at least one or two regular meals a day, I am continuing to see gains and am comfortably maintaining what I have while I have little time for the gym.<br/><br/>Two thumbs up, get this stuff. Don't trust the people at GNC or the vitamin shoppe, they are just trying to sell for commission.
 Super blendable. I like chocolate and coconut but this chocolate coconut is a bit of an acquired taste .. It's good by itself , I've also mixed it with pb and ice when I got bored with the flavor
 Ok
 Best solution on the market that i've had. That said it kinda sucked compared to what i was hoping<br/>Pros: High protein, kinda tasty<br/>cons: Tastes like old hot chocolate mix<br/>Protip: Mix it with peanut butter to make a delicious spoonful of deliciousness
 Made my farts clear a whole room, good stuff!
 by far my favorite protein shake
 makes great workout smoothies when used with almond milk and a frozen banana. :-)
 I've always purchased ON whey protein for years now. I ordered a 5lb tub of "delicious strawberry" and will never get this flavor again. It is bland and not very good at all and worst of all, it tastes like sour milk. The Rocky Road flavor I had previously is the best flavor I've tried yet.
 Really like to mix this one with a cheaper brand and give my protein shake more flavor and quality.  Plan to keep using it.
 The best protein powder I have ever used. I have tried multiple brands of protein and this is by far my favorite. It is a little pricier than others, but it packs a punch. It tastes great when mixed with milk and doesn't kill my appetite like some proteins I have used did.
 This is the best I've found on the market. It takes amazing! I put it in my smoothies. I add kale, bananas, chia seed, milk, peanut butter, and this powder for a power pack smoothie.
 Has a nasty chemical aftertaste, but after a while it disappears as the body gets used to it. Didn't even notice it when I got to the end. Doesn't stir very well, but I suppose I should make more than a few rounds with a spoon before drinking, so take that as you will. Good price, would buy again.
 The absolute best tasting protein powder on the market!
 They taste super good, I think it's a reliable brand, doesn't extremely affect to my digestive system. I would buy them again
 Excellent product! A+
 Just what the doctor ordered.
 Optimum Nutrition products tend to be the best for me at not producing gas. That is a good thing according to my wife. Easily absorbed by the body and digested. No problems on the stomach whatsoever. If your looking for a good protein isolate, give this one a shot.
 My favorite protein. The taste is smooth and doesn't upset my stomach like other cheap brands. My only complaint is that the price has continually risen over the past 2 years. May have to start looking for a cheaper alternative
 Doesn't get any better than Whey. But my maaaannn let me tell you...wash your shaker cup after you take your protein. Because if you leave this thing out after you drink it without cleaning it. This chocolate or whatever flavor this is will make you think something died it smells that bad. LOL Otherwise great product.
 This stuff tastes awesome and mixes so easy that you can do it with a spoon! Will buy again!
 I'm completely satisfied with this purchase. The tub was mostly full and it weighted 5.4lbs. The taste is great, a must buy if you're considering this flavor.
 With only 2gm of carbs and 24gm of protein this is great for you. As an added benefit it tastes great!!!
 I've tried chocolate coconut, which was wonderful. Now I have chocolate mint and it's ok but I feel like the menthol/mint that's in it irritates my stomach. Will definitely get the chocolate coconut again.
 I have never used protein shakes before so I wasn't sure what to expect.  I mixed a full scoop (double rich chocolate) with a 8oz glass of skim milk and stirred it for about 30 seconds.  It dissolved in the milk well enough so then I drank the concoction.  It reminded me of drinking chocolate milk made from the chocolate powder from when I was a kid!  It was sweet but not too sweet (just right).  This is going to be very easy to drink everyday.
 Quality Product. And so far my favortie flavor. I used to drink GNC fudge chocolate, which tastes somewhat acceptably disgusting.
 This is the best protein on the market! My husband and I are avid lifters and have been using this protein for years! This is the best, hands down in terms of growth and recovery! It doesn't hurt that it tastes great either!
 No flavor, does not mix well and leaves chunks. Dymatyze ISO 100 is way better for similar price.
 Too sweet, I won't buy it again, I loved the old formula.
 To my surprise, this whey protein dissolved very quickly in almond milk. The vanilla taste is subtle without overwhelming the food/drink that's been mixed with the protein powder. Low fat and carb content also helps.
 Tastes good even with water
 This is for the Cake Batter flavor.  I'm picky with the flavors I purchase, and usually stick with the rich chocolate from ON.  I decided to try this one, and am glad I did.  It tastes good, and just like other ON products, it mixes easily.  Wish the prices on whey would drop though.
 I wasnt expecialy fond of the double rich chocolate flavor. I do understand why as most prople that use this product DONT WANT extra sugars in thier system. After following the instruction I find that I am normaly hungry 30 mins later. I normaly mix a scoop of this with a spoon of peanut butter and half a pack of Met-RX for a much better tast and I stay full untill my next meal. I will buy again.
 Just wasn't a good product for me! Everyone is different though!
 Taste great! I've been using this product for years and enjoy the great taste. It tastes just like chocolate milk and I typically have one for breakfast to start the day. I also will have one on occasion after a long run or a tough workout as you should replenish on protein and rebuild torn muscles.
 16 oz of 2% milk, one gala apple, 2 bananas, 2 tablespoon of chunky peanut butter, one scoop of this protein mixed in the blender with some crushed ice and you got heaven in your mouth. Goodbye to sore muscles after the soccer game. It is intended for medium body trainers. People with extreme work out routines need to use casein protein instead. Casein is absorbed a lot faster.
 Hands down this is the best protein out there and I am sure 15000 other reviewers agree with me. I tried double chocolate, milk chocolate and cookies and cream till now and milk chocolate is my fav.
 My breakfast staple for great smoothies.  24grams of protein.  Love French Vanilla flavor.
 good flavour and good product - i am not sure if it helps my muscle to grow or something else - but i hope it does! :) i buy it because of TALE that ".... it helps and without it you would not get result...." and because of good rating ....:)) hope it worth of it and we do not just fool each other with good rates and comments
 Great taste
 Protein powder is great, other protein powders I've used clump pretty hard while mixing but this one doesn't seem to do so. Rocky Road tastes great, I recommend 1 scoop per 8 oz of milk though as doing more scoops per milk than that starts tasting a bit to sweet for my tastes.
 Ive had alot of proteins powder and ON is the best flavor and quality I've had ! This amazon price was the best on the net ! When your a serious weightlifter you know you can never have enough protein , and go thru it like water! The bag seals very well to retain flavor and quality as long as you make sure to re-seal it fully it will last til the end !
 Tasty Gainz for when I can't get in that meal or shove any kind of food in my face.
 Great protein.
 i JUST received this item, so i don't know how good it is as a supplement (i'm sure its great as far as what whey protein powders are supposed to do), but i had high expectations for the taste for some reason. all the reviews made it sound really tasty and it is top-rated on almost every website i checked. now, i LOVE food - cooking it, eating it, talking about it, so i consider my taste buds to be pretty accurate. well i guess i must be really spoiled by the protein powder sold at my gym, but i thought this stuff was bland, mineral-y, and left a weird aftertaste.<br/><br/>you might all be thinking, uh, isn't that all protein powders? well the brand sold at the gold's gym i go to (supplement Rx) is WAY tastier, tastes EXACTLY like chocolate milk when mixed with skim milk. although, i cannot find it anywhere outside the gyms (i'm guessing they have a contract) and it costs like $60 for about a lb less than this 5.5 lb tub. i was hoping i would like this stuff more, since it is cheaper and comes with more product. now i have 5 POUNDS of this bland stuff. maybe i just need to give it another chance, mix it with some milk (i did try it with just water initially). although, the golds gym stuff tastes awesome with even just water.<br/><br/>with a name like double chocolate, i guess i was just expecting too much. now i just have to get through these 5 lbs and go back to my old smaller more expensive but TASTIER tub.
 Cant go wrong with it
 great product
 Good stuff.
 GREAT, THANK YOU!!!
 When I use these daily they really worked. Helped me put on a lot of muscle mass.  Would recommend for anyone serious to working out
 Good stuff
 Good flavor, mixes instantly. I use this every day.
 Oh so tasty, but definitely not light on the calories!
 Awesome flavor great taste and mixes really well.
 Taste really good. Tastes very good if you use it with almond milk. Tastes exceptionally good if you use it with sweetened almond milk and fruits.
 Great protein supplement I use immediately after getting out of the pool after long hard workout. My coach recommended using a protein drink immediately after rigorous exercise. I believe that it truly helps my muscle recover. I am a 60+ female masters swimmer.
 This stuff is good! The only problems I've encountered with it is that the coffee flavor isn't very intense... and when mixing the powder with water (which is usually what I do) it ends up just tasting like watery coffee. However, I feel that using milk may make it less unpleasant, or perhaps stirring in some instant coffee with it. All in all, it's got all the good stuff, it just isn't "to-die-for" yummy.
 ive used whey for 2 years now. first time i ordered online though, it was great! lol.
 This is the best protein powder I've ever bought. It tastes good and not chalky at all. French Vanilla is the best but I've also tried Delicious Strawberry and it's good.
 Really good flavor on this one to make smoothies.
 I liked the taste of this one, it’s not as gritty/chalky or slimy. It mixes very well and isn’t overly sweet. However I use almond mix instead of regular milk or juices.
 Taste great and you'll need a shaker for this because using a spoon will not do and it wasn't really clear but it does come with a measuring cup. I got halfway through before I found it.
 Excellent!
 👍🏻
 There are a lot of servings in this thing which makes it so much more worth it. The coffee flavor is actually pretty good with some ice. I think I will be getting vanilla for now on so I can use it for recipes and a vanilla protein shake with a bit of cinnamon is my new go-to shake.
 This is a good price for a good product.  It tastes vaguely like vanilla ice cream, which is somewhat unnerving at first, in terms of subconscious urges to eat ice cream, but you get used to it quickly.  It goes nicely in lowfat milk, although if you use water it tastes fine.  I like using a shaker to mix it, but you can stir it and it is instantized so it mixes better than some other whey products.  If you have Prime it makes it a really good deal.
 My go to whey product. Have used this to make daily kale protein drinks for years and would recommend it highest based on flavor and performance. The Vanilla ice cream flavor is the best in my opinion.
 yummy! I haven't tried too many different powders so I can't say with a large amount of authority that this powder is the best around, but I really really like it and haven't felt the need to try other brands at all.
 Nothing better, then Optimum Nutrition 100% Gold  Whey!!!
 I bought the strawberry banana flavor. I was very surprised, because I had tried protein bars and such and I couldn't believe that protein shake could taste good, but it does. For the results, it is yet too soon to tell.
 This is the only chocolate protein I think I'll buy from now on. When you get it in the 5lb container, it is an expensive purchase at $50+. But there are over 70 servings in it at 24 grams of protein per. This is definitely not one of the higher protein powders out there, but the really good flavor and low calorie/sugar/fat ratios make up for it. Perfect mixed with milk or in smoothies, and honestly not that bad in water.
 I bought the double rich chocolate. It's delicious, no clumping and there is no strange after taste. I love it. The best protein I've bought so far.
 Great price, Drink a protein shake every morning. Make mine with water, skip breakfast, make a cup of coffee and I'm good till noon.
 This is my first trip down the whey protein line, am working on bulking by the way. After reading a lot of reviews here and knowing I am not the chocolate type, I gave the French vanilla creme a shot and went for the 5pound pack. Very nice taste and blends very well with my blender bottle( which  I also bought via amazon). You don't need to add any sweeteners as it's already sweet, just some cold water and you are good.
 lots of protein tastes horrible, this stuff is very good.  I mix it with just water.  It is better with milk, but higher in cal.  It mixes well with a blender bottle and doesn't clump.  I like it alot, on nutrition makes high quality products that are consistent.  This flavor is the best in my opinion.
 I really like this brand of whey protein.  I use it either with almond milk or 1% regular milk and it never disappoints.  It mixes well, tastes  great, and goes down very easy.  No digestive issues at all with this brand for me.  I have tried other brands in the past that really did a number on me so this was a welcome surprise.  Works well after a hard workout.  It has also helped to control my appetite when I need a late snack replacement.  After mixing it, let it sit in the fridge for 10 minutes at least and it will turn out best.
 I have done quite a bit of research and this is the cheapest, best tasting, fast acting whey on the market that I can find. It mixes easily and one of the best things I like about it is that it doesn't have any chemical sweeteners, and yet is sweet enough without. This is low cal, low/no fat, and very low (almost no) carb- almost pure protein- great for pre and post workout- and I take it with me everywhere I go on trips. I highly recommend this product.
 This is easy to mix, it doesn't remain clumpy like other brands. I also tastes great with Milk or Water. Because it is not my only source of protein, it would be impossible to truly know whether it is having a different effect than other proteins. We have to trust the manufacturer's statements for that analysis.
 Great product!!!
 excelente
 Simply it works and it tastes good, can’t go wrong with this stuff!
 Strawberry had little to no taste at all. Strange. I found this brand of strawberry had a much better (stronger) taste: CHALLENGER NUTRITION -100% Whey Protein Powder. STRAWBERRY.
 Purchased the Mocha Cappuccino, 5lbs. Arrived in 2 days, thank you Prime! Smell is terrible...however it tastes amazing! I could care less about the smell so this lovely product gets 5 stars! Would purchase again.
 Taste is great, real chocolate flavor
 I really like this stuff - tastes great and does not bother my very sensitive stomach.  Expensive though ...
 ordered the same flavor powder that i normally get from bodybuilder because amazon prime free shipping. the flavor was not the same, very weak tasting.
 Best protein powder in all respects.  I've been to the facility in Aurora, IL where this is made and I can tell you its the real deal; high quality stuff.
 This stuff is great! Tastes awesome and so healthy. Very happy with item and seller
 The mix is superb, and the taste is even better. I was skeptical about buying Banana Cream at first i was used to Chocolate flavors. However this flavor mixes better than the chocolate, and goes down smoother like chunkless thickless milk. taste great too.<br/><br/>ON is always a strong brand. Need i say more?
 Great product, great tasting and is everything I thought it would be.
 good
 Dissolves very easily and tastes amazing with anything that it is mixed in. It tastes so good sometimes I workout just to have an excuse to make a protein shake with this product. I love it.
 One if the best tasting protein drink out there thats easier to mix vs the brands at walmart.
 Thanks very much!
 I drink protein shakes just to include more protein in my diet, I don't really work out, but this has to be the best protein shake I have ever tried and I've tried around 4-5 different brands of chocolate protein powder.
 Love ON whey protein. Good taste and the easiest mixing protein powder I have tried. Many flavors to choose from.
 good product tastes good too
 My forever protein.  Milk chocolate and French vanilla
 Tastes great. Good source of protein. Usual ON Quality. 5/5
 Packaged great by Amazon, no leakage. Container was factory sealed. Tried one scoop with a glass of 1% milk and it tasted great!
 You won't find a better value, and the taste is great!
 Tastes great, and you can't beat that price delivered to your door.
 I have used this product for about 5 years and am 100% satisfied with the results. It tastes great and I feel like this product has helped me recover after workouts. I have recommended this product to others I was training. I have tried a lot of protein supplements and I stuck with this one and will continue to do so.
 Tastes great!  Drink it every day after a work out..
 Delicious taste, my go-to favorite
 This is hands down the best Protein I've ever had. I got massive on this (in a good way, all lean muscle) and it helps me maintain my size. I literally bulked up on this with minimum fat gains. This also goes with dieting and a lot of exercise, so it's not only this supplement that changes your body to the body you want.<br/><br/>I always repurchase this protein shake with this brand.
 I have gone through 20 lbs of ON Mocha Cappuccino flavor over the past 2 years. Great product, I never get tired of the taste. I add dextrose and maltodexterin with a scoop of ON Mocha Cappuccino for an intra/post workout shake.<br/><br/>With 71 servings per 5 lbs and using 1 scoop per workout, 4 workouts a week, one 5 lbs container lasts me about 4.5-5 months. Great value.
 Taste good
 I don't even use milk and it still tastes just fine leaves a nasty smell in shaker bottles but putting it in the dish washer, using dish soap and baking soda will take care of the smell. Washing out with water even hot isn't enough.<br/><br/>Update: I've tried some different protein powders since this one and I have to say that the best tasting one so far is Proto Whey Choc.
 didn't like the taste at all. had to switch back to SYNTHA.
 Love this protein. Mixes very well. The chocolate malt is fantastic. The strawberry is great. The mocha cappuccino is actually pretty good too. Good amounts of protein, low suger, low calories,  low carbs. Perfect combination! And amazon always has the best price.
 Received it quicker than expected ( 2 days free shipping.) I actually ate a spoonful of it this morning just to try the taste and see what it would go well with. And it tasted like milk powder. As a person who used to eat milk powder for fun I literally couldn't taste anything other than milk powder except for a slight vanilla taste. If that is really the flavor than that's great I can add flavor to it no problem . If the whey powder has been replaced with milkpowder then I might have a problem. So if anyone knows what milk powder tastes like and has tried this please lmk .
 as advertised
 Best tasting protein drink ever tried many and will be getting this again love the strawberry / banana one tastes so good you don't even have to add sugar or fruits it's good all by itself lot cheaper on Amazon also thank you! ;)
 I definitely recommend this product, the flavor excellent, sugar almost nothing, you should really try it , won't be disappointed 💪👌
 Love this protein for morning breakfast. This flavor is very very sweet though so if you aren't into sweet flavors I would chose a different flavor.
 A tad better than the average protein supplement. I am going to try the JYM Mass next.
 I love it. Goes into almost anything. Really helps fill the gaps in my protein intake.
 My first 2 buys went great with no issues, the one with strawberry has a different sweetener (sucralose). Watch out for that one, it might ruin the day for people around you :)
 Been using ON products exclusively mostly. It does the job. I mix it with my smoothie every morning. Tastes great (chocolate ones are the best). Vanilla ice cream and vanilla don't taste as good as the chocolate ones.
 Ever since I started taking this stuff I have become a beast.  I can now lift cars and pick up supermodels.<br/><br/>In all seriousness I do like this protein for it's shorter than normal list of ingredients. And it has been effective.  I normally prefer vanilla flavor to chocolate but in the case of ON Whey protein go for the chocolate.
 Love this protein shake after work out. Nice price per pound and good quality..
 They changed the formula.  Don't waste you're money on this.
 Great product, better to buy in bulk. Too bad its the same cost per pound no matter what size, but we go through a lot with our gym schedule. buying 1-4 lb bags saves $0. Make sure you buy from this supplier, cant beat Prime shipping.
 Consistency and quality of protein powder are good. Less powdery than others I've used and does not have sour milk smell afterward when I go to wash my Blender Bottle. I don't like chocolate coconut flavor: tastes artificial and not chocolaty in a good way
 This tastes so good with almond milk and a bit of ice in the blender! Seriously easy to drink. With that said, I can even drink it with water in a shaker in a pinch. No weird chemically taste. Hands down my new chocolate protein. Been replacing 2 small meals daily with it for weight loss and its working great!
 I've bought this before and will buy it again. I mix mine in milk. Great taste especially when you add some ice cream and make a whey shake.
 Optimum Nutrition Gpld 100 % Whey is the best tasting power protein drink mix that I have found. 60mg. of protein in one glass. The product mixes easily with water, but I prefer non-fat milk and some ice in a mixer. The taste is great. Many flavors - I like to mix Milk Choc..or Double Choc.  with the Vanilla Ice cream mix. Yum !  Great for Gastric ByPass patients to get your protein fast.  Online price is good too !
 Good stuff.  Supposedly one of the better protein powders on the market.  Low in carbohydrate, which is nice.<br/><br/>The double rich chocolate flavor is my favorite. I mix it with skim milk and look forward to drinking it.  It's not too sweet and tastes like regular (artificially sweetened) chocolate milk.
 Stick with chocolate which tastes great. Wanted to try Rocky Road and it sucks unless you like artificial tasting marshmallows in your shakes.
 Do you life heavy things and put them down again? Then this is for you. Good price , good taste, and all the numbers you want to see, low sugar , high protein gram per serving etc etc
 Strong protein. really had effect on me. even with little but intense workout and with help of this protein I gained about 10 Kgs in 3 months (from 65 to 75). Can work much better with other supplements.
 There is not a better protein product on the market today IMHO. Great flavor and it mixes perfect. Never get left with chucks or grainy after taste. I personally think Chocolate is the best flavor and it's my go to flavor but I also have Vanilla, Strawberry Banana and Double Chocolate in the cupboard to keep it interesting.
 Great taste and it keeps me full. I use it in my smoothies as a meal replacement
 I don't want to say this stuff tastes good, but as far as whey protein, it tastes great and is by far the best I've tried. Not very good with water, but it's still better than the other flavors. Tastes great with milk and even juice. If you haven't found a flavor you like, definitely try this one.
 Not bad
 You can never go wrong when ON goes on sale on amazon.  Great tasting and a quality protein.
 obsviously this is great protein for working out and rebuilding your muscles.  the only thing i would watch out for is what time you are going to order/receive this by shipment.  i ordered mine in a hot week and I received it really hot and warm inside.  im not sure if it was a problem but u'll be better off getting this from a place like gnc; though they too might might receive their products in the conditions i did depending on the weather
 this whey protein contains whey protein
 good
 Item came on time and well protected. Product is excellent and is exactly what was advertised.
 Tastes pretty good but a bit difficult to dissolve in water
 Product taste great. Vanilla ice cream taste better than expected. Mixes very well with just a shaker cup. Container was clean and package very well. I will buy this product again.
 Love the flavor. I never used regularly enough to see results or benefit of combining with exercise. But I still really enjoy the flavor when I do use the product.
 Only brand I buy now. I mix up the flavors but stick with the brand. I even buy it for my daughter because I know is great ingredients.
 Great taste! Wish they would either fill up the jar more or send it in a smaller jar. The jar is very large but only about 1/2 full...
 The taste is not very good compared to other brands on the market which is especially true when mixing with water (making it undrinkable). Other brands like Muscle Milk that don't require milk may be more expensive but the amount of milk you have to buy in order to make this (especially for soy milk drinkers like myself) actually costs you more in my opinion.
 ON products are always reliable. That said, this tastes pretty good when mixed with just water. I love mint chocolate chip ice cream so the mint taste wasn't over bearing or too minty at all.  I took one star off BC it was difficult for me to mix it with other components like fruit with this flavor opposed to what I typically drink which is the extreme chocolate flavor. Also, I got used to the taste and couldn't bare any longer BC of my inability to find good mixes that are low in calorie while tasting great.
 I have been using this brand for years now. Nothing compares to it. I will forever use Gold Standard Whey. The Chocolate one is amazing
 Great product.  The taste is good and it dissolves in water quickly without any grainy residue.  I've tried other protein powders that needed to be put in the blender, but this was not the case.  I can just use a spoon. I would buy this product again.
 good
 Recommended this Whey Protein for those who require a substanstial amount of protein in their diet. I bought 5 lbs of this product when i began my weightlifting journey back in December and so far it haas really helped my progress, I take it especially after working out to aid in recovery. IMO Optimum Nutrition has made the best protein Good taste, Good consistency, Good price ftom amazon, makes a Great Product.
 To be clear, there is nothing wrong with this product and we certainly like it. It contains whey which turns out being harmful to many folks so we went more organic vegetable based protein powder.
 The better whey protein in can get in the market. This satisfies all your expectations and you would find results quickly.  I love Optimum Nutrition and I expect to can get it always.
 I think this is the best protein for the price. I mix it with almond milk and I don't get bloated at all compared to other brands. I recommend the milk chocolate flavor if you like chocolate.
 this is my standard go to Protein. Mixes fast and tastes very good. No grittiness, no aftertaste, and a really nice deep chocolate taste and smell. Hard to go wrong with this one. One of the few products I go back to everytime I run out.
 I have tried many whey protein products, and this is the best combination of nutritional content (not many carbs), great taste, and a reasonable price. I use a heaping scoop on top of yogurt every morning, but it is also easy to shake into a beverage.  Chocolate Malt is my favorite flavor, but Double Rich Chocolate and Vanilla Ice cream are not bad either.  (Stay away from the banana!!)
 Use 2-3 times a week
 Best protein hands down! mixes easy in shaker cup no clumping EVER! the taste is great mixed with water. My favorite flavors have been milk chocolate and chocolate peanut butter. Now for  the effectiveness: Its great, doesn't cause bloat. and is effective love it!!
 I don't know and say anything about the quality since I don't know how to compare different products. One thing that I can compare is the taste and I have to say it is not as good as everyone is talking about. It is OK and it doesn't taste bad. But it doesn't taste great either. I have tried Walmart brands too, and they definitely taste better.
 I always went with optimum for protein, though recently I've been experiencing Steatorrhea, which is Greasy soft stool and I read that they changed from a natural sweetener to a splenda sweetener. After I stopped Taking the supplement my stool went back to normal. I read online that Splenda sweeteners can kill good bacteria in your gut, and I probably will never buy this protein again, unless they go back to the old formula. If you are planning o taking this protein try getting a few sample packets, and if you're fine then try it but if you start experiencing stomach discomfort then I wouldn't spend 60 Bucks on a full jug.<br/><br/>Though if you are still going to try it, my all time favorite flavor was the mocha. Defiantly the best flavor, and you wont get tired of it. But I have not tried a flavor that I didn't even like, so I am sure if you want to try a certain flavor it will probably be very good as well.
 Best protein ever, period. What makes it even better is their large selection of flavors.
 Great product, wasn't a fan of the flavor so much--also tried to mix it in with my oatmeal and it clumped up a bit.  I ended up mixing it with other flavors, like chocolate protein or peanut butter to break up the flavor.
 My husband and I have been purchasing this product for over two years and we love it! The plethora of flavors available is great and our favorites are chocolate and cappuccino. I have mixed mine with ice and fruit for a smoothie. I would say both of us have seen noticeable gains when paired with our high intensity lifting. For the price, this is a fabulous choice for a protein powder.
 my wife loves it
 love this protein
 Tastes like monkeys ass if u only mix it with watter and the price is just too high. For example bulksups sells 1kg  of whey protein (33 servings, 23 grams of protein every 0serving) for 20$, when on sells 1kg (30 servings, 24 grams of protein every serving) for 30$. why would i buy this anymore...
 Dissolves well . Got rich chocolate. Maybe should try xtreme chocolate milk next time. Eaas chococolate tastes  better but doesn't Dissolve as well
 Awesome
 Strawberry Bannana - ehh it's okay.<br/><br/>Good price for the amount of powder you get - just make sure it is a flavor you like!
 Great product have bought many over the years.
 This is an excellent protein powder. It tastes great and you don't need to add too much water. You can also use it with things like fruits and veggies to make a smoothie and it adds a nice sweet flavor to it. Also the price is great for such a large size. I recommend this product to everyone
 I’ve had many different proteins and I like this one but it tastes a little too rich for me. It does the job
 I love this product and use it daily.  It keeps my energy even and it takes the edge off of sugar cravings and crashes.  It also tastes to good that I get that little hit of sweetness without the additives....great product!
 Tastes good, blends well. Lots of protein (about 75% by mass) and almost zero sugars. It's a great supplement.
 The taste is not there. Syntha-6 Isolate tastes better than this brand.
 Great powder for the price.  I have alternated between this and the sny 6 for many years.  this is the best value and has more servings but sometimes I like to switch it up.  Can't go wrong with this powder.
 I love it, bought in bigger package next time
 Does not compare in taste and quality to other Whey products I have used
 The Vanilla ice cream flavor is delicious, on a weight loss regimen this helps to keep protein high while feeling like you're getting a cheat meal/dessert at the same time. Can't say enough good things about ON Whey.
 I'm a runner. Not a body builder. I was looking for a protein supplement because I felt like I wasn't getting enough protein as I ramp up my mileage training for a marathon. I wanted something that was pretty much just whey protein to help me recover from the training. Not a lot added stuff claiming to do things I don't really care about. ON Gold Standard is the closest I could find with a reasonable price. It really is a good product. It tastes good, its high in protein but doesn't have as much sugar, carbs, and salt as some others. I add it to milk and shake it in my blender bottle and its that simple. On Saturdays I'll add some cold coffee to the milk and protein for a little extra taste and pick-me-up after a long morning run. If you want a high quality protein without all the additives, this is a good one. I can't speak to other flavors, but the french vanilla cream is good. I'll stick with that. I can always mix it up by adding coffee, chocolate, or whatever else I find.
 Kids are in soccer, and wanted to make sure they get enough protein in their diet.  They love the rocky road flavor (and normally only put about 1/2-3/4 amount suggested because I'm just trying to supplement an 11 &amp;12 year old without adding sugar)
 No complaints. Exactly what I expected. I only use this kind.
 Really solid whey. I really love most ON products I've ever used. This flavor is pretty tasty. In regards to the protein, I can be a little sensitive to some whey (bloated, etc.), but this is pretty clean.
 I've been buying this protein for three years and I've never had a problem. This protein tastes great (Double Rich Chocolate), and it mixes perfectly in my shaker bottle. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for some straight up good whey.
 First time user, and the flavor is great and zero side effects.  I take with water only, but I know it would be even better with milk.
 At stores this product has been sold over 100 dollars. i buy most of my supplements online and this is by far the best product i have used to date. I have gained 30 lbs and gained size in just one year of using this product alone. worth your money.
 Thanks
 wery good product,taste is very good.i was use this 1 mounth .i can't say this product gives me avarage result but it is normal.more better than normal. LIKE
 My favorite protein powder at a great price.
 Really like it  there is so grit after taste keeps me full for 4 to5 hours  .I add a banana , Berries ,coconut water ,flax meal .great value I was laughing when the box was at my door it was huge I have ordered other shakes this one is the best so far .i think I'm going to stick with it . Oh and I work out for two hours ever morning and it keeps me satisfied .
 Nice taste
 I have had the double chocolate flavor previously which was really good.  This is no different. It mixes well, is high quality, and tastes great without all the extra sugar and carbs.  The Mocha Cappuccino flavor is even better than the double chocolate and actually mixing the two is even better if possible.
 You honestly won't believe you're drinking protein powder if you mix it. Even mixes with straight water (tolerable but not recommended).<br/><br/>Someone on Reddit was testing a bunch of powders on the market and this one comes very close to the actual advertised amount of protein. Most didn't so you may want to look around before buying these powders.
 our youngest son wanted this and he uses it daily
 I'm very satisfied with the ON Gold Standard whey protein powders.  The Double Rich Chocolate flavor is what you'd expect and just tastes like chocolate with no funny aftertaste or hints of artificial sweeteners.  It has a good percentage of protein by weight without a lot of empty calories.
 We love this product many benefits
 Flavor makes me want to gag.  DO NOT BUY VANILLA. Stick to double chocolate
 High quality, easy mixing, no issues. Still the standard.
 Great stuff. I always get the gold standard. Many flavors and of quality amino acids. All 9 essential.
 The mint chocolate flavor is wonderful.  I mix the stuff with water and its extremely drinkable.  Excellent quality ingredients, minimal artificial sweeteners, and does wonders expediting the muscular healing process after intense gym sessions.  On top of all that, the price is amazing if you buy the large size tubs.
 I regret not buying this brand of protein. I bought strawberry in another brand and the other brand tastes so synthetic. Cookies and cream flavor with ON is prime.
 Well obviously the moment I bought this I bulked up.  I made so many muscles I had to buy a new house to store all my new weight equiptment from all the lifting I would be doing.<br/>  The flavor is nice, makes me remember my childhood.<br/><br/>#WHEY!
 ON protein has been the one consistent brand I've used with great results. The product is a solid choice for anyone who is interested in adding supplements to their diet. Their products have the perfect combination of being cost effective and of high quality.
 Great test, high Quality Protein
 Good taste and you get good results
 Tastes great and feels like it does what it’s supposed to. I drink it after I work out
 Love this! Great taste, mixes super fast and dosent require gorilla scoops to get you daily recommend allotment. This is my second tub of this,and will return for more.
 Best protein on the market
 I LOVE this flavor. (Cake Batter)  I'll drink a shake, and I immediately want more.  Even better, it mixes well with other flavors. I've made a double shake, Cake Batter and Chocolate Milk,  its great.
 Not as tasty as the GNC AMP double chocolate, but gets the job done.
 Makes a great addition to my smoothies and a great post work out drink, ice cubes skim milk, tastes like a vanilla shake.
 Delicious creamy chocolate. One of the best I have tasted. Very little grit especially when blended in a blender. Even when shaken in a shaker bottle, the texture is decent, just not milkshake quality as when you blend with some ice. Chocolate flavor is good.
 This protein is the best tasting I've ever had. It mixes easily in the blender or just with milk using my blender bottle. The vanilla creme also goes with most fruits (strawberries, blueberries, bananas, etc). I usually purchase the 2 lb tubs, but the 5 lb ended up being a better deal. Definitely recommend this flavor and brand. Good shipping too, arrived in 2 business days (using my Prime account).
 So delicious!
 wanted to try different flavors and this one is one of my favorites now. i bought the cake batter before this and it wasn't so great :( i did finish it though, wasn't going to let $60 go to waste. but the cookies and creme is definitely great! i love it because its sweet and i have such a sweet tooth.
 I was recommended this brand of whey protein by my family members. It is a delicious flavor and is a great workout recovery drink! I like to mix it with unsweetened almond milk or whole milk - it tastes just like a creamy chocolate milk drink. My husband mixes it with just water and he also loves it. We will continue to purchase this whey protein!
 Any review that says this flavor tastes like chocolate YooHoo is totally correct.  I've never tried any protein mixes before this and I'm sold enough not to want to try other flavors.  Started with a 2 pound, purchased the 5..
 I love this protein powder. Not only do I use if for my workouts, I use it throughout the day if I get hungry. It does not taste overwhelmingly chocolatey if you just mix it with water. I usually drink this post workout and sometimes as a quick protein boost.<br/><br/>The best smoothie:<br/>-frozen banana<br/>-scoop of this powder<br/>-2 tbsp of peanut butter<br/>-about 3/4 c almond milk<br/><br/>Blend those up and enjoy.
 Great product and arrived fast
 I hate sweet protein, this is good. Not too sweet and great flavor. Doesn't taste like i'm downing cake batter. Not my default flavor but this is really good flavor. A nice change from double chocolate!
 It's good. Mixes well.
 best price for high quality whey
 Very tasty
 My go-to protein powder
 The wrong flavor was delivered.  The actual flavor was different than the invoice and the sticker on the lid.  Can't send it back because don't want to go without.
 Cheaper than Body Building because if you have  Amazon prime you get free shipping.<br/>I usually get the vanilla and chocolate. I prefer chocolate though.
 The best-tasting whey protein I've ever had (the Double Rich Chocolate flavor specifically). I keep it at my desk at work and fill up my shaker before leaving for the gym, and my coworkers even say it smells amazing when I open the tub. Also, it has surprisingly low fat and carbs, even compared to the "lean whey" my sister uses.
 ON 100% Whey is one of the best. I am becoming a big fan of ON products. The quality you get for the price is phenomenal. 5.5 grams Bcaa in every scoop, 4 grams of glutamine, 11 grams EAA's total. Its really low carb at 3 grams. It does contain artificial flavors (this doesnt bother me but I know some people shy away from them).  The taste is great when compared to other protein powders on the market. I've tried Choc Malt, Double Rich Choc, Cake Batter and Cookies &amp; Cream. They are all great but Cake Batter gets old pretty quick when having 5 pounds of it.
 Oh my God! FINALLY a protein shake that does not taste like a protein shake! Tastes great with milk or water. IF you use milk it tastes EXACTLY like chocolate milk! This may be the best discovery ever! I accidentally ordered 2 of these tubs and was planning on returning one of them. Heck no, it's mine.....ALL MINE!
 New to protein drinks but after several reviews I decided this was the one. It tastes like a so-so chocolate drink. Do not expect it to be delicious but ok for a meal replacement drink.
 Good sample size. Taste ok. I am very picky and this wasnt too bad. Good choice if you are on the fence about which flavor to choose.
 I've been drinking protein shakes for about a year now and first I'd like to say that so far, ON has been the best that I've found nutritional wise for the value. I'm sure there's others out there that compare or may even be better but I've been sticking with this brand for a while now.<br/><br/>I haven't tried all the flavors yet but my favorite is Vanilla Ice Cream! I'd rank the ones I've tried from best to worst as Vanilla Ice Cream, White Chocolate, French Vanilla Creme and then lastly Cookies &amp; Cream. I'd say about 90% of the time, I've purchased Vanilla Ice Cream. Whenever I start to get tired of it, I try a new flavor and then go back to it. Lol Cookies &amp; Cream was awful though. We ended up mixing it with Vanilla Ice Cream to get rid of it and we still celebrated when we were done with it... the last shake may have had a rock/ paper/ scissors match to see who got stuck with it and who got the first shake from the flavor we actually like.<br/><br/>If you don't know if you like a flavor or not, I wouldn't suggest buying the big 5 pound tub or even the 3 pound tub if you aren't good at forcing down flavors you don't like. However, if you know you like it, the 5 pound tub is the way to go. It's a great value and chances are, you're going to end up buying more anyway.<br/><br/>If and when I try more flavors, I'll edit my review.
 Really great protein powder, truly one of the best I've tried. I will be a repeat buyer on this one.  I always buy vanilla, because it's more versatile for everything I do with it: shakes, protein pancakes, overnight oats, and other recipes.  Vanilla ice cream flavor is just a step above what I was expecting.  The smell of this when I opened it...AMAZING!  Easy mixing and great macros: 120 calories, 1 fat, 3 carbs, and 24 protein for 1 serving (31 grams).  Also, there are 73 servings in this, so the price break down is phenomenal for quality protein.<br/><br/>Thought I'd share an amazing protein pancake recipe I make almost every day:<br/>1/2 c. cottage cheese<br/>1/2 c. oats<br/>1/2 scoop (16 grams) vanilla protein powder<br/>splash of vanilla extract<br/>2-3 egg whites<br/><br/>Mix in blender, cook on skillet, DONE!  Fast and easy and tastes amazing.
 The best protein around. Nothing beats this protein. It mixes so well, doesn't leave any plumps behind, and tastes amazing. I absolutely love the mocha flavor. On the other hand, if you want something that is not so sweet (because most of the flavors are on the sweet side), get the strawberry banana flavor, it is very very tasty, and not at all sweet.
 Best tasting protein
 It's ok.
 This stuff is amazing! I have looked far and wide for some affordable protein in whey isolate form. The cake batter had mixed reviews when i looked it up...that was 3 orders ago. I love this stuff and use it every day. It goes great with fruit or chocolate. The best is when you mix it with peanut butter! It tastes exactly like Reese's Puffs cereal! SOOOOOOOOO GOOOOD!
 Nothing about the protein seems to stand out to me, so seeing as it has many equals and several superiors I'll just say the chocolate malt flavor doesn't impress. Rating because I know we all look for tasty options. Maybe another flavor would up my rating, but I won't know until I try them.
 Have tried 3? flavors of Gold Standard now,<br/><br/>French Vanilla - It's OK, drinkable, not my favorite.<br/>Mocha - Outstanding, have bought a few of these.  Drink them straight, or with a banana/peanut butter blended.<br/>Milk Chocolate - OK, wouldn't buy again.  Just a bit boring.
 Compared to NitroTech this stuff is terrible, hardly noticed a difference in strength and definition.
 This a high quality protein and easy on the stomach :) Excellent stuff. I have been using On's 100% whey since about a year now and I highly recommend this product over anything else out there on the market with the best ratio of ingredient. I love the double rich chocolate tastes like heaven, easily mixes with milk/water and leaves no stomach bloating etc. Get the 10lb bag and save$$$$
 I have tried other powders such as EAS, GNC, etc. This is by far the best and easiest to mix. I use a blender bottle to make sure is mixed well but forgot it one day and just put some in bottle water which worked with no lumps. Great protein too, 24grams in 1 scoop! Also taste is much better than others I have had. French Vanilla creme has the creme aftertaste which I am not a huge fan of (even with rootbeer), but still much better taste than other name brands. Will try chocolate next.
 Really good protein.  It is easy to blend and it has a good taste.  I drink it mixed with water and sometimes with milk.  I also add it to my smoothies and my oatmeals.  Their both chocolate and vanilla flavor taste really good.
 The Vanilla Ice Cream has great flavor.  Perfect for right after a workout.  Smooth consistency.
 Fast delivery ... Quality product...will buy again!
 The taste is alright, not the best. The nutritions are great with low fat, low sugar, and good amount of protein. I probably wouldn't buy this flavor again but the gold standard brand proteins are always one of the best.
 Item is exactly as described, tastes delicious, and provides the additional protein I need without overloading on carbohydrates and sugar.
 Great flavor. Doesn't taste chalky like a lot of others that I have used. Makes for a good snack when you're having a "sweet tooth" craving as well. I mix mine with Almond Coconut milk or Soy Milk - both of which taste great.
 Exactly what I needed and expected!
 Give off a really nice aroma and taste pretty good. Mix this with ice, a banana, and some peanut butter, you got yourself a nice afternoon snack. Also I noticed I don't get as sore as I used to, but also been making a lot of progress since I've been taking this.
 I really like this product although I'll try to go for a natural protein powder on my next order.  They call it natural but I didn't realize it has Sucralose, an artificial sweetener.  I make smoothies that are naturally sweetened with blueberries, strawberries and bananas, so I don't need the extra, artificial sweetener.  I had no idea when I ordered this that they added this.
 great product and a good price!
 Delicious, dissolves easily, and is the best protein deal I've found for the price. I've ordered 3 canisters so far and I don't think I'll ever switch.
 I LOVE this stuff for 3 reasons:<br/><br/>1. Taste--- blend it with ice and you've got a slushie that tastes great! It goes down easy and keeps you full. Low in fat and carbs, too!<br/><br/>2. Quality--- tried lots of big name companies and this one is hands down the best. This truly gave me GREAT results. I'm in the best physical shape of my life. I put on more than 5 pounds of muscle in the past 1 1/2 months! And helped me get shredded at the same time.<br/><br/>3. Price--- hard to beat the price for what you're getting. This company doesn't blow its dollars on lots of advertising and instead uses it more wisely on R&amp;D.<br/><br/>I was drinking the strawberry flavored one but recently tried vanilla ice cream and wow!... things just got better! I love the taste and found me something new. As expected the results haven't changed (which works for me). I recommend this to all my friends. If you gave it a try you won't be disappointed.
 My son recommended this to me for building muscle after workout.  The flavor is great, it blends well and packs a lot of protein!  I recommend it highly.
 ON 100% whey is the only whey protein i buy and recommend it to everyone i know.<br/>It is great tasting and mixes very well. No lumps and no awful after taste.<br/><br/>This cake batter is a little sweeter than most other flavors but stil enjoyable.<br/><br/>You cant beat Amazons pricing.
 In my opinion, this is one of the best values for whey protein you can get. I always buy this brand, vanilla tastes great.
 It tastes good and it can be blended with anything easily. I like it and i bought it 3 times already.<br/><br/>I recommend it.
 The Strawberry banana flavor from ON's line of whey protein has been the worst so far. This is mainly because it doesn't seem to mix well. I've had other flavors mix perfectly or near perfectly just when using a spoon. This flavor, for some reason, only fully dissolves when i use a blender, which is way too inconvenient. But on the bright side, this is still the best whey protein, regardless of how clumpy the mixture could get. But it's better to get a different flavor like vanilla cream (which also doesn't have as much cholesterol or sucralose in it).
 after reading other reviews about the sweetener, it does leave a aftertaste but after a few drinks, you wont really notice it.
 I liked the flavor and the effect of this protein powder. I was using it as a diet supplement to help with weight loss and it was working. Then,  found out I couldn't consume it because of the whey. Bummer.
 Good clean protein. Not the cheapest but you get what you pay for with Gold Standard.
 My favorite protein right now (using the last 4 years).  Even if I drink Skim Milk, it still taste great.  Don't see myself getting another protein shake for awhile.<br/><br/>Pros:  Taste great<br/><br/>Cons: Pricey :(
 In my opinion this is the best protein out there because this is cheapest protein if you buy in bulk and its high quality whey protein. That is why I only buy the 10 pound bags because you're going to eventually run out and you save $ in the long run. Also, i put on like 10 pounds of muscle in the first 6 weeks i started taking this protein.
 I have tried a few different whey protein supplements out on the market and this is the one that I keep coming back to. I think it is one of the better tasting ones out there. I did like BSN's whey protien to supplement and thought it tasted better than this but for the price and the amount of protein you get per scoop, you can not beat this product. Optimum nutrition mixes so easily and the double chocolate, rocky road, and cookies n' cream taste wonderful. I usually just throw some water in a cup and add a scoop and stir it. Mixes well and barely leaves any clumps. Also, the supplement is very effective when it comes to reaching your goals. I usually go to the gym about 3-4 times a weak and lift fairly heavy. The gains with this supplement have been great. It's not a miracle supplement but it sure does what it is supposed to in terms of fueling your stressed out muscles with fast protein and BCAA's. Also makes a great snack for when you are hungry or can not get actual protein from food. Low and fat and calories.
 this makes me feel great in the morning. its coffee flavor still takes great when mixed with just water, but milk makes it more wintery morning mix. also, hot water makes it taste like coffee/hot chocolate and makes it dissolve quicker btw
 ON is the best whey protein out there... Best flavor I have tried is Chocolate and Coconut... LOVE IT!  Rocky road is good... But the other is the best!  (Product is superior, plenty of reviews how good this protein is, so I am just sticking to the flavor review)
 Pretty decent product when it is actually as it should be.  Too bad when I got a batch of the stuff that was utterly disgusting (HORRIBLY clumpy as if moisture got into the bottle and it tasted REVOLTING) the company wanted me to wait a month to hear back from them with a chance of me not even getting a replacement.  Yeah, that's not happening, they just lost a customer.  This is no way for a business to treat it's loyal customers.
 I have tried a lot of different types of protein on the market and I always get disappointed and come back to this stuff. You know why? Because it taste great, has what I need to throw around the iron, and is one of the best proteins out there. It mixes very easily. I tend to mix a little water in it. Doesn't have a nasty after taste like many products out there. Very smooth. When I first tried this flavor way back, I thought it was simply a spin off of the Vanilla flavor but it really is more like cake batter when you get a few sips into it. Throw some milk in it for a truly amazing taste. I'm on the run and just use water. If a protein tastes great just mixing it with water, has the best ingredients, and is produced by one of the best companies out there, then you know it is worth buying. Don't get fooled by XYZ's new ad for the newest protein on the market. Just go with this. You will love it.
 Love the taste. Dissolved fine.
 Tastes fantastic with milk.  Tastes gross with water.
 JFast delivery. Product arrived without any problems
 Great!
 Good flavor mixes well
 This is such a good flavor t it’s not chunky. Be prepared to have a lot of shake because this is huge!
 I drink this in skim milk post-lifting or running. It is pretty good in milk, but I didn't like it as much as their Milk Chocolate version. It is a little expensive, but worth it for me as supplements have less regulation through the FDA. This product appears to have undergone more extensive regulation and quality control than other products on the market.
 It tastes great, and works very well. It has by far surpassed my expectations. I bought it to increase my vertical jump and before the powder it took me three MONTHS to gain 6 inches, with the powder it has taken three WEEKS to gain 3 inches!! And I have still have about 70% of the servings left!
 The best protein hands down. Very low carbs, dissolves easily in water without a blender bottle. Love the chocolate mint flavor and have reordered several times. Can't ever go wrong with Optimum Nutrition whey.
 Excellent
 I take about 2 shakes, 2 scoops each almost every day. Have put on a ton of good weight with this protein. Good stuff, good price.. As long as you're putting in work at the gym.
 If you're gonna workout, this jawn is useful. Highly recommended.
 I use this ALL the time in my Whey Protein Bars recipe and smoothie recipes.  I've been eating the bars for years and this is the only whey protein I use.  So much more of a value through Amazon versus GNC!  I highly recommend this product!!
 I've tried 2 other protein supplements, namely the GNC chocolate mix and ANS. Both weren't bad, but for the price aren't the greatest deal. ON gives great value for the price that others can't match. Supplements can be expensive, so it really helps when someone can find that equilibrium. Not to mention, it does taste pretty good. I drink mine with skim milk which gives it the perfect thickness and taste.
 Great Product. Came as Advertised. I have ordered this many times and it has been pretty consistent thus far. Would recommend getting this brand of protein if you are looking for some! Great Tasting and as someone who lifts regularly, I recommend this as a great supplement to your diet.
 The protein is great, the ingredient profile is exactly what anyone should look for. I buy the 10lb bags of chocolate. They've recently switched the seal from an internal push to lock, to an external ziplock. the new zip is faulty and I had to pour this into my old bag pain in the a$$. anyway. please go back to the old bag!
 great product,use it all the time,years
 Used this protein several times during my early years of training, it never fails to feed me the protein I needed after intense lifting. You won't go wrong with ON's protein.
 The Optimum whey protein is a very good product.  I like the taste.  I thought I was getting 100% protein isolate but when I received the the product I noticed that the second ingredient is protein concentrate.  I have a sensitivity to milk products but this product has not bothered me.
 Great product servings pay for themselves a little expensive but I can use this much longer because the protein per scoop and size is not huge.  Will buy more when. It goes on sale got about a month supply left
 The gold standard for protein. Cannot go wrong with this product. Great taste! Husband loves it.
 Very impressed with the wonderful strawberry flavor! It even taste great in my coffee with coconut oil and grass-fed butter. Best of all, the amount of protein is awesome! Can't wait to try more flavors!
 This stuff has really helped me with my turnover from working out. Cookies and Cream tastes pretty good and even better when mixed with the Extreme Chocolate. The only thing I wasn't too fond of is that they add little black particles to simulate cookies, and they don't provide any flavor, they are just there to hammer the point across that's it's not Vanilla. Still, very tasty and I'd certainly buy it again.
 Gold standard is the only standard. Cant go wrong with this flavor
 I had gastric bypass almost 2 years ago now.  As part of the protocol, I'm supposed to drink a protein shake once per day.  As you can imagine, this can get to be pretty boring flavor wise so I'm always trying new brands and flavors.  The simple fact is, I keep coming back to ON Gold Standard Extreme Milk Chocolate (or double rich chocolate) over and over again.  It's simply the best.  The flavor is excellent.  It doesn't taste like it has "diet flavored" sweetner in it.  It's just simple and delicious.<br/><br/>I don't have to worry too much about calories so this may not help a lot of you out there.  But if you just need to get some protein in you every day for whatever reason, try my shake recipe out:<br/><br/>1.5 (12 oz) water<br/>2 scoops of ON Gold Standard - Extreme Milk Chocolate/Double Rich Chocolate<br/>3 Tablespoons of Peanut Butter<br/>1 Banana<br/>1 Tablespoon of Flax Seed Oil (if you're into that sort of thing, I think it actually enhances the flavor a bit and it's good for you)<br/>1-2 Cups of Ice (depending on how "shakey" you want it to be)<br/>Blend until smooth
 Coffee flavor - YUM.  We make ice cream shakes with oreo and coffee flavored powder - this is very good.<br/><br/>Mocha flavor - YUM.
 Good and tasty shakes
 I keep hearing Cookies and Cream is the best flavor in this stuff, but I'm not feeling it. Has a bit of an odd aftertaste for me, but it's not terrible. I'll be looking at another flavor next time around.
 Nice taste , this has been my staple protein shake for years now
 My husband has tried quite a few brands and always comes back to this one. He loves it, I love it and we will continue to buy!
 The best protein out there.
 Not that great tasting. It's okayyy it works. I like BPI slightly better as well as My Protein.
 Great stuff. My husband and I take this as our recovery shake and I definitely see/feel the difference when I leave it out of my regimen. Now I know to order more way in advance of us running out. I've tried other brands - this one seems to be absorbed into my body better than any of the others I've tried. I've only had the chocolate - and I like it a lot!
 Tastes good. Mixes well.
 The only protein I buy and have for years.
 This had a plastic seal around the lid, but did not have a paper cover under the lid. Not sure if its safe to use...
 I take this almost every day and it builds me up between workouts.  I'm not a body-builder, just an ordinary elderly guy who's trying to keep in functional shape, and this seems to help.
 I won't comment on the health benefits as I am not qualified for that.  The double chocolate is quite tasty and it's also pretty filling as it should be.  I mix in a little 1-minute oatmeal and it's a perfect breakfast replacement.
 I have the Rocky Road and it's delicious. It tastes much better than chocolate milk you buy from the store. I don't know enough about the nutritional effects that others haven't already commented on so I won't make a fool of myself spouting information.
 Not the best taste, went plant based instead.
 ON Gold standard is by far the best Protein out there. I have tried more than I can recall. For the price, and quality  they cannot be beat. Cake Batter is amazing if you like to bake with whey or make protein balls for the freezer.
 This is the first protein that has dissolved quickly and thoroughly, with a great taste and no excess gas. The Arnold brand didn't give me gas but the taste was lacking and it was clumpy the whole time. Optimum nutrition seems to have got it right.
 great product
 Been using this supplement for about 3 years and have no complaints.  The best on the market when it comes to high protein/low carb for the price.  Taste is excellent.  Great with water, even better with vanilla soy milk.
 Mixed easily; delicious taste.
 Amazing product that has helped me to bulk up. Not only does it taste great, but it mixes well. I even got some bottles for my family members. We've tried Double Chocolate and Vanilla Ice Cream so far, and the flavors are amazing. This gives lots of protein and BCAAs and is definitely my go to whey protein product.
 This is by far the best protein ive used. Great taste. Great quality. Great source of BCAA's. Mixes easy. I got chocolate coconut. And really great price. Way cheaper than buying it in stores. Bigher selection of flavors too. And the amount you get foe the price cannot be better. I will definitely be ordweing tbis again
 There's an old saying: "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." I've been using Gold Standard for years and the taste and consistency have been great. So imagine my surprise when I bought a new tub, mixed it up, and it turned out to be awful. It's disgustingly sweet in a funny tasting sort of way, and it leaves a nasty &amp; bitter aftertaste in your mouth. I'm guessing it's the new artificial sweeteners that they added, perhaps the sucralose. Used just with milk or water, it's nearly unpalatable, and in the blender it foams up like crazy when compared to the old formula. They've removed the aminogen, too. Luckily I still have some of the old formula left, but I don't know what I'll do when I run out.<br/><br/>One thing about the glowing reviews that the product is still receiving: Many, if not most, of the five-star reviews are done by obviously fake accounts that only generate five-star reviews. It seems that the manufacturer knows how people are reacting to the new formula and is attempting to bury the negative reviews. Have a look through them and you'll see what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>Optimum Nutrition, please, please bring back the original. I'm now in the market for a new protein supplement, and judging by the recent reviews, I'm not the only customer that you've lost either...
 Great that its in bulk, bad because the corners in the bottom are susceptible to splits and leaks.  I'll be avoiding the bags.  Pay the extra for the annoyingly large canisters, unless you use the back to fill containers.
 I don't have a lot to compare to since this is mostly the only brand I use....but it works. I definitely feel stronger recovery through my training. And it's a great little supplement instead of the chips, candy, random snacks that I am often tempted with. I love this flavor too!! Makes me feel like I'm having a bit of a treat ;)  Sometimes I put in a little low sugar creamer just for fun. Mixes well.
 I use as a meal replacement or when I am starving.  It has been working out very well with me.
 Husband is a weight lifter and he has purchased this brand for over 20 years. We blend it with milk, frozen bananas and strawberries- It tastes delicious
 Best protein on the market hands down, enough said. You just can't beat the quality that optimum nutrition brings to the table. I've gone through hundreds of pounds of this stuff over the years and I will continue to keep them as my number one protein brand. Highly recommend.
 Great high quality protein. I usually get cookies and cream. Mixes well and is a great price compared to gnc, vitamin shop, etc
 Can't go wrong combined with gym I always put on meat  with this
 My go-to Whey.
 So far so good but could use an improvement in the taste
 Love the chocolate mint flavor...I was worried that it would taste bad and be hard to drink, but not at all!  Seems to have no side effects whatsoever...The first week I seemed to have some gas and bloating, but not sure it was from this.  I have not really noticed it doing anything for me yet though, but it has only been like 4 weeks, so I know I have to give it time and can't expect miracles overnight.
 Got the Rocky Road flavor; tastes amazing. Great supplement, low calorie, low sugar (2g per serving), would definitley buy again.
 This Whey was rated "the best" on a site i was checking out while doing my research on which kind to purchase. i'd have to agree. Its only been a week or so on this stuff, but i can already notice a difference in the workouts im having on it as appose to when i wasnt. Its just a matter of time till i start to see the full benefits of this product, but so far so good.
 Great product.
 We loved the Chocolate Mint and Chocolate Coconut and wanted to try a different flavor. This flavor does not mix as well with my favorite fruits/yogurt combination for protein shakes. It is still an excellent protein and my go to breakfast. I am hoping O.N. comes out with Brownie Batter flavor in the future.
 Good tasting protein powder with an efficient concentration of whey protein. I was going to buy the smaller size but then I did the math and you basically get 1lb for free when you buy the large size. I gave 1lb to my parents and kept the rest. I also got them some blender bottles. I use it in blender bottles with 1% or 2% milk most of the time. Double rich chocolate. Also good in blended shakes with frozen strawberries bananas and kale. I've lost about 30lb since almost 2 months ago, and I've been including this protein powder in my diet for most of the duration. I ran out of the powder a few weeks ago. I might get more in a different flavor and without the artificial sweeteners next time around. But the sweetners in this are fairly low and make the flavor very good, like chocolate milk or as my girlfriend describes it as tasting like nesquik. But want to try the non sweetened natural one next time. It's good as a meal replacement or to meet your protein macros easily. Pre or post workout to feed muscle recovery. It's the top protein powder out there and for good reason. As far as flavor quality/nutrient enrichment/protein concentration, you can't beat a big plastic hug of this stuff.
 Using it for years now. 2-3.<br/><br/>It surely IS NOT a GREAT tasting protein. FOR SURE.PERIOD.<br/>IF there is one thing ON lacks , it's great taste.<br/><br/>But other than that , I've always found result with it.<br/>That's why I still have it. I alternate it with other better tasting proteins.
 You can't go wrong with this protein
 Tastes great, helps the diet, helps the health, will definitely but it again
 I had high hopes for this product but, I was really disappointed.  The product is far too thin, I do not feel satisfied after having a shake, and it has an artificial taste.  I'll stick with Isagenix!
 Only proteing shake I use... Great taste and no aftertaste. You serious about loosing meal replacement? Try this.
 My go-to Whey protein.  Let me know of a better one at a comparable price!
 It's great.  No weird aftertaste and not overpowering with the mint flavor.
 Great tasting protein when added with milk. Tastes like chocolate milk.
 Pretty good. I got the cherry flavor I think. It tastes best when mixed with something out like some fruit or something. This is a fairly big container.
 I  trust ON and have had no problems with their products, Gold standard works for me,mixes well, good flavor, will buy again.
 Doesn’t taste great
 Generally not a fan of chocolate drinks, but after 5 lbs of the vanilla stuff I needed a swap and this was actually very tasty. Honestly though the best flavor came from when I still had some vanilla left and I could do 1/4 scoop vanilla + 1 1/2 scoop chocolate.
 I like it, it is just not on sale enough and its pretty high priced normally. Great protein and flavor.
 Delicious!!!
 Works great. I have been using it for awhile and feel like it helps with strength and recovery.
 You really cannot find a better deal, 24hr fitness is selling it for 110 so the price hands down cannot be beat, now onto the flavor my girlfriend hates protein powder so I was looking to see which flavor might taste the best for her " I have tried almost all of them" but so I bought the extreme milk chocolate and let me tell u she loves it and I love it taste just like nestle chocolate milk, anywho I recommend this protein due to taste, price and results
 Love this brand and flavor.  I mix it with water and its like having a cappuchino!  Nice afternoon healthy treat!
 This is the best tasting ON shake I've tried (and we have tried a lot of diff ones from this line).  You don't even feel that little protein aftertaste.  We will be buying this again, and again, and aGAIN :D #SeeWhatIDidThere
 I am now in my 50's. After a few years of neglecting my body due to the "Corporate World" work load I now have time to get back into the gym rat I was and move the muscle that was previously in my chest and arms and found it's way to my waist and belly, I am hoping this will help based on the reviews. It tastes great.
 It's just like Nesquick. Heckin' great taste.
 I'm not about that life &gt;_&lt; I wanted to finish this but I sadly stopped at the very end. I just had a few scoops left before it expires I don't have much experience with many of these drinks but it tasted great and made me feel better after workouts. I am happy with my purchase
 one of my favorite flavors, mixes easily and no clumping.  I find my self adding it to everything for that extra protein boost
 Mixes really well and taste good too
 Keep up the good work!
 I had the chocolate mint, not sure it it is because I'm mixing it with water. It tastes REALLY bad and smells awful. It works tho. HOWEVER, I recently got the extreme chocolate. It tastes good mixed with almond milk. It smells good the powder itself too. So, get the extreme chocolate and DON'T mix it only with water.
 BUILD SOME MUSCLES!!
 Great taste, I mix it with water after working out at the gym.
 I ordered my package on Saturday night and it was at my doorstep on Sunday evening and I don't have Amazon prime.  I guess they are shipping on Sundays now.  The banana cream is one of my favorite flavors and it mixes very well.  I do have to mention that I 95% of the time mix this with berry's and yogurt to make a smoothie, so I don't normally just mix this with water.  Overall a great product that I will continue to order from Amazon.
 I love the chocolate flavor of the protein powder. It goes very well with milk and tastes pretty good with water too. I use this product after working out.
 Great tasting Protein, mixes well with water or milk in shaker and makes really good smoothies.
 Great taste (bought cookies and cream). Mixes above average. Still has to be shaken well to not have big pieces in it. This protein is one of the big name proteins and with reason. It gets the job done. After seeking, I've noticed that Amazon has it cheaper here than most sites, so I opted to get it here, with prime for 2 day shipping. I'll definitely be back in a month buying another.
 By far the best...
 I've been using Whey products for years, and I've tried most brands out there. This stuff is probably the best 'bang for your buck'. It mixes very well; 10/10 there. It's probably some of the better tasting whey powder, depending on flavor. You just can't beat the value. It's my 'work horse' powder.
 When looking at which size to buy, I believe that the 5lb tub is the best value. I like chocolate so the flavor was great too. It says to use 1 scoop per shake but I use 2 and it still lasts a long time
 every morning I use this, love all the different flavors as well
 I like this protein. It doesn't really have a strong coconut flavor, it is mostly chocolate.
 Great product, specially for those who wants to keep a lean muscle, not the best who want to gain mass.
 good
 Love this stuff! Tastes great and is filling.
 My husband loves this. He can almost make it in to pudding.
 Best whey you can buy. Mixes easily and tastes so good that I look forward to lifting just so I can have a scoop of this stuff afterwards.
 I like it
 Tastes great when mixed with anything really, smoothies just milk, doesn't have that powdery taste. I had it in banana flavor
 This product works better before having meals, have small protein intake bars during your daily working time and expect huge results A++++
 Tastes great and mixes well in protein shakes.
 This is one of the best whey's I've ever used and I'm always happy with the ON products.  I wanted to switch it up a little so I ordered the new Arnold series from MusclePharm (big mistake) and now I'm going back to ON.  It will be a long time before I stray from ON again.
 Love ordering this. It works really well
 This is a small sample probably for a week or so maybe less
 Great product and excellent price
 Taste great! And the directions are so simple!<br/><br/>I was asked a question if it came with a scoop. It does Just mine was all the way on bottom of the container.
 Best protein. For the price you can't find anything better, quality or taste wise.
 great for on the run, protein shake, tastes great
 Do not be fooled by other products. This is 100% isolate which is great. Very happy with the servings and size of the container. Will definitely get this one again. One thing we were surprised by is the same volume mixed with water with this name brand tastes watered down. So, to over come the "weak" chocolate taste, we mix the same serving size in less water. Still glad we got this product. A definitely win!
 This stuff is amazing.  I use it as a breakfast replacement.  It's not a full fledged meal-replacement, but it does the trick and keeps me from being hungry until lunch time.  The Mocha Cappuccino flavor is excellent.  Mix it with some 1% milk and shake.
 I made a big mistake in not realizing this has sucrolase in it. I've been reading how artificial sugars can damage our brain and our heart and actually make us fat. Very disappointing!
 I have gone through at least 6 of these 5lb tubs of whey. It's solid.  Mixes super well with anything I use, and it tastes awesome. I get Rocky Road
 Double chocolate tastes really good.  Low sugar in proporation to protein.  Great product!
 Tastes amazing and doesn't stay chunky like other protein powders, it has a smooth consistency. Wish they sold other flavors in small sizes like this so I could try before buying the larger amounts.
 Definitely glad I got this protein. Optimum Nutrition is always the best way to go when it comes to supplements, as they always deliver on quality, and effectiveness. I love how smoothly this stuff mixes in just about ANYTHING, seriously. And it tastes amazing, I don't feel like I've gotta just slap it down. Tastes good mixed with your favorite drink, or with just plain water. I use this to lose weight, so most of the time I mix it with just water. But sometimes I like to mix it with milk or orange juice or even into my oatmeal or yogurt. I also love that it only has 1g or sugar in it, and it is very low on calories. It is easy on my stomach, I am lactose intolerant and this protein is lactose-free which is perfect. No gassy feeling after drinking it. I would suggest getting the 5lb tub or even the 10lb. It lasts you a lot longer, and the price on here is the best, considering you also don't need to worry about shipping, not only that, in stores, 5lbs of this stuff will easily run you at twice as much as here.. You WILL be spoiled after using this stuff, you won't want to use anything else, certainly nothing below standard. Only protein even better than this stuff is the Platinum Standard Hydro Whey, also by Optimum Nutrition. The only reason I don't use that is because it is not lactose-free and I did experience a bit of gas for a while. But you can't go wrong with anything by ON.
 Love the taste! hard to find a protein shake with an acceptable flavor.  fast shipping .
 This is the first protein shake that I actually enjoy drinking. My favorite flavor is the extreme milk chocolate. If you use milk, it tastes a lot more smooth and delicious then when you use water. Even if you mix with water, its not terrible. I feel that my workouts have been a lot more effective after drinking this everyday. I highly doubt I can find a protein shake flavor I like more. I am interested in trying all the other flavors.
 I take 1-2 scoops daily.  Great way to get your 30grams of protein first thing in the morning.<br/><br/>Created minor bloating and...flatulence...in the morning if I had a scoop right before bed time.  Other wise, no issues.  Helps with recover and towards getting to that 1gm per pound goal.
 The vanilla ice cream is my favorite but the chocolate is good too.
 You know what you are getting. Solid protein and great taste.
 Rocky Road flavor is GREAT!
 I have tried many whey proteins in my lifetime, and ON is the brand I've settled on, not only for cost, but the lactase allows even the lactose intolerant to drink it with milk, and the "instantized" feature allows it to mix without any granules to choke down!  However, if you have not tried any flavors, the chocolate mint falls second to the rocky road which is the best tasting pure whey protein around.
 Been an ON fan for many years. Tried multiple other brands in the past, always find myself coming back for more ON. No stomach aches, or bloat from this product.
 "Delicious Strawberry" tastes like old bubblegum, and not in a good way.
 This is my favorite protein. I really like the taste of the chocolate. It mixes incredibly well, e.g., I can put a scoop on my cereal or in my oatmeal. I have been buying this protein for years and I have not been disappointed. It's a great value and I highly recommend it. I enjoy Optimum Nutrition's products.
 I love this stuff. Mixes well, good flavor, very filling.
 Great product
 I ordered a coffee flavor and it tastes good.
 Great deal and will last a while. But you should try to get most of your protein from real food
 Great protein!
 French Vanilla tastes alright mixed with water. It dissolves easily.  It doesn't lump or clump like Muscle Milk powder. This is way better.
 I love ON's Whey Protein. Always quality and lasts for quite a while. Plus the chocolate flavor isn't half bad. I use this together with the Optimen multivitamins and their Flaxseed oil.
 Darn it! Should'nt have gotten such a large amount of cookies and cream. It tastes like double chocolate cookies (no cream). Very strong flavor and after taste. Horrible with fruits as well. I got the 5lb too. Sucks.
 I have use a bunch of different protein powders over the years, and this flavor of Optimum is BY FAR the best tasting, most versatile, and my favorite protein. The double rich chocolate flavor is like drinking a chocolate milkshake, and I'm PICKY! Probably my favorite thing about this protein is it's versatility. I can mix this with water after lifting, almond milk and chocolate peanut butter as a meal replacement, and it tastes just as good. Definitely recommend
 my life force
 Great product! Good quality and taste pretty good. It's my good to before and after my workouts. It purchased this to test it out and was very happy I did. I eventually purchase the 5lbs and am ready to reorder more.
 Taste so good and I love to mix it with my smoothies.
 THANK YOU
 Absolutely my favorite flavor, it's hard to believe it's good for you!
 Great prices, fast shipping.
 The cappuccino flavor is BOMB!! I can drink this all day!
 While most of these 'protein drink' products tend to be reasonably distasteful, I've found this ON Double Rich Chocolate as borderline scrumptious.<br/>Haven't tried any of their other flavors, but have been using this one for years, with satisfying results.
 I've ordered multiple times. Never had any issues.
 I have tried many of the flavors of the ON 100% Whey Gold Standard Protein. The "vanilla" flavors such as white chocolate, cookies and cream, etc. are a little bland to me so they are great mixed in smoothies. I really like the chocolate flavors extreme milk chocolate and double rich chocolate, but my favorite has to be the coffee flavor. These are all fine to good mixed in water, and even better mixed in milk.<br/><br/>You can't beat the 24g protein per 120ish calorie serving that this provides.
 This flavor is 'good enough' if you like mint. Thankfully, it is not overly sweet like some products can be but, unfortunately, there is not enough mint flavor. It smells very minty when you open the container but that does not translate to a minty-enough taste for me. I will not be buying it again.
 Mixes very well with a shaker cup and about 10 shakes. Other cups will take a little more shaking.
 The protein is by far the best you can buy. Nothing comes close to the amount of Protein inside, while keeping the calories and sugar low. I wouldn't buy more than 5LBS of a flavor at a time, since you'll get sick of it by the time you get to the end. You switch it up then, and then repeat the process.
 I bought this for my son to help him gain weight and he's very pleased with it.
 I have tried a few different protein powders, and I like this one the best. First of all, it is very nutrient-dense, unlike some other powders. 1 scoop delivers 24g of protein, while in some other powders, you need to take twice that amount. It also has fewer carbs (only 3g per scoop). I also find it to be much more cost effective. One of these 5 pound jars contains 149 scoops and costs $43 -- that's 29 cents per meal!! And, most importantly -- it tastes good. There is no sense buying something if you won't eat it, no matter how healthy it might be, but taste is not a problem with this product. So, it's healthy, it's cost effective, and it tastes good -- can't really go wrong.<br/><br/>No doubt there are plenty of ways to consume it, but these are my top two: Either put it in a blender with black coffee and a splash of milk, or put it in a blender with plain Greek yogurt and a bit of water. You can also add other nutritional supplements, like fiber powder or DE.
 Mixes well, good taste.
 can't go wrong with ON Gold Standard, I've tried many whey protein but I keep coming back to this one,<br/> Mocha Cappuccino is just perfect!
 By far the best tasting protein I've ever had. I have tried them all and this literally does two scoops in 16oz of milk and its like a tall glass of chocolate milk. It tastes so good I am even skeptical there is 24 grams of protein per scoop.
 I have used ON gold standard whey protein for 14 years.  It's dollar for dollar the best protein on the market.  No filler, some extra goodies in it (BCAA's) and it tastes great.  Vanilla ice cream is my favorite flavor.  I make protein shakes, smoothies, protein bars, protein muffins, pancakes, etc with it.
 Easily the best protein powder I've ever used.  It mixes easily and the consistency is just right. There is no comparison. Chocolate Mint tastes great each morning.
 Best &amp; Only flavor left without sucralose in the ingredients.
 This stuff is by far the BEEESSSSSTTTT tasting protein shake drink I have ever tasted! I think it mixes much much better than any other protein shake that we have ordered in the past. I was so excited when I saw the cake batter flavor and I am VERY happy with the taste!
 I work overnight security and instead of eating meals late at night I have replaced them with this product. I just add 8oz. of coconut milk, some fresh fruit, throw is in a blender and SHAZAM a meal in a bottle. Love it!
 I use it my coffee every day and I love it
 Tastes excellent, mixes easily.  Quality stuff.
 Everything according to the description of the ad and as expected! Highly recommend!
 I'm on my second container of 5lb double rich chocolate this month. It tastes really good. I mix my protein powder with water because I'm lactose intolerant. Sometimes it get my bloated, but It usually isn't a problem. I am seeing great results with ON. I'm on a high protein low calorie diet. I'm gaining strength aswell as shedding the fat at a good rate!
 Shipped fast.  Satisfied customer.  Thank you
 Best in the business and taste is a lot better than competitors
 Tastes terrible!!!
 Do you like coffee and/or Starbucks? If so, then buy this protein! It's the first protein that I've actually looked forward to drinking. I've bought multiple 5 p
 Love! Tasty
 Fast shipping before I expected. Great product and flavor I can mixed with any natural fruit. Great price, very satisfied
 Bought it with high expectations. However, it tastes so bad because of artificial sweeteners. The chemical taste doesn’t go away easily. I’ll look for something else.
 I can absolutely see a big difference after using this product along with some bodybuilding supplements. I have already ordered this twice and I loved the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor.
 Perfect for breakfast, pre/post workout.  Taste is fine and you know you're getting the best quality on the market. Results speak for themselves if you train well with it
 I work out on a daily basis and enjoy a protein shake post workout as well as throughout the day to stiffle any hunger. I'm pretty picky with the taste of protein powder because I don't like any artifcial flavor (like in diet/sugar-free drinks) and I don't like them tasting too sweet. ON Double Rich Chocolate is the best protein shake flavor I've ever had because it tastes like an actual chocolate shake--I like to mix it with unsweetened almond milk to give it a more milky consistency without any added sweetness; milk is slightly sweeter and makes it taste exactly like a milk shake, soy milk gives it a lot more sweetness (for those who are pro soymilk), and water gives it a more run-down taste, but it's still better than other chocolate protein shakes I've had. The only other flavor I've tried from ON was the Mocha Cappuccino, and I wasn't a huge fan of it because there was a slight artificial flavor and had to take it with soy milk to mask the taste, but my cousin who enjoys the ON Double Rich Chocolate as much as I do, thought it was good enough to finish off the rest of the 3 lb tub I ordered.<br/><br/>I order the 5lb Double Chocolate, and use about 4 scoops daily (2 scoops/24oz liquid), and a tub lasts a little over a month for me. I wish I was able to sample every one of them, but I think I'll be sticking with the double chocolate until I'm feeling adventurous again to try something like the Chocolate Mint :D
 Protein Powder works great. Taste is not so great, when using a blender bottle use milk instead of water and it will taste 100 times better! Otherwise great product.
 Tastes great. Mixes great. Just wish the scoop was buried in the bottom when I first open it haha!
 Great tasting whey protein! Probably my favorite
 Mix this with some orange juice and you have an orange Julius. Great taste and price
 I am huge.
 Please note this is for the Extreme Milk Chocolate flavor.<br/><br/>This powder is well worth it, at the time of this writing it's $53 for a 5 pound tub of it. That is an absolute amazing price for what you're getting. It's about the same amount, per ounce, as the Six Star/Body Fortress(Wal-mart) powder I used to get.<br/><br/>The flavor I have is a bit average. This is both a good and bad thing, with one scoop per 8 fl oz of milk it has a very mild milk chocolate taste, it's not overpowering nor is it underwhelming. It's an average taste with very little after taste.<br/>I have yet to try it in water though, as I've never liked protein powder like that.<br/><br/>It mixes extremely well with my Blender Bottle, within 5-10 seconds it was completely mixed and I had zero chunks leftover. I would have to highly recommend this powder.(And if you have the extra money, the Blender Bottle is a good pair with this.)<br/><br/>One last note, be aware of the ingredients, there are artificial sweeteners in it. If you do not like this, I would recommend getting the natural whey from ON which is sweetened with a form of Stevia.<br/><br/>Update 4/17/13: So, now that it has been some time since I first reviewed, I figured I would give a small update.<br/>I've gone through a little over half of my 5 LB tub with an average of 3-4 shakes a week. The main reason I'm updating is to give more insight on the taste of the flavor I bought; I seem to be enjoying it more the more I drink it. I suppose I'm "getting used to it", but it is tasting much better than when I first tried it.<br/>A small tip - I've found that the best way to drink this is to put it in the freezer for about 20 minutes, or in the refrigerator for about 40-60 minutes with some milk. It makes for an absolutely tasteful protein shake.<br/><br/>Update 6/29/13: Just tasted the flavor 'Chocolate Malt'. Everything from my original review is the same about this flavor as far as quality goes. If you're wondering how this tastes, it tastes very close to the Whoppers candy. So if you're thinking of trying it, go out and buy some Whoppers and imagine how it would taste as a liquid. I think it's an alright flavor, not a big fan of it. 3/5 for taste on this one.
 If someone were to ask my opinion on whats the best flavor, I'd definitely say Mocha Cappucino for sure.  You'd almost think you're drinking something unhealthy because it's THAT good!  The powder mixes very well.  Oh, and I'd suggest buying from Amazon rather than buying from stores, even if they are the same price.  I bought three 5lb tubs from different stores, all of them being a little lower than 3/4ths full.  When I ordered from Amazon, the powder was almost up to the lid!  Excellent stuff, I tell you.
 Perfect for my needs as a meal replacement.  Have definitely lost weight due to its low calorie/fat count and works great at keeping you full. The vanilla ice cream flavor is delicious!
 It's just ok.  Deff not as good of a taste as the ISO-100.  Not even close.
 Tastes great and has a large dose of protein without too many extra calories. Unlike most whey didn't leave me feeling bloated afterwards.
 I have tasted better however this mixes well with 2% milk or water, and I have not experienced any GI symptoms with this straight whey as opposed to some protein blends I have tried in the past. The price of this along with the reputation of ON cant be beat.
 Ordered cookies in cream. Worst flavor of protein I've ever tasted. They ignored the widely accepted flavor profile of cookie and cream and instead tried to recreate the taste of a (chocolate chip?) cookie. Also this flavor contains high fructose corn syrup.<br/><br/>Tried to complain to the company and they said they'd send me free samples of their doughnut flavor... Gave them my address and waited a few months. No samples. I'm pretty disappointed with ON at this point. Feeling robbed blind.
 The double rich chocolate is the best-tasting protein powder I have tasted in 20 years.  The price is about the same as elsewhere, but delivered to your door via Prime.  I mix mine with 1% milk; can't beat it!
 This stuff is the best. Tastes great, blends smoothly (no chunks), always seems to help recovery period after a good workout.
 I am very happy with the
 I am very happy with the
 This is the perfect protein IMO. Based on it's low sugar, low calorie, and most importantly low carb composition. This is exactly the protein you'll want if you want to maintain a good protein intake without the fear of putting on the unwanted weight. Flavor is just right, obviously most prefer with milk if you want to increase flavor and caloric intake. I take mine 3 times a day with water, using a double scoop following my morning workouts.
 Tastes outstanding with 2% milk.<br/>I mix about 10 ounces to 2 cups powder.
 While it doesn't seem to mix as well as it used to it is still the best I can find. In the past it wouldn't clump when miked with a spoon. Now, while its not terrible, it is definitely less smooth. That being said, I would still buy this over anything else offered.
 ON Gold Standard is frequently considered one of the best whey proteins for a reason<br/><br/>1.  It mixes really well<br/>2.  It tastes very good<br/>3.  Its loaded with 100% Whey Isolates - ya know that good stuff that builds muscles and repairs quickly.<br/><br/>Best flavors are cookies and cream, vanilla ice cream and strawberry.  Love this stuff.
 Gave mine away as I missed the part on the label that dictates this will give 10% of your cholesterol daily intake.<br/><br/>I had the chocolate and it tasted ok with 2% milk.
 GAINZZZZZZZZ BROO!!!!!
 Great for the protein. You can't really go wrong with ON Whey products. Just wish it had a natural sweetener instead of sucralose.
 Makes it so you are not ordering it all the time.
 Flavor is much better then I expected for a chocolate mint. It is actually now my favorite flavor
 The extreme milk flavor is way too sweet. It's really hard to drink it.
 Does not taste like rocky road to me. Definitely not going to purchase this flavor again.
 This is the best flavor I tried so far, I tried iso- 100 vanilla and chocolate, vanilla one is the worst flavor out of these three.
 I used to love this stuff, but I guess they reformulated it or something, because now it's sickeningly sweet (but not a real sweet, more like the artificial sweetener kinda) and not the same.  Which is a shame, as I just bought the HUGE tub, and now am stuck with it.
 Strawberry/Banana -- I use end up using this only in vegetable/fruit smoothies, and other creations... In the smoothies the flavor just dissapears and tastes like its part of the fruit mix, its great in that way, you dont know its there. I cant drink it in plain water it just never tastes right, it disolves fine, but seems to still have a powdery taste somehow. Its very good and milk, just doesnt happen to be my favorite in just milk so I dont drink it taht way often.<br/><br/>Vanilla -- awesome in milk... tastes like vanilla icecream... I guess melted icecream, but very yummy.  Cant drink this one in plain water. Not really bad in the veggie/fruit smoothies... but not good either. Pretty good in iced coffee.<br/><br/>Extreme chocolate milk -- all around this is my favorite. So far its the only one I can drink in water, and it tastes like chocolate milk. Even better in milk. Makes iced coffee almost like an iced mocha. As strange as this sounds I even like this in the green smoothies. This is great all around for lots of uses. Im normally not a chocolate fan, but this is my favorite ON whey so far.<br/><br/>I really like the ON brand, and I almost only use them, clean ingredients, they care for their quality, and very reasonable priced... ON might not be the best of any of those 3 categories, but seems to be the best all around in those 3 that Ive ever seen.
 This is probably some of the best tasting protein powder that I have used.  Not too much of a sweetener after taste.  It also readily dissolves either by using a hand blender or in a shaker.  Combined that with the Prime shipping and this is a pretty good deal.
 Taste amazing considering its whey. Most brands we've tries are horrible tasting, but even when made with water it tastes like an awesome chocolate malt. We (my hubby and I) can also tell its working the ways we needed it to. Would highly recommend to anyone!
 Not nearly as good tase as Isopure
 Son loves this stuff
 The best you can buy.  Not the absolute best tasting, but mixes incredibly well, great ratio on the macros, and tastes very good without tasting too much like a protein powder.
 Everyone is raving about how this protein powder is low in carbs and sugar. Well there's a reason for that and it's called chemicals! Chemicals as in sucralose that was created in a laboratory and has been proven to cause cancer.<br/><br/>Only reason this doesn't get one star is it is still more natural than some other protein powders with even more chemicals.
 This stuff makes me want to bro out with my flow out. I cannot get enough of this, I shower and shave with it, I use it as powder for my butt. Everything I am and everything I will be is due to this awesome delicacy.
 Exactly what I wanted when I researched it.<br/><br/>I add oils... Oats... Peanut butter<br/>Banannas<br/>Greens<br/>Apples<br/>Flax seeds<br/>chia seeds<br/><br/>Whatever as needed<br/>But alone, just fine too.<br/><br/>I always make in a Shake blender.
 nice
 Very good stuff!<br/><br/>Mixes ok, but tastes great and is super smooth! I can see small gains. Of course that really depends on your own exercising, but I think this works!
 Good tasting protein.  Very light, but not very rich.  The 5 lb container was huge, but was 1/2 empty due to settling...seemed like an overkill on container size.  Will purchase again.
 very good
 Great product, fast shipment 📦 thank you 😊
 I had the coffee flavor which I love although it's a little on the artificial sweet aid which is why I did not give it a 5 star.
 Great Product
 It truly is the gold standard as any fitness blog/site/thread will tell you. This one in particular mixes very well with my shaker.
 best protein powder i've ever bought. i will not stray away from this product. chocolate flavor is definitely the best flavor out there for this line. Yes, it is a bit pricey, but in my opinion, has given me the best results so far.
 This protein powder has more protein per calorie than any other I've seen. For my diet, it works really well. The flavor is good, though not the best I've had. Kind of thin and watery.
 Awesome! Tastes great.
 I've used the brand a couple of times now. I am a research nut and think this is a top of the line protein powder for the price.
 My favorite Whey Protein. Best flavor and best gains.
 reasonable price and amazing taste
 Very delicious. The fast Digesting Whey you need after work out. After my intense workout I refuel my muscles with this Whey. Love the Vanilla flavor.
 Super tasty, tastes like chocolate milk!
 This Whey protein has worked very well for me. I take 2 cups of powder after workouts. It really helps boost my protein needs. It comes in a whole host of flavors. Personally I've chosen the french vanilla creme, which is actually really tasty. I don't think I'd change from this. Good product, good price on Amazon.
 This is by far the BEST flavor of protein you can ask for. It tastes like ice cream! I've tried several, but nothing compares to this one.
 Best tasting protein hands down!
 Best tasting protein powder I've ever had, mixed in with shakes I can't even tell its there, no aftertaste. Even pretty good with cold water in a pinch. Just have had rocky road so far and it's so good I'll likely just keep with that one, seems weird but I never get sick of it. Would recommend to anyone.
 The flavor is not bad and not the greatest I will try new flavor on my next purchase. I like how it dissolves easily better than any other product I had in the past. Hard to tell if there is result so far or if I noticed any difference.
 Tastes like someone sprinkled chocolate powder on a piece of chalk. If you want to significantly up the calorie content you can mix it with milk to mask the flavor but that does defeat the purpose. Compared to other products i am a little disappointed at the lack of nutrients as well.... especially potassium for the price of this product. Its my fault for not doing a little more research before buying. There are plenty of other products that offer great taste and bonus added vitamins and nutrients for the same or less money.
 I love this but the bag showed up with a hole in it.
 The taste was good, but it had to be mixed very well.  It was hard to mix by just stirring, so I guess you would need a blender.  However,the bottom line for me was that it didn't help me at all.
 I've used this a few times already &amp; everyone wanted some. One of my brothers even admitted to stealing a couple of scoops, and he has his own tub of Whey! (different brand)<br/>When I run out, I will for sure buy this again. For now, I use it every other day so that should last me for a while. It tastes great, too, but even better with chia seeds mixed in. This is some great stuff.
 There are plenty of Protein supplements on the market all claiming to be the best and so on. This is the real deal. Within a couple of days you feel and notice a difference in performance and endurance with the right blend of BCAA's and Isolate. This is the protein that you will stick with and keep coming back for more each time. And the price is on point.
 Favorite protein powder.  I mix it with with vanilla almond milk after a work out and it takes fantastic. GAINS.. Gains.. Gains?? Gains.
 gud
 Taste great
 Tastes great!
 Simply the best whey protein out there! Makes for a quick protein boost for any time of the day. Especially helpful first thing in the morning after a long period of no food. Has a great flavor even with just water!
 Excatly what I expected
 Great product
 Very good product and tastes excellent. I will definitely be buying it in the future as well and would recommend it.
 it is tasty but I don't like it because I gain 20 pound in 2 months.
 I'm just getting back into working out after being pretty out of shape for many years and after reading many reviews I settled on Gold Standard for my protein. It's still pretty early on to tell how this whey affects my body but I can definitely say the Mocha Cappuccino flavor is absolutely DELICIOUS! I've been drinking a scoop with almond milk and it tastes nothing like the nasty protein shakes I've had in the past. I actually look forward to drinking this after my workout because it tastes so damn good!
 This is so tasty it's not right! It gets old if you drink it daily, so try and have another flavor on hand if you can. Mixes well with P2B/peanut butter, milk, frozen bananas, etc. Great flavor of a reputable protein.
 4/04/14 Edited Review. I lowered my rating to two stars, due the price continually increasing. It's already up $11.00 dollars in a little over a month, VERY disappointing, will buy elsewhere unless prices goes back to reasonable standards. This product was originally $89.00 I believe.<br/><br/>I've been using Gold Standard for several years. I've tried to switch to other brands, all the current and former top selling brands over the last 7 years or so, nothing can still compare to this powder. It still mixes easier than any powder on the market, with a decent serving size to price ratio. They did decrease the serving size in the larger bags by about 5-10 servings, but it's still the best value per scoop. The flavoring is good, especially if you drink this product with any sort of milk. I personally use plain, vanilla, or chocolate almond milk, so its quite delicious. Water is tough for any protein powder mix, I personally don't use it with water, but I know many do. I would suggest a more tropical flavor with chilled water. I will continue to purchase this product as long as the quality stays high, and the price is reasonable.
 Great product!
 I'm a fan of ON, so it's a no brainer that I ordered a 5 lb bucket.  I normally use 50/50 water and milk with ON whey proteins because I think it makes it taste better.  Not much else to say.  You're either a fan of ON or not.  I like ON because I think it's one of the best quality products out there.
 I don't know why the Mocha Cappuccino isn't the most popular flavor.<br/><br/> - It's not too sweet<br/> - a good mix of coffee and chocolate<br/><br/>It's the best.
 I've been using Optimum Nutrition Whey Protein for several months and I'm very satisfied with the product.  I travel a great deal and take several shakes a day to ensure I'm getting the proper amount of protein.  This taste SO MUCH BETTER than the Double Rich Chocolate.  Extreme Milk Chocolate when mixed with about 6 to 8 ounces of water taste more like chocolate milk than a protein shake.  Great product.
 Love the taste of it. Have tried other protein powders and was really disappointed with the taste as I cannot handle the sweeteners and this does not have  that problem at all. I have tried both the dark chocolate as well as the banana flavor one and they both taste great.
 Only protein I take and like. Has low carbs which is perfect for me and my goals. Great tasting.
 Great taste &amp; very clean whey protein. Will definitely buy again.
 I feel myself getting more POWERFULL!<br/><br/>It's just protein. Mixed easily and tastes not bad, which I guess is pretty good.
 I've tried a few different kinds of protein, and this is my new favorite. Most importantly to me, it's more easily digestible than some of the cheaper protein powders out there. The double rich chocolate is also quite delicious. And to top it all off, Optimum Nutrition isn't too expensive for the amateur weight lifter. Give it a try!
 Love the flavors, great quality, nice price point
 The only protein powder I have used for the past 5 years.
 Perfect 100% whey protein. Simple and cheap, but is extremely worth it because protein is protein and this one is known as a good brand, but still cheap. Recommended
 Great taste, Especially when using milk
 ...Yes, really! I use water post workout, as long as it's cold the shake still tastes great!<br/><br/>I use milk for a breakfast shake and I chug right before eating a banana. Good flavor combo.<br/><br/>This is the "chocolate" you want... But not that "cocoa powder" rich flavor you can't stomach after a solid 2 hours working hard.
 nothing special others taste better with more protein
 Just awesome. The best ever made. This brand you cant go wrong.<br/>This flavor is sick man. So good! I enjoy a few other flavors as well. Protien content is legit and clean. Two scoops your around 50. Get it
 Double rich Chocolate doesn't taste the best.  Think that might be because I was hoping for something a little sweeter.  I think "double rich" is an over statement. More like half chocolate. Otherwise everything else is "Golden". Probably will repurchase the same one.
 Had never tried it before but I love it. A bit pricey but its good
 I don't know if it's me or it was a bad batch but I couldn't stand this protein. I thought Serious Mass was hard to swallow but I quickly changed my mind when I had this. It smells good but that's about it. It's more tolerable with milk but at the end of the day I never look forward to taking this. I'll stick to chocolate or vanilla from now on, I wouldn't even recommend this to someone I hate.
 Been drinking it.  I bought the vanilla ice cream. Super tasty.
 Still my favorite flavor.. Took an order off to try the #1-voted banana cream flavor; happy to be back with the cake batter.
 Great price and service
 This stuff is great! It helped me lose weight. I drink 4 scoops of this everyday with diet and exercise and I managed to lose 20 pounds in 2 months. No way? YES WHEY....ha....ha..<br/><br/>Anyway, I would suggest any of the chocolate flavors in terms of taste. I've tried strawberry and never finished the thing.
 Great tasting!
 Good product. What you expect. Will order another soon.
 Love this stuff, mixes well with water or milk, tastes great, getting the results I desired
 Tastes great. 5 stars if Optimum Nutrition would please start making this one size up so I don't have to reorder so frequently and can get a better price for size.
 my 1st whey protein, i love it
 After going through multiple 5 pound jugs of Gold Standard Whey, I finally caved and bought the big boy bag. It's a great feeling knowing that you won't have to buy protein soon. I save a jug of protein and just refill it on occasion with this bag, a great buy.
 Happy with results, good taste
 Good clean protein at a good cost! Iv already ordered my next container.
 mixes readily into any cold drink and is very filling and nourishing.
 love it
 This protein was a great find.  I am always experimenting with new proteins and I am definitely glad I tried this one.  Definitely will buy again.
 Excellent blendered with ice and a 1/2 cup of vanilla Greek yogurt!
 Worth it
 I purchased a strawberry banana taste. It has a very very weak taste, so it may good for people who are tired of drinking too sweat taste of protein. As for myself, I mix with half of battle of water, instead of using all, that's how I let it keep strawberry taste. To be honest, I don't taste banana. However, this protein has only 120 calories and 24g of GOOD protein in it. So I would say this is good product to buy!
 I don't get into the nutritional analysis, etc., and I'm not even a bodybuilder or athlete.  I just want a high protein supplement to mix with almond milk and a banana in the morning as I rush out the door and this is, so far, the best tasting one.
 Best protein you can get for the money. I'd much rather take this at the price than hydro-whey
 I think this is my favorite low fat and low carb protein.  I wish it had a richer taste.  I found that ON casein protein is much thicker and if I mix the 2 1/2 and 1/2 I get the advantages of the whey with the satisfaction of the casien.
 Tasty, really handy when you don't have time to prepare a meal- a lot of protein packed in here. I use it in my Nutribullet w 1 banana, 2 handsful of frozen blueberries, coco water, and 2 scoops of this. Fantastic!
 Great protein. Just wish it cost less or went on sale.
 Great product
 Love this flavor. I'm usually a vanilla girl but the cake batter flavor intrigued me. Perfect for shakes or protein waffles.
 Use all the time
 Great taste and digest good, got good visible result.
 Tried the Mocha Cappuccino flavor. I've tried a handful of different protein shakes in the past and this by far is the best tasting. The taste is mild with no after-taste; tastes just like a coffee drink. As for effectiveness - I have no clue and I'd defer that part of assessment to other users.
 feels its helping to build muscle, use it after evry work , especially when lifting so far so good I noticed a difference, have bought again and will continue too, would recommend
 This is the best one my son said! He loves to  bulk up!
 WOW!!! I was torn between this, mocha, and rocky road since it seem so popular but coffee is by far the best i've ever had in terms of any other brands or flavor. i'm willing to workout for 3 hours with high intensity but i can't get myself to mix protein and chugging it down because it was always a dreaded nasty chore. This coffee has thin watery consistency and mixes easily unlike the banana flavor, I can easily drink this all day for no reason just to enjoy. This does not gum up and stick to the side of the cup unlike the banana flavor. I really had a hard time getting 1gram of protein per lb of bodyweight just for the fact I hated drinking thick shakes, but I'm probably going to get even more now just because this is so damn good. I'm not a coffee connoisseur so those that are may hate this but this coffee taste to me like the ice cream kind.
 slightly cheaper than buying 2 5lb containers, still the same quality.
 This is great if you are trying to cut weight. It is a very lean protein. However, you can get it cheeper at any GMC location. Online it is over priced and takes awhile to get.
 Tastes great. but a bit too much sugar. Mixes terribly with milk, great with water. mix it with 3/4 of water, and then add milk. it tastes amazing this way.
 The banana flavor can get boring really fast, however this protein powder dissolves great with just water and taste great with just water!
 Been using this for years and have no plans on stopping anytime soon.  I'm a big fan of ON products. Using a lot of their products monthly.
 I drink it with milk. Tastes great - it's something good for me that I actually look forward to. We use blender bottles and it always mixes well, no grit or anything
 I bought the double chocolate and the vanilla. Both taste great even mixed with water. Lots of protein and not too many calories.
 This is the best protein powder I've ever bought based on the macros, taste, and price point. Delicious and beneficial whatever your fitness goals.
 Decent taste and consistency.
 Great buy. I've used many whey, but none as long as ON whey. 10+ years always fresh never an issue.
 The Mocha Cappuccino flavor was so good and addictive. Decided to switch since it's like have coffee... and I work out at night so...<br/><br/>I didn't like Rocky Road all that much. Double Rich Chocolate isn't bad. About to try Chocolate Coconut, hopefully it's good.
 CHOCOLATE!!!
 Great taste, great protein but I ordered white chocolate this time. While I like the taste of white chocolate, I think I prefer cake batter because it can easily be combined with berries for a sweet smoothie, or with peanut butter for a more savory smoothie. Cookies and cream is my favorite to use with just water for a quick, light protein shake.
 Regularly purchase this.  Great product.
 This stuff is fairly cheap and it tastes alright.<br/><br/>I've gained some strength while using it, but I also keep a strict account of all total protein that I eat.  I can't scientifically distinguish whether this is building muscle better than a lot of eggs, chicken, and beef (which I eat on a regular basis).
 I bought this and switched over from Muscle Milk and wow is there a difference. This stuff is not chunky and think. It dissolves easily into water or pancake batter. It doesnt get stuck when pouring it through a funnel. Plus there is no indigestion afterwards.
 Great product
 The vanila ice cream flavor delicious and its a great way to curb your appetite until your next meal. There are 24 grams of protein in one scoop and other good nutrients. Amazon delivered the product on time so I always order from them. So if you're looking for a protein shake that's healthy and delicious, try this one and get it from Amazon!
 Great price for a great product. I use this as a meal replacement with assorted fruit, yogurt, etc and love it. Its very effective for filling up with healthy nutrients and protein, not just before and after the gym.
 Best value for money for whey. I like the chocolate flavor. They sell this at Costco now for insanely cheap (especially when there's a coupon or manufacturer's rebate).
 Used them for years, but will never buy this brand again, no response from them when overcharged for product.
 I'm a big fan of optimum nutrition protein, and this chocolate coconut brand is no exception. It's my new favorite protein. Same great protein macros per scoop, and i drink it with milk and it tastes great! I would recommend this protein to anyone!
 One of my favorite whey protein mixes. Good flavor with the Double Chocolate, even when mixed with water, good consistency after mixing, and seems to garner decent results.
 It does what it's suppose to, it also looks badass sitting on counter too lol.
 The "delicious strawberry" flavor is to die for! Excellent quality protein.
 mixes very welll into drinks/smoothies. the vinilla mixes into practically anything. coffee, fruit drinks, cold teas and veggie drinks. adds slight vanilla flavor, but vanilla works well as a flavor enhancer.
 It's protein... The best tasting protein ever (vanilla ice cream). I use this in my morning smoothies every morning (mixed berries, spinach, almond milk, greek yogurt, oatmeal, protein powder, and about 1/4 of a pack of sugar free fat free cheesecake flavored jello pudding powder).
 Gainz. Nuff Said. Tastes great. Always shipped on time. try it with almond milk!
 Super blendable and smooth. The chocolate is delicious. Supposedly the best nutritionally on the market per our relative who's a certified professional trainer.
 Loyal to this brand,  I love chocolate and coconut but for some odd reason I don't like the taste of this.
 Vanilla ice cream tastes gross.
 I've been happy with the various flavors over the past year. Optimum Nutrition is rated as having good quality protein powder and I can't argue against it.
 And i love it
 Never disappointed in ON Gold Standard Whey. This is my favorite flavor!
 I love this product and have been using it for years so I knew it would work but I was a little sceptical about purchasing on-line because of all the problems with counterfeit items, however I can say that not only is the price great but the product itself is authentic, buy with confidence
 Love the product and this was one of the lowest prices I could find online. If you are a prime member this is the way to go
 Let me start this by saying that this protein performs just as well as other ON products, it just doesn't taste great. I mean, at first it's fine. But the taste wore on me pretty quickly. I usually mix it with plain almond milk and this helps a lot. Vanilla almond milk was far too sweet in my opinion. This stuff actually has little bits of "cookies" in it and that can be a little weird texturally. I gave it 3 stars because extreme milk chocolate is simply far superior to this in the flavor department. Don't mix this with water unless you hate your tastebuds.
 My husband uses this. The first time we bought this last year,he absolutely loved it.Not overly sweet,mixes easily with milk or water..Even I liked it.He went back to buying this again couple of months ago after trying few other protein shakes..Its a changed taste.. Tastes like I am drinking sugar syrup with little milk powder and a hint of vanilla.Too too too sweet.. My husband drinks this only when he has a sugar craving...Please go back to the old flavor with less sugar.
 Awesome protein shake, taste, flavor and mixing. Has BCAA for post workout recovery added in. I double scoop a shake on post workout, 48g of protein and 10g of bcaa. i stack this with Beast Creature, great results. Read other reviews, solid protein sup no fillers.
 Chose ON because of the favorable high protein, and low sugar ratios.<br/><br/>Of the 15 or so flavors I've tried, Banana Cream is by far the best. Highly recommend.
 I use this everyday. I am not a body builder or workout person, but it's the number one rated drink for highest protein that tastes the BEST! It gives me energy! I am not a breakfast person so I drink this in the mornings. My favorite flavor is Rocky Road. I mix it with Silk Soy and I'm getting 32 grams of protein. Been drinking it for over 2 yrs. now. It's great!
 Good product for the price. But the other brand I used tasted so much better than this and hence I take off one star. I like the way it comes in a zip lock and with a scoop
 wonderful product, great price.  you really can mix with a spoon.  great flavor and no aftertaste.
 I got the double rich chocolate.  Mixed with skimmed milk produces a very tasty, high proteiln  "chocolate shake.  No chalky taste.
 High quality, mixes well, great value.
 Taste more like a capuchino , but it's good<br/>I like better chocolat o vanilla ice cream !
 Not a sweet as some of the others, which is a good thing. Great stuff just got my second container.
 This has been my go to protein for quite a while now. Pice, taste and quality are hard to beat. Btw, imo the double chocolate taste's just like chocolate milk. Ironically, the extreme chocolate milk does not.
 Fave powder, used it to bulk before I did my summer cut last year, was effective and never got sick of the flavor *(vanilla).
 I found this was a good value.  The taste is alright and the price was a little more than what I wanted to pay.  However, I big 5 lb bottle lasted me for almost 2 months.  The product is really good, and it may be a little more expensive than some whey proteins, but I found it pretty good.
 I love the taste. I would drink this even if I didn't want the protein. I'm a little nervous about the long term affects of this s*** (it can't be healthy for the long term) but it tastes amazing with milk, so...
 Great flavor. Little high price but there isnt to much other crap in it. It is my favorite brand of protein. I sometimes blend it with almond milk, water, fresh mint leaves, and half a banana. Makes the flavor pop.
 The best protein, love the double chocolate flavor!
 This is hands down the best protein out there. I have Lyme disease so I use high levels of protein to keep me energized. This stuff if great - no bloating, low calories, mixes easily, and tastes great.
 Actually tastes great. I look forward to drinking my protein shakes. (I use milk)
 Great taste and quality. Ordered coffee flavour. Even though it says coffee on the label it’s cookies and cream inside.
 This is hands-down the best tasting whey protein powder available. I like the double rich chocolate, but YMMV. I would try more flavors if they were available in sizes smaller than a 5 pound container. 5lbs is an awful lot to buy to try it out.
 This is great protein but the Cake Batter flavor is a little too sweet for me, and I like sweet stuff. I liked it at first but now I have to chug it because the taste got super old super fast.
 You can do your own research into quality of ingredients, nutrition values, etc. But just for taste, this whey protein is undoubtedly the best tasting whey I've ever used. It mixes great, and tastes straight-up like a glass of chocolate milk. This is my favorite brand of protein. It's good stuff, too.
 Best flavor!!!
 Good product
 Gift
 Tasty
 I love optimum nutrition whey protein. They are great tasting and they provide the protein I need after my workout when I don't have the ability to make myself a high protein meal after. It is very smooth and and doesn't clump much and this makes it a joy to take.
 This brand tastes better that the other brands of strawberry flavor that I've tried.
 Just say I put on 10 pounds in 2 months. I'm doing strength  training with heavy weights.  Chocolate is the best flavor to me! This is some good stuff and basic.  Does it's job and taste great!
 good
 Nasty stuff
 Definitally the best tasting protein powder available. Also the amount of protein glutamine and BCAAS really can help your body get what it needs to develop, if your skinny and workout alot and dont see the results you want then let me tell you two things<br/>1. Work harder !!<br/>2.you probably dont have the diet that will bulk you up so this supplement will really help!
 Great quality and taste.
 You cannot beat this protein. Hands down the best tasting and highest quality product around.
 I have tried a lot of whey protein in the market, but I believe this product is the best in quality. Maybe the taste is not the best, but quality is everything since you look for a very completed powder with a mix of the best aminoacids. Totally recommended.
 It is a good way to get a lot of protein and other stuff like amino acid and glutamine with very little effort. I can't say how much it helps because there are too many factors in life that make it impossible to do a study. It is a little pricey. I take it with creatine, fish oil, and ON's multivitamin.
 My son loved the flavor and the results
 I've bought other ON products in the past including other flavors of whey, but the banana cream flavor left me unimpressed to say the least. After around 3 weeks of using it, the flavor made me gag with each use, forcing me to look for ways to mask it. Don't get me wrong, this is a great product, but I'd definitely recommend a different flavor than banana cream...
 Looks good, very satisfied.
 Ive had tons of those pre made protein shakes etc and they always taste like S***!! So I was so of skeptical to spend the money on this and it taste disgusting. I ordered the double chocolate one. And Right when you open it it smells like chocolate so I was like ok Ill try it. I make mine in a shaker bottle. Put in 1 scoop and fill the shaker cup up half way and shake and drink. It tastes like cold hot chocolate. I was so surprised. It makes drinking 2-3 protein shakes a day a nice treat. Cant wait to try the other flavors.
 it is, what it is!  ain't called the gold standard for nothing.
 Tastes great. Kinda of addicted to it!
 It's protein, what can I say?<br/><br/>Don't look into reviews on whether or not you should use protein, use them to see whether the brand is worth your investment.<br/><br/>Given the price and quality, I'd say it's worth it. The protein mixes well (I use a blender cup), and tastes relatively good, especially when mixed with milk.
 Good stuff
 I've tried several other protein shakes and found them cloyingly sweet and just unpalatable.  ON smells and tastes like hot chocolate mix - sweet enough without the overpowering flavor of artificial sweeteners.  I love adding an extra spoon of cocoa powder, chia seeds, frozen raspberries, and milk to make a delicious blended shake!
 I've tried many brands and flavors and this actually gives the drink a thicker consistency (not watery like others) and Vanilla Ice Cream goes well with the scoop of Berry Greens Plus I throw in (I use Almond Milk as the base, add in a handful of strawberries and 1/2 tsp of ground flaxseeds).  perfect meal!
 Taste horrible! I hope the fitness side of it makes up for the taste
 MY SON LOVES IT ..WE KEEP BUYING THIS SAME FLAVOUR
 Great tasting, no side effects on lactose intolerant stomachs.
 Great product long time customer.
 I have a protein shake every morning ... mocha cappichino gold standard whey plus one Starbucks via. Yummy protein coffee!
 The Vanilla Ice Cream is the safest flavor for trying new products. The taste is good with milk. I've even used it to make pancakes and waffles. ON in general has the best bang for your buck taking into consideration the percentage of actual protein vs. what the company claims.
 I take one scoop in the morning and it gives me a lot of energy to start my day
 Tried other protein powders and this one by is the easiest to drink and keeps me feeling full the longest.  Wish the company would make a protein powder that is whey free.
 Good stuff
 Good stuff
 Second time buying this product. I use it for after workouts or for smoothies. I find this brand mixes well compared to the other brands I have tried. A bit pricey upfront, but if you calculate it throughout the whole usage it's pretty cheap per serving. Would recommend!
 big
 order all the time
 Absolutely amazing! Couldn't wait to try it and couldn't find my vortex mixer so I took a spoon to it and it mixed so well with water! Rocky road flavor tastes great! I think we have a winner in the protein wars!
 I've finally learned my lesson once and for all. I will never buy another brand of whey protein. I've tried so many, and they've all disappointed. Nothing can beat Optimum Nutrition 100% whey when it comes to taste, effectiveness, and quality. Seriously, I could drink this stuff all day; It's that good. If that testimonial isn't enough for you, go Google " Labdoor whey protein test." Optimum Nutrition is the highest scoring big-name whey protein brand on the list for purity and protein content. It scored 13 out of 73 for protein quality and 5 out of 73 for overall value. Don't waste your money on nasty-tasting Muscle Pharm or horrendous-quality GNC. I've been there and done that. You know what protein shakes made with those powders taste like? Shame. Shame and disappointment.
 I highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking to:<br/><br/>- Lose Weight<br/>- Gain Muscle<br/>- Eat more often, up their metabolism<br/>- Etc.<br/><br/>All Star Health is a great company to deal with too. They ship quick and are very quick to answer any questions!<br/><br/>Just remember to switch your Whey Proteins every once in a while, it helps! =)
 I tried because I like vanilla on whey. This is way inferior.
 Love the taste and it’s really helping me to feel better! I can see the change in my body after using it for a month!
 Mixes well.  Tastes decently like milk chocolate.  I have been mixing this with PES's Cookies and Cream and it tastes great.  For the price, it's hard to beat.
 good protein, works as expected. delivers the amount of energy you need. if you workout 4-5 days a week, you will see results in 30 days. doing a good diet of course.
 Dissolves well, tastes good. I'm not a big fan of artificial sweeteners but it's alright otherwise. I add it to smoothies and drink it on its own, and it really helps with post-workout recovery.
 I've tried several protein powders on the market, and Optimum is my go to.  haven't had one that didnt taste good yet and the sugars are lower than many of the other brands
 Same flavors and similar prices as going to Nutrition Depot and you don't have to drive there. We've been buying the same brand for years.
 Best bang for your buck with preworkouts, look at the amount of servings you get out of this compared to other 5 lb tubs. There is a reason this has won supplement of the year in the past. I wouldn't go a day without this and the milk chocolate tastes great.
 I used to buy this for $30-$35 at any vitamin place... Now it's $50 plus for a tub of this stuff and there seems to be no end in sight.. This really is some great protein though (taste and macros), so if you can handle the cost I would recommend this stuff to anyone. 4 stars only for the never ending price increases, otherwise a 5-star product.
 Really good whey powder for boost during a workout. I keep buying it because this stuff is great. It completely mixes and doesn't have chunks or lumps.
 This protein tastes amazing compared to its competitors.  I can't believe how rich the chocolate tastes.  It mixes pretty well.  Usually I drink it with milk but in a pinch it's not bad with water either.  It shipped quickly and there was no damage.<br/><br/>Oh and it definitely HAS a scooper... just shake the container a little you'll find it.
 Its called gold standard for a reason, quality protien with a solid amino profile and great macro ratio. best value for the price period<br/><br/>Protip: prepare in a blender with raw eggs, spinach, and oatmeal. it tastes just as good and adds low glycemic (please excuse spelling) carbs, good fat, and micronutrients as well as fiber
 The Gold Standard...literally.  This stuff mixes well and tastes great!
 i haven't used a lot of brands - just this one and body fortress. but this one mixes a lot easier with either water or the coffee i have left over from the morning at work. it's tasty and seems to work as far as i can tell. i'm no professional body builder, but it's good IMO
 I've tried multiple different protein shakes, and this is by far the best tasting.  I actually look forward to drinking it after a work out.
 Double chocolate was pretty good. It blended well. Taste was not as chocolate flavor as it could of been.
 I got a 2 pound the first time just to try it out....but now that I've tried it I like it much better then other brands I've tried. I think this is a decent deal for 5lb also. The stuff tastes pretty good, mixes very well &amp; stays mixed, doesn't make my stomach churn 30 minutes later....all in all I would recommend it. I intend to reorder when the time comes.
 Bought the vanilla ice cream flavor of this whey protein powder and I am not dissapointed! Best whey protein out there! Getting noticeable results. Girls are all over my biceps now that I lift and drink this shake after every workout! Doesn't taste good unless you mix with milk. I drink with water so it is a low calorie shake so I keep those washboard abs for the ladies. Enjoy!
 I ordered the "Double Rich Chocolate" flavor.  Great taste.  Other protein powders I tried tend to be a little too sweet for me.  This one is perfect.  Great in my smoothies!
 AMAZING TASTE!!!! I will be buying more when I run out. Mixes really well, high protein dosage, amino acids, everything you could want. I highly recommend it.
 This is our second round of purchasing this item. Fast shipping and surprisingly great taste. I would recommend this to someone who is currently working out and building muscle. I drink mine after a work out with a banana. I've seen results.
 Tried others but I'm sure that this is the :whey" to go!
 A few years ago I tried every vanilla protein powder out there. I was about to undergo bariatric surgery, and knew I would have to supplement with protein the rest of my life, so I wanted something that tasted great and was easy to use - or I might not keep up with it. Well ON Vanilla Ice Cream flavored whey protein fit the bill then and I'm STILL drinking it. I drink it in cold two percent milk. It melts quickly without the need for a blender. It's creamy without being thick. It tastes as good as melted Hagen Das vanilla ice cream. And unlike products that contain soy, I've had no digestion problems with it.
 Great taste and texture
 As you can read from all of the other reviews, this is a GREAT whey protein.<br/><br/>BUT THE REAL QUESTION IS... which flavor to pick?<br/><br/>I'm on my fourth 5lb can of ON Whey.<br/><br/>My first batch was Vanilla - seemed like a safe choice.  Hated it.  Worst vanilla ever.  Not nearly as good as Muscle Milk's Vanilla.  Of course, MM is also a crappy protein with tons of carbs you don't want.<br/><br/>My second batch was Double Chocolate.  It was good.  Although still a little "proteiny" flavored, I figured this was the best I could expect from ON, and went for DC again on my 3rd batch..<br/><br/>This time around, when I went to reorder DC again, I accidentally chose Banana Cream.  OH THE HORROR!  I figured "it's just protein" though, and decided to man-up and drink it.<br/><br/>HOLY S#!7!!!  BEST FREAKING PROTEIN POWDER FLAVOR EVER!!<br/><br/>Dare I say it's even better than Muscle Milk Vanilla?<br/><br/>I dare!!  :)
 Optimum Nutrition 100% GOLD STANDARD WHEY in the Chocolate Malt flavor is very good.  I personally cannot stomach the other flavors but the chocolate malt is like a soda fountain drink. So glad the flavor is available because it is a great nutritional product for anyone.
 Industry standard. Tastes great.
 Lovely tasting product with excellent meal replacement functionality
 i use this as base for mu morning smoothies. i have chocolate mint right now, but i'll definitely try on different flavors of this brand. it tastes great!
 Amazing flavor and it goes well with bananas, so good! I'm not to sure about gains, but I've been using it for 2 months, don't  see much of a change.
 I love this product.  It mixes well and tastes great.
 Great!
 Great item, Great service!
 good amount of servings
 Pretty good but a little sweet. I don't want to change over to chocolate but I used to use strawberry and was happy with that for years, I think I just got bored of the taste but my next batch will be strawberry.
 just what i need
 I've tried plenty of protein shake powders in the last 15 years and this is the first that I've found that truly tastes good. While I can't necessarily attribute my recent weight/muscle gain to this product (since I've recently started lifting regularly after an inconsistent period), I have definitely seen improvement. Recently finished my first 5 lb. container (Double Rich Chocolate) and on to my next (Extreme Milk Chocolate). Both taste good, but the Double is the better of the two.
 Super product; makes low carbs / high protein easy. Building muscles and losing weight!
 Great quality of product. Taste better than most flavors as well.
 The taste is very rich and once you mix it up with milk or your favorite drink, you can be sure to savor its deliciousness. The fact that this protein provides 24g of protein with almost zero carbs and fat speaks for its products quality. The scoop comes in the bucket.
 Simply the best. Great taste and proven product.
 The best tasting protein powder that I have found to date!  Good dissolution so it doesn't have the grit that some of the others do.
 Ideally it would have less carbs per serving, but it's pretty good value for the amount you get.<br/>I found that I didn't digest it as well as other whey proteins I've tried, and had a bit more gas - I'm not sure if that's a comment on the quality or not, but that was my experience.<br/><br/>Tastes good, mixes well, good value.
 Best on the market.
 Great protein. Make sure you drink water after a shake though, can make you feel a little nauseous.
 I think I have found my absolute favorite flavor EVER! Mint Chocolate rules!
 Chocolate malt is probably the best tasting Gold Standard whey I've had. I have tried Chocolate Mint and Extreme Milk Chocolate and they both have a strongly artificial flavor.<br/><br/>100% Whey Gold Standard is also very low in carb, for people following a ketogenic diet.
 Great taste and great that I only have to use 1 scoop so it lasts longer. Good Product.
 Best protein ratio for the price...
 Actually tastes good.
 Excellent!!!
 Very good flavor.
 can't go wrong with this, all time favorite.
 its pretty good whey protein but I didn't like the taste. every time after a workout I would feel like its more of a punishment to drink it then a treat. I recommend to buy the small one to see if you like it before buying the large one. I never finished it by the way couldn't stomach the taste so I got the cookies n cream version much better.
 good
 It is good - I just think it's too expensive. Good quality I know, but it's hard to keep up with it if I have to buy one of this a month.
 Mix it with water and it tastes great! Chocolate Coconut is my favorite flavor.
 Awesome!
 It tastes terrible.
 Gold standard whey is, bottom line, the top protein on the market. Its taste is good, it's creamy, and it packs a good protein punch. It's a little pricey considering how much I consume, but the quality is worth the price.
 When I opened this up and smelled it I thought I was going to be drinking Nesquik.  I use it every day in my morning smoothie.  Mixed up with some fruit and almond milk it tastes great.  Price is comparable with other websites.
 Came fast! Taste good
 Tastes just like chocolate milk but not overly sweet.  Great to mix in with smoothies and shakes.  With others I get really sick of the flavor after going through 5 lbs of it.  Not with the Double Chocolate, it's great!
 Excellent product. You can spend more on whey isolate but why when this is as good as it is. This should be what everyone takes following a workout.
 Has a weird smell when mixed.  Didn't notice this with other brands I've purchased in the past.
 Low Carb, Good Quality Protein!
 I love this whey protein, very good flavor
 I drink this protein mixed with water throughout the morning to keep my level of energy while working with young children.
 Gave me massive acne breakouts. Beware!!!!
 Love this product, and got here very quickly.
 came opened. thru it out. was affraid to use it after it was delivered with the seal broke and in the lid of the bottle.
 When I first bought this product I was very concerned it was going to taste nasty. When I tried it I was surprised. I wouldn't say it is the best tasting thing I ever had but it isn't horrible. I drink this directly after my workout and by doing this I feel because I am thristy, tired, and want something cold to drink that I don't even notice the flavor at all. A little tip if the flavor is to much use a little extra milk or water (I perfer skim milk) it dilutes the flavor a little bit.
 Awesome product.
 Delicious
 Good chocolate taste and reasonably priced. I will purchase again
 I am a 24 yr old girl. I like to work out. My boyfriend asked me to buy it for him so I did. Then I researched if women are allowed to drink protein and they are so I tried it.  Tastes good &amp; good quality. I recommend a special shaker cup though because it stays in chunks. We bought the double chocolate.
 Easy going down.  Each new container has a consistent taste/texture.  Worth it if you are bulking, need a snack, or can't eat any more chicken breast.
 Wasn't sure about the cake batter flavor when I ordered, best decision ever.  I had never ordered a non-chocolate flavor, but after ordering this I don't know if I will ever order a different flavor.
 One of the reasons I buy ON protein powders is because their bottles usually got more servings than the competitors'. I tried the<br/>Double Rich Chocolate before and the taste was fine (not great). However, the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor tastes horribly and funny, no matter how much I try to alter the mixture. I do not recommend this flavor and I would suggest picking something else.
 It's the gold standard for a reason.  Very affordable, high protein per serving, low carb, and it tastes great.  It has more servings per container than other brands also.  I go through a ton of this stuff, and this one saves me some pocket change.
 Have always been an ON fan. Forever and always. Yum
 Good protein powder for my workout. You definitely get more for the price with this product
 My son was very happy with this purchase!
 Has a strong cake smell.. Yes, it's cake batter flavor.. But the taste is not strong at all. It's just right! It's not over powering.
 My husband works 14hr days so he doesnt get enough opportunity to eat throughout the day so i make him these shakes 2scoops with veggies and fruit helps to keep him going
 I've only been taking for 1 wk now and I'm not negatively reviewing the efficacy of this protein as a muscle builder...merely the taste.  Perhaps I've been spoiled by the likes of Muscle Milk when it comes to cookies and cream but this stuff...not the greatest-tasting concoction I've had for sure.  I usually drink the chocolate Gold Standard and I'll prob just go back to that after I choke down this tub.
 I use this for breakfast. It tastes great, unlike some other protein powders, and it keeps me full until later in the AM. I've ordered this through a different site, for a similar price, but had to pay shipping. Glad to see I can get it here instead.
 I always buy ON whey. I prefer the gold standard whey over the isolate, even though the isolate has a few more grams of protein per scoop. I've had several different flavors, and I like to try something different each time. I was not a fan of the vanilla shake, it reminded me of cake batter ice cream..I love cake batter ice cream, but I was expecting it to taste more like plain vanilla, and I just dont like the idea of drinking cake batter, so I wont be buying that flavor again. I really like the Chocolate Malt flavor and I think that's my favorite so far. I most recently purchased Rocky Road because of the rave reviews. I definitely really like it. I usually drink it with water, although it honestly doesn't taste very much like the ice cream flavor if you mix it with water. If you mix it with milk, it tastes AWESOME and very similar to the ice cream. However, I usually use water for various reasons and so I don't love it quite as much as I would otherwise. It has a weird aftertaste (with the water) and I don't really know how to describe its general flavor, other than very "artificial"... I feel the need to chug it to "get it over with" because I dont really enjoy the rocky road flavor that much (unless it's with milk, but I dont usually use milk). Chocolate malt tastes good with water or milk, same with Double chocolate.<br/><br/>As always, this protein blends super easily with water or milk, I always use a shaker cup so I have no idea how easy it mixes with a regular cup and a spoon/fork, but probably easier than most other proteins in my experience. Never clumpy.
 This is the most consistent protein powder I've found so far.  Any other brand or flavor just seems to make me sick after a few doses and I can't finish the whole container, while this has been my "go to" for years because it's so easy to drink.
 Cake batter is a great taste. Prior to using this product, I was using Mal Wart protein which was absolutely horrible. This does produce gains. I feel like I will never run out of it either. Literally as big as my head if not bigger.
 I have tried many different proteins an this is by far my favorite! The taste is awesome, and it mixes very well with 2% milk! I will continue to order this protein from now on.
 A lot of people try to compare the effects of protein powders, which is basically impossible for one to truly do. All I can say is that I have continued to see gains using ON and that the cookies and cream flavor tastes really good after the third or fourth time you've tried it.
 Excellent quality.
 It tastes grrrrreat!
 Protein powder as expected.
 Great price. Great packaging, and the flavor is really good as well. Is worth noting that the spoon is inside of it, so keep looking!
 Always the best. Highest protein per gram of product on the market. Will use this for a lifetime.
 great taste (strawberry)
 Tastes great!
 My first protein powder and I'm in love. The Strawberry Banana is out of this world. Just the thought that I'll have a shake after a workout motivates me to go do it. Fishing the scooper was a challenge of mind and concentration. Very happy
 Really added a new dimension to choc or vanilla routine. Yes, couldve gone to some thing exotic, but since I mix with fruits taste quality varied poorly.
 Yum!!!  great tasting protein
 I remember first seeing a tub of this on my RA's desk in college. I started working out and taking protein my freshman year and never looked back since. I've tried a couple of other protein powders (weight gainers, different isolates, etc.) but I always came back to this one because it just works and it tastes great. I always get the Double Rich Chocolate.<br/><br/>Random note:<br/><br/>I love cereal. Mix this with milk (almond milk works really well) and you have chocolate milk for cereal.
 Optimum Nutrition is the best product i have used and purchased. Great things from this brand.
 I am giving it 5 stars for the sole purpose of being a protein mix and you can't expect much from a protein mix. It taste pretty much identical to my vanilla flavored mix by a different brand. It does dissolve better in the water then other brands I have tried.
 Delicious
 The Best!
 I drink it with 2% milk, with lil Hershey's syrup and ice cubes crushed in blender....love chocolate flavor(havent tried other flavors)...like it so far..supposed to be good protein as trainer recommends.
 Mixes well and has good taste specifically the double chocolate. Good price and have been ordering for a year.
 10lbs of protien is a hefty amount but when you're a genetic beast lobster, you need it! This stuff not only helps you transform into a greek god but it also tastes like it was forged by Swiss Chocolate Wizards. It's great stuff!
 Great flavor and great value!
 Used this product for years - works really well, taste is pretty good, does not clump like other protein powders, and helps with body recovery.
 People have left a lot of negative reviews about the new formula on whey protein powder. here's my take:<br/>1. no aminogen digestive enzymes: I'm too lazy to do a google on it but think about it: your stomach acid is some VERY STRONG ACID. Acid denatures proteins. Then pepsin kicks in and further breaks down the denatured protein into peptides, then amino acids, then get absorbed by your body. Bottom line is maybe aminogen work but it can be a hoax. Also if you really think it works and your body just can't absorb protein that well, why don't you buy some aminogen and try for yourself? They have it in pallet form and to me it has a better chance surviving the stomach acids then going to the intestines than the powder form. Just like a lot of people saying "dont fix it if it aint a problem," why overdose on these digestive enzymes when you can sufficiently absorb nutrients without a digesting problem?<br/>2. fillers. From what I've seen most formula still maintains 75-80% protein by weight. Also it really depends on the flavor. The one I got is double chocolate and it has a pretty short ingredient list. Amazon does a bad job listing the nutrition facts but you can easily check it up on bodybuilding.com. Now if you really don't like artificial sweeteners you can try the natural flavored ones.<br/>Also don't panic when you see "artificial." computers are not natural. cars are not natural. a lot of drugs, including the cancer and HIV drugs are not natural. They are not necessarily a bad thing and a lot of complaints I saw were "they make you think you can eat other sweets" and "they mess up your taste somehow." Well again there are natural flavored options and they are not always bad.<br/>as for the product itself:<br/>mixing is pretty bad but my previous protein powder from muscletech is also horrible. maybe I just didn't swirl with my spoon enough but they do not mix fully with skim milk.<br/>taste is fine to me. Again it really depends on the flavors, the one I have is double chocolate, it smells like chocolate a lot but it doesnt taste sweet at all, since I'm expecting a sweet chocolate taste. Maybe my tastebuds got screwed up by the artificial sweeteners, god knows why. Now the muscletech vanilla flavor is really sweet.<br/>as for the ingredients:Protein Blend(Whey Protein Isolate, Cultured Whey Protein Concentrate, Whey Peptides), Cocoa(Processed With Alkali), Artificial Flavors, Lecithin, Acesulfame Potassium,  Lactase. 78% protein by weight(24g/30g), definitely not bad.<br/>People have suggested met-rx as an alternative to this. its 20% cheaper and honestly I dont find a big deal with the 2g sugar per serving from the met-rx ones. There's online websites doing this protein powder review and some says the myprotein brand has the best value/protein per serving. really if you are that concerned, try them all out.
 I've tried Double Rich Chocolate, French Vanilla Creme, Banana Creme, Caramel Toffee Fudge, and Cookies and Cream, and just plain ol' Coffee is my favorite.  Not because it tastes the best on it's own, though, but because the Coffee flavor seems to mix the best with other things like psyllium husk and Green Vibrance.  It's got a strong flavor that doesn't just blend or clash with other things but overpowers them.  This is a very good thing when mixing it with "superfoods" like GV and other things that taste bad.
 I've loved every flavor of this stuff that I've tried, but Cake Batter is definitely my #1. I use about 3-5 scoops of this stuff over the course of a day, and never get tired of the taste.
 I have had many different protein powders. This is my favorite. The taste is great, and it shakes up nicely.
 I've probably gone through about 10 of these in the past 5 months.  It is the only type of whey that I will use, and in particular this flavor.  I love it!  I mostly use it in my protein shakes that include a frozen banana, peanut butter, ice, granola, and water.  So dang good!
 Repeat purchase. Always a good buy.<br/>I'm not as crazy about this chocolate malt flavor as I am with the milkshake, and the double chocolate, but it's nice to try a new flavor. tastes fine with milk.
 Tastes like a junior mint.  Very good quality protein.
 This stuff is AMAZING!!It is the best protein powder i have ever tasted. love the chocolate milk taste!
 Like ON Casein, I've been taking ON Gold Standard 100% Whey for a number of years now.  Except for increases in price, I haven't really noticed the changes that I've been reading about.  It's getting to be expensive though I'll keep buying it until I can't afford it.
 This is the only protein that I buy.  I love it.  The Vanilla Ice Cream flavor mixes well with everything.
 Great taste
 My sons use this stuff. They like it and have no complaints so....
 Good
 Great product. Thanks.
 My husband loves this item I've been purchasing for a long time, great seller, great price and fast service, thank you
 Perhaps one of the protein supplements in the market. For my taste though, I wish there was a non-sweat version. I hate to use artificial sweeteners.
 Got the rocky road, does smell pretty strongly of marshmallow, but tastes great and at least is good by nutritional value.
 The sweetener that they use makes me feel ill. Not a big fan.
 Not too much to say about this protein.  It is one of the top brands that I use, and it tastes great!  I have purchased this multiple times now, and I have yet to have a complaint.  The stuff mixes well with anything.  If you are looking for a good protein this is it.  On top of that Amazon has a great price on it!
 OK not that tasty
 Go to protein product.
 Surprisingly delicious if you're a chocolate lover. I'm glad I got the 2 week one to check it out. Will be purchasing again.
 Optimum Nutrition is the only protein supplement I will use. Tastes great, even with just water, also especially good for smoothies.
 All time favourite
 Love the Chocolate Malt
 Love it, great quality and taste, I am about to order my second one.
 The product is great.
 If you are looking for a protien powder with out alot of fat, carbs and espeacially sugar in it, then this is the best whey protien on the market. Hands Down! Ive been taking this for years and love it.
 Good product. No problem.
 I used protein for 15 years now and cannot find a better flavor than the Rocky Road. It mixes very well with milk and even water. Try the Rocky Road if you are getting tired of the usual chocolate or vanilla. Be careful though, you may not ever go back. I know I won't.
 deliciouse
 definitely works if you put in the time and effort, but you will gain weight. for serious people only.
 I have used many ON products over the last five or six years, but I have to say that this is probably the best all around product that they have. I would recommend that you use milk, you will be much happier with the taste that way. I take a hit of this mixed with ON's micronized creatine powder before and after a workout, and that has been doing the job for me. Overall it is a very good product.
 Optimum Nutrition is the best dissolving and tasting protein supplement you can get per price.  Purchase a 5lb bucket and you will receive about 71 servings.  I've tried Chocolate Malt, Coffee and now this flavor.  It's more bland then extreme. Taste almost like watered down hot chocolate, even if you mix it with milk.  Although I mix my drinks with Almond milk.  I would not purchase this flavor again, but will continue trying different flavor variations.
 Great tasting protein powder.  My wife and I utilize this daily in our morning smoothies.
 I work out lightly and like to use protein drinks to fill in meals. I've always had a problem with the taste of these drinks but I actually look forward to drinking this stuff. It tastes like ice cream. If I remember it took a little while to get completely used to it but not I love it!
 Tastes fine for having artificial sweeteners.  Ordered this accidentally instead of the natural stuff.
 So so yummy! Love this product so much. Tastes amazing and is great for you! Great in a smoothie!! Helps curb my hunger in a healthy way!
 Good taste and dissolves well. I love mixing it with milk and a little malted milk post workout. It taste like I'm having a legitimate shake that way.
 Stuff tastes good and seems to be working good. It's high quality and you get a ton of whey, around 75 servings I believe. Has low cholesterol which you want with whey protein. Highly recommend for a great price
 Very good product
 I've been using ON gold standard for over a year now.  The price can't be beat.  The taste is pretty good and it does mix well.  I'd say using a shaker cup (any cup or lid will do) mixes it the best.  The price is really good too.  Great for my post workout protein.
 Delicious. Fair Price. Mixes Well.
 This is one of my favorite proteins.  The chocolate is delicious.  No fake sugars.  Low carbs.  Good buy.  It was delivered the same day.
 We've used this through the summer. We use it for protein shakes at breakfast and we are pleased with it. I'll be ordering some more when we run out.
 Love the taste.
 I didn't like this product.
 I've tried many protein powders, but this is the only brand I have bought repeatedly. The taste is amazing. I recommend mixing it with skim milk because it tastes MUCH better than mixing it with water.
 My husband and I have seen great gains with this. The taste is good and we add Cacao powder to boost the flavor/add more vitamins &amp; minerals. Hubby is also lactose intollerant and this doesn't upset his system at all.
 This is my go-to Whey product. I purchase one every other month or so for myself and my husband.
 I've been taking this brand for years and I'm satisfied with the results.  However, the Coconut flavor gave it an oily, fake taste.  I will finish the container--it's not horrible or anything-- but I'll stick with plain old chocolate from now on.
 It tastes great, and mixes in well. I hate protein drinks that are gritty, this tastes and feels just as good as regular chocolate milk.
 I Love it!
 I love this protein!  It is the best protein for the price that I have found (including bodybuilding.com).  With my Amazon Prime account I get free 2 day shipping and you can't beat that. This protein tastes pretty good and even with 1.5 scoops after a workout it's lasted me more than a month.
 Blends well, tastes good. I've ordered about 10 of these over the last couple years and double chocolate wins every time.<br/><br/>I prefer to use it in: Milk, Soy Milk, Almond Milk or Lactose free Milk.
 Great quality.
 good !
 I love it, specially because it is my favorite flavor. I was amazed on the reviews of this product. So many people can't be wrong!!
 Taste great, blends great. Ive stuck to Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard for almost 6 months now, I don't see myself switching.
 The taste is not overwhelming which is awesome and not too many calories per scoop either. I've also seen definite gains in body composition.<br/>DISCLAIMER: protein powder should and must be used in conjunction with a clean and healthy diet along with regular excercise.
 Yeah, so the idea of cake batter flavored protein powder sounded like a great idea, but not in a 5lb. container...wow! It was great for the first few pounds (blending with various fruits/almond milk) but it got very old after that.
 great source of protein. tastes bad regardless but its one of the better ones.
 Prompt, efficient service; excellent product at a reasonable price.
 Absolutely fantastic tasting protein. This Flavor is really good. Very clean protein that I've been using for years. A+
 I used to buy the cheap $15 body fortress protein from Walmart and it was horrible so I decided to take a chance and buy this protein instead and it's amazing!! It tastes great and makes my muscles bigger! Couldn't ask for more
 I like it!!!
 Coffee is one of my favorites. Currently exploring my way through the flavors. They all mix well, and taste like they say.
 It is as advertised. It was delivered quickly. Seller did a great job. I mix it with sugar free almond milk and it tastes like drinking chocolate milk. No carbs only protien.
 Only protein I buy is Optimum Nutrition. Best tasting brand out there for a good price.
 DO NOT BUY "StrawBerry Banana" Unless you like Pepto-Bismol flavor. Otherwise, good product highly recommended!
 I love the flavor. Being on weight watchers this is perfect as it's loaded with protein and 0 points. I especially like mixing it with almond milk and frozen fruit.
 ON protein is always good. But let's talk flavor, I just finished my Mocha Cappuccino(which is really good if you're into coffee). The delicious strawberry tastes pretty good, when I open the tub it smelled sooo sweet! So, overall, I would recommend it if flavor it's always the priority when buying any protein powder
 good product
 Banana Cream goes with everything. If you mix it withe milk you will be astonished. It also dissolves very well even in milk. made all kinds of Gainzz already.. All kindzzz.... LOL. No doubt Whey Gold Standard is the way to go when in comes to quality protein, and even Creatin. Definitely will by again. 5 pound one is the beast. But if your nut sure about the flavour, first order a smaller one.
 Good
 So yummy!
 my favorite protein powder.  i always buy it here great quality nice future expiration date and best price.
 Chocolate mint smells awesome. None of the mint smell transfers over once mixed which is a little disappointing because i love chocolate mint. Out of all the chocolate flavors this one is the most bland.
 It's delicious, exactly what I expected, and since it's whey protein isolate, there's no content that bothers my stomach even though I'm lactose-intolerant!
 My previous favorite flavor was the cookies and creme and now this mocha one tastes like those iced ones from starbucks. Im more of a dark roast guy but this gets the job done for me and turns me on and makes me want to drink more. Mixes great.
 I've tried many different protein powders, but I always come back to this one after one try.  Every time I try other products, I regret it because the others are so hard to mix even with water.  This also is the best tasting too.  So, I don't even try any other product now.
 Excellent product.
 good price lots of flavors
 A little watery as far as flavor goes (typical for isolates), but it does the job (with fewer calories than concentrate). Nice Product!
 I absolutely love this product I got the vanilla ice cream and it tastes like vanilla ice cream very big will last a while mixes very well compared to other whey protein I've tried, great product  will buy again.
 Superfast shipping great product. I love this protein it's really one of the best protein powders money can buy.
 Excellent product.  Excellent service.
 Get swoll
 Taste Great
 The chocolate malt flavor is too sweet, IMO. I wish it were the same sweetness as the double chocolate.
 absolutely delicious !!!  first protein powder i've purchased and i'm so glad i went with extreme milk chocolate - i look forward to drinking this every day and pretty much chug my shakes because it's so good ... can't wait to try more flavors !
 Just the best product out there. Unlike other Whey products, this is 100% Whey. Many products out there are not as effective as ON's Whey!<br/><br/>Love this product. Chocolate also tastes very good!
 The double chocolate is great tasting and I am still not sick of it even after finishing. I will try different flavors, but so far chocolate has made a great impression.
 Best protein powder for the money by far. So many good flavors as well. Milk chocolate, double chocolate, and chocolate espresso are all amazing. On banana cream now.
 I use this for milkshakes *AND* I add it to my cereal and milk!  Tastes great!
 tastes pretty good!
 works wonders, one of the best proteins i have taken. Almost no fillers
 Product as described.
 Cookies and cream is my favorite flavor but this did not taste anything like it! Has more of a caramel taste to it. Couldnt stomach a whole scoop. returned it right away.
 Tastes pretty good. Mixes well.
 Good protein.  Probably won't go with cookies and creme again, but will be buying more in a different flavor.
 Best bang for the buck protein out there. Used it for years and will continue to. The coffee flavor is ok, but if you get a chunk you will know it in a hurry. I recommend cake batter as the absolute best mixing/tasting flavor
 Love this stuff. I bought the mocha cappuccino flavor. I’m on my 4th or 5th container now. One of the few protein powers I can drink and actually enjoy it. I mix mine with water and little ice. Sometimes ill throw in some PB2 just to change it up.  Can't go wrong.
 Tastes great and mixes so well in water. I always do 2 scoops in about 10 ounces of water for a great quick shake.
 great product great price!
 It is good protein with decent price. I like the White Chocolate flavor better than double chocolate flavor so I took out 1 star. I will get the White Chocolate for next order.
 Tastes good n worth it
 The double chocolate flavor is just amazing. I think I just workout often just so that I can have this Whey after workout.
 Only whey protein I use. Rocky road is the best flavor. Was able to gain 15 lbs when I combined it with creatine, and working out 4-5 days a week.
 If you just want some protein that is effective, choose this one. I love strawberry, it tastes great (i drink mine with low fat milk as opposed to water) and it definitely helps with your workout routine. I used it mainly for recovery not so much to help bulk.
 I've used this for well over a year and it is the best tasting, most mixable protein powder on the market.  It does cost more than a lot of the other powders, but it has such low fat content and tastes so good that I consider it worth the extra money.
 Ive been stuck on GNC so long.. the additives would bloat me up.. PLUS it was $$$!! I'm a firm believer everyone's body will process ingested products differently. This may work for one person and not as well for the next. For me, I never really saw gains taking GNC pro performance WheyBolic... I'm a big guy 6'6" 240lbs so taking 2 or 3 scoops a day was hard with how $$ it is and probably not enough protein anyway.<br/><br/>  Don't get me wrong I love GNC's Megamen vitamins and vita-packs (basically assembled their vita-pack researching on my own without knowing it  megamen, omega 3s, iodine/kelp and glucosamine/calcium lol).<br/><br/>  SO ANYWAY I take Optimum Nutrition WGS after a week of working out with GNC and in two days i started seeing subtle gains I'd NO JOKE see in a two weeks on GNC protein. ??? Also noticing when I take alot of WGS after a workout I don't crave protein until the next day as if my muscles are 'still full.' I cant describe it really, its like my muscles are starting to tell me when they need it and when they don't and from this I can tell how much I need. Also recovery is faster than ever and no bloating..<br/><br/>  No promises but this stuff works with my metabolism and muscles and its cheaper. Guys and Gals if you do have breakouts when you work out I recommend lowering additives and compensating with wholesome protein. (Also KYOKA face wash works well if you rinse cold before getting out).
 I've always used ON protein powder and other supplements.  I usually go for fruit punch for the summer, however the cake batter and making it into protein icecream is quite a treat, would recommend.
 Great protein. I take it daily with water or milk, doesn't matter. Tastes good with water, tastes like a gourmet milkshake with milk. I even mix it into oatmeal sometimes, it's not terrible.<br/><br/>Great protein and it's been shown that the actual protein content is very very close to what is advertised (compared to lots of other powders which were found to not be anywhere close to what's on the label).<br/><br/>Great price as well. I will never buy another powder, barring some major change in the formula.
 This is the best protein on the market. Simple
 As recommended by MuscleHack.com, this is the BEST most complete protein source. I received it with free shipping on AmazonPrime in 2 days!
 Great product and also shipped fast.
 I just wished they had a "flavorless" version.
 The best Whey Protein! Mixes well and tastes great. I usually fix a bowl of raisin bran, old fashion oats, and a scoop of this powder (vanilla) for an afternoon/ pre-workout snack.
 Great tasking Protein shake. I like to mix this with Doctor Smoothie for ultimate taste.
 The taste is okay...
 Pretty much the standard in whey protein supplement. I've tried other brands, but this taste the best and is easily digestible. I like it with rice milk.
 Perfect taste. very delicious. but to expensive.
 Nicely packed and delivered as promised
 Very good! The protein makes for a great recovery after workout and for a great start to one's day. I can definitely notice gains after using this after workouts. Optimum lives up to its name; I was originally told about this by someone else and after using it, I can definitely say that this is good. I've gotten multiple tubs since the first time I tried it. Recommend to all.
 I purchased this product as a supplement to slightly increase overall protein intake by using it once a day in a smoothie. The Vanilla flavor is nicely realistic. Other similar products I have used leave an artificial flavor on your taste buds. The consistency of the powder is such that it does not clump up, at least not when processed in a good blender. Overall I rate it as an excellent choice.
 usual I pick up these protein from local GNC store, this time I decide to try on amazon since GNC no longer offer buy one get one 50% off. Good quality and exactly like the one got from the store.
 ON is a high quality product, and a good choice overall, but I cannot, under any circumstances, recommend the Chocolate Mint flavor. It's gross and I'm a little upset that I have to suffer through a whole five pounds of it.
 It tastes glorious and each scoop is full of BCAA's and glutamine. I love this protein. For the price you can't beat it; especially for what you get.
 Amazing price
 Long time fan of ON's protein and products in general. High quality at a decent price.
 Good product
 Awesome deal 100 at gnc
 After years of either chocolate or vanilla whey, I took the chance on this Strawberry and its delicious!!  ON always worth the price!
 I think this is an acquired taste.  It is VERY sweet in a strange sort of way but I've gotten used to it.
 Great product
 For waaay too long I used to go to a supplement store for all my workout stuff. I was overspending like crazy. Finally I decided to buy my stuff online and started saving so much cash.  The supplement store sells this for $25 more than Amazon. Its a no-brainer.
 The gold standard for a good reason.
 Perfect for my snack between meals.
 Great taste! Love it!
 I started back to weightlifting and I needed some nutrition. This is a good start. I think this is quality at a great price
 Optimum Nutrition's Extreme Milk Chocolate is a very tasty product!  I have tried their French Vanilla Creme, Vanilla Ice Cream, Cookies and Cream, and Double Rich Chocolate and my wife and I both agree on the Milk Chocolate being the best of the bunch there.<br/><br/>Both of the vanilla flavors tasted pretty similar to one another and were pretty good and easy to mix other "things" in.  What will turn either of them into AWESOME is to take a scoop of whey, about a cup of ice, half a cup of low-fat vanilla yogurt, one cup of frozen strawberries, and one cup of skim milk (need a big glass!).  Blend that together for a shake that tastes sinfully good!  We have used other fruit, but if you like strawberries, you can't go wrong there.<br/><br/>Another option with either of the vanillas is to mix just like above, but leave the fruit out, bump the milk up to one and a half cups, and put in about one quarter teaspoon of nutmeg.  It takes a little imagination, but it will have an eggnog flavor that is pretty darn good.<br/><br/>Both of the chocolates are pretty similar tasting too, but the milk chocolate is our preference.  My "normal" shake there again is about one cup of ice, half a cup of low-fat vanilla yogurt, one and a half cups of milk, one scoop of whey, and I like it sweeter, so I add in 8 drops of toffee flavored Stevia (also sold here on Amazon).  Love it!  Every now and then if I am needing more calories for the day, I will make that same shake but add in 1 tablespoon of peanut butter.  Ok, so Reeses still does it better, but you'll appreciate this recipe if you are a fan of peanut butter cups!  Instead of peanut butter, try a scoop of instant coffee for a mocha.<br/><br/>The Cookies and Cream flavor kinda missed the mark in my book.  It has a twang to it that I just don't like.  Chocolate and vanilla are way more versatile in my opinion and let me make them into whatever I want them to be, so I'm going to stick with them!
 While not as tasty as some other powders it is the easiest mixing powder I have ever used. Great price and simple product. All protein. Love it and will absolutely buy again.
 Taste great with milk!
 I like it so much, I keep reordering when one runs out.<br/><br/>The main reason I like it is because it only contains a small amount of carbo's and fat; and when I have to dissolve it in a plain glass of water, it dissolves, not completely, but reasonably well for just stirring with a spoon and has a very slightly sweet taste that makes it acceptable in plain water.
 This is good protein. I was not looking for anything too fancy and this is a great deal as far as whey goes. The product is a little lacking on the flavor side. Make sure you drink it in milk, anything else is going to taste like crap. If are really into flavor, check out BSN Syntha-6. It is not 100% whey but the flavor beats anything else I have tried; you could mix it with water and it would taste like a milkshake.
 love this stuff, great flavor and would definitely buy again. comes with perfectly sized scoop.<br/><br/>I prefer with milk and maybe some fruit in my blender but definitely tolerable with only water.
 Excellent product and service. Tastes great.
 Ive been buying this protein for years, its the only one I use. Both the flavor is good and it helps me meet my protein requirements in order to get gains in the gym.<br/><br/>Throw in frozen banana with some milk and a scoop of this in your blender and you have a freaking amazing &amp; healthy milkshake
 As a novice who just started adding Whey to my diet and work-out, I don't pretend to be any kind of authority. But I did do my research before purchasing this and I have zero regrets. This is easily the tastiest protein/Whey powder I've ever tasted (and I've tried my share). It blends beautifully so it's always perfectly smooth and never grainy, and it isn't disgustingly sweet or anything either. This is a fabulous product. Incredibly versatile and worth every penny!
 Loved it
 Finally found the taste which is good with water ( so I can take powder with me and mix it right after workout )
 Great price, you already know this brand. Good deal.
 Cheap and good.  Not a hardcore bodybuilder.  Use mainly as a meal replacement at breakfast.  8 oz milk, squirt of chocolate syrup.  Tasty and good until lunch.
 This stuff with chocolate milk is amazing. It's like i'm not trying to be healthy.
 Tastes great and mixes very easily.  The best bang for your buck.
 This is a good quality, good tasting, and very blendable protein powder. I have nothing but good things to say.
 You can't buy whey by price. It has to be by quality. Here lies top quality and great taste.
 Mixes well and the vanilla flavor can be mixed in with your intrawork carb of choice and will be fairly tasty.
 I would give this 2 stars but I didn't want to drag the rating down too much as this is excellent protein. However, for a vanilla flavor, I found this protein to be pretty disgusting. I tried mixing with both water and vanilla almond milk and didn't like it either way. I will not buy this flavor or the banana flavor again.
 Best tasting whey protein I have tried. I wish it was less expensive, but the number or calories per gram of protein is worth it.
 Its absolutely a great product for workout nutrition, and the price is so much cheaper than buying it from the gym. and the taste of it is so much better than I thought!! I bought CHOCOLATE MALT flavor and it tastes just like chocolate milk!! Ive tried chocolate malt and chocolate flavor but chocolate malt is much better.
 This was my first purchase of this brand.<br/>I'm not going to lie, I mainly decided to try this due to the reviews on the taste. I was looking for something that would be a little more enjoyable to drink than my usual protein I've been taking that is on the bland side. The kind you just make yourself drink.<br/>I purchased the Mocha Cappuccino because I'm a cappuccino/coffee lover in general. The kind with a million grams of sugar and calories to boot, so I thought this flavor would be a nice alternative. I've been looking at this product for a pathetically long time before I actually ordered, so the reviews from this and other sites already had me pretty much sold on it, therefore I went ahead and bought the 5 pound tub. I'm glad I did because it  tastes wonderful...and also because my Husband who has a massive appetite loves it too. If you are a coffee/cappuccino lover, I would recommend this flavor. It also mixes better than my former protein powder.<br/>The flavor wasn't the only selling points for me though. The quality of the protein and the reviews of the results were a big reason, otherwise I likely wouldn't have tried this for the price. I can't speak for long term results yet, but so far I really feel the difference it makes in reducing soreness in  muscles after a workout, and it's a nice "treat" that keeps me satisfied. I drink it 1-2 times a day depending on my activity and my macros from food sources.<br/><br/>I look forward to trying other flavors of this, and likely will purchase another before I even finish this just to have some variety.
 I've made some gains.
 Pretty good. Much smoother than the regular chocolate but I think that I am going to go back to the Strawberry-banana because its like eating ice cream.
 This is my favorite brand of protein, as their quality is superb and most of their flavors seem to taste the best. This flavor was okay, nothing to brag about on amazon though.
 Rocky road is the best tasting protein that I have ever consumed. This product is super easy to mix and combines well with all my other supplements. I will be purchasing this product again.
 Good stuff...Dissolves easily
 As described
 The mint-chocolate flavor is amazing. I like mint-chocolate everything, but this really is good. I will buy again.
 Absolutely horrible taste. This stuff taste like strawberry milk mixed with Kaopectate....the product itself is good. But the taste is awful.
 The best tasting protein powder I've ever had. Blends well with a shaker. I also like how it is very low in fat.
 No scoop? How am I suppose to measure this out?
 Tastes great - I mix with low sugar almond milk.
 This 5 lb container has no scoop and have no idea what a scoop equals.
 I've been using these for the past four months and have been enjoying the results. Two scoops pre-workout and two more scoops post-workout. I used to use GNC Amplified Whey Protein, which had the same results -- but seriously overpriced, even if you were a GNC member.<br/><br/>Highly recommend these for any guys hitting the gym.
 Great, thanks!
 Pretty good protein powder, I got a bit sick of the flavor after a month of drinking it though.
 Always 'opt' for Optimum... the price is a bit higher than it used to be, but the quality of product is still excellent. Took a chance and got Rocky Road; not bad, but probably will get a different flavour next time.
 Great-tasting protein that mixes decently and does not give me gas if taken in reasonable amounts, which can be a big problem with someone who has a sensitive stomach like me.  Switched to this kind after my other protein source upped their prices and I am not disappointed.  Would recommend.
 This product is pretty popular. If you look at the nutrition stats on the back and compare it to any other brand, this one stands out for sure. 5lb lasts me about 4-6 months with working out 3-4 times a week.
 good price and very low carbs....very few fillers
 I'm on a 12 week diet plan administered by my nutritionist. I'm no "protein expert" as some would say, so if you are new to this and looking for something that tastes good like I am - at least to jump-start your new regimen, I'd skip this product.<br/><br/>I started with one whey protein type (name unknown), along with Optimum Nutrition's chocolate casein (heavenly!).  So when the initial whey supply ran out, I thought that Optimum Nutrition's double chocolate would be even better given my pleasure with the casein.<br/><br/>Wrong.<br/><br/>The double rich chocolate is anything but rich.  In fact, I've decreased the amount of water I put in hoping to make it thicker and more richer, but it is still bland. Cold, warm, semi-cold, semi-warm... it doesn't matter.  Too bad.<br/><br/>As far as results go, I can't attribute any *one* thing - including this mix - to my success because I'm doing many things differently that cumulatively are working.
 Great flavor and mix-ability from a reputable company.
 I have used several different kinds of protein for years.  I have tried lots, and generally try them once and throw them out, because they are usually so sweet they are disgusting.  I tried this one, the Double Rich Chocolate flavor, and I was immediately very happy.<br/><br/>I do free weights followed by 60-90 minutes of high resistance exercise bike.  If I do not take protein, I tend to need at least a full day recovery, and often will end up using light resistance on the third day.  The protein lets me go light on day 2 and back to full resistance on day 3.  Thanks all well and good, but I was running low on Protein.<br/><br/>I bought the GNC Blue Bottle SEI chocolate and vanilla YEARS ago.  I had to throw away the chocolate because they changed recipes and the Chocolate got so sweet it almost tasted like Caramel, but even sweeter.  Disgusting.  I threw all of it out and continued with the Vanilla, stocking up.  I since have tried several iterations of their newer products locally, but they are so ridiculously sweet that I can't stand the taste.  They don't put sugar in it, they put splenda or sucralose, and they overdose it to the point that it all tastes like simple syrup with a touch of chocolate/vanilla/peanut butter candy in it.<br/><br/>This stuff tastes GREAT.  I got the Double Rich Chocolate and it tastes like a good cocoa based milkshake (I do mix with Whole Milk, not water, to get the fat).  If you like eating rock candy, go buy the GNC crap.  If you like your hot chocolate dark and rich, you can't mix.  I plan on buying several of the Double Rich and trying a couple of other flavors.
 Taste is horrible!! Will not buy again!!
 Good protein powder, but I don't like this mint flavor. Stick with the plain chocolate flavor.
 Good product and better pricing than my local health food store
 This is my favorite flavor. I mix it with yogurt, oatmeal, it's perfect
 As good as protein junk is going to get. Doesn't taste too horrible.
 I have a subscription of it and love the taste!!!
 This is a pretty good protien product overall;<br/><br/>Taste: I found the taste to be decent, not great but not bad. There is a hint of artificial sweetener, which I probably notice because I despise the taste of artificial sweeteners so they stick out to me. The serving size is pretty small, so one serving goes down relatively quickly after a workout. this does make the taste less important. I do mix my protein with milk which may change the taste a little.<br/><br/>Mixing: This was the main reason i withheld one star, this powder is a little more difficult to mix compared to other protein powders I have used in the past. I am usually left with some (very) small clumps after vigorous shaking (I use, and highly recommend, a blender bottle). If you aren't using a blender or a blender bottle there will be some trouble getting the powder to mix all the way.<br/><br/>Value: This powder has 24 grams of protein per serving, which is pretty good for the price. I would say that this product is worth the price it is at.
 This will always be my go to whey. You can't go wrong with ON brand. The strawberry banana is my favorite goes with anything in smoothies.
 Great taste and I feel muscles feel much less sore than without this whey.
 Absolutely the best quality /taste /price combination for this specific form of whey protein powder. If you want 100% Whey protein (almost entirely isolates), easy mixing, and really enjoyable flavors, this is what you should purchase.
 It is great. The amout is larger than I thought.
 Good stuff, good taste, nice results, if it was a bit less expensive I would drink it more often
 My bf drinks this day and night . the muscle built since he started 2 months ago is really good. He does strength training  a few times a week. I like that the weight gain is gradual before the muscles. I would recommend to anyone looking to build muscles gradually over time.
 I started using this the day I received it and absolutely love it.<br/><br/>For starters the taste is so much better than many other whey protein powders on the market, as many others have a chemical type of flavor to them.  Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard has a more natural flavor.  I have the double rich chocolate.<br/><br/>Along with being great tasting, it has been a God send for me to get up to the 1g of protein per pound of body weight, as the protein in a single scoop is around 24g (going off of memory here)<br/><br/>I like to mix the powder with other ingredients.  Here is my favorite recipe:<br/><br/>1 scoop of Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard<br/>1/2 medium banana<br/>1 tbsp natural peanut butter<br/>1 tbsp ground flax<br/>1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt<br/>1 cup of skim milk<br/><br/>I will substitute the banana for blueberries or raspberries as well.  Depends on what I am in the mood for.
 Delicious!
 Best tasting protein powder out there.
 Strawberry Banana is great tasting!
 Best Whey protein around. If you use caution and some common sense, you will improve your gains with this stuff. It tastes great, and mixes well.
 I like this flavor. I usually add berries and other fruits to make it more healthy and tasty
 Been using Optimum Nutrition Whey protein for years.<br/><br/>It always tastes good and blends well.<br/><br/>It does the job!
 I am not very good with being consistent when it comes to go to the gym, but I enjoy protein drinks a lot. The flavor on this one is pretty good and if you read the label you'll like what you'll find.<br/>It is the best deal out there for whey protein that makes you feel like it's working. This was my first time using this brand and now I am a returning customer every time i need whey protein.<br/>DON'T get strawberry flavor!!!! it is definitely NOT my favorite. Still... a really good product. Highly recommended.
 I have bought ON products before.  The first was a gainer that stuffed me full after I drank it which I didnt like.  This one did not do that. It tastes great in Double Chocolate and I don't even like chocolate!  Great for pre, during, and after workout drink.  Also excellent with meals.  Great product and even came with a scooper.
 makes protein shakes real foamy. cant taste it that much when mixed with strawberries and bananas though.
 Make sure WHEY is the correct protein for what you're trying to achieve. Continually rated at top performer by fitness and performance sites. For me? Used for years. Lean gains. Tastes great. Mixes well. Price has gone up as popularity has picked up, but that is to be expected...
 Mixes well but I use magic bullet superior taste
 Good stuff.
 I always use this protein however switched over to the all natural.
 Definitely helped.
 When I am hardcore dieting, this is probably the tastiest thing I eat, and I eat probably six scoops of it a day. 10 lbs. bag is the cheapest way to buy it.
 I've tried my fair share of proteins over the years and landed on Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard. Firstly, it tastes great and mixes easily. Secondly, the price is great for the quality protein you are getting. Third, it is known in the supplement industry as a quality protein with a nice blend of amino acids. No unnecessary ingredients and decently low in sugars &amp; calories. Put it this way, I've bought 20+ tubs and don't plan on stopping.
 Best product on the market
 I drink it before my workout and whether it's a placebo effect or not I always feel stronger after I do.
 Great Whey Protein, Light, and Good Flavor. I like the vanilla because you can mix them with different fruits and what not...
 Really great taste that blends well.  White Chocolate and Rocky Road are my two favorite.  It blends well, no clumps.  Low fat and low carb that gives all the protein and a great tasting Whey!
 I normally love all flavors from Optimum Nutrition- they've never let me down before! But this cake batter is quite bland. Definitely not one to mix with water and chug. Or do, just to get it over with. It's not terrible tasting.. just, barely flavored. Great to blend or bake with! Definitely cheap for a 5lb jug!
 Good product at a great price.
 i've been a repeater since 2010.  no other brand beats quality and value of this product
 Best protein powders out ther in my opinion. Easily digested and tasted great too. I love the Dutch Chocolate.
 I was looking for a good whey protein mix without a lot of junk (fat/sugar) mixed in, and this works great. It tastes fine and mixes well. I have used for years.
 For whatever reason, the Banana Cream flavor made me very sick. I've never had any issues taking protein before, but for this particular batch with this particular flavor, I got crippling stomach aches and vomited on multiple occasions. I'll try a different flavor of the same brand because the mix dissolved better than others I've tried, but this one was ruined for me.
 Great protein drink or after work out drink. I love the flavor! I drink it with milk. I have never tried it with water.
 Is the best protein and love the flavor
 Not to sweet. Mixes in easily with water. Good source of protein for a quick snack at my desk when busy at work
 My boyfriend love this product and the double chocolate flavor.
 Amazing for the price
 I have been drinking one cup of this daily first thing every morning for the past year.  I'm not sure if it's the magic potion, but I have managed to maintain my weight loss and decent muscle mass.  Plus, it tastes really good.
 The Best
 I've used it for years. I can't say it's the greatest tasting thing in the world, but you get used to it, and it has helped me a lot with muscle growth and recovery,
 Cookies &amp; Cream<br/><br/>Let’s be real here. Most people that are in the market for a protein shake know very little about nutrition which isn’t bad. But do your research this is a supplement not HGH or some steroid that’s going to make you swole AF without a working diet and following a weight goal.<br/><br/>You only know what you’ve been told and You don’t know what you don’t know. So don’t bash on this protein shake because some of the ingredients have changed. It’s not going to make a drastic difference in your gains. Don’t rely on this shake to be your only source of muscle growth thinking you can eat nothing but Hot cheetos, soda, and candy with expectations of looking like a pro bodybuilder.<br/><br/>This is basically the same stuff everyone else has in their shake so depending on if you’re trying to gain or lose that’s your goal not mine.<br/><br/>I like this shake for it’s flavor and price. I’ve had good results with it. I don’t use it anymore not because it doesn’t work but I just found something with a better flavor (Personal Preference).<br/><br/>Long story short this is a good shake. Just make sure you get a good diet plan that fits and this will help you get from where you are to where you want to be.
 Best Protein powder to shake ever. I hate the chemical smell in most powders. This is silky smooth, gets frothy in a hand shaker, easy to use and great taste. A little too sweet but working on adding cocoa powder, peanut butter...to get the sweetness down.
 Tastes great and mixes well.  Use it with almond milk, frozen blueberries, frozen bananas and a scoop of frozen chocolate yogurt to make a great frozen smoothie.
 Optimum Nutrition has done a great job with this protein, its got a lot of great whey protein with a great taste, its good with water but great with really cold milk, if you need a good whey that taste great here is a great big tub of goodness.
 Decently priced, good protein. You get what you pay for.
 Great product, I keep buying this one for a good cheap alternative to the expensive overpriced whey protein
 Always good
 Not extremely soluble, too sweet ! Taste ok.
 I've stuck with Dymatize for all my previous protein purchases, but a gym buddy recommended I try this... it specs out about the same, price is comparable, so that's basically a wash... ON offers many more flavors, though, which was his big selling point... he insisted the rocky road was the best, so I went with that... now, with Dymatize I used their dark chocolate, which is pretty tasty... I mix my shakes with 2% milk... this label calls for 10-12 ounces of water or milk... tell ya what, I almost can't stomach this stuff at that mixture... it's not too sweet, but I think to achieve that marshmallow element of rocky road they use a little more artificial sweetener, and I can't stand that flavor... I tried usin' less milk, only 6-8 ounces, and that was a bit more tolerable... I'm just not feelin' this rocky road flavor at all... so I won't speak on their other flavors, but based on this one I likely will just go back to ol' trusty Dymatize... everyone's tastes are different, though, so give 'er a go I guess... 'cause other than the flavor, the rest of the product is top quality...
 Always have been a fan of the Optimum Nutrition brand, and this did not disappoint.<br/><br/>For the price and quality, you can't get a better value.  Gold Standard is my go-to whey protein.<br/>Tastes great and produces results.  Cannot wait to try the next flavor.
 Simply the best! Wish it was cheaper, or cheaper in Canada at least. Would keep buying it otherwise.
 Great product and fast delivery
 A++++
 Sabe rico y llena bastante 😍😍😍
 I love this flavor, and it is priced well, and more convenient then going to the store to have it shipped directly home.
 Hard to believe the taste.  Mine really tastes like Rocky Road.  You can smell the nuts and marshmallows.
 As always, Optimum Nutrition knocks it out of the park with their products. I never get any other type of protein.
 Tastes great. Awesome and creamy in shakes if you add a little soy/almond/milk or yogurt.
 Buy this product if you don't know much about whey . Great Results and solid taste but use it only if your goal is getting fit and if you are working out with a healthy Diet . Everything matters ,this is just fuel .
 Great product if your looking for a lot of healthy whey protein that is low calorie and low fat.<br/><br/>The taste is alright, I mix one scoop with water and it tastes good enough to drink, not like straight chocolate milk.
 Expensive, but really worth it. Perfect for pre-workout, as your body absorbs it quickly. Note that this is pure whey isolate, if you want something with casein in it,  you have to buy something different.
 Love the double chocolate, no chalky taste and mixes easily. Haven't tried it with water but is great with milk. Like that it isn't loaded with sugar. Have tried several different protein powders and this is easily my favorite. For me it's easily the best product at this price.
 tastes great but i wish i had gotten chocolate (my personal mistake) i drink it after every work out and it fills me
 Great taste! Awesome mixed with PB and a frozen banana in the morning. Yumm!
 I love optimum nutrition whey, thats the only brand i buy. I have only tried the chocolate flavors but i must say they are awesome!
 Its whey protein.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I decided to branch out and I got a terrible flavor....
 Best tasting whey protein I've had in a while the tub is huge love cookies and cream.<br/>I thought It would be OK since I've bought a cookie and cream from the cheap brand at Walmart but this one surpasses it by a long shot.  Love that fact it's 24gP and only 4gC  1.5F
 OMGSH!!! This is AWESOME. Thank you to the guy that made the super detailed review about the flavor rankings! Rocky road!!!!! Is a gift from the protein shake gods
 Tastes like chocolate water. not too chocolatey.  I can even add to my regular chocolate protein drink for added protein;. Mixes well.
 Just bought it, the taste isnt the best but its doable.
 This is the best tasting whey protein I've had so far. I've been purchasing the extreme milk chocolate for the past year and mixing it with fat free milk. I doubt I'll try another brand or flavor anytime soon.
 Great product. After a week of using this product I can feel the difference in my body whether you are working out or just need the extra protein you will feel the difference
 Excellent, excellent product.  Tastes great (mainly in milk, but in water it's not bad - actually in water it practically disappears), very light but chocolatey.  It's 20-something g of protein per scoop too, and it mixes easily in a blender bottle.  I also mix it with my coffee sometimes (makes a great iced mocha).<br/><br/>Not much else to say, it's awesome and has a lot of extra supps in it so that you don't have to add separately (e.g. BCAA).  I'll be buying this repeatedly, long-term.  Huge help to the gains I've been getting with my weight training.  Never upsets my stomach.<br/><br/>I use both this and Syntha-6, but this is much nicer when you just want to get more protein in your diet.  I supplement about 100g of protein powder per day, so you definitely want more than one flavor (even if they are both chocolate) - also one with all the extra fiber and one without.
 Just ok .
 Excellent Flavor. Arrived on time. Love it.
 Great tasting protein. I take 2 scoop post workout and been getting better results since I switched over.
 The product lacks substance.  It is one of the weakest Whey's I have ever had.  My wife thought I was being fussy and when she tried it, she said, WOW, this is like really pathetic.<br/><br/>The best way I can describe this to someone is that it is like being really watered down.<br/><br/>There are better Whey products out there that are similar in price and actually pack a punch.
 Has high protein (24g per 30g serving) and low sugar (1g per serving). The chocolate flavor is just right, enough there to taste but not too rich.
 Excellent
 I love the way this stuff tastes. Add a banana and some peanut butter to the shake and it's so good! Highly recommend!
 So far have tried cake batter and rocky road and both are great.  However I do prefer cake batter.  Overall great product for the money spent!
 Best protein avail... costly but worth it
 Great product at a very competitive price if you have Prime!
 Loving the larger sizes flavors and price!
 Lasts a long time, but it's huge. You need a place to store it.
 Tastes pretty good even with two scoops, but did not come with a scoop. And I sifted through 90% of it.
 Good stuff didn't mind the taste at all
 Not a super chocolately taste, but not horrible at all. It works for me when I don't have a lot of time and need something in my tummy.
 Good buy!
 Great price. Cookies and cream is great!
 Good tasting protein...has also helped with recovery.
 It tastes great, well the chocolate does at least. The bag kept it fresh for roughly 9 months, which i was happy about. This is easily the cheapest way to buy protein.<br/><br/>So if you use it a lot, this is a great choice.
 Strawberry is definitely the best, i tried the Banana and wasn't too impressed it was a struggle to finish the container!<br/><br/> Definitely the best protein powder i've had, and you can't beat the price. Slight mix up at the post office caused me not to get my package as timely as i'd like but the seller PROPRO5 was active in ensuring i had the best customer experience possible.
 Excelente !!
 I love this powder really fulfills my hunger, and it's great after working out! I combine it with shakeology and improves so much the taste of it and the you get much full with it. I personally use half and half of a regular scoop to take more advantage of shakeology since is SO expensive.
 Best protein on the market and delicious.
 Great price for a superior product. This is the industry standard of whey and the taste is great. i recommend using a mixer or blender to avoid those powder bombs in your shake. The product speaks for itself. Packaged well with no other product issues.
 Shipping was excellent.  For those serious about healthy protein intake,  go with the Natural Whey by Optimum Nutrition.  I did my research after buying this product.
 My husband works out everyday and he really likes this protein powder. He has tried many others but found that this one works best for him. and the sugar content is very low! He loves chocolate so this flavor is perfect for him.
 Best protein that has been around for a long time.
 Bought this flavor based on the reviews and its ok.  Next time around I am going back to regular chocolate. With the surplus from yogurt manufactures I can't understand why the prices are constantly increasing.
 Taste is OK,  doesn't taste like cookies and cream though more like vanilla
 Expensive, but great taste.
 Not ordering again but good product. Watch your ingredients
 Nice product at a fair price.
 I love this protein for the taste and the power it gives me to work out and to recover
 Why Why..? You Guys have change the taste. I will look for different Protin now. Please get your old formula and Chocolate taste back again.
 Absolutely love this protein! Tastes amazing and mixes so easily 👍🏼
 It's cookies and cream. The best flavor ever invented. If you get any other protein, you need to start flexing your brain more often
 good protein for the money.  i use it immediately after working out and within 15 minutes of working out as the body screams for nutrients and i grow pretty fast.
 Best tasting whey you can buy, hands down.
 Tastes like a mild mocha coffee.  No bitter aftertaste.  Powder is very fine and mixes like a dream. Stays suspended in your drink.  No settling of the protein to the bottom.  I won't use anything else now.
 This is by far my favorite protein. The double chocolate flavor is always reliable. Not overly sweet/rich like some of the other flavors and it is great for mixing if you like to make shakes.
 Great protein with great taste. I like the cappuccino flavor better than the extreme milk chocolate. I put this in my oatmeal and it is the perfect breakfast!! I'll continue to buy this product.
 Best ratio of carbs protein and fat for the price. Not too sweet and not too blade for the taste. Easy to mix with water and test good with milk. Price has gone up over the years but it is hands down one of the best protein supplement I have bought. If the 5lb tubs is around 40-45 dollar, it a no brainer must buy.
 Pretty much strictly protein, which is exactly what I want. It may not taste the greatest due to that, but I am in it for the gains, not the flavor. 9.5/10 will buy again.
 Best whey protein out there in my opinion. Tastes delicious and mixes well with no chunks in it.
 I used it 2 month and actually get growth muscle, I satisfied it.<br/>But, I don't recommend this with water, taste feel little bitter, with milk that acceptable.
 Probably the best protein money can buy. Tastes better than most and mixes well, not too thick, not too thin.
 Chocolate protein .. um .. can you ask for anything more than that when you need to feel DA PUMP everyday! Sweet sweet muscular nectar. Love it. Buy it. Drink IT!
 I use this as a supplement every day.  My favorite way to mix this is with a glass of milk.  It gives it a almost vanilla pudding taste.  I tried water a few times, and could hardly get it down due to the taste.
 Best protein powder for all around health and body use I found. I asked lots of friends who work out a lot and stay up to date on health and working out things. They all said this is the best value and best all around option. There may be some that are better, but you would not get as much and it would cost more. I would compare this to a Corvette at a New Buick Price. Where some other powders are the low end car and the low end price and may be unhealthy for you. There are I am sure the Ferrari powders out there, at the Ferrari price. For me and what I was looking I am 100% happy with this, as I am getting the Corvette experience and performance at the Buick price.
 Delicious and mixes well. Prices well compared to many other proteins.
 Product came with broken seal. Would not recommend purchasing this online.
 Love Optimum Nutrition!  I've tried a lot of protein powders over the years and ON really does the job.  No upset stomach and the flavor are great!
 I can't speak to the nutritional aspect, but the flavor and solubility are great.
 It's great! Mixes easy. Tastes great!
 Amazing product, good mixability, vanilla ice cream flavor you cannot go wrong
 Excellent really makes a difference!!!
 Good stuff!
 I'm not going to go into too much detail. But the product is good! The French Vanilla tastes pretty good and mixes well with fruit and berries. It also mixes well with water. It doesn't clump. I recommend it to get some added protein in your diet.
 Wow.  Pretty amazed with this product.  I'm probably on my 25th lb or more of the extreme milk chocolate.  I've tried some of the other flavors, but I just keep coming back to this.  It tastes great with no weird aftertaste at all.<br/><br/>I use this in my smoothie as a meal replacement.  I'm recently divorced and when I don't have the kids, the idea of pulling out the pots and pans, making dinner, eating and cleaning up just isn't appealing.  I love cooking, but when I'm alone, it just seems like a lot of wasted time.  Blending up a smoothie and getting enough lean protein in my system is soooooo much more efficient.  5 minutes to get a meal into me and I've freed up so much time to do something else!<br/><br/>Since getting a nutritious meal into my system is so much easier, I've even started making a smoothing for breakfast every morning.  I put it into a big cup and drink it on the way to work.  It's helped so much in keeping me from getting "shaky" around lunch time and I'm sure it does wonders for getting my metabolism going.  And at night, I make another shake and vary some of the ingredients.<br/><br/>I'm so happy with this product, that I don't know what I'd do if they discontinued it!
 Amazing. Love this poduct and the fact that it has so kany flavors online.
 I give it 5 stars because it really doesn't clump and it tastes good. But darn it's expensive!
 Best value. Best taste.
 The delicious strawberry is the best tasting whey I have ever had. I only use it to mix with Greek Yogurt. It mixes easily into the yogurt and tastes very good! I highly recommend this flavor.
 tastes gross
 Probably the best, if not one of the best tasting powders!
 one of the best values for whey protein
 Arrived in 2 days. Tastes like birthday cake ice cream
 The best
 When I take three scoops of this daily I get bigger faster than when I just eat food.  This is probably because I'm able to easily increase my daily protein consumption without having to consider how full I am at the moment.
 Other than the low sugar and carb content, can't go wrong with this. Take it consistently and you will see gains.
 5 stars for ON Gold Standard, but this flavor is WAY too sweet. I won't be getting this flavor again.
 Arrived with container a bit damaged, but not broken enough to get powder leaking. Good taste for whey, though a bit more expensive.
 Taste just like Mocha Frappuccino
 great price for the product.  it's definitely my go-to protein source, and there are tons of flavors to choose from.
 Taste good.... Don't care for the aspartame
 Great product. Doesn't have the horrible taste that others do.
 Great product. Doesn't have the horrible taste that others do.
 Made per instructions, little to no taste. Not a fan compared to others I have tried.
 This stuff is great! The taste is one of the best I've had and I look forward to it after my workout. I think this stuff is just as good if not better than hydro whey and its not as expensive. It also has hydro whey in it! I will definitely buy again!
 The only protein I use. I have tried other proteins like some of GNC's own branded protein and other protein brands sold by GNC and none tasted as good as this or even felt as good going down like Optimum whey does. I have been using this for a year and don't plan on changing. It is pricey but nothing good in protein powder comes cheap so it's either this or buy some cheap protein that will be bad for the body. I mix mine with milk and its always great  tasting, I have drank it with water and it still taste good. Not as good as drinking it with milk though. The powder last a long time to and doesn't lose form or taste. Can't complain and this is the only protein I can recommend to anyone. It doesn't have lots of fats or sugars which is nice to and the protein to gram ratio is great as well
 My husband told me this whey was probably the best in terms of nutrition &amp; cost so I ordered it. I'll update my review in 3 months (we are doing P90X starting the first week of June...XD.<br/><br/>I received my package as promised. The box was perfectly sized, secure &amp; not wasteful. I hate to receive products swimming in huge boxes:) Thank you!
 :)
 Good Protein product we like it very much.  Always gets her in a time.
 yum
 Love this stuff. I have bought it a few times over the past year and a half. It is cheaper than GNC protien and I experience the same lean muscle growth. It is better tasting than most as well. I also think it is cool that on the 'bottle' they dont tell you to take some stupid amount that your body could never absorb.
 So far it's been great. I was worried about the Cake Batter flavor... but it turned out to not be bad. So thats cool.
 The best protein out there in my opinion.
 good product, little on the expansive side
 favorite whey out there. good quality and decent taste
 Coffee is the best tasting favor I've tried.  I little water and Ice in the blender makes for a quick tasty drink.
 Tastes like a milkshake and it's good for you
 Probably my favorite brand of protein. I've tried Muscle Tech and Gaspari, but Gold Standard has always been my favorite. It mixes so easy. I blend 2 scoops in with a banana some spinach and a couple of handfuls of blueberries first thing in the morning.
 Love the taste and excellent way to get some extra protien on the go
 The 5 lb package is enormouse, but the product is a good, drinkable product.
 Not a fan of strawberry but got used to it<br/>The vanilla n chocolate are bomb tho
 When mixed with milk it actually tastes pretty good unlike the concrete/Pepto Bismol/week-old fish flavor combo typical of other protein powders.
 Plan on having the plastic zip lock be broken within a month... your whey will spoil sooner than you think. So if you think you can't finish this bag within 6 months, get the canned "ON". Or find another container to fill it as a back up. The product is always good but the packaging sucks. You have been warned.
 Tastes great, and excellent nutritional value.  Read the label on your protein shakes, some have ridiculous cholesterol content. This one is great all around. Worth the money and I've seen great results.
 Very good
 Cheap, tasty, and helps me hit my protein intake. I dig it.
 im not a big fan of choco protiens but this one is actually quite good. mixes up well like all the other gold standard products iv had. low carbs and high on flavor!!! drink up it always goes down smooth!!!
 Been using the same product for YEARS! Have tried others and nothing ever compares. Stick with the tried and tested. The BEST!
 DELICIOUS! What more can I say? Optimum Nutrition is a trusted brand and Mocha Capp protein tastes exactly like Mocha Capp! You like coffee or mocha flavored stuff, this is for you!
 After trying multiple protein powders I landed on this and haven't changed since. This protein is a far better product in terms of quality and taste than any other I have used. I use it daily and it has made a notable difference for me. Would highly recommend.
 It tastes excellent with 24g of protein who can complain.<br/><br/>Try it yourself.<br/><br/>Peace.
 Great. However i feel they won't let you loose weight or get ripped. They bulk you up a lot
 Been drinking this stuff for years. I've tried dozens of other protein powders and this is far and above the best. Dissolves quickly, tastes good, and delivers results.
 While the double rich chocolate is better, I LOVE THIS WHEY! I workout 7 days a week, and it is glorious for what I need it to do. Everything about it is perfect for me and my workouts. It tastes delicious, it doesn't upset my stomach, it dissolves easily, since it is a combination of whey isolate and whey concentrate it has natural occurring BCAAs. I usually take two scoops in a large shaker after a hard weight workout with some added glutamine. When I do my long runs or bike rides I take one large shaker, I fill it up with half chocolate coconut water for the electrolytes, half water, one scoop of Gold Standard, some extra glutamine... and I have the perfect recovery drink. My wife does the same thing after her workouts. We are both triathletes and this just simply works for us especially on strength training days for muscle recovery.
 This is the best route you can go for your protein supplementation as far as price and quality combined.  The only other you're going to find better is the more expensive Platinum Series by Optimum Nutrition.
 Rocky Road is a great flavor, it's smooth and has no aftertaste to speak of, and it tastes great.  I haven't tried all the flavors yet but I would order this again for sure!
 Best flavor, best quality. ON is even nice enough to verify the authenticity of the product if you send them pictures of it. Probably will never buy another brand of whey products. Some of my friends did think it was too sweet or chocolatey, especially if you also blend a banana into your mix. I think it is the perfect flavor for mixing with water.
 Good quality
 High protein, low in carbs and added sugar.  Very nice!
 The price on Amazon cannot be beat! This is my first purchase of any type of protein powder and after doing some reading I decided on ON. The Extreme Milk Chocolate flavor is great, it tastes just like Nesquik chocolate milk and only 2g of sugar per scoop and no added artificial sweeteners.
 Double rich chocolate is the best. Mixes well and tastes great with water and milk.
 Love this protein - does the job!
 Delicious flavor (mocha), this is the best protein you can get by far.
 I've tried alot of stuff and have consistently used this and it only gets better and better.. The taste and mix-ability is unmatched for the nutritional value.. It mixed well with water as well as milk.. I enjoy drinking this and it's almost like i'm being rewarded :D
 Great product and service.  Thank You
 Have a mild coffee taste, not overwhelming.
 Good
 works well and taste great
 been taking after workouts and at night - so far so good.
 Love the flavor. Great value. Love the variety of flavors.
 Got this product because I hoped it would taste like a coffee milk shake, and it does. I'm weening myself off pepsi and this is helping. The drinks are filling and drinking soda afterwards doesn't taste good. So it's doing its job.
 This tastes great with milk. It tastes so good that I actually force myself to work out - just to taste it afterwards. Highly recommend it!
 As my title reads, don't get this flavor. It tastes like they but artificial sweetener in it. I chug it down to get the protein I need but i should have gotten  the extreme milk chocolate instead. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!
 I'm very disappointed. With my second time ordering this product I got the wrong flavor. I specifically ordered vanilla ice cream and instead I received chocolate coconut.
 The rich chocolate flavor is the most bland flavor I've ever had. It basically taste like a more chalky version of the regular chocolate.
 Great formula, mixes very well. Started Insanity without this and it was a serious struggle to continue. About a week into the program I've incorporated this into my post workout routine and it does everything it claims. Love it, will continue to buy it.
 I'll admit, this stuff is high quality. Definitely the best money can buy, but I think everyone has a limit for how much their willing to pay for protein. 10lb quantities are always the most cost effective way to go. The last time I purchased this fertilizer sized bag of protein it was $58 ... now it says it is $104 dollars. My rating will reflect the product and not the price.<br/><br/>I am a firm believer that if you're going to be putting 2+ protein shakes into your body a day, make sure it's from a reputable company to ensure you're getting the expected nutrients which then leads to expected results (assuming you're training and getting enough rest). Optimum Nutrition definitely manufactures quality supplements and this is probably their highest volume product.<br/><br/>Whey shakes are essential for many people looking to meet minimum protein requirements since getting 1 gram / pound of body weight is quite difficult with a busy schedule. Oddly enough even at this price, it's still more cost effective than many other protein sources, however It's a shame that their prices have increased so drastically to the point where I went from a regular buyer to having looked elsewhere for protein.<br/><br/>This amount lasts me about a month an a half (my laziness wins if it comes down to a shake or cooking chicken breasts). If money is not your concern, I'd buy it. If money is your concern, I'd look elsewhere.
 I've tried a lot of protein powders, but this one (extreme milk chocolate) is hands down the best tasting. I like blending it with kale, bananas, espresso, coconut oil, almond milk, and filtered water...TASTES AMAZING!<br/><br/>The vanilla ice cream flavor is ok, I usually blend that one with fruit.
 By far one of the best protein shake products I have tried thus far. I would recommend this to anyone.
 Double Chocolate tastes really good. Easy to get through the whole tub without getting brunt out on flavor.
 Nutritious and tasty, too.  I don't normally like to drink whey protein drinks, but this mixes well and tastes great.
 Despite what some reviewers here say, as far as I am concerned this is NOT for lactose intolerant people. I actually wonder if some of the folks that say they are lactose intolerant, actually are. Maybe they are not! Haha!<br/><br/>I started eating this powder and got a ton of gas and stomach issues eventually leading to diarrhea... yuck! This really screwed up my program!!! It has been almost a week and finally now I am recovered well enough to eat properly.<br/><br/>Sounds funny but I did not figure out it was this powder, until I was well into my stomach problems. I thought it was something else, that maybe I ate something undercooked, etc. in a restaurant or maybe I was taking too much creatine, etc.<br/><br/>So what I do now is mix this powder with milk (I suggest skim milk; you do not want the fat in the milk because the fat is where all the lady cow hormones are; that's right, estrogen, nature's anti-testesterone). And then I drink it with a Lactaid pill.<br/><br/>Even though whey isolate is low lactose, this probably contains lactose from the whey concentrate or whatever else in it. I have narrowed it down, and taking the Lactaid stops the stomach upset. So, the problem has got to be lactose.
 This is one of the best Whey protein, i keep buying in different flavors.
 my favorite protein.  blends well.
 I'm not usually one to complain about the flavor of protein powders, but with Optimum Nutrition I already know it's a quality product and a good price so flavor is all that's left. I won't be buying this flavor again. It just didn't work for me. But I did like that it wasn't too sweet and it had a good coffee flavor.
 very good
 I like it more than the Mocha flavor. Strong coffee flavor yet not too sweet like the others and for coffee lovers that is a plus. :)
 This is great protein. Though I originally made the mistake of listening to some of the reviews. A lot of people seen to enjoy the Rocky Road flavor. I did not. It was very sweet and didn't taste good mixed with anything other than milk. I didn't mind it at first, but two shakes a day? It wears on you. After that I tried the Rich Chocolate flavor, which I found to be the best tasting flavor of any protein I've tried.
 Bought this because of the high ratings.  Completely satisfied.  I use immediately after a lunch time workout and it greatly increases my post workout energy level.
 Great protein, although the strawberry tasted very artificial. Reminiscent of the pink strawberry milk you get at the supermarket. Mixes super well in just a shaker.
 Repeat buyer, this is my preferred protein supplement.  I think it tastes quite well but apparently my friend cannot stand it, so to be safe you might want to order a smaller size to start, but I found double chocolate to be just fine.
 Exactly what I ordered and works great after the gym.
 Once you find the flavor you like then that will be all she wrote. works great and makes you feel great after a workout. this will be the brand i keep coming back to until they come up with something better.
 Great protein supplement. In the past I have gotten the chocolate flavor, which also tastes good, but cookies and cream tastes great too. There are a lot of other people who can tell you why this is good protein so I won't bother with repeating anything. I would defiantly recommend this to anyone who is looking for protein, especially for use with work outs.
 I love the protein, value and quantity but the taste of cookies and cream is really not so good...i mix it with another flavor and it is fine then.
 great product. great price.
 I like the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor better than this one (Cake Batter) but it isn't bad. I love the 100% Whey products, I was just hoping for a truer flavor.
 Formula changed and now uses sucralose. Run away. I have been using this for years and feel betrayed.
 Great quality protein source and the taste is good. Cannot complain. I have mixed this with milk and have also just used plain old water. With milk it is much better, as you could imagine, but it is not bad at all with water either.
 I started dieting and working out again, and this product has really helped. In just a month I can see real definition in my arms and legs, and I don't get quite as sore when I work out. For those who want better muscle tone and definition, you should definately supplement your diet with protein, and I'd recommend this over almost anything else.
 I usually hate the excessively sweet protein powders, this is perfect.  I'm not a heavy lifter, I just use it after running workouts where I'm feeling fatigued.
 Great product. Arrived fast
 This protein tastes AMAZING!!!! I recommend th I s product to all my friends. It asterisks vanilla protein with a soft frosting after taste.
 Tastes great! The double rich is a lie, don't let it scare you off. I accidentally ordered the wrong flavor and ended up liking it. Easy on the stomach as well.
 For cheap protein, this really can't be beat. It also mixes easily in a blender (less easily in a shaker, but not SO bad), and tastes very good with some milk, water, and a banana (my daily breakfast).
 I love the taste (banana cream). Comes in a big jar and I'm sure it will last for a while.
 Tastes wondeful!
 love it
 Love chocolate flavor, the power dissolves in water easily and taste great!
 A serving of frozen/fresh strawberries, 8 oz. of water, almonds, and protein powder in the blender and I'm good to go for 3-5 hours! Optimum Nutrition dissolves almost instantly &amp; a nice tasting vanilla. I've been known to drink it straight, alongside carbs and fat to have a balanced snack.
 I just keep buying this product, Excellent
 Chocolate mint flavor is a bit weird but blends in very easily and smoothly, no issues with it all, although I probably wouldn't choose chocolate mint again.
 Best whey on the market.  I also use ProJym with it a couple times a day for a different protein mixture.
 ON Whey by the numbers is a great protein. The Double Rich Chocolate is not a good flavor. I tried it in water, 2%, 1% then whole. Rice milk, coconut milk and almond milk it just isn't that good tasting for me. Mixes best with rice milk.
 Some of the best quality, best tasting, and most effective whey protein I've had to this day.
 I've used this protein for years and I have no complaints. It is good for a morning easy meal or pre/post workout protein boost. Highly recommended.
 i use it everyday and its good
 This is my 2nd protein powder that I've used and I love it. It doesn't get clumpy and gross and tastes great!
 Best Protein on the market.  Amazon has the best price on this product. I love "ON" products they make it clean and simple.
 Excellent
 Optimum hands down makes the best tasting whey protein in my experience and does not cause a lot of excess gas as other proteins will for me.
 I purchased the mocha flavor, and it is delicious. Mixes very well and does not clump together whatsoever.
 I didn't care for it, not much flavor,but maybe it's because I chose the Rocky Road.  I know I won't buy again.  I found the "Publix" brand to be much better in flavor and a lot cheaper.
 Banana flavor is by far the best, milk and an actual banana with some ice in the blender and boom the best protein shake.
 It's the shiznit.
 Tastes good, good quality. Be noted that this product contains artificial sweeteners.
 Can't go wrong with this brand and flavor.  Have recently begun experimenting with it by adding very little water (2 tbsp) to a scoop and making it into a spread I add on to Ezekiel bread or rice cakes.  Love it.
 Excatly what I wanted
 After the change in their Pro Complex line, I've been using this product and have learned to love it. The price point is excellent for the amount of servings and protein in each serving with very low carbs.
 Great for those gains.
 Coffee is da' bomb! I wasn't sure what flavor to go with so I took a risk and got Coffee. Its awesome! Using cold enough water, its like a iced coffee frappuccino. With Optimum Nutrition, you know the quality is good!
 The flavor is WONDERFUL - no artificial after-taste. Smells great. I  highly recommend this product. I've been ordering it through Amazon for some time now, which is the best deal I've found!
 ON puts out some of the best supplements and their whey protein is amazing. I ordered the extreme chocolate and it is by far one of the best protein powders I have had so far. Fast shipping and a great price.
 Tasty for a protein powder.
 This is some of the better tasting whey I've ever had. Double Rich Choco is definitely the way to go for flavor. Taking whey supplements is the only way for me to hit my daily protein needs so this product helps a lot.
 GREAT STUFF
 the flavor is amazing!
 high quality ingredients and good taste.  You can match both the quality and taste in cheaper proteins though but that doesn't degrade the excellence of this product.
 Hands down the best protein powder you will ever find. Wanna get kinky? Mix it with milk instead!
 Tastes great, mixes well but was getting pricy when I last bought this stuff a couple of months go.  May consider going to an inferior brand.
 This is my favorite whey protein. It helps me keep in shape and the flavor options are amazing. I stick to the chocolate!
 If you love Coffee! This is the brand to get for coffee flavor protein!
 The Gold Standard of protein, can't go wrong. Cookies and Cream doesn't have a good rating on bodybuilding com, but I enjoyed the flavor very much, great by itself and great in recipes... very good when you've gotten tired of chocolate and vanilla, it's a perfect middle ground.
 I researched protein powders by reading reviews and forum postins and on whey protein was one i kept seeing again and again. It was cheap too (comparatively) so i jumped on it.<br/><br/>I'm trying to bulk up for my first year of college and this was the first powder ive tried. And its fantastic! For taste anyway, i havent had it long enough to look for results. With water, its ok, kind of bland but not bad tasting at all. A bit gooey, could be a bit sweeter, but i still liked it. I have only tried mixing it with a spoon and it easily dissolves but clumps in goo floaters. Not a problem for me.<br/><br/>When i tried it with milk it was delicious! Tasted just like milk chocolate powder you get at grocery stores. Its almost too good as now when i get close to finishing my workouts i look forward too much to the postworkout snack and lose focus. Highly recommended!
 Mixes very well and good price for the amount you receive. No bad smell or bad taste. Very pure and clean product.
 It tastes good and has the right nutrition.
 Arrived fast. I got cake barter flavor and it's so delicious😍 Very happy!
 taste great, I just use this for a post workout supplement. It's well priced
 Mostly pure isolates but it is not hydrolysized and has whey protein concentrate in it as well making it less bioavailable.
 I like this whey protein but not the flavor. I love the banana flavor, I dont know if I can even finish using this on taste alone.
 Great protein mix. Dissolves well and tastes great.
 I just finished my first drink and it was probably the best protein powder shake I have ever tried. Smooth as silk when blended using a “magic bullet” style cup blender. I mixed one scoop with milk and a shot of water, and I couldn’t be happier with the taste or texture. No off putting flavor either. Taste is like a really light chocolate shake.<br/><br/>Note... I chose this specific flavor because there is NO Sucrose in it, much like the other flavors.
 I swear by this brand! I have 4 flavors currently- tastes great and I use as a meal replacement; love this protein!
 This stuff works! I'm 53 been working out for over 25 years and when you get a little older its just harder to keep the mass and the strength. Was never a supplement guy but thought I'd give it a go as I was getting frustrated that all my workouts lately seemed to be going nowhere and I started to really have to kill myself to lift the same weight. My friend bought that  ISOBURN GARBAGE an I also tried 4 tubs of it. That did nothing but waste my money. This time I did my own research and bought 2 big Jars of the Gold Standard! Well it's been about 3 weeks and AND THIS WORKS!! After the first week I noticed I can easily lift again what I was starting to struggle with before and I've started to increase the weight again at the gym and this is the first time in a long that I feel I can start increasing my weights without hurting myself.<br/>I drink it as directed with water, actually I would say about an hour after my morning workout I have a heaping scoop.It doesn't help with my appetite control because I drink it with water but I have also noticed with the muscle gain and strength I've kept my same weight and am starting to get leaner...
 Son love it.
 GOOD STUFF. FEEL VERY ENERGETIC DURING WORKOUT. I TAKE IT 3 TIMES A DAY. I CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE IN LESS THAN A MONTH.
 Exactly what my body building grandson wanted &amp; at a price I can afford
 Who knows if it's psychological or what, but I see a positive difference in my body when I drink this after workouts.
 ON hits again. This is the tastiest protein powder I have ever taken. I currently am using the Cookies and Cream flavor and it is fantastic. Even though it is a bit pricey, it is worth every penny. I will buy again due to the results and taste.
 Tastes great. I am pretty picky about protein drinks. Most taste chalky, but this one is great. I mix it in milk.
 Better from GNC.
 My favorite kind of protein.  I've used it for years, and it is by far better than any other brand I've tried... it mixes well and tastes good too.
 My husband loves it for weight training, and I love it for Pilates/body weight training. Helps build muscle and helps keep the soreness away. Great price on amazon too
 Flavor is good. But more importantly the product is quality &amp; low carbs and fillers.
 Great item.
 Arrived on time, and great quality.
 It doesnt taste good, even my instructor says so. A big part of the deal is to reward yourself with the protein shake right, but this taste horrible. Besides taht it's a good deal.
 Best whey protein I have ever purchased by far! Nothing comes close to this whey. Taste is amazing and mixes well.
 Tastey stuff. Would order again
 Great protein! Great flavor! Tried numerous brands. This is still the best.
 Delicious, and a perfect size to try out the flavor. I love this in my protein smoothies, but not so much just on it's own.
 With a name like double rich chocolate i expected to be wowed. Not so much but still good. I use them in shakes with a ton of other tasty ingredients so its not that big of a deal.
 It's great quality and value compared to other brands that if you buy local would be double the price.  I hate the taste of these drinks I admit it, but I found if you use Fruit Punch Crystal Light instead of water it tastes MUCH better.
 Good quality cheap protien. I would recommend this product to everyone
 If you are new and searching through all of the hype you can't go wrong with ON. Quality company, quality ingredients (they source their own whey) and great profile. MusclePharm makes another great product for those looking at other options.
 is working very well
 Taste Good, Helps get that protein you need so bad in you everyday.
 ON Gold Standard has always been the most tolerable protein for me. I can drink a shake per day with many different flavors and not get sick of them, can't say that for every brand. Plus for Double Rich Chocolate and Mocha Cappuccino flavors!
 Great deal and taste great
 Great seller all as stated thank you.
 Excellent product!
 This protein has helped me so much on my journey of fitness. Tastes amazing. High quality ingredients. But most importantly there are no fillers and dyes. Healthy all the way around and I will not change off of Optimum. All of their products are top notch.
 This is whey too much protein for a single person
 The only Whey protein that doesn't make me gag or feel like crap. I personally love this protein and have seen some major GAINZ!
 Tastes good, contains quality whey protein.
 All kinds of gains, way better than the Super Mass Gainer or whatever the green tub is called that has like 300g of carbs/serving.
 My first time using this , and I love this one little bit pricey but it does the job
 Definitely need a shaker or mixer for this one. I have tried to mix in a glass with water and milk without a shaker and it still is a little clumpy. Good flavor though.
 My fave. protein powder. Actually tastes good.
 Tasty, good amount of protein.  Previously I was on muscle milk weight gainer, which has greater saturated fat, sodium and has cholesterol.  Surprisingly this product tastes way better despite having minimal fat/sodium.
 not saying it's a bad product and you won't get your protein from it but this flavor is WAY TOO SWEET for me. only ON gold standard flavor so far that i do not like. i'll stick to the vanilla flavors from now on. or go to the NOW brand unflavored which i have also used.
 Gold Standard just may be the best Whey protein you can buy at a good price(ON's Platinum Standard Hydrowhey is too expensive). Barely any fat and all the protein you need. If you are looking for a fantastic Whey supplement, you don't need to look any further.<br/><br/>Also, for all you vanilla lovers out there, buy French Vanilla Creme, its the best. Avoid Vanilla Ice Cream, its horrible.
 i feel allot better with the whey then the synthetic brand. I use to take pro7 but this gives me more energy and makes me feel better physically.
 Tastes great and a great cost per serving.  Dissolves well and mixes really great in milk.
 My husband says this is great if you just want the protein. But he does have to take a multi vitamin whit this as it is pretty much pure protein.
 Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard, Double Rich Chocolate, 5 Pound, really do the work when you refer an excellent working whey protein isolate.<br/>you can buy it with confidence.
 Dissolves completely. Tastes great. No after taste. Love it!
 Great product and taste.
 Dissolves easy, and you can choose lots of different flavors (all have tasted great)
 Low calorie and high protein. Only type of protein I will buy.
 Fantastic protein. It is also a great deal for how much protein you get for the money.
 good tasting
 i always buy this stuff.. little expensive but dissolves well in water..
 Great product!
 Taste good but not as good as muscle milk.  Much healthier and cheaper though.
 Double chocolate is delicious, dark chocolate flavored, and makes great mocha flavor in coffee. Also, micronized like their creatine so it mixes super well... Gold standard indeed!
 I heard good things about this protein and the reviews are right.  The chocolate flavor is absolutely delicious with no hint of that protein flavor you might get in other brands.  Highly recommended.
 Best tasting protein out there when combined with milk(Lactaid)
 Tasty protein powder, mixes easily with milk.
 Good product as described
 It's protein... It's not supposed to taste great. It's about results.<br/>I get that. But this stuff didn't do much for me, AND tasted poor. I get better results using casein, and much better flavor.
 The "Gold Standard" marketing is effectively true - sets the curve for mass-building whey products. The taste esp. - first protein shake I've ever liked the taste of.
 Taste is just.... nonexistent.  I guess that is the cost of cutting nearly all sugar.  Mixes well with water or milk.
 This is quite simply the best Whey Protein powder mix I have ever consumed.  At 72 I no longer pump the iron, but It now helps me maintain muscle<br/>mass.  I choose Vanilla Ice Cream flavor, and I must say, it is the best Vanilla Flavor I have come across.  When Optimum Nutrition says it is the<br/>Gold Standard, they mean it, and I agree.  They have many other flavors to choose from, but it is the content of the WHEY that is so impressive.  I<br/>thinks you will agree if you give it a shot.  The best price comes in the 5 lb. container, but it is available in smaller sizes to check it out.  Best taste comes with the use of a little 2% milk, for that Soda Shop taste.  Use some peaches or strawberries, bananas etc.  I simply love the Bananas and<br/>Peanut Butter for a killer morning kickoff.  Enjoy
 Love this stuff.
 Best protein money can buy. I hope the price comes back down. Seems like every time I order it, it is more expensive. Firm believer in ON products though.
 I've used this product for years. I've also tried many other wheys. This is consistently rated one of the top workout supplements every year for a reason, my hands down favorite.
 Product is as expected and the transaction was simple.
 great tasting for me
 Have used several brands of whey.  This one tastes good and mixes as easily as any.  24 grams of protein in one scoop is great. 120 calories.
 Absolutely love this flavor! Will keep on buying and buying. Results have shown as well. Wish amazing had a subscribe and save for this one lol
 Love this stuff
 wonderful.  thanks.
 cake batter , the one and only way to fly .
 I love the taste and I love that it is not gritty. It dissolves well. I use it after my workouts and sometimes with my breakfast smoothies. I used it in homemade granola bars I made the other day and it turned out great. I have tried strawberry-banana flavor. Do not like chocolate, so I am not going to give that a try, but I have heard it is really good, esp if you like chocolate.
 This is the only whey I drink... Taste the best of all I've tried.
 Only drawback, contains sucralose!!!
 I like the flavor and the benefits. Really makes my muscle improve and it is increasing gradually.
 Good stuff. Taste great.
 Not the tastiest powder, but mixes really well. Has a bit of a chemical taste to it.
 perfect
 The best protein and very cool package
 For someone very picky about protein powder flavors (I can't do anything that remotely tastes like vanilla unless I add a ton of peanut butter powder to the mix), the strawberry is very tasty!
 Wife loves it
 Chalky and lack of flavor. Guess I'll go back to using BSN Syntha-6.
 This protein tastes like a modified formula, unlike the one I bought before.
 Great product. Love it. I can (and everyone else can :) see the difference.
 Amazing taste..creamy but not thick..very smooth and not at all frothy.
 This is the only brand of protein that I will ever buy. Great bang for the buck. Protein with very little carbs and a couple other useful supplements.
 This tastes excellent in cold almond milk. Almost tastes like cold hot chocolate. I do prefer blending it over stirring with a spoon, since spoon stirring it seemed to leave a few clumps. I am quite lactose intolerant and have noticed no problems with this.
 This is my favorite protein powder. I own the Double Rich Chocolate flavor. It tastes delicious in banana and spinach smoothies. I use two scoops of this powder and add in some greek yogurt for a thicker texture. The end result is a delicious, frothy chocolate banana shake where you can't even taste the veggies.<br/><br/>I have also tried the Cookies and Cream flavor which is also delicious and actually tastes good when mixed with water!<br/><br/>This is a fantastic brand. I trust that they have quality ingredients that are not only good for your body, but also great for your tastebuds.
 This chocolate milk is really delicious. I used to be a big supporter and fan of nesquik(sp?) but ever since I bought this chocolate milk I won't turn back.<br/><br/>Tip: Throw some of this chocolate milk in your protein powder for some added taste.
 Price was right and unlike the last few brands I've tried, there is no clumping.  This is actually one of the best dissolving protein powders I’ve ever tried.  The Vanilla Ice Cream is terrible though if you don’t add anything to it to change the flavor.
 bought for a friend
 Two scoops of this, 2 tbsp of peanut butter, ice and water, blender on high...BEST protein smoothie ever, not even kidding.
 The Banana Cream is delicious!
 Solid product, just a little pricey. You are paying for the name, but if you know that you are getting what is listed on the container unlike some brands.
 Sooooo, decided to try this new flavor and it tastes like a puppies breath smells, true story.  Great quality protein, however, not my favorite flavor.
 The Chocolate Malt flavor tastes like dirty bootyholes, but it's a great supplement! I have seen major weight gain, and I love that I only need 1 scoop of this stuff to get a whole 24g of protein! Fizzle wizzle!
 Been on this since 2002. Still the best.
 This taste so much better than any other nutrition shake I ever tried.  I really liked the chocolate but I felt like something different so I ordered this and I can't imagine ever switching to anything else.
 So far we haven't had a flavor of Optimum whey we didn't like.
 it came unsealed and its only 2/3 filled
 Always a good product.<br/>But had to go treasure hunting  for the scoop.
 Tastes great, doesn't cause me any stomach problems.
 The flavor of the vanilla ice cream is just not that great.  I am making smoothies with it now so its not a big deal but with milk only i could pass on the flavor.
 Can't believe this is healthy!
 Hands down the best tasting protein powder I've tried. The extreme chocolate is delicious; sweet milk chocolate taste without being overpowering or fake in taste. I've only mixed it with water thus far. A great way to get in extra daily protein at a great price!
 The protein mix is very high quality and tastes pretty good. Its however a completely different taste than After Max. I use After Max with just some water but I have to use this protein with milk otherwise it tastes terrible.<br/>When used with milk however its awesome and is a very good tasting chocolate milk.
 I got banana cream and the taste is great with just water. I've tried muscle milk as well and I would say that this is comparable but available in more flavors. This works great with a blender bottle too! Excellent product!
 Not my favorite protein powder if just using for shakes - tastes a little dusty on its own.  Great for incorporating into baking or yogurt/puddings.
 I've tried several protein powders, and this one is by far the best. The taste is extremely good. It actually makes me look forward to working out. Plus, it can last a while because 5 lbs. is quite a bit. Very good, when it comes to protein go with the gold standard
 I have been using Optimum Nutrition's Whey Protein Powder for a few years now and it is no doubt the best all around protein powder on the market.  I workout 6 days a week - weights 4 days, cardio two days and ON Whey is always the first thing I grab post workout.  It does a great job helping my muscles to recover and I always feel energized the following day for my workout.<br/><br/>Results aside, this stuff just tastes so much better than any other product.  I don't like drinking milk, so I only use water and it is still incredibly tasty.  Before finding ON Whey, I tried many competing products and they were simply awful.  It felt like a chore to get my necessary protein.  However, with ON whey I crave it after my workouts.  If you are having trouble finding a good tasting protein, look no further.<br/><br/>There's a reason this is one of the best selling protein supplements; it gives you the results you're looking for, it tastes great and it's a good value.
 One of the cheaper flavors for a 5 LB whey, yet delivers same nutritional results. With water it makes me gag, white milk is good and chocolate milk is delicious.
 ON whey gold standard, Double Rich Chocolate was the first protein i tried. The taste is very enjoyable just like quik chocolate milk even though i drink it with water. I use a blender bottle and i never have a problem mixing it up.<br/>I have tried other brands of whey protein and i cant get my-self to enjoy them as i enjoy ON whey gold standard.<br/>About gains well I'm working on it so cant really comment on that.<br/>For me this is the best Whey protein out there, I would definitely recommend it.
 Good as usual! My fav brand!
 Flavour wasn't that good
 Love this stuff
 I got strawberry banana great flavor and great mix-ability , also low ingredients with no extra fillers just the good stuff
 I have yet to find something cheaper that is as good as ON 100% Whey Gold Standard.<br/>I put it in my Vitamix smoothies.
 I blend this with milk, one banana, large scoop of peanut butter and ice. Delicious shake.
 Optimum Nutrition has always been my go-to, so unfortunately I can't provide much insight into other popular brands. I've tried store brand stuff before, but if you go cheap it's going to taste like chalk. That said, Optimum Nutrition always delivers on flavor with minimum clumping. Don't kid yourself, there will still be clumps, but nothing close to the unbearable ones that you get with cheaper protein powders.<br/><br/>As far as flavors go, here are the ones I've tried. Please note I mix all of these with skim milk post workout:<br/>Double Rich Chocolate: Nice smooth chocolate taste, but kind of plain on its own. Great if you're making a shake with something like bananas and peanut butter. 4/5<br/>Banana Creme: You better really like bananas. Personally, this one was too sweet for my taste. 3/5<br/>Chocolate Coconut: Absolutely amazing if you like Almond Joys. Obviously not as good, but when mixed with milk it is pretty darn close. 5/5<br/>Cake Batter: Great at first, but towards the end of a 5lb jar I started getting sick of it. Not too sweet like the banana creme one, but not as close to real cake batter as the chocolate coconut is to an almond joy. I'd say it ends up tasting like cake batter that you put way too much milk in to the point that it starts losing flavor if that makes sense. 4.5/5<br/>Rocky Road: Pretty good, but very similar to the double rich chocolate. Seems to have a little marshmallow flavor in there too. Probably a great choice if you're a bigger rocky road fan than I am. 4.5/5<br/>Vanilla Ice Creme: Similar to the chocolate - great in a shake, but very plain (vanilla if you will) by itself. 4/5<br/><br/>Hopefully this helps people who are looking to purchase any of these flavors out. I highly recommend mixing them with skim milk...I can't imagine half of these with water. Granted I realize if you want to use this pre workout water is the best way to go.
 I like this protein powder a lot. It tastes very good and is also easy to digest. It does not upset my stomach at all. In contrast, some other proteins give me acid reflux which is very inconvenient. Price wise it is also competitive with other products in the market. I will be using this in the future as well.
 Chocolate shake (from Costco) tastes better (sweeter) than double chocolate.
 This is my third bottle already good stuff good price. Taste isn't bad n from what I've read they are a good company trust worthy. Will keep ordering when I'm out hopefully they keep the price tge same
 This stuff is great. Tastes good, mixes well and works. I feel good taking it.
 Really good protein powder it keeps you full.
 This will definitely help you fill your protein requirements for the day. Recommended for bulking or weight maintenance. If you're looking to cut body fat, look at something with fewer carbs/sugar.
 You can't go wrong with whey, delicious flavor in every flavor
 Favorite protein, favorite flavor.
 As always the scoop was at the bottom... Other than that pure fuel!
 This is some great stuff. It does not have that funny taste that some protein shakes do and no after taste. Works great too.
 Tastes nice enough, not been using it as much as I should but I would recommend it.
 Great protein.
 I've tried over 6 flavors of ON whey and this is my favorite. Bought around 10lbs of this stuff so far and I never get bored. Whey must be mixed in anything besides water to taste good.
 Great Chocolate Tasting Protein Powder.<br/>I would recommend this to anyone who is working out and would like protein supplement after a workout.
 Perfect Protein. I order it every time. Exactly what i need.
 good protein low on cholesteral
 Good taste, little on the pricey side.
 Fast delivery, product was what I had ordered. Very happy with my purchase.
 My go-to protein powder. No weird fillers and it mixes well. Initially taste was different but I have grown used to it and now prefer it.
 It's a huge bag a protein. 5 stars
 Great Taste, low sugar. Came quickly.
 My wife drinks and mixes the Vanilla with many different things.  ON has some of the Best Tasting with nothing but the basics.  I love this protein I have tried many others but nothing taste better than ON Protein.
 Really huge, wasnt paying attetion to lbs. Not disappointed, though!
 This stuff tastes great and mixes well with milk. With some ice, milk, a banana and a tablespoon of peanut butter it's a delicious post workout source of muscle building protein.
 Great tasting protein.  I've tried several other brands but definitely prefer ON.
 Strawberry is a good flavor, protein powder dissolved pretty well as there were no clumpy bits. good stuff.
 ON Gold Standard is awesome. Always great taste and consistency.<br/><br/>It has a good price too.<br/><br/>Great product.
 Worlds best Whey Protein. Period.<br/><br/>This thing gets dissolved in water less than the quantity of scoop itself. All you need is spoon. it will take you couple of seconds to dissolve it in the water. I only like the "vanilla ice cream" flavor though.
 This is my favorite product to use after I workout I have seen results in strength and size faster than I ever have before. the price was also better when compared to the supplement stores in the area. Buy it you wont be sorry!!
 Flavor is much better than most, but certainly not the best. Best I have tried is John Gray's mars/venus chocolate shake from Amazon also.
 way bigger than i thought
 great product.
 The protein and amino acid content is excellent.  The flavor is simply the best chocolate there is.  Dissolved in milk it's a straight up dessert.  This is the workhorse of my supplementation regimen.
 Feels really good to take this after workouts and in the morning. Good quality protein. Love the taste.
 I though it would come with a scoop. Maybe I am a little spoiled.
 The best protein powder on the market in my personal opinion.  Included in the powder are BCAAs and Glutamine which means you don't have to worry about supplementing those on the side. I've had a few of the flavors, and would recommend the white chocolate (mixes really well with milk).
 Great!
 This products tastes great and not the typical grainy chalky taste! Will keep buying!
 Great product. decent protein count, low carb, low fat, and i can manage to squeeze 3 shakes a day into a low cal diet. Ive been buying ON for over a year. Slightly over priced product, but Amazon has the lowest price ive seen.
 This one tastes great especially with milk. You don't even need to spend your money on milk because it tastes that good with water. All I drink is 100% whey by this brand. It helps me recover faster so I want be so sore after workouts.
 I haven't tried to many protein powders but my husband and I really enjoy the vanilla flavor this protein has and it doesn't have a weird after taste.
 Optimum Nutrition has never failed me when it comes to providing quality whey protein.  Amazing flavors, overall taste and very pure.  High protein and low carb, doesn't get much better than that!
 Went with the extreme chocolate flavor. Amazing. Tastes like hot cocoa but cold. I mixed it with water and chocolate cashew milk and both are incredible. With a good shaker bottle there is little to no clumps. Very satisfies.
 I have been using the ON products for a few years now and I don't know what I would do without my favorite protein. Its not a lot of calories per serving which is good for me, it mixes fantastically and tastes great also.
 Trying French Vanilla Creme after getting bored with Chocolate. The taste is so great!! I mix it with milk and water.
 Been an avid ON protein shake drinker.  This is by far the best bang for your buck if you are looking for a good protein shake.  What I always refer to people on to escape all the gimmicks of a label ad is to check the nutrition facts and ingredients.<br/><br/>If you you look at this product, serving size to protein amount, you can't beat it.  Also, if you look at the ingredients listing, protein isolate is the first ingredient.  If you know anything about reading ingredient listings, they are listed sequentially with what's most in the product to the least.
 This is the best flavor, good for post workout or if you need extra protein and low calories.
 Amazon purchase experience was great. Coffee flavored whey in theory should be good....I'm finishing the tub but won't be buying this flavour again. Naaaasty.
 Husband uses this every day.  Vanilla is one of his favorite flavors.
 delicious.
 I bought this along with a blender to take a break from the traditional shaker bottle protein shakes. This blends well with fruits and I sometimes use it for baking in place of sugar to make the food healthier.
 Tastes really good and actually mixes into water or milk just stirring it with a spoon. Good stuff!
 Tastes great, competitive with all whey-proteins on the market, easily mixable, easily digestable, 5-star product. Highly recommended for anyone looking to increase their protein intake
 I really love the taste. My favorite one. And good price.
 I have never tried protein shakes before, so I did my research before I bought this product. I am glad I ended up buying it. I enjoy the taste and I can feel the difference after a good workout at the gym. I feel recouperated very shortly after I drink my shake. I recommend making a shake using a blender and experiment with different fruits and other ingredients to make your shake taste even better and for added benefits. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
 Got to try the other flavors but it rates well with me.
 optimum nutrition whey protein.  gold standard by name and reputation.  this flavor is my favorite
 I am working toward bariatric surgery and this protein powder is the core of my diet.  Good flavors and mixes well with water or skim milk.
 This just arrived at my doorstep, and I was eager to try the double rich chocolate flavor. The taste is not overwhelming and it wasn't as sweet as I thought which was perfect! I have tried other brands and I kept switching back and forth, but now I found the perfect protein just the way I like it. Fast shipping and reliable product. Thank you! I would definitely reorder this product.
 I bought the rocky road, its pretty delicious with water. Although I hear others say that other brand taste better, It doesn't matter to me as much as I usually chug the thing.
 much better flavor and dissolves easier then other powders i have used. also more servings for a lower price.
 i use a scoop in everything i cook. I made a protein turkey for thanksgiving and powered it at the end with a thick protein sauce.
 this is my favorite post work out protein flavor.  use this with just water or ice and it's fine.  Mixing it with non-fat milk or silk and it's like drinking a chocolate ice cream shake and better for you.
 Love the mocha cappuccino flavor! Happy with my purchase.
 Coffee is the best flavor, and remains non-disgusting even if you mix with water (unlike the Chocolate or even worse Vanilla flavors *shudder*).
 Great product with a great taste. I use water and some frozen fruit and Psyllium Husk and blend. Very delicious and very filling. Excellent product and best price I've found.
 what more is there to say about protein? okay price and tastes good.
 great
 This whey has NO flavor!! I thought I would try ON Whey (normally I order Muscle Pharm) and I totally regret it!! I have the vanilla ice cream flavor and it lacks any flavor at all. I mix in water and it tastes nothing like vanilla. Do not buy this product if you mix in water and expect flavor. I will be going back to Muscle Pharm as soon as this 5lb tub is gone.
 This stuff tastes so incredibly good. I would honestly drink one every day if it didn't have so much protein in it.
 Great Protein Powder! Tastes great, and really helps to add mass.
 love the flavor
 I started buying protein shakes back in high school and one after another they tasted DISGUSTING!! You couldn't wait to get it down and the pain of actually having any of that stuff hit your tastebuds...uggh! So I looked online and found out that Optimum Nutrition supposedly makes good tasting whey protein powders.  Well they aren't just good, they're actually GRRREEAAT! This is the only type of protein i've bought since then. Chocolate was the best flavor and they expanded on it with mint chocolate, double rich chocolate, chocolate shake, creamy chocolate, and now "extreme" chocolate. Basically, if you buy a chocolate flavored optimum nutrition shake, you're getting the best tasting protein out there for that price, hands down.
 grey product, my boyfriend has a shake with this protein every day an absolutely loves it.
 I was surprised how big this 5lb tub was. It is a much better deal than buying protein at retail.<br/><br/>Taste was good. Not great but gets the job done. I really like how well it mixes, it does not leave a lot of clumps when you shake it
 I used the "vanilla ice cream" for a while. Usually mixed it with cold brew coffee. When I ordered again back in November it said "NEW IMPROVED GREAT TASTE" or something and I didn't think much of it until trying. It's really, really sweet and kind of saccharine. Tried it a couple different ways - more coffee, in cereal, whatever. Still gross and cloying. Got a return on it and will switch brands since the vanilla was the only flavor I liked.<br/><br/>As I write this I realize I sound like a picky eater - I swear to god, I'm not. I order all kinds of stuff off menus, eat beef head tacos and cook a bunch of different stuff, too. I just think the new vanilla flavor is gross.
 Extreme Milk Chocolate has the best flavor that I have tasted as far as whey protein goes I can drink this one like a normal drink. Other flavors and brands I have to drink in one go so i can survive the experience. For me Extreme Milk Chocolate is what I will buy from now on. The flavor kinda reminds me of a hot coco drink. Other flavors I have tried from this brand are the delicious strawberry and rocky road which in my opinion taste really bad and are not worth buying. I also have 3 other friends that say Extreme Milk Chocolate is their favorite flavor as well. One friend I converted after he had some of mine and the two others found this flavor as their favorite on their own. So that shows its not just my opinion. I understand everyone has different tastes but at least for me and my friends this is the flavor to get.
 Whey protein strikes again. Great product. Love it
 I hear whey is better than anything else, I'll try. I like trutein and unless this has a noticeable difference in my physique i will be going back to the awesome flavor of trutein.
 Excellent product!  Smooth and mild taste.  Mixes with my other ingredients perfectly.  Will stick with this brand from now on!
 Great product! Highly recommended. Great macros.<br/><br/>I would purchase this over the competitors.
 Solid quality protein. Wish it said something about the coffee flavor having 40mg of straight up caffeine per serving though.
 Excellent product and great price. Price is very competitive to other online stores and much cheaper than brick and mortar stores.
 Coffee flavor sucks! Don't buy it unless you like the sensation of gagging every 2 seconds...
 Very small package. I didn't think this product was any better then the one I use.  I won't buy again.
 I have been lifting for about two years and this whole time I couldn't find a protien that actually works and doesn't have the typical protien taist. I have finialy found one. I could sip on the extreme milk chocolate all day so I no longer have to chug down the shake at the end of my workout I can actually enjoy it.
 Good stuff. Tastes fine
 always order this from here, great!
 my go to protein for years. I rotate my BCAAs and my pre-workouts, but ON Protein is my mainstay!
 My husband and I tried different flavors of this product before and definitely this is one of the favorites! If you are taking your workout seriously, it will help you a lot for recovery and muscle construction.
 very good
 Great value for the amount of protein
 I ordered this for my boyfriend and he loves it! The taste is amazing and its a HUGE CONTAINER. Lasted him a few months and he gained a lot of muscle with the Whey Protein and exercise combined.
 Best whey protein on the market. Great value for the price. My guns are looking better than evah!
 Mixes easily and has a good taste. I have two hard gainer sons and have seen a marked improvement with their muscle gains, and they like the taste also. I have already ordered a Cookies and Cream flavor and we like that too,<br/>not much different from Vanilla though.
 The product is easily diluted, however the taste is not of my liking, next time I will order Extreme Milk Chocolate, i ordered that flavor before.
 Good flavor, good protein. dont get strawberry banana it tastes terrible.
 Good deal for the product  it's available in stores but the deal here was good
 This thing lasts for ever!
 Good product, great price, decent taste. This was my second "tub" of protein I've purchased. The first was a big drug store's own brand in vanilla. The generic brand actually tasted better; but this one's not too bad (but I mix it with water only--might taste better with milk and some additives). Filling and feels good after a workout. I'm hooked on protein!!!
 Good
 great product and flavor.
 Extreme Milk Chocolate is the best flavor I've used. Onky started using whey protein about 18 months ago and tried 3 other brands before ON and this is by far the best.
 Good quality product
 I writing this review on 5lb - french vanilla.<br/><br/>Pro<br/>1) It tastes so smooth and nice. I couldn't taste any chemical taste to it as I did with my previous whey. Sometimes, I work out so that I can justify myself to drink this (not even joking)<br/><br/>2) It mixes real well with water and 2% low fat milk. I haven't t tried other drink but I had no problem with water and milk.<br/><br/>3) It works. After heavy weight lifting, my sore muscles used to take 3~4 days to completely recover and ready for the next round. With this whey it takes me about 2~3 days and I can feel my muscles growing faster than before. I actually started to gain weight a little faster.<br/><br/>4) Reliability. This product has been out in the market and used by many customer for years. You can rely on this whey and not worry about banned chemicals, etc.<br/><br/>5) Fair price. I won't say this is the cheapest one out there. But it is definitely  a good price for its performance and safety.<br/><br/>Con<br/>I couldn't find it yet. I will update it if I see one.<br/><br/>Overall, I definitely recommend this product. I did find some cheaper products on Amazon but I did not risk my health over like 5~10 bucks. For the quality of the product, the price is definitely fair and I will buy it again when it runs out.
 Straight Chocolate is better, this has a bit of a chemical sweetness after-taste that would make me gag if mixed with water, milk makes it way better.
 I just love this protein. The taste is very nice. I was using another brand but I came back to this one to discover that it was so much improved over last year's. I really think this is the best protein I have tried so far.
 I have been trying Hydro Platinum for the past 2+ months, 1 tub per month.5 approx for 2 people. This deal surpassed the Hydro by almost about double the products weight (Hydro= 3.5 lbs, Gold Standard= 5 lbs)and pound for pound in the supplemental specs, Gold stardard comes out equal to Hydro. The reason why the hydro has a slightly higher amino acid per serving ratio is because of it having a slightly bigger scoop.(Ex. Hydro= Scoop 77cc: Tryptophan-495 Valine-2259, Gold Standard= Scoop 70cc: Tryptophan-405 Valine-1422. Same shinanigan if both had the same size scoop. I initially wasn't even aware that Gold Stardard came pre-equipped with the hydrolized protein and if you didn't either.. now you know. It also has the peptides and bcaa's and digestion enzymes etc, etc..everything the Hydro has. The mixing qualities are exact. The taste of this Chocolate malt is pretty good (Milk chocolatey liquorish) like wise with Hydros Turbo Chocolate(rich darkydensey sweet chocolate). Taste isn't even an issue with me though, I wouldn't care if was horribly tasting chalk as long it was the best performing. But all in all Gold Standard has more flavors to chose from and like I said it has a greater product for-the-buck ratio. Subscribe and Go with the Gold Standard it will be exactly the same as hydrowhey. I have cancelled my Hydro subscription and traded it in for this Heavier Better deal.<br/><br/>I haven't tried the Hydro Builder (different than the Hydrowhey but again with the bigger scoop thing. Even bigger than Hydrowheys) but to save you some time, I've read various reviews and they say it isn't all that much better than the Gold Standard 100%. Some say the continuous creatine doses may even have bad effects if you have kidney issues, some say its a cruddy "lets make a new product AGAIN" scheme. Although it would be a one stop shop, I just ordered the glutamine and creatine separately and now if I mixed them the total weight I can make has made it worth while and more accurate to my liking. I haven't even put a dent on the containers, all you add is a tsp of each(You can probably add more without any bad symptoms popping up, too much of anything can be bad, balance is key). Although I still do want to give Hydro Builder a whack just to see whats up. =) The specs of the good stuff feel to be same if I just add another half a scoop of protein or more if I Want and Could generously do with the savings I'm getting.
 Best one in the market!
 My number one product was Designer whey protein and this is the first time I use the Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Whey. The tast is ok if you drink it with water or milk only. I choosed the dark choclate flavor so it's not sweet at all. I used to enjoy the designer taste better. As far as the results, I don't see it yet because I'm not consuming it on a regular basis but my friends got big and cut using it. The level of protein is higher in it than other protein shakes and the price is reasonable. I would recommend it for others.
 Dissolves easily. Tastes great. High protein content. Relatively cheap. Its protein powder. You are likely thinking too hard about this. Just buy this one.
 24g Protein, 3g Carbs, and 1g Fat.  What's to lose with this?
 This is a very good product and I think it helps me a lot
 Here's what I want: trust worthy contents that I can stomach and mixes well. This is all the above. It Mixes great with milk or water and blends well with banana's and such. Good price on Amazon as compared to brick and mortar.
 Bought this for my husband. He says: "Tastes great, dissolves easily in water, and is a great post-workout drink. Would be even better with ice and milk."
 It really is the gold standard. Other proteins have been proven to skimp out on the actual protein content. ON stays true.
 Quality and tastes good
 best one I have tried will stick with this a while taste is good no burping and I feel like it is the most effective for muscle building
 Good protein
 The taste is extremely good without a doze of carbs. If you're overweight or don't want to bulk, this is one of the best products to get lean muscle.<br/>At the same time, ON100% promises that it will be easy to melt powder even with a spoon. Not really.
 Good value, low calorie, high protein that stops hunger just as good as a regular breakfast at a fraction of the fat, calories etc.
 Best testing. I used several other brands and threw in garbage. This one double chocolate flavor, whole family drinks it and this is my 3rd 5lb bag. Love it.
 Not bad.  Not the best chocolate flavor I've had, though.
 Great protein powder!
 Arrived on time.  Good tasting flavor.
 I love the taste and is a high quality protein powder.
 Taste good effect is obvious i love it
 I bought double rich chocolate flavor becuase some top reviews said it has good taste but after first shake it taste like fake chocolate. Oh man, there is 5 lbs....
 very good taste
 I've been using this brand of protein powder for over 15 years now. It's always been a solid choice. Mixes well, tastes great. I just wish it was more affordable, I remember when I used to buy 10lbs for $50.
 I've gone through several 5lb containers of the strawberry and double chocolate containers. Both taste pretty good, and dissolve easily. I make a shake daily after my workout, and add a banana and some milk to give me some extra sustenance. Always happy with this product.
 Greatest tasting Whey you will find that is not loaded with a bunch of crap. The protein is what you can expect from ON (great) but the taste when mixed with either water or milk will leave a chocolate bar taste in your mouth. Unbelievable.
 Go to brand! No additional stuff, just what you need.
 I have never really been into proteins before but I have tried a few that my brother has bought over the years and I was always disgusted. My husband and I recently got into lifting and are glad we chose this protein, it dissolves great and tastes great too. I take mine with 6b oz skim milk.
 Nothing double rich about this flavor. Horrible and bitter 👎👎. Don’t buy. Stick to ISO 100 chocolate protein. Better taste!
 Son loves it.
 Great product. I use a very frequently and does the job for me. But highly recommend this to anyone.
 There is no cup inside. Very inconvenient to measure it as the instruction refers to cups.
 My husband buys this product over and over again. He is super happy with the way it makes him feel!
 Love the taste
 After i started taking this protein I feel much better after workouts. This is because after i bought this i am taking twice the amount of protein I was taking before.<br/><br/>I am giving this one 5 stars because i do feel the difference when I start taking the whey protein from ultimate nutrition, which i understand is supposed to be very good too. I still have some left but I will stick to ON's whey protein because it has a good price and I definitely see results when i taking it.
 I order 1 a month. Best protein I have found
 Excellent taste and is lasing me a long time!
 Great taste! Vanilla ice cream, excellent price, great quality, the best selling protein worldwide!! go for it! you wont regret!<br/>yo can't  go wrong with ON!! =)
 I'm not a crazy workout person but I do work out in some capacity every other day at least.  I just like the way this tastes better than everything else!
 The perfect post-workout drink. I mix it in some variation of cranberry juice. Pure satisfaction.
 Outstanding product delivered timely and well-packaged.  Whey to go.
 I have ordered this twice. Taste is very sweet and nice, but once you get used to it, I would recommend trying another flavor out.
 Great product, have been using for some time and helps rebuild muscle. Good flavor.
 Tastes great and easy to mix.  Dissolves well.
 Great flavor, try in a smaller size before committing to 5lbs!
 It has amazing taste, I love it!
 Great product.  Does as advertised and tastes adequate.  (Extreme Milk Chocolate)
 Easy to mix and tastes pretty good.
 I have been using ON's protein powder for years: great quality.<br/>This is the first time I buy Cookies N' Cream.  The flavour is good but really sweet and takes a while to get used to.  I do not think I am gona purchase this flavour again but I'll stick with double choccolate and french vanilla
 The product has a seal on the outside but when I removed the lid there was no seal. The container itself had multiple scratches and damage. It seems like the container was reused. I think this protein is fake.
 I love this product. It tastes great especially blended into a fruit smoothie. It also mixes well with water and tastes fine like that too especially when it's cold. I would recommend this product to everyone!
 Tastes great, mixes easy.  Grams in protein is near total grams size of scoop which is supposed to be a great indicator according to one article I read.
 The milk chocolate taste amazing with almond milk! Mixes well (i use a promixx type cup). I think this protein would go well with a banana or any other type of fruit.
 The great thing about this is that it now has a zip-lock to close and open bag. Same great taste and value.
 I mix 2 scoops with a cup of chocolate Silk and a frozen banana.  The soy protein by ON makes a much better shake, both in taste and consistency, but this stuff ain't bad.  There's a faintly bitter taste, but it's still pretty darn good, and it doesn't upset my stomach after a hard workout.
 Had great gains on this protein!
 The best protein ever I  have been using it for year's especially the double rich chocolate
 GET IT<br/>Affordable , works well, taste bomb.
 Great
 great protein powder, really felt the difference, very mixable, great price and is good to know that you're getting you're dose of quality protein of the day after killing yourself at the gym, the only con is that the flavor isn't that great but  I don't really bought these for the flavors anyways so 5 star XP.
 ON Gold Standard is by far the best choice in whey protein, for just about every reason.<br/><br/>So far the flavors I've tried (chocolate and cookies and cream) have been surprisingly good. Good enough that my female non-exercising friends ask for a sip or two just because they like the flavor.<br/><br/>Of the few powders I've tried, ON Gold Standard mixes the most easily. With a spoon  you can actually get it to pretty much fully dissolve into water or milk in less than a minute (some powders take far to long to dissolve, or never fully dissolve and instead just get clumpy and end up making your drink lumpy and chewy.. yuck).<br/><br/>In terms of nutrition, ON has enough protein per serving (24 or 25 grams) with a relatively low calorie count, and not too many carbs. The cholesterol is high, but that's to be expected for a whey powder.<br/><br/>Price-wise, ON Gold Standard is cheaper than most other whey powders, and the cheaper ones usually either aren't as tasty, are harder to dissolve, contain too many calories per serving, or contain less protein per serving.<br/><br/>I started with ON Gold Standard, and after trying other whey powders, and after trying others I've come back to this one. It's by far the best for the price.
 Best protein out there!
 Great as always
 ON is my go-to product for Casein, Vitamins, Creatine, and Whey. They make a great product that works well and you can feel it. Their Whey is no exception. Just make sure you always go with something with Chocolate flavor!
 Delicious and mixes easily with no clumps.  Will def buy again and probably more flavors, too
 Love it
 But the price has gotten crazy. We've been using this same ProPow for nearly two decades, and by now we might have been able to buy a small house on a lake somewhere.
 My husband loves the taste
 --great tasting protein powder<br/>--provides good amount of protein per serving<br/>--affordable
 Best of the best I love this stuff!
 Taste Delicious and is great with frozen strawberries.  Enjoy
 I bought this shake for this cleanse smoothie to put inside the smoothie to put some protein in it. It was amazing and very delicious. You should buy this product. It was amazing!
 Very fast shipping, great product!
 Tasty
 Definitely one of the better tasting protein powders out there! Mixes well also!
 Good price.  Great taste and easy to make.  Definitely will purchase again and again.
 This product tastes great and arrived very quick. Love it as a protein shake or mixed with Greek yogurt for some extra protein.
 good tasting protein
 Probably the best tasting protein powder out there. Very reputable company!!! Must buy.
 Mixes so well, tastes so good, for a protein shake.  Will keep buying as long as they keep making it!
 Great!
 Fantastic protein powder.  Great taste.  High protein, low carbs.  No clumps upon shaking with BlenderBottle.
 Works as expected.
 Powder mixes easy with water, no extra bubbles, well dissolved.  I've tried a bunch of other powders, but keep coming back to the Gold Standard.
 Tastes pretty good
 It was bad
 good
 This brand of protein is good, but the cookies and cream flavor is seriously disgusting, doesn't even remotely taste like that. it makes me gag every time I drink it. Don't buy the cookies and cream flavor.
 Cookies and cream is so good.
 Awlsome  product. Thank you.
 Recommended by my dietician.  I first tried it with almond milk, but strangely that was too much.  Like it with water just as it is.  Love to mix the Cake batter (is there a more insanely good flavor?), with the Chocolate Mocha (well one just as good!).  Any chance you guys could come up with a flavor like Broccoli Cheese Soup, Tortilla Soup (spicy), por asta-less Alfredo that could be heated?  The sweet flavors are great, but when you're on a liquid only diet, the craving for something salty is equally compelling.
 Just the best pure whey protein product for me. Tastes great and digests great. 72 servings is a lot of servings!
 Best protein powder out there hands down. If you are on the fence or this is a first time buy this is definitely worth your time and money. It costs a little more but remember you get what you pay for. The taste is also by far much better than any other I have tried.
 I used the Vanilla flavor the last two times but...Amazon didn't have it in the big tub this time, so I tried this - Chocolate Mint.  Tastes good and no after taste.  Minor complaint is that it doesn't dissolve as totally as the vanilla did - no matter how much I shake.
 This is a good choice of Whey Protein if you want to supplement into your Nutrition Plan. You have to workout hard and drink this protein within 45 minutes for Optimal Results. Double Chocolate is my favorite flavor.
 I usually drink this after I pick things up and then put them down. It is the best tasting protein out there that doesn't have all that added crap in it.
 I bought this after being bored to death by the standard vanilla/chocolate/strawberry offerings. The coffee taste is good, the ingredients are quality, and price was comparable (per pound) to big box stores. Big box stores, however, don't have this quality/quantity/flavor.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it cannot be mixed with hot water--that would have made my life.
 It is what it is.. I am taking it to bulk. My diet is pretty sufficient in all other aspect. Good value and fast shipping.
 It's worth the price. Excellent pre / post workout drink. Packs a punch.
 works great in water and doesn't dissolve in milk
 Perfect
 ok
 great
 Tastes amazing. Works amazing. A great product. And the price isnt too bad.
 I am satisfied so far with the product. I find that unless I use a blender or blender bottle it is very difficult to create a shake that is not clumpy. That being said, my blender bottle makes it dissolve fully, as does mixing it into my morning smoothies (Banana, frozen blueberries, almond milk &amp; spinach). It tastes great mixed into the smoothies and adds lots of protein!
 Tried and true, I always come back to this protein. It is pricey, but you know your getting what you paid for. I recommend the 10 lb bag if you are a returning customer to this product.
 Have ordered this protein four or five times now. It is a great product! I have only tried the double chocolate flavor and it mixes very well and tastes great with water or milk. The only thing I wish different was a lower price but overall great quality protein.
 Excelente
 Great mixing ability and taste. But too much intake of this stuff will lead to acne and multiple small farts.
 Best protein on the market.. that and you add the best place to purchase it for the best combo
 Taste just like some chocolate milk and no bloating. Great stuff
 By far the best protein on the market. It has a good flavor and it's easy to mix.
 Love this protein.  Low in carbs
 For the price, not bad but ehh I would not mind buying again.
 it was not sealed under the lid
 I love ON protein. Best flavors. low sugar. Good for you! Tastes great!
 Favorite flavor and brand. There is a reason this is the most popular whey on the market. Additionally, it is also some of the leanest stuff you can get.
 Favorite protein powder.
 Good protein! Leaves me full and no gross aftertaste.
 Some of the best protein powder I have ever taken. Tastes good, mixes well , and generally does what it should...cut recovery time and help build muscle. I'd give it 6 stars if I could.
 my favorite brand, got and talked many into this product
 The French Vanilla flavour is great, tho I've only had the extreme milk chocolate and this. I prefer the vanilla, it's got a great, not chemically flavour, mixes well and is good with water, milk, oatmeal, or smoothies. Highly recommend.
 Best product for its price and flavor as well. Will continue to buy.!
 I usually fill my half gallon of skim milk up with 8 or so scoops and drink it right out of there. It helps me recover from intense workouts and build muscle.
 Delicious.  Not so sure it tasted like ice cream, but it was very good.  Added it to my morning smoothie.
 I have gotten the strawberry banana flavor before, and it was awesome. The price is good too. However, they sent me chocolate mint instead. I would of sent it back, but I was lazy and curious about the flavor. It's not terrible, but I wish I had gotten what I ordered. Strawberry banana is much better.
 We have tried a few different flavors and the double chocolate is definitely our favorite.
 great variety
 Tastes pretty good and is a protein powder with minimal carbs. I will buy this again if the price stays as competitive as when I first purchased.
 Awesome protein with such a good flavor and enough to last You a while.
 Great stuff
 As advertised.
 This is one of the better tasting protein powders I have ever tried. It also mixes very well with water or milk; unlike, many powders that create an overly thick consistency. The double rich chocolate flavor is so good i am often tempted to drink more than required.
 good
 Good product would buy again
 as advertised
 Love it. Tasty, mixes well with water and other liquids with just a spoon. Does the job (aka perfect for meatheads).
 Love optimum nutrition whey protein in general, but mint chocolate is a terrible flavor.
 I use the Vanilla Creme protein powder in oatmeal in the mornings and in smoothies sometimes.  Drinking this with water is less appetizing, as the drink will foam up a lot and it tastes pretty synthetic.  Not bad, just not outstanding.  I use the Extreme Milk Chocolate, which tastes great, for drinking after workouts or throughout the day.  The chocolate is not as good for mixing with other foods, however.
 Delicious 😋
 The strawberry flavour is delicious, like strawberry ice cream.  No detectable sweetener aftertaste.  Mixes really great even when I'm lazy and just give it a few shakes in a normal cup (not the awesome BlenderBottle).
 I absolutely love Whey Vanilla mixed with PB fit Peanut butter
 This is one of the best protein powders available and from possibly the best trusted company too. I use 2 scoops a day one when I wake up at 4am with 8oz of 2% milk and one post workout with water. This stuff taste amazing with water and even better with milk. Cant beat amazons price either.
 Gold Standard is everything whey should be. It tastes great while also providing the body with protein and other nutrients that you might not be able to get daily. The ONLY reason i gave it a 4 out of 5 is because the flavor wasnt what i expected; It's not bad. Just not good. This whey stirs and/or mixes very well. i'll be purchasing it from now on
 It taste terrible with water, but with milk in the other hand it's so good.
 Probably not the best quality available, but still GREAT. NOT chalky, GOOD taste, BLENDS WELL with other flavors or just straight water. I had tested this with the smallest size first before buying the large 5lb one.
 24g of protein per serving. Mixes well, tastes great. No long list of questionable ingredients. A smart whey concentrate and isolate blend with tons of BCAA's, and almost no fats, carbs, or sugars.
 I have been using gold standard for years and I have always been satisfied with the results and the taste. Unfortunately the price has been rising since it became more popular. This used to cost around $30 only a few years ago :(.
 I've been taking Optimum 100% Whey since high school (and I'm now a few years out of college). Like my review title says, it's reliable, it's consistent, and it's a quality product. I've tried all kinds of brands, and even gone so far as to order custom protein blends (which is still valuable if you have very esoteric needs). When it comes to straightforward, uncomplicated results, however, Optimum is virtually impossible to beat.<br/><br/>-Cost effective, especially if you're an Amazon Prime member.<br/><br/>-Highly mixable; whether it be a manual shaker or a blender.<br/><br/>-Several flavor options.<br/><br/>-Contains protease and lactase enzymes to aid digestion, and avoid stomach problems.<br/><br/>I'm a professional athlete, and have to travel all over the world to compete. Quality protein sources can be hard to come by when you're in an unfamiliar environment, and Optimum 100% Whey is one of the most important things I travel with.
 This is my absolute favorite flavor of any protein I've ever tried. Tastes just like chocolate milk!
 Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard, enough said!
 This stuff is great! i have only used it once but it tastes great and didn't break the bank.
 I've tried a few protein powders over the course of 10 years, slowly loosing weight, always had the same problem after the workout. I'd had enough of the 'the runs' and threw in with Optimum. The difference was night and day, not only dose it fend off 'the shakes', but the next day I was far less sore, plus one other perk, it actually tastes good.<br/><br/>I'll never go back to the cheap Wal-mart crap again, my friends....this is it!
 Mixes into a great shake
 Just started taking this product, so can't attest to any results yet, but it is by far the easiest-disolving powdered protein product I have ever used and it tastes good enough to drink with nothing but water.
 Satisfied
 Honestly doesn't taste that different from standard vanilla protein powder.
 Great flavor
 My husband LOVES this stuff. We find it the cheapest on Amazon.
 Tasks super great. Can't go wrong with Optimum Nutrition. I buy a lot of their products because they have been around for a while and have been proven to work by many pro athletes
 Good
 Optimum Nutrition produces the best tasting whey protein. I usually get vanilla but decided to give their chocolate flavor a try. Needless to say, it tasted great!
 This protein is just awesome.
 This mocha cappuccino flavor powder is, in my opinion, the best tasting protein powder ever made - and I've been using protein powders for nearly 30 years.  Mixed with milk, it's even more delicious than chocolate milk. :-)
 Great taste, great mixablilty, great quality, great value!
 I have only tried a couple of whey products and this one by far is one of the better tasing ones.  I suppose it does what it's supposed to do and I have experienced no adverse side effects from it.
 I really like the flavor of it, mixes great in the blender with some coconut and almond milk! Won't dissolve that great just in a glass though. You can see a difference the more you work out (of course the whole diet plays a big role, but it is part of it!), so I'm giving it 5 stars as I can't think of anything bad to say about it.
 As always, great protein shake.
 I used to plug "5 lb. whey" into google and just buy whatever came up as cheapest.  But after stumbling upon this one recently, it's definitely my go-to from now on.<br/><br/>1.  Ease of mixing.  You truly don't need a shaker; this mixes extremely well with a spoon and a glass of water/milk.  No leftover globs like most proteins that won't mix up no matter how hard you stir.<br/><br/>2.  Easy on your digestive system.  I usually drink about 4 shakes a day, and I don't have ANY digestive problems.  The last protein I tried literally gave me constant gas.  No gastrointestinal problems here whatsoever.  big plus.<br/><br/>3.  Taste.  I like to drink mine with water and the taste is fine.  Often I'll get sick of one brand and have to switch to another, but so far so good with Optimum.<br/><br/>4.  Value.  There are 77 servings in the 5-lb tub.  No tricks like making it take 2-3 huge scoops of the power to make 1 serving.  One scoop = 1 serving = 24 grams of protein.<br/><br/>Hope this is helpful - I don't usually bother with reviews but really liked this product.  The only negative I've seen is the fact that it contains artificial sweeteners, but that doesn't bother me.  Only 1g of fat and 1g of sugar per serving... that's basically negligible, and an acceptable trade-off for the taste.
 The only whey I use. been using it for years
 getting swole!
 My husband and I have been taking this with shakes for years. We both work out and use it before and after. The taste is great and the protein and multitude of vitamins are great.
 The best macros I've seen in a protein powder although the sweetner leaves a difficult aftertaste unless you drink it with milk. I use it with water and hate the aftertaste.
 Wont say much about this. It's the most popular, affordable, and effective protein.
 LOve the strawberry flavor. its great
 Great tasting powder
 This whey protein is one of the best I have ever used! Besides tasting great it is a great way to start your day. I have not used it as a post workout shake yet but I plan to soon. Also it is a great value @ under 80 cents a serving. Give it a try you won't be disappointed.
 Worth the buy with amount given
 Tastes good (okay, this isn't a milkshake, but neither does it taste chalky or leave an unpleasant aftertaste) and has a good balance of protein to carbs without unnecessary calories.
 Best Tasting Protein Powder with Verified ingredients from an independent study. (vitamins/minerials/protein/etc they say it has inside it ACTUALLY has!)
 definitely works. i am taking it daily and this coupled with some lean meat and a green salad after workout and a nice 6 hour sleep is what you need for visible results.
 My bf and I been using this for over a year now, we buy a new one every two months. Shipping is fast and always on time! we are still using this and will keep buying from the same seller.
 Its ok to me.  After trying Optimum Nutrition's Whey Gold Standard, I have 2 issues.  The first issue is the taste of the Extreme Milk Chocolate.  Lets just say this, I have tasted wayt better chocolate whey proteins than this...mixed in both skim milk or water.  The other brand (I won't mention the name) taste better and has more protein (30 grams of a 36 gram scoop).  Optimum Nutrition has only 24 grams of protein in a 32 gram scoop.  The other issue I have is that I notice my body still in pain (muscle repair) up to 3 days after weight training.  The other brand I was using had a shorter muscle repair time....with all things being equal....number of sets, reps, exercise, and amount of protein shakes (fluid oz) taken after workout.  I'd probably go back to my other whey protein brand after finishing this 5 lbs jar.
 I'm usually a fan of the banana cream flavor, but I tried a small container of mint chocolate in the past and liked it, so imagine my surprise then I order the big 5# tub of mint chocolate and find that it didn't much taste like chocolate or mint at all. It's like they put half the normal amount of chocolate flavoring in and 1/10 the mint flavor as normal. Now I'm stuck chocking down this nasty stuff for the next few weeks :(
 as desribed
 Love this stuff. The bottle is huge! I wish it tasted a little more chocolaty. Otherwise it does the trick.
 This protein is seriously overpriced. There are better options out there that blend. I recently purchased Myprotein (Google it) for less than half the price of ON. It blends better than ON and the taste is on par with ON. It also has a higher rating on Labdoor than ON.
 The standard. Not great taste  but ok. But great value and nutrition.
 good stuff
 Delivered in two days! A great product and I have always stuck with whey protein and have never been disappointed. Probably the best deal you will find out there.
 Great taste. Shake it for 30 seconds and it dissolves perfectly. Way better than the over-prized GNC stuff.
 This cookies &amp; cream whey smells kinda weird, at least to me, but it tastes REALLY good. Much better than the chocolate I'd say. Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard is the most trustworthy and highest quality whey you can get for sure.
 Best protein on the market.
 Can’t beat ON whey. Great taste and great results.
 For a protien supplement, it's Optimum Nutrition all the whey! Will never buy a different protein again as long as they keep with their standards!
 I really like it, only con is it doesn't mix well with ice and water, Haven't tried it with milk but I'm thinking it will mix better with milk over water.
 Instantly swoll. BUY THIS NOW
 I bought this product along with a bunch of other products including NatureWise Ketons, Fatburner, C4, other vitamins, and proteins.  I weight in about 165lbs two weeks ago, today I am at 158lbs . One of the products I bought is working.
 Not my favorite, has protein only and no fiber. Also doesn't have a strong taste. It may be chocolate but it tastes diluted.
 I've spent over a GRAND on Optimum Nutrition products over the years. I used to love this brand and stand by their "great" products. This once delicious protein is now disgusting. I cannot stand drinking it anymore. Anyone with throat problems, tonsil stones, etc should NOT be drinking this. It really irritates your throat. Must be the new ingredients.<br/><br/>Their chocolate and double chocolate were delicious. Used to buy the 10 lb bags religiously near my gym. About 2 years ago, I noticed that the taste changed. I couldn't drink it with just water anymore and the taste was off regardless if I used milk or anything else. I still have three big tubs that I can't even drink.<br/><br/>If you enjoy their new taste? Go for it. Personally, I remember how the old product tasted and it was leaps and bounds better than their new protein.
 This is my go to whey protein. I love this product because it mixes well and has great flavor. Optimum nutrition is my go to for supplements.
 Been using ON whey for years and still to me the best tasting chocolate whey I've had. Great for mixing with fruit shakes!
 Would have been better if they didn't change the formula I liked the old formula better than the new and improved formula, the formula now is to thick 😞 and contains different ingredients than the original formula
 Good product. Mix it with the Optimum Nutrition French Vanilla Casein protein powder and coffee. Great!!
 My favorite protein powder.  I love most of the flavors and I have been using this brand for years.  I recommend it to everyone.
 it contains 24g of protein, which is good sources to build muscles. However, the taste is a little bit different. It is ok, but basically it has no taste even it is vanilla flavor. If you are get used to it, it is good. But the first time I tried, it was hard to drink since the vanilla flavor is so light.
 Why even leave a comment, we all know optimum nutrition 'gets down' with the protein supplements.
 This is the best around!
 Favorite product:)
 A good product!
 This is one of the best proteins I ever tried.<br/>It taste good especially when you mix it with milk.<br/>I got my best results so far using this protein.
 I was blown away how much came
 This is really good protein powder.  i've purchased it several times and im very impressed with it...It tastes great, mixes well and is a quality protein source
 Great tasting and very smooth. I will buy again.
 My favorite protein. Doesn't make me bloated or gassy
 Great taste!
 Great price. Lacks taste.
 fresh.<br/>I add it in whole milk and oatmeal.<br/>tastes great! like chocolate milk!
 Blends nicely and digests well
 Tastes great in either milk or water and I've been making gains so it seems to be helping!
 I love this brand, I have been using it for almost a year and I like the flavors, you can use it on everything .... not that many chemical stuff like the others ... If you want to bulk up and for cheap and know what you are getting into your body, this is a great option
 I have tried several other brands of protein powder, and by far, this is the best brand I have used! It mixes very easy, it has MANY flavors to choose from, and the vanilla flavor(s) mix very well with fruit, etc. It has a great mix of many of the vitamins, and nutrients that you have to take with "other" brand protein powders.<br/><br/>All this, and add to it the low Amazon price + subscribe and save feature, and you have near perfection! I am currently buying the 10lb vanilla ice cream flavor, and paying slightly more than if I were to buy the 5lb tub at GNC stores.
 Great product and a good price.  Whey good!  If there's a better product on the market for the price - I want to know about it.
 Glad I bought it, wish I had more on hand to keep bulking up!
 The cake batter is awesome. My only grip is that i had to buy a 5 pd bucket to get it. I get tired of protein quick so i usually keep 3 flavors around at once to change up. Make the cake batter a permanent flavor and sell it in a 2pd jug please.
 Great tasting and high quality.
 This protein is great for anyone want to build muscle. I have had couple of other protein powder, and this is the one I keep buying.<br/><br/>Absolutely amazing !!!! I recently start going to gym. Since I am on a diet, I have to get the best protein powder. This stuff has very little of sugar, carb and fat. As a result, I get the results very quick.<br/><br/>I have lost over 15 pounds while working out and taking this as the supplement.<br/><br/>As for the flavor,  banana flavor is ok, but I like the vanilla one way better!!
 When it comes to the completely unregulated supplement industry, you get what you pay for. Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard is pricey compared to its competitors, but it is absolutely above and beyond any other protein powder on the market in terms of quality and truth in labeling.
 The container came unsealed and no scoop inside (not sure if that normal) with different flavor from what I ordered. Waiting few months for the results if will match expectation or not and I'll decrease the rate to 1 at that time if not.
 Smells as good as it tastes!!
 Gainstown, bitch
 Great product.  Low fat, low calories, and high protein.
 Always good price for good product
 The Rocky Road is a favorite in our house, both with me and my 12-year-old son. I drink it with ON's unflavored creatine and unflavored BCAA and, while the BCAA is strong enough to slightly alter the taste, it still tastes good.<br/><br/>The Double Rich Chocolate is a decent second, but doesn't come near the flavor of the Rocky Road. It does a decent job of masking the creatine and BCAA but lets more of the bitter BCAA flavor come through. My son and I both prefer the Rocky Road to the Double Rich Chocolate.<br/><br/>The Cake Batter is odd. It's not quite cake batter flavored, but I couldn't tell you what flavor it actually is. Adding creatine to it (which only mildly affects the flavor of coffee) does something awful to the flavor. I haven't tried it with the BCAA. I won't be ordering this flavor again. My son finds it unpalatable.
 Taste so good makes me want to slap my moma ! P.s Mom I hope your not reading this
 Tastes really bad...an artificial chemical taste.
 I take this for post workout/breakfast. Easy to make, filling, and taste great. I'm on my 4th container and plan on continuing to order more.
 I've bought the 5 lb chocolate coconut tub now for the third time.  It is truly one if not the best tasting protein powders on the market and mixes so easily, I sometimes forgo my shaker cup and just use a fork.  A Great Buy!
 So far I have enjoyed this Whey product. I haven't been as religious with my intakes, but the taste is on par when used with coconut milk or almond milk.
 Bought some of this to see if it mixes better than previous brands. I'm happy to say it mixes very well in milk, a few stirs with a spoon mixes almost all of it completely. Vanilla Ice Cream flavor is very good, even my two year old grand daughter loves it. Safe bet.
 It does work, I've begun to see results. However, it mixes poorly, doesn't taste too good either. I will not be reordering this stuff. I guess that's the gamble you take when buying online. No returns.
 like it
 Best protein around
 My go to whey supplement for years. Great taste, great product, great gains.
 I really like this as a regular source of protein for my shake in the morning. I am following Tim Ferris' ideas, this being 30g of protein within 30 minutes of awakening, and this is my go-to protein.
 Delicious! Whey better than buying the stuff from Wal-mart.
 Cake Batter flavor is not my favorite but not bad.
 good
 This product is very nice to lose weight and earn muscles
 Great mix of ingredients and good flavor.<br/>Chocolatey rich flavor with an undertone of protein powder taste.<br/>Definitely beats Banana as a flavor.
 Great taste.  I mix it with skim milk
 The enjoyment of this product depends 100% on which flavor you pick. Having tried nearly 5lbs of every one of these, I will send out a stern warning on flavors you should never buy:<br/><br/>Extreme Milk Chocolate - tastes like you scraped the oxidized layer off 5 year old chocolate and mixed a tablespoon of salt in. Just horrible.<br/>Banana Cream - god awful. nauseating to say the least<br/>Tropical Punch - the holy grail of do not buy. One of the worst whey flavors of any brand of all time, and a true disgrace to whey protein everywhere. Finishing 5lbs of this was akin to running a marathon using shoes filled with broken glass.<br/><br/>The rest are bearable or pretty good. The original chocolate one is the best by far.
 Not usually a fan of these things but this flavor is really good! Makes really nice shakes!
 Didn't give a five because of the bland/weak flavor and it doesn't dissolve that easy.  It is a good amount for a reasonable price.  I would probably buy it again.  It does come with a scoop.
 Been using this for about 6 months now. Is the best tasting protein powder for post workout that I have ever used.
 Great flavour for a great price. Great amount of protein+bcaas+glutamine and very little carbs. Simply awesome!
 Ive tried other protein powders and flavors but always go back to ON 100% Whey Gold Standard Double Rich Chocolate.  It just tastes better than the rest that I've tried and dissolves easily with your drink.  They also have a great reputation so you know that there isnt any junk thrown into the product even though a lot of body building nutrition isnt regulated by the FDA.
 this is my favorite flavor. it does not taste like garbage like the other flavors and is a nice compliment to other juices and dairy items that you can shake it with
 Great protein! My go to everyday!
 Best protein on the market for my money.
 best whey protein out when i bought it. good taste and value.
 This is the best tasting protein I've tried. Its exactly what it says.
 I've been using this for a long time. Best Whey Protein on market!
 Will be buying more soon!
 good as all on products
 great flavor!
 i didn't want a big calorie protein powder and ON GS whey fits the bill. only one scoop has 24g protein which many other brands cannot match. Tastes great too!
 Great protein!
 I broke out really bad. Avoid if you have acne-prone skin.
 This thing is intense. I mean talk about getting some serious protein. I do two and a half scoops and I feel like iron man. But seriously this tastes and works great.
 Great protein powder. There's a reason why its so popular. It mixes very easily with just water and a little shaking (I just use ice in a mason jar).<br/><br/>I got the extreme milk chocolate, which is definitely one of my favorite flavors of protein powder. Mixing it with milk makes it taste even better, but if you don't want the extra calories, it tastes just fine in water too. I'd recommend keeping on the low side for the recommended amount of water so that it stays thicker. Its also great for a quick meal/snack if you toss it in a blender with ice, a banana and some peanut butter.<br/><br/>I'd definitely recommend this and would buy it again. Amazon had the cheapest price I could find and it came in two days, which is great.
 The Quality of ON Whey is second to none. However the Cookies is Cream Flavor is terrible. It used to be good but somewhere along the line they changed the formula and now it's extremely sweet and odd tasting.
 The best in taste and performance ever
 Added to our smoothies every day.
 I LOVE THIS WHEY! I workout 7 days a week, and it is glorious for what I need it to do. Everything about it is perfect for me and my workouts. It tastes delicious, it doesn't upset my stomach, it dissolves easily, since it is a combination of whey isolate and whey concentrate it has natural occurring BCAAs. I usually take two scoops in a large shaker after a hard weight workout with some added glutamine. When I do my long runs or bike rides I take one large shaker, I fill it up with half chocolate coconut water for the electrolytes, half water, one scoop of Gold Standard, some extra glutamine... and I have the perfect recovery drink. My wife does the same thing after her workouts. We are both triathletes and this just simply works for us especially on strength training days for muscle recovery.
 In bodybuilding you need to keep nutrition in your system constantly. I put three tablespoons into a mini 20oz Blender Bottle and fill with non-fat milk to go with breakfast, lunch, dinner, and sometimes when I just feel hungry. The stuff actually taste great, too!
 Delicious and easy to mix
 This product has been great. Good taste, easy to mix and very good value
 This is the most efficient whey protein I have tried. All 5 pound jugs are not created equal. This jug has way more protein than any other 5 pound jug i have found.
 Best protein at the best price!  The first bag lasted me 7 months and I used it every day, often taking more than the recommended amount.  You can't beat the price.
 good
 Tastes terrible with mayonnaise.
 I've been using for a few weeks now and really love this product.
 First time trying the flavor and I am glad that I liked the taste. Would have loved to be able to buy in a smaller size instead of such a large quantity but the flavor is good and not overly sweet tasting like some of the others.
 It tastes pretty good, but still tastes like protein powder. No masking that.
 This is the best protein on the market... you just have to read the nutritional fact to know it... this is the first time though I buy it from amazon, and I dont know if its me or the protein the send me tastes different.. Ive been taking this protein long time... hope to be wrong, thats the only reason I give it a star less.
 Very good product!
 Best value, best taste, and great results. Only whey protein that I buy and take after my workout. Never been sore after a workout while using gold standard and have to give it up to double rich chocolate, it tastes great.
 amazing results
 Disgusting taste, BSN tastes way better
 Excellent protein source.<br/>Taste is good and price is ok.<br/>I'm satisfied with the product.
 Such a great big container...great service
 Good protein. Good value.
 Very good product I have the coffee flavor tastes good and mixes well. No weird after taste clean drink. I mix it with water. Would recommend.
 Not too impressed with the flavor. Double rich chocolate isn't so rich and is extra clumpy. The regular chocolate flavor is better and doesn't take as long to shake and break down.
 Tastes delicious.
 First time trying and definitely recommend it.
 PERFECT, as always!
 Hands down, the Optimum Nutrition Coffee flavor is the best tasting protein I have ever had. I don't want to ramble about the positive points of ON Whey protein - if your drinking it, I'm sure you've done the research or read the thousands of other reviews.<br/><br/>But, this was the first time I've ordered this flavor. I mixed about two scoops with Vanilla flavored almond milk. Have you ever had one of those Mocha Starbucks frappuccino drinks in the glass bottles? It tastes almost EXACTLY like it! It is so delicious!<br/><br/>HIGHLY recommended and I will definitely be reordering. Plus, Amazon 2-day shipping and price was better than almost every other site.
 Good Product at decent price
 New review. I was using the Double Dark Chocolate for a while and it's been OK. I recently bought the Mocha Cappuccino flavor and it's been a bad experience every time. At first I thought it was the milk, so I tried it with water. It's definitely the powder. Maybe it's because they use Aminocore now, which improves protein absorption (there's a peer-reviewed clinical study on it. Google it). I don't know, but every time I drink this stuff I feel nauseated, I get cramps and bloating. I'm done with Optimum Nutrition. Time to give up on whey protein all together or find another brand that won't make me sick.
 This stuff is awesome!  My favorite is vanilla, I can mix it with different flavors or sorbet ice-cream and it tasting amazing every time.
 great tasting
 Mixes easily with no clumping.  No overly sweet and no nasty aftertaste.  The banana cream tastes great.
 Taste great doesn thave a after taste that stays after having a shake
 Love this product.  LOW LOW sugar...DO NOT be fooled by other brands.  Look at the sugar content.  This is a great tasting and seriously effective protein.
 Great Product.
 This flavor gave me a lot of stomach pain.
 My favorite whey protein of all. I suggest it to all my friends and family and they say the same. I love Optimum products.
 Tastes great, gives proteins, helps to grow muscles.<br/>would recommend to everyone that is not sure which one of the large variety of optimums nutrition to get.
 Excellent taste (Vanilla) and mixes with my lo-cal almond/coconut milk very well.
 Mixes extremely well in water without the need to use a blender.
 I have used Optimum Nutrition Protein for over 10 years.  I consumed a lot of it because it used to be one of the less expensive protein powders and didn't have a taste that made me gag.  I've continued using it as the price increased because it was still one of the better quality and better tasting proteins on the market.  At this point though, I'm jumping ship.  The price per gram of protein is more expensive than chicken.  Chicken tastes better, lasts longer in your gut, and is healthier for you, so the only benefit protein powder has over it is convenience.<br/><br/>Still giving it 5 stars because it is a great product, but just wanted to make people aware that now it is more expensive than real meat.
 this whey protein is the best of the best no carbs no fat and the highest amt of protein per scoop gram of protein per dollar you pay is awesome cant beat it and it mixes so easy in water
 I bought the mocha cappuccino flavor based on the reviews I read.  I mix it with almond milk and it tastes fan-fricken tastic.....<br/>Not a fan of the double choc
 Very good
 My husband is obsessed with this protein powder, thank you!
 Best carb/protein ratio and much cheaper here than at GNC.
 Best tasting whey brotein out there. Aftertaste is bearable. Chocolate is the only flavor I can seem to drink everyday without wanting to kill myself. Bit more expensive then some protein powders you can get at Costco but better taste.
 Mixes well with water. Tastes like chocolate milk. Not sure what else to say about it. I had previously used American Pure Whey and GNC's brand; I definitely prefer Optimum Nutrition.
 I have used this protein powder for several years and I love all of the flavors.  It makes great protein shakes. I also put some in my pancake batter when I make protein pancakes and I add it to my children's batter as well to give them an extra protein boost.
 The flavor is good. It can last 2 months. It depends on how much you drink, I take two tablespoons per day.
 Delicious taste, easy to blend, and doesn't leave chunks at the bottom of the cup. This is considered one of the best flavor Gold Standard makes. Price is also very competitive with similar protein powders.
 Now I'm a big ole' beefcake, this stuff is great.
 The mocha cappuccino flavor tastes pretty good.  Definitely better than any other protein powder I have tried.
 Product as described.
 Great product...arrived exactly as expected!
 For whey protein you can't beat ON. Highly recommended!
 great protein, it can make you big and strong. maybe someday you'll look like Arnold Schwarzenegger if u keep taking this product.
 Best flavor ever!
 great product!
 Terrific taste and best of all it blends perfectly without a blender! Arrived in time and will order me another when this bad boy runs out.
 ON products are a great value.  This stuff is hard to beat, and it has glutimine already in it; Bonus!  shop around you will be hard pressed to find better bang for the buck on protein.  Tastes good too.
 Taste great .gains gains
 I bought chocolate powders for years, but the French Vanilla Creme has made me a convert... best flavor I've ever tried.<br/><br/>Protip: Add seltzer for a foamy egg cream.
 Showed up in perfect condition AND it tastes great! I usually can't stand the taste of any protein powder but the flavor I got (Vanilla Ice Cream) is definitely a keeper. High quality and worth the purchase.
 Tastes horrible, like chewing saw dust in your mouth. Dumped it after a couple of weeks.
 I got the rocky road flavor. if you want to get the full effect of the flavor use milk. but i dont mind either way.
 The flavor is slightly chalky and bland but not bad. I used syntha before this and with milk it becomes nice and thick, this however with milk still stays thin and more like chocolate water than chocolate milk!
 ON never disappoints...only Whey Protein we use!!
 Best protein out there!
 This stuff is like candy it tastes so good - definitely worth the extra premium for delicious protein. Always buy this over the cheap stuff for that good chocolate taste.
 Good flavor (Ice cream vanilla), decent price, clean enough and a pretty good amount of protein in each scoop. Can never go wrong with  choosing this!
 Cant go wrong with ON- anyone in the athletics industry knows that
 Still good stuff! The best bang for your buck and works just as well as some of the pricier stuff with "proprietary blends".
 The plastic seal looked so loose that I'm suspicious it had already been open,and didn't have the hollogram seal either,never buying again
 pretty tasty and easily dissolvable
 Great product, would rate 5 stars if not for sucralose (artificial sweetener) I like to avoid all artificial sweeteners, so I will buy the natural one next time. <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Optimum-Nutrition-100-Whey-Gold-Standard-Natural-Whey-Natural-Chocolate-5-Pound/dp/B000GIQT06/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard Natural Whey, Natural Chocolate, 5 Pound</a>
 I've tried many of the protein whey flavors and usually prefer strawberry. It has a good and non-chalky taste, much like nestle quick strawberry, that isn't too sweet.
 Top notch protein. Best protein to calorie ratio I've seen. Although it's not stated explicitly by ON this protein gave me ZERO lactose related problems. Mixes very easily. Cleans up easily. I've only tried strawberry so far. It tastes very good. Less sweet than some other products which I like.
 I got the double rich Chocolate flavor and its tastes pretty good with milk, but taste okay with water. It's not totally disgusting with water but not as good with milk. It's protein what else do you want???
 Best tasting whey protein I've ever had. Hands down the only brand I will buy for my protein sources now.
 Tastes great with almond milk or even with water! The Extreme Milk Chocolate is definitely the best flavor.
 Chocolate flavored Whey protein. It's exactly what it says it is and it works great.
 I like rocky road. I can drink it for days. searched everywhere and this is pretty much a decent value to protein ratio. if you're serious about working out. buy the 10 pound and save a few bucks. you're gonna need it if you work out.
 Tastes SOOO much better than Six Star whey. Drink with milk and you got a sonic milkshake!  ;P
 Great protein for a great price what else can I say?
 Awesome healthy Powder
 Comes in a great flavor selection, the container comes in very handy. I can reuse the container to stored the bag protein shake, i've purchased.I purchased this item for my husband, he seems to enjoyed it. It's a great for weight gain and muscle bodybuild.It has an easy measuring scoop. It's also an excellent source of protein compare to eating raw eggs, or protein bars.
 Rocky Road! By far the BEST protein shake I have ever had! great taste, and no after taste!
 Good quality protein that mixes well and tastes great.  I've been taking ON gold standard for couple years and decided to try to buy in bulk to save couple bucks.  It comes in a durable resealable bag.
 Loyal customer to ON whey gold standard since more than 10yrs! If you experience bloating or flatulence , drink it in little sips throughout the day.
 Want a good protein?  This one is it.  It actually taste like a milkshake.
 I prefe rISO100 by Dymatize, But you can't go wrong with this
 Excellent... Don't buy from stores anymore.
 My go-to protein powder. Can get 6+ lbs for $45 at Costco when on sale. Watch your Costco sales flyer.
 One of the best proteins on the market !!!
 I love this stuff! Extreme Chocolate Milk is the best flavor, in my opinion. The Amazon price is comparable to Bodybuilding.com, but the Prime shipping makes Amazon cheaper.
 It tastes bad! I've tried almost 6 different flavors of optimum nutrition and this ones the worst of them. Otherwise no complaints. It's a gold standard when it comes to muscle building. I think I'm gonna stick to my favorite.. White chocolate!!
 I think this protein has to be one of the best that my son and I have tried in a long time. The flavor is unbelievably smooth and rich. I like to mix banana's and strawberries in mine and it's delicious and filling.<br/><br/>It's really a great product and great on price too!
 This is the king of whey proteins.  Currently have 15lbs on standby on a shelf.  Go through it like it is candy.  Easy mix and simple taste.
 good flavor..mixes well
 noticeable lean muscle growth in the first month of use. lean great tasting post workout (double rich chocolate). relatively low in calories, great taste, great results,  and great price. 5*
 A great, trusted protein source! Bad thing is it makes me have bad farts! But nonetheless, it arrived on time and surpresses my appetite thus not eating as much!
 Great Protein. Tastes great with milk and still good with water! Have definitely benefited from this product.
 This is whey too good of a product to pass up.
 Great value.  Quality whey protein.  I have reordered 5 times now and will continue to do so.  Thanks!
 I am a regular ON-Whey customer. I've always made it a point to drink Whey Protein 3 times a day to cover my protein requirements for my lean weight, which is 1 gram of protein per pound of my body weight.<br/><br/>The only con I would give is that, for a Double Rich Chocolate flavor, it's not that chocolaty yet. I hope that they could keep on improving the flavor (without adding sugar or fat of course).<br/><br/>MUSCLE MAINTENANCE:<br/>- I always make sure I drink whey on breakfast to replenish lost muscle cells after that long sleep.<br/>- I always drink whey protein before sleeping, to fight midnight hunger, and to keep my muscles fed on the first 4 hours of sleeping
 Very good taste, and dissolves faster than the 10 different protein brands I have used in my lifetime. So far very satisfied!
 I always end up going back to ON whey protein it just never seems to fail me flavor and nutrition wise.
 This is the only brand of protein we use in our house.  Smooth, mixes easily, and it tastes great.  Never clumps, never chalky, and most importantly... Never gives you the bubble guts.
 This product was recommended by a friend of my sons to improve muscles and they have just starting to have it. Also arrived on time and well packed!
 It has a lot less cholesterol than other brands and the protein value (24g per scoop) is great. On top of it all, it is a flavor I actually want to drink. Yum!
 Taste like hot coco!
 Its hard to find a protein Flavor that will taste good with water, generally they all taste decent with milk, but with water they usually are difficult to drink day after day. Mixes really well with water, with milk it takes a few shakes to get it to mix well.<br/><br/>Overall one of the best Protein Shakes out there, and one of the better tasting ones.
 The best protein PERIOD. ON is the best. I've tried the rest and know the game.
 This stuff is so good. Something to look forward to after a good workout. USE MILK! It gets frothy and cold with little bits of chocolate floating in it... wow, I want one right now.
 I am a vegetarian and hence protein is hard to come by... I gotta eat huge quantities of chickpeas and the like in order to get the amount of protein that a small piece of chicken would give. Not only has Optimum Whey given me the much needed protein in just one scoop, combined with my weight training i have gained a healthy 12 pounds in a year and am looking in a much better shape now... Even though I dont weight train much anymore, as i attend some kick boxing classes regularly, I still maintain my daily intake of 2-3 scoops of this protein to keep me going... It is a good buy!
 This is my second 5lb tub of Chocolate Mint.  The flavor of mint hides the artificial sweeter well and makes it easy to drink day after day.
 Very nice deal.
 Great taste with milk or water
 Good taste and texture with milk but I would probably prefer the vanilla.  Not so much on this mix that I use before or just after exercise but with the Casein I also bought for meal replacement and nighttime.  I prefer to add frozen fruit, berries, berry mixes, banana etc and not too appetizing with chocolate:) Made the mistake and ordered both in Chocolate.
 Vanilla ice cream taste 10/10 amazing product 💪🏻
 Good stuff! Good Price!
 Not writing an in-depth product analysis, just posting to say I love this protein.  It is decent in water, but I enjoy it the most in some light vanilla soy milk.  Delicious in regular milk as well.  Can't go wrong here.  I do recommend a shaker for mixing, though! Pretty impossible to fully dissolve with a spoon, same with any other brand of protein powder, however, so definitely not a con.
 mixes and taste great
 BEST protein there is to buy, I bodybuild and I live by this stuff. Don't cheap out and buy that walmart stuff full of taurine it'll only make you sweat and you won't absorb the amount that is in the servings. Optimum Nutrition is  a great brand and makes clean efficient protein.
 Love this protein powder! I wouldn't use any other kind. My husband and I have gone through over 15 canisters and are completely satisfied
 great product
 Good Value &amp; a good product.. best flavor I've tried by far is the vanilla. I will definitely continue to purchase this product &amp; recommend it as good quality &amp; value.
 This is the best tasting protein drink mix in my opinion.
 good price and love that you can choose from a whole variety of flavors. Different prices of course but all the choices are at your fingertips on amazon so you save a trip on gas.
 Good value which is why i'll probably keep buying it.  Taste is just ok.  Mixes ok, but need a blender or a blender ball not just a spoon (I use milk not water).
 This powder mixes easily, tastes great, and loads your diet with protein with the protein you might not be able to cook at a given time. Some people also benefit from taking their protein in a liquid form, due to bloat, and some swear the bioavailability quickness of a liquid protein can't be denied. Don't misunderstand me, my opinion is different than that last statement, but it's still a true statement that some people "live by." ON Gold Standard Strawberry is my favorite flavor thus far and it mixes extremely well with a milk and water mix. I can see why people love this product, myself included. It simply fills your protein needs, and avoids powdered protein faults, such as mixability. I'm very interested in trying some other ON Gold Standard flavors, and maybe trying some Casein Protein for a nighttime protein meal. Anyone want to address their personal effectiveness with their personal diet, because I'm all ears. This product lost one star from me due to it's high cost. I understand that quality products cost money, but body-builders and health aficionados could use some savings on essential products, such as whey protein. How about it ON? I challenge you to lower your costs every once in a while on Amazon, so some of us loyal customers could save a little cash for other ON products such as BCAAs.
 I'd have to say over the years I've tried a ton of different proteins just to SEE if they compare to Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard ... and they don't. Boom!
 great product, have bought more than once and will continue to purchase.
 One of the best protein.
 Got a great deal on the ON 100% Whey powder. Mixes easy using a blender bottle and doesnt taste terrible. Does leave a slight after taste like many other Whey products<br/><br/>However, wish I'd just paid a little extra and got the Natural Health Formula Dutch Chocolate which has a much better flavor.
 3rd time I've ordered this.<br/><br/>I'm hooked, it's delicious and seems to work.
 Great stuff. Mix with unsweetened almond milk and you're ready
 Smells good, tastes.. meh..OK.  Still like using Gold Standard.
 Best flavor
 wonderful
 This is one of the better proteins that I have tried.  It tastes great and mixes really well.  Chocolate mint wasn't the best ON flavor, but it was pretty good.  Not too minty.
 I mix this with some 2% milk in a Blender Bottle (another recommended buy) and shake it and it tastes like a delicious Ovaltine reward after the gym.
 Delicious, nothing but the best out there.
 Coffee flavored is my favorite
 perfect
 The cookie chunks tend to get stuck in the back of my throat. Taste is a little less than alright. A little sweet. Occasionally nauseating.<br/>With that said, the nutrition content is worth it. If I could go back in time I'd probably buy a different flavor or go flavorless.
 Tastes horrible. Tried covering the taste but eventually gave up and gave it away. Went back to Dymatize.
 All kinds of gains!.....all kinds
 I really like this brand.  Have tried both the vanilla and milk chocolate and they taste great.
 This product helps shorten my recovery time from trying to do strength training by a couple of days. Keeping my muscles out of a catatonic state post workout is keeping me on my resolutions. One note is that if this product ships on its side, the scoop will likely settle somewhere in the middle. If you don't want to dig it out, you can use a 1/4 cup measuring cup.
 ok.
 It has a good flavor but sometimes it is lumpy.
 This Protein supplement is great and I notice the recovery after workouts much sooner than with some other products I have used in the past.  I will continue to purchase and use this product moving forward.
 great taste, its not too heavy on your stomach. this is my second time purchasing it.
 Love this stuff, deff worth the money
 Arrived on time, and also such a good product. 5/5
 Great flavor, my favorite so far
 love this product.. definitely seeing more gains
 I got it on time. It tastes really good, and easy to blend/mix. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a solid protien shake.
 taste good and helps recover after workout
 Best protein I've ever tried. Love this stuff
 Been using this protein for a few years. I went with Vanilla Ice Cream this last time around. I love it! I'm going to stick with this flavor for a while.
 Best taste out there. I put it in my coffee for a protein mocha.
 Awesome product. I order it once and i continued ordering it the same. I ordered 3times in a row.
 Works great and test is the best I drink french vanilla !
 I love the vanilla flavor came in with seal close and can't wait to try it.
 I tried the banana cream one and I did not like it. It tasted so terrible and wouldn't mix properly. I am going back to using Muscle Milk
 Very good quality
 I bought 3 flavors so far of Gold Standard Whey Protein: vanilla ice cream, extreme milk chocolate, and delicious strawberry. In the past, I never liked any chocolate-flavored protein drinks. I read other recommendations and decided to purchase it. This company proved me wrong. The Extreme Milk Chocolate is so delicious that you can mix it with water and you will love the taste. I also like the vanilla ice cream flavor. However, I was vey disappointed with the delicious strawberry flavor, because it is nothing delicious about it. I honestly can't stand the taste. It just taste very "chemical." I have to try other flavors,  but my stable flavor might just be  Extreme Milk Chocolate.
 I can't speak for all the scientific facts on the label, but I can say that this protein is far better than any other I've tried in terms of mix-ability and taste. The Mocha Cappuccino flavor is downright delicious, mix it with some warm water and it tastes just like hot chocolate. Plus, if you read the fine print, they flavor it with REAL COFFEE, so there's 15mg of caffeine in every scoop. Maybe it's all in my head, but I'd say it gives me a little boost when I take it before my workout. Yes, it costs a little more than what you'd buy at Kroger or Walmart, but it is far superior.
 Got this product numerous times before, but I stopped for about a year. Definitely noticed faster muscle growth and recovery once I started using this again.( with a good diet though)
 Excellent - our whole family uses this.
 Actually tastes pretty good for a protein drink!
 Good taste, not clumpy
 Wish it were cheaper but with Prime free shipping it is a little less than where I use to get it from.  This batch didn't seem quite as coffee ish as the last.  This is for a grandmother who loves McDonald Frappees but needs the extra protein.
 I use this all the time, works good for me.
 Ok been drinking this stuff for years now. Here's my rankings for flavor<br/>Strawberry banana is creamy and awesome in water milk and especially mixed in Greek vanilla yogurt. Gotta try it in Greek yogurt.<br/><br/>Mocha is pretty good. Adds variety to flavors but wouldn't recommend as first flavor.<br/><br/>Vanilla ice cream is ok in water and good in milk. Give it average<br/><br/>Rocky road is the best of the chocolate flavors . Has thin taste in water little bit creamy in milk and good in yogurt.<br/><br/>French vanilla creme is my favorite of the vanillas. Good overall<br/><br/>Cookies and creme was ok overall. There's no real bad flavor but I'd pass on vanilla Icecream and cookies and creme for now
 very good
 I used to buy this all the time. It's the standard, as they claim. I buy organic protein powder now. But it's not as tasty as the Optimum Nutrition powder.
 The only protein powder i keep coming back too.
 French vanilla flavor: Taste really good.
 Amazing rich taste. I put into my smoothies as well as just some plain almond milk in my shaker cup.
 this is my 4th one. i will only continue to buy more optimum nutrition whey proteins.
 I don't know much but it's tasty, dissolves quickly, and has helped me make great lifting gains in just 4 months time.
 delicious rocky road!
 With milk it tastes like chocolate milk, with peanut butter and milk it's absolutely amazing.
 My ladyfriend loved this stuff. She uses it everyday!
 I bought this at the recommendation of a friend of mine who is a sponsored power lifter. Apparently, Optimum Nutrition is one of the only brands of protein that not only puts absolutely no filler in their protein powder, but they are get every individual ingredient certified on a yearly basis. Not only that, but they have 24+ flavors to choose from which is awesome. My dad had to have surgery and lost about 30 pounds and is incredibly weak in his recovery. I asked my buddy about a natural protein that has no crap in ti and no creatine since my dad can't have creatine. He recommended this so I asked my dad if he would take it. My dad is the world's most picky person you could ever meet. But when he saw the list of flavors, he couldn't try to tell me there wasn't one he would like. He ended up choosing the Chocolate Mint, which I thought was a risky flavor for a picky guy, but then he told me he planned on mixing it with milk and some ice cream to basically make a mint chocolate chip milk shake. Sounds like a great idea. I will try to update my review in a month or so and let you know how the results have been for him.
 Good, just what I wanted
 Love the flavor.
 Perfect. And tasty too (insert Lucille Ball reference)
 Superior quality to anything else on the market. Best tasting chocolate and mixes perfectly in milk or water.
 As usual excellent flavor and excellent mixability. A very long time customer for ON
 Tastes delicious. I've only mixed it with milk though I imagine it tastes good mixed with water as well. It lasts a long time and I take two cups since I'm slim.
 Great protein and great taste!!
 I drank this and sat on my ass for weeks and just got fat. Then I figured out if I pick things up and put them down I get gains. Tastes great.
 The flavor is perfectly reasonable. It dissolves okay-but-not-amazingly. It's a bunch of protein. Hard to complain, right?
 This is hands down our favorite protein powder ever! It taste amazing and mixes perfect every time. Love it, and will continue buying it as long as they make it!
 Great tasting product.
 LOVE IT!
 Excellent product. A+
 Only protein powder I buy. Doesn't have much of the  year extra fluff. Good quality, reasonable price.
 Whey Isolate that tastes great.  It mixes well if you use a blender bottle or a slightly thick liquid like milk or juice.  I've used this brand and flavor for years.
 I have bought this product for many years.....works great and tastes great.
 I enjoy the taste of it!
 Exactly what I needed. Exactly what was advertised.
 Best whey flavor - coffee
 Best protein on the market. Period. Taste is good but not overpowering.
 Since I began to use this stuff, my arms are about 3 cm's larger.
 Very good price for a very good protein, I use it sometimes in the morning if i am rushing for work, and also right after workouts. mixes well and tastes really good.
 Great tasting protein powder. Have been ordering this brand for a few years. Mixes well.
 followed instructions but it tastes like water so i mix it with my workout supplements for flavor.
 I love the taste of this and the way it dissolves is better than other protein powders I have tried. I use a Blendtech with this so that is overkill for blending but it mixes well with water in a standard shaker cup with the wired strainer.
 I loooove it. It tastes great and you won't get tired of it even if you drink it every single day. I'm not a big fan of chocolate but this one is easy to drink. The only downside is it doesn't dissolve well unless you use a mixer.
 Best buy for price
 Not much else to say. Scoop before and after working, taste good but I tend to mix my shakes with yogurt, fruits, and almond milk ... in most cases I guess any WP would taste good'ish after that ; D
 The rating is for the flavor. It's sort of watered down. Go for the french vanilla, not the vanilla ice cream. The product itself gets five stars. Easy to digest.
 great
 It works great for me on a cut or bulk.
 I am a fan of Optimum's Gold Standar Whey. I find it is not very heavy on my stomach and it does not cause any stomach pain. I have had protein powders in the past that will make you run for the facilities, not this. If you are new to ordering this product, try the Rocky Road.Hear me now and believe me later, it's great.<br/>Mixability: I would go 9/10 here. No clumping and very easy to mix. (full disclosure, I use a blender bottle <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/BlenderBottle-Classic-Loop-Top-Shaker-Bottle-Clear-Black-28-Ounce/dp/B00MVMCUK8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">BlenderBottle Classic Loop Top Shaker Bottle, Clear Black, 28 Ounce</a><br/>Taste: 8/10 Really good. They have managed to make something rich and creamy without using milk.<br/>Contents: 7/10 I am pretty happy with what is. If I had any critiques, I could use a little more protein per serving and I would like more aminos.<br/><br/>Overall, I would recommend and I will continue to buy for my personal use.
 The flavor is good, and the consistency is good.
 WOW is all I can say. It is unbelievably DELICIOUS! Same taste as Starbucks Cappuccino but better! Never had a protein shake that tasted better than this by far. Props to ON for making this flavor.
 Tastes Good
 All my protein needs in delicious rocky road favor. YUM
 ive been using this stuff for a long time. its great. it blends well, even by hand. and isnt too thick and heavy. it doesnt seem to slow me down and fill me up as much as others
 Best protein powder out there, especially if you are lactose intolerant.
 Tastes good
 Mixes well, tastes great, seems to be good quality! My only complaint is storing it, I wish they would offer a 5 pound bag rather than a big plastic tub.
 The same product you buy anywhere else.  Just needed it sooner.  Competitive price.
 Delicious as always.  This is my go-to protein supplement.  This was my first time ordered it with Amazon and I definitely will again.  Got it for cheaper and didn't even have to leave the house.
 Mixes well with fewer scoops per gram of protein.
 Best protein out there and no mater if you mix it with water or milk it taste pretty good.  I generally get chocolate but strawberry was a welcome change.
 best product
 I've been using this powder as a weekly regimen post-workout and post-cardio. It tastes great, and I believe it really does help build muscle after a great workout.
 Muscle Milk aint got nothin on this whey, yo!
 a great bargain for the price.
 Perfect size and same item I buy at GNC, but it fit perfectly in my suitcase for vacation!
 Good bang for your buck. Delicious protein too. I mixed with both water and milk- both results were tasty! Ive used this as a meal replacement and it works well
 ON, can't go wrong with it.  Buy this for your postwork out protein needs.
 The product itself is great but this flavor tastes like someone put some angle food cake mix in a box and sold it as a "rocky road" I would recommend chocolate or double chocolate instead.
 This is my go-to whey protein because it tastes the best! I also prefer the jumbo bags instead of the large, bulky canisters.
 Great quality at a good price. Doesn't get me nauseous like some other proteins and mixes very well. I frequently just stir it instead of shaking it up. Bought the Extreme Milk Chocolate flavor and it tastes great. Add some hot water and it literally tastes like hot chocolate.
 If you are looking for a whey product that is not hard to choke down this it.  It taste okay.  I don't particularly care for the taste but I don't hate it either.
 I can see noticeable and acceptable results in addition to its amazing taste.
 Best tasting protein for the price. I like the flavor and it doesnt clump up like the other brands. Highly recommend!
 Powder was not open, but container was crushed. Next order was perfect. We did not return the first order and did reorder the same product the second time which arrived perfect.
 taste great, just like a banana milkshake
 Taste is good. Blends well. Not too sweet but sweet enough. Perfect for my liking. am going buy more today or tomorrow....
 It's not delicious by any means but it is palatable. It tastes like a bad chocolate milk. Not gross but not great either.
 Used this stuff for years, best whey for price.
 Mixes extremely well and also digests well. With other products this are the main two issues but I'm really happy with how this one has solved these issues.
 Seems fine.  Mixes up thinner than most and the Chocolate taste is not as good as some others.
 Love the taste I love almost all ON products but this by far exceeded my expectations. mixes fantastic with almond milk even when not using a blender. taste great. i would def recommend.
 Great protien!!!! Optimum Nutrition has great products and Amazon has the best price.
 Works great to make protein shakes
 Love it
 I can't say much about Whey I mean the name says it all it's definitely the gold standard when it comes to getting your protien and building muscle. Always a great buy for that novice bodybuilder just like me!
 noticed an inch gain on my arms and 2 inches on my chest in a month! A great investment for ones health for as we get older we need more protein in our diets.
 great
 I have been lifting for 12+ years and have used supplements for about half that time so i know hoe hard it is to find a good price on whey. This fit the bill and provides plenty of protein and essential vitamins/nutrients. I tried but couldnt find a better product or better pricr per serving!
 I went through this container in about 3 weeks and thoroughly enjoyed it. The whey mixed well in water and smoothies and tasted great. It was perfect for a between meal snack or post workout supplement.
 Best 100% Whey you can get but the double chocolate is better tasting than this flavor or coconut/chocolate flavor.
 Damn good taste for a damn good price with great results
 Very nice for building up muscle and incredibly disgusting gas.
 Exactly as described, we got the coffee flavor and it tastes amazing!
 very good.
 Love it ...taste very good
 The taste is ok.  I feel like it is a little clumpier than most other powders
 One of the best selling for a reason. Not the best tasting but good quality as well as ON's other products.
 My favorite flavor and mixes very well. Other brands ive tried tend to "clump" and have bad aftertaste. This stuff is great.
 This is my favorite flavor so far. Mixed with cold water it is just refreshing after a long workout. Protein is protein.
 taste good
 Double chocolate tastes good.
 Best tasting whey and highest quality for the price. Keep an eye on the price as it goes on sale, last time I bought 2 bags for 160. Mixes well and tastes great.
 There is no comment, it is dietary supplements for daily dose.<br/><br/>It has high quality and a good manufactured.<br/><br/>I recommend it body builder and sports.
 For the price and the quality this is a very decent protein supplement. I used it for a while and it worked pretty well.
 Good quality, good service, good taste. Thanks
 Unlike any others it tastes great! which makes it easy to drink.
 Literally can't go wrong with ON Gold Standard whey. Tried and true
 Simply put<br/>Great price.<br/>Great price.<br/>Great results.<br/>The taste is good and it doesn't leave an odor in containers like the other proteins do. Also cleaning the container is easier because there is no residue sticking to the bottom.
 5 star
 I've noticed increased weight lifting performance with this product.
 Best protein I have taken
 Nothing beats this protein. I've tried other ones from Cellucor and MTS. And I've gone right back to this one.
 Got this because Legion Whey+ Chocolate was sold out. Compared the labels when it arrived - not worth it.<br/>Returning this and getting Vanilla for the time being.
 The best Whey protein on the market
 Feels like I'm getting juicy!!! Great protein content!
 love it!  like this flavor!
 Great Product, Highly recommend.
 Exactly what I needed and ordered.  Tastes  great too.
 Love this product, best protein on the market!
 Huge container
 As advertised. A slight downgrade in taste from the previous version (a couple years ago). But this newer version mixes much better.
 i love it!
 This protein supplement has become an integral part of my training as a high-level surf ski and flatwater kayak coach and athlete. The quality of the protein seems to be excellent, the price is right, and it's an easy product to mix in a shaker or in a blender.<br/><br/>I usually get the Double Rich Chocolate, which is very palatable straight out of a shaker or in a mixed smoothie, and love it. No fake sweetener aftertaste, not overly sweet, real chocolate flavor, and a nice consistency. Based on other reviews, I just ordered a 5 pound tub of the Rocky Road, which is often declared as the best of the flavors.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I hate it. It's OVERLY sweet with an artificial, bitter aftertaste. The protein quality seems the same, so I'll suffer through it and then go back to the Double Rich Chocolate!
 A gift for my son.  This is his favorite protein powder!
 Great whey protein! Mixes well and tastes great! Drink by itself with water or mix into fruit veggie shame in my nutribullet!
 Great price and arrived quickly!  The double chocolate is a good flavor -- we put it in skim milk, add an ice cube, and mix it in our Magic Bullet.  Great breakfast to grab and go with lots of protein!
 Cheap, works fine, will buy again!
 This product really is the gold standard for whey protein. Good flavoring. I have had multiple gold standard whey products and I think this flavor is my favorite.
 I really like this product, has a great taste!!
 Excellent product.  I just mix a scoop with ice water before going swimming in the morning.
 I've tried many brands of protein and to this day I haven't found a brand of protein that taste and mixes better than ON.  It's a great product!
 Great taste!
 Seems to be a good quality product.
 EZ dissolve, good taste, no hassle.
 I use this in smoothies and sprinkle on cereal.  They have many different flavors but I've only used the chololate, which is really good.
 Love it.
 Our favorite protein powder!
 Mixed with water this tastes pretty good. Looking over the banned substances list this currently does not feature, always a positive.
 Bought for my 20 year old son. He loves it. Taste good, mixes well.
 Always the best. No issues for me
 Before I found out about this optimum whey protein I was using cheap protein from walmart never really saw any progress just a waste of money. I final got this optimun whey protein and in 2 week I began to see my muscles getting bigger. recommend this product It's worth your money.
 Good stuff! Really works well. Started seeing results in about a week. Not bad tasting.
 Its not as overbearing and chalky as the ever popular double rich chocolate. Its not exactly starbucks, but the coffee flavor isn't weirdly chemical or over bearing. Its good in milk and cereal. For something you're gonna taste for a month or more, its definitely a buy.
 this stuff tastes great and I'm pretty picky with protein powders. easy to mix and great value
 Love this product just am not crazy about coffee flavor.  Ingredients are perfect. I will continue to buy this, only I will order chocolate next time
 Great Product definitely recommend it!
 This products does the job and tastes great!  I love it!  If you need more Whey, purchase this.  I feel it's a good brand and the taste isn't chalky.
 Taste great!!!
 I am not expert on protein shakes but I have tried a couple of brands before this one. ON whey is by far my favorite cuz it does not cause bloating and the taste is not "too" sweet like the others. I'm lovin it!
 Get the Natural Optimum Nutrition for a few bucks more and it has no artificial ingredients.  This tastes totally great, but it does contain fake sweeter.
 #1 Protein powder. This is all you're going to need to supplement your diet.
 This is a good powder. It is tasty and it dissolves quite well in a shaker bottle. Stirring it in a glass it clumped up a little, not as bad as most, but I've never encountered a powder that mixes completely by stirring it. I usually put this in a blender with a banana, skim milk and ice cubes, tastes great.
 Whey gold standard all the way!!
 Doesn't get any better than this. For the price and free shipping with prime, this was the best choice for me.
 Don't get me wrong. I love ON's protein but this cookies and cream flavor just doesn't do it for me. I love and will stick to Extreme Chocolate for my future orders.
 Something about the flavoring isn't right.  It tastes like a banana flavored antacid tablet.  If you care about the taste, go with something they've engineered to taste right, like the chocolate.<br/><br/>Otherwise, this is good quality why and I got it at a big discount so I'm not going to complain.
 love it
 I do not think that I will keep using it at-least alone with all research showing better results with blended Whey and Casin, but it is still one of my favorite supplements, Extreme Milk Chocolate is my Favorite pick
 Best price for quality protein.
 I bought this for my son as he has commuted to a rigid workout schedule. Great flavor and very noticeable results.
 One of the best flavors of Gold Standard I've had yet
 I use a scoop in my shake on its own, but most of the time I add a banana some Greek yogurt and flax milk then with a hand blender make a wonderful little mini meal.
 BEST BEST i've ever had!! Incredible, i've tasted so many and hatted them. This (rocky road) flavor is sooo goodddd.
 Great tasting.
 Got it fast and for a great price this is all I use
 Great taste!
 A bit pricey but the flavor is great. I mix some powder with milk and a banana and it's delicious! It makes me want to drink protein shakes even on days I don't work out.
 Absolutely the best protein powder period.  This stuff taste the best and is very clean.
 Taste great with milk. One serving contains good amount of the protein and BCAA.
 White chocolate tastes great, mixes well.
 Great taste, mixes very well, and a good deal.
 nice product
 good
 Good product and price
 Requires 6-8oz of water and one scoop.<br/><br/>Couldn't be easier.<br/><br/>Tastes great and was an awesome Amazon deal! Much cheaper than I saw in Rite Aid.
 delicious and it mixes well with my milk. It isn't too harsh on my stomach.
 nothing special
 husband likes it
 tastes great
 For the price and protein complex it's worth it<br/>Mocha cuppichino and extreme milk chocolate are the best flavors. Still my go to protein after all these years
 Love this flavor. Had been using the double rich chocolate flavor, but the cookies &amp; cream flavor is much better (in my opinion).
 The best on the market.
 it's not as tasty as twin labs, but it's healthier in some degree.. when i mix it with a blender bottle, if i don't shake hard enough i get some white specks on the side of the bottle.. beats me what they are.<br/><br/>i like it though and will prob purchase again.
 This is exactly what I wanted plus fast shipping
 I love the taste
 Good stuff.
 The taste is good, easy to prepare and works very well, gives energy and regenerates the exhaustion of the muscle
 What can I say, Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard whey is one of the best all around protein supplements out there.  There are many other quality brands with great nutrition profiles similar to ON Gold.  Is it the best concentrate? NO.  Is it the "cleanest" whey? No.  Where this line of protein separates itself is the taste and solubility.  Anyone who has tried many different quality brands in addition to ON Gold Standard, knows that the solubility of ON GS cannot be compared to any other brands.  How is this important for someone who takes one or two scoops per day? Nothing.  But if you are an avid lifter or constant lifter, you'll probably take six or more scoops per day.  When you can get about 50 grams of protein(two scoops) and mix it with as little as 5oz of water, it makes a HUGE difference in how bloated you feel after and throughout the day.  Other quality proteins really need 8-10oz.  That is nearly double the amount of liquid.<br/><br/>The taste.  Cake batter. 9/10.  This is a delicious flavor I tried for the first time.  It might be a little too sweet.  It kind of tastes like cookie dough to me.
 Now that I know more about the Whey protein market I would suggest Now Whey Protein Isolate Unflavored Natural. All Natural with no sweeteners and it is full of BCAA's.
 See I really like this flavor, but the only issue I really have is I did not know it was that sweet. I use 1/2 a scoop of vanilla and 1/2 strawberry and I personally think its a perfect combination.
 Great.
 Have been using this as my post workout protein for awhile now, I think it seems to be working and keeps me full for a bit too, I add a little bit more water than recommended and use a shaker bottle with blender ball, and it seems to mix just fine. I have only tried mixing it with water since thats my preference, but I am sure if you chose to mix it with something else or make a shake in a blender with other ingredients that would be pretty good as well. French Vanilla Creme - the powder seems to be a lot more airy or fluffier, not too sure why. The flavor was a bit weak which is surprising since opening the bottle it had a strong French Vanilla scent. I am actually glad it had a weak flavor though since the smell had me a bit nervous of how strong the taste would be. Extreme Milk Chocolate - Flavor is good not too sweet, prob one of my favorites so far, but I am usually pretty basic in my flavors (chocolate, vanilla, strawberry) definitely would recommend this one though!
 best whey protein I have tasted.  Like the chocolate and the cookies and cream.  no after taste.
 Would buy again.
 Almost ready for a refill on this container. Tastes great and seeing results!
 It feels heavier than Up your Mass, but the serving size is pretty good. I haven't tried all the flavors, but I will definitely keep getting this protein powder.
 Best stuff I've taken!
 Great product, only whey I'll ever need. Bought the 10lb because I ran out of my previous 5lb tub. I just wish it would go on sale more often. This has helped me gain about 20 lbs so far.
 Perfect! Will constantly use this product
 great
 The quality of the protein itself is good, but the taste isn't as great as some of the others. Personally I recommend buying vanilla because you can then mask the taste completely by mixing it with whatever you want. Kind of hard to mask cookies and cream.
 Always the best!  Cheaper protein powders makes you bloated - this one doesn't!  It cost a bit more than other protein powders but it's worth it!
 This stuff is amazing. Quality ingredients. Tastes good. Definitely worth it.
 Best Tasting!
 Excellent powder, works great and is a fantastic supplement to basic protein intake for anyone.
 I am not sure how much better or worse this product is than others. But it does have a lot of protein for the money. the taste is kind of grainy, but not revolting.
 the best
 fair price. taste and mixes great.
 Occasionally this formula will remain lumpy, but overall it tastes good and is thick &amp; rich.
 Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Banana I love it does the job what I need to for right now .....!!!!!!!!!
 Great product
 Tastes so good!
 Love it! Taste just like coffee flavor! :) I always have 1% - 2% milk in mine!
 Best protein I have taken, easy to mix and great taste
 my son uses this and it was a great price and with prime it was delivered in 2 days.....
 Ice cream flavor is not so good. Good product.
 Great taste! Great protein!
 Provides all the nutrition I was looking for in a protein supplement.  Good luck finding the scoop, I always keep my previous ones to use until I find it.  The Rocky Road flavor is good, so far I haven't mixed it with anything other than water and it mixes great, no clumps.
 Optimum Nutrition Whey Protein works great for me. It mixes well and has a great taste. The Strawberry Banana tastes good, and I have also tried the Mocha Cappuccino,, Banana, Chocolate, and Strawberry, and they all have very good flavor and mix great!
 Don't get Cookies and Cream. Stick too Chocolate or Vanilla.
 The best whey protein out there. I buy this all the time
 This smells and tastes so good!  I really enjoy drinking this,  even with just water!
 I have been using Optimum for a few years and love it. The combination of proteins in their specific order are of great use for someone trying to gain lean muscle mass. The ten lb bag is convenience for those using it often. I personally have two scoops three times per day. This gets me 144 grams of protein in addition to the foods I eat.<br/><br/>I recommend purchasing 2 5 lb tubs of this product and use the empty containers to use instead of the bag itself. The bag tends to be messy when using so i immediately empty it into the tubs.<br/><br/>Great tasting and mixes easily with a blender cup.
 I've been drinking the Optimum Nutrition whey protein for some years and it's good stuff. Taste awesome, mixes well and price is also reasonable for the amount you get.
 tastes great!
 This stuff is sooooo much better than the lesser expensive brands. Leaves me full and satisfied and tastes great going down. Slimmer - Healthier me, Here I come!!!!
 I take this post workout and first thing in the morning.  Easy to mix and taste good.  Helps me get my protein in so that I lose fat not muscle.  The price is a bonus as well.
 Good product, dependable company.
 My husband loves this stuff - only this flavor, double chocolate.
 Good taste, good consistency. Overall, ON never lets me down. I would buy any of their products.
 I've only tried the chocolate, and it's delicious. And it seems to be working pretty darn well too, but I don't have enough body building experience to give a good judgment. Its nice that it already has glutamine and BCAA's in it, just a small bit of convenience if you already take those.
 Best price in town.
 Always 5 stars! No complaints.
 GREAT!!!
 Great, good quality product and I love it. I will be ordering this again in the future.
 Awsome stuff, the double chocolate is a great flavor!!
 This protein is the best I have ever tried.  It mixes well with water and a few shakes.  The Double Rich Chocolate has a great taste (and I hate chocolate).  I've seen some impressive gains using this.  I'm sure there might be other proteins that are great but my search is over as I have founds my favorite.
 Been using this for a couple years. But I'm sorry to say I will not be buying this product anymore. Optimum Nutrition decided that the bottom line was more important. Seriously why change something that was not broken. ON you just lost another customer.<br/><br/>Currently they are trying to post many fake 5* reviews. If you look those reviewers only post 5* reviews. Well here's a real customer with a real 1* review. Go back to the old formula ON!!!
 I have been using 100% whey by ON for a few years now and it's always my go to choice. High quality protein, mixes well and doesnt taste as chalky as other protein powders
 Go to whey - best all around
 Amazing product. Double chocolate tastes just like a Wendy's frosty when mixed with milk. 10/10 would buy again.
 Fantastic. Works great with a heavy workout routine. Combine with creating, work out 5 days a week, results will come! I take 3 scoops 3 times daily.
 Good product, will get the job done, no fuss
 Great taste and it mixes very well, gets a little to sugary when trying to down two or three scoops after a good workout, tastes much better with milk than water.
 Tastes great
 Every body is different, for me, this brand works great
 Very satisfied---
 Do the research and look at actual independent lab analysis of product versus label. Optimum Nutrition is quality clean protein that mixes well even in a plain shaker with just water. I had never tried their strawberry and it's pretty good, I take mine with unsweetened vanilla almond milk FWIW.<br/><br/>You might wanna invest in good air tight containers or save your old tubs though instead of the big bag. My bag the zipper doesn't properly align so I can't reseal it. That's the only reason I docked it 1 star from the review, gotta find a couple containers..
 excellent
 It was open box.
 Best deal on plain protein. I'm a trainer. If u want simple protein... quality and value this is it
 Tastes good! I hate protein taste and this is the best I have had so far. A co-worked recommended this to me and I haven't gone back. Results are good as well.
 Very nice rich vanilla ice cream flavor.  I highly recommend it
 My favorite flavor is the vanilla ice cream. You can mix it with water and it's very tasty.
 Just received strawberry banana flavor, as other chocolate flavors I've had in the past weren't as cheap or available for prime shipping at the time, and it's absolutely terrible. Stick with the chocolate flavors and you'll be set.
 No doubt this is good stuff for you but I've had better tasting.
 2nd purchase! will purchase again :)
 best whey on the market!
 I'm a little lactose intolerant and this product doesn't give me any problems unlike Optimum Nutrition's Serious Mass (Terrible product that's non-returnable by the way). Be sure to take your proper calorie intake for your goals and you are golden with this product!
 Great product. Very tasty. Save yourself time and order the bigger one. This one goes by fast.
 Good stuff, will definitely continue to order
 Although you look everywhere that this taste good, it's just ok to me. It's too bland. The ingredients are great so I will finish my 5lbs tub but will get another brand with same ingredients &amp; better taste
 The only whey that tastes great to me.  I've tried many others, but ON brand is the best tasting one. And the Mocha Cappuccino is my favorite.
 Its the best flavour I had in so many years.... not  too sweet...Thats all I need..Thanks ON
 Great buy
 Me and the hubby love optimal nutrition. Good source of protein with low carbs and sugar. We've tried every brand but always come back to Optimal💜
 I compared it with many other powders and it came out on top. Tastes good too.
 Great protein for the price
 Item as described.  Thank you!  Could taste better...
 I like the choice of favors.
 Good
 We use this product in a smoothie type shake each morning--mixing with cow or goat or almond or rice or  .  Adding cinnamon and ground flax seed add to it.  We can have a glass of this and that is it until lunch.
 works as intended for cost
 This is my second order and it taste great and mixes well I use  this whey first thing in the morning Was looking for something a women could use and this is IT!!
 Great taste. Mixes very well.
 Gets the job done, but taste is not as good as<br/>BSN SYNTHA-6
 The best out there and with prime, you can't beat Amazon for the pricing.
 This product gets the job done. I recommend it to all who go to the gym, break down muscle, &amp; need some thing like this that mixes well and gives you just enough protein and BCAAs to repair the damage done.
 Still great!
 Super
 Simply the best. It tastes great, and mixes EXTREMELY easily in water or milk. Tastes better in milk. Good protein amount per scoop.
 ON Gold Standard is the OG of whey proteins. it is decent value and gets the job done. the taste is nasty to me, which is why i drink syntha now. the mixability is good.
 Great product that I have used  many years and great results.
 Love it. Banana cream tastes and smells exactly as it should 10/10
 Best protein I've ever tried. Mixes really well. Taste is amazing!
 White chocolate is my new favorite flavor.
 Excellent product.  Better in skim milk than water but water ok.
 I love this protein, but French Vanilla was a poor choice for flavor, just get standard vanilla or chocolate. Will be going back to double rich chocolate.
 Not my favorite taste for whey protein but good enough
 good tasting protein and reasonable price per serving.
 Excellent product.
 Perfect product to gain muscle and healthy diet. I have used this product for over two years now and it has helped me gain considerable muscle mass along with other protein intake. Highly recommended.
 Good taste and great ingredients
 It's a lot thinner than the protein that we are used to. It does not keep us very full very long. We will use it when we are in between proteins or just need a quick boost.
 Makes me look like Popeye!
 Good tasting and mixes well
 good brand cheapest on the market its about the same price as when GNC puts it on sale but GNC dont always have it on sale so you can get it here on sale always
 solid. best protein for a fair price
 Serviceable, and reasonably priced.  Not delicious but quite palatable.
 Very good seller. The order came on time and excellent quality. recommend
 Great value for money
 I use it for more than year after workoutsto feed and support my muscules. Very easy to mix with water or milk. Another plus taste, and this even tastes good when you mix it with water.
 Preffer the chocolate flavors
 Always one of the best.
 Buy Syntha-6 instead. Gold standard has 24 grams of protein and Syntha has 22. Drink Syntha with milk or add a lil more and ya got the same thing but ya saved 10 bucks. Syntha is better tasting, cheaper, and has nearly the same stats.
 I love the taste. Optimum Nutrition makes great quality whey. Very easy to drink.
 I like it, the taste is just right
 Awsome!!!
 Good flavor with the chocolate. One of the best whey protein products available.
 I have only tried the chocolate flavor. It has great taste. I have had good results.
 Great product.  Great taste.  A bit expensive but you get what you pay for I guess.
 I've bought like.. 6 or 7 jugs of this stuff and its all you'd ever need if you're after some quality whey protein for shakes.
 I've been taken this protein for over three years . Simply the best
 Great flavor.
 Cappuccino has a great taste all alone or even better with peanut butter, banana, and cinnamon. Plenty of servings to last.
 Good stuff for the price I guess. It has much less cholesterol than other products. Although I believe that taking too much of this product and other supplements is quite expensive and can have negative effects on your health.
 Mixes well, great taste, and really like this stuff.
 Great tasting whey protein. Best with 2% milk (cake batter)
 Tasted quite good. I always liked ON products. Thanks.
 If you want protein without all the garbage then this is the one. The price is excellent and the product is always fresh.
 LOVE IT!
 Review for ON 100% Whey Gold Standard, 10lb, Double Chocolate<br/><br/>Hands down, ON makes the best tasting whey on the market.  The whey comes in a thick plastic bag with heat sealed sides.  The top needs to be sliced open in order to access the powder.  There is a zip lock style closing system.  While you can scoop whey directly from the bag, I generally fill two 5lb containers and use those instead.<br/><br/>Powder mixes well with a variety of different liquids.  I generally use 4 scoops with whole milk or water filled to the brim of a standard size Blender Bottle (<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/BlenderBottle-Classic-Loop-Top-Shaker-Bottle-Clear-Black-28-Ounce/dp/B00MVMCUK8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">BlenderBottle Classic Loop Top Shaker Bottle, Clear Black, 28 Ounce</a>).<br/><br/>Flavor is somewhat like a dark chocolate.  It's not bitter, but it's not nearly as sweet as the ON chocolate.
 I didn't think it was possible to make whey protein taste this good, period, even when mixed in water with a spoon. I'm throwing away any other I have, nothing else I've ever had compares.
 Excellent seller, everything perfect I recommend it!
 Simply the best, I have been power lifting for many years and this is the best protein powder out there.
 Yes I would recommend it. Great smell and taste. Mixes well. The only thing I would like to see is it offered in a 2lb size...so it will not take up so much room on the counter.
 Best tasting whey out there, only issue is it is a bit pricey compared to the brands available from other websites.
 HUGE container. Wonderful taste.
 THE BEST. but expensive so i go for 2nd best
 Great
 Thought i already reviewed this..oh well.<br/>Its good protein..a bit too chocolatey in my opinion but that's certainly very subjective.
 Probably the best protein that is available.
 Works well for the price offered, taste is pretty decent too.
 Does not taste that good.
 best protein around, flavor could be a little better but it wouldnt be worth sacrificing the quality of the nutritional breakdown.
 affordable- i like that when you are training a lot<br/>flavor is lackluster and disappointing<br/>for economical reasons im giving this more cred than its worth
 Good product but the price is crazy when I first started two years ago 89.00 dollars I must've bought half a dozen I don't know if I can keep playing $111 dollars
 I love this Whey protein. It tastes great and mixes well. It is by far my favorite flavor. I introduced it to my son and he also loves this protein powder and flavor.
 Very inexpensive. Well made and easy to use. Thinking about buy another one so I won't run out. Just when you think you have seen it  all.
 EXCELLENT
 Good product
 love this protein drink.  Love the taste and no junk in it
 Pretty good protein shake . I've tried cheap brands before but they really taste horrible. They did a good job on this one
 seems to be better quality than the other brand i had used previously.
 French Vanilla with milk tastes heavenly. :9 :9
 on time and correct. no complaints<br/>This is the best tasting protein powder i've tried
 Very good product thanks
 Great! Mixes well and has a nice mild flavor (double rich chocolate).
 I purchased the Optimum Nutrition Whey based on the largely positive reviews. If only I had used the same guidance to select the flavor. I love the taste of cake batter and had thought that a glass of a cake batter flavored beverage in the morning would be great.<br/><br/>Much like soy milk does not taste like regular milk, cake batter flavored whey does not taste like cake batter. It starts off well as it first hits your tongue, but the pleasant taste and memories of happy times quickly fade to a slightly bitter flavor that does not leave your mouth even after you've swallowed the last of it.<br/><br/>Unlike other wheys that I have tried, this one goes down easier without being chalky and it does not feel heavy after ingesting it. If I had chosen a different flavor, I would have likely given this a 4, or even 5, star rating, but I cannot rate the cake batter highly.<br/><br/>My advice, get this whey, but choose a boring flavor...like chocolate.
 Great taste, and the fact that it has BCAA's is fantastic.
 I like the performance whey taste a bit better, but this has less carbs and I don't feel as bad using it as a meal replacement.
 Love it.
 tastes great...
 I love this product.  It tastes amazing, and I know there won't be any clumps.  15-20 seconds worth of mixing in a shaker cup and I know I'll be good to go.  The best part about this protein is I don't have to worry if I'm out of milk, as it still tastes just as good when using water only.
 Great product!
 I love this protein. My boyfriend and I have tried cellucor and muscle milk and this brand/flavor (milk chocolate) is hands down the best for price and flavor. For some reason the other chocolate flavor is really gross, but the milk chocolate one is spot on perfect. If you weren't sure between the two, always go with this one. My boyfriend likes to run out of the house and down a scoop really quickly from a glass. This mixes very well with just a fork if you don't want to shell out on blender bottles. We've used this protein for protein cakes and it works especially well with that too. They used to sell this at costco, but it seems like Amazon is the best place to get it now. For the nutritional facts, price, and flavor, I don't think I'll ever change brands.
 Didn't taste as great as I had expected and it gave me stomachaches.<br/>Pass.
 This protein shake has to be the most delicious protein shake out on the market. DOUBLE CHOCOLATE IS SO DELICOUS
 Good value
 excellent, highly recommend, excellent service, excellent product
 When it comes to protein, ON continues to be the on the top in terms of quality. You know whats in it, there aren't too many additives, and it is relatively cheap.
 This is simply the best! I've tried others but nothing compares to GS Whey in my opinion.  It always mixes with ease and tastes great. I never finish a workout without it.
 Best protein on the market. Hands down
 Taste is ok. More bland than anything.  Mixes well but leaves an odor in my blender bottles even after they are washed.
 tastes pretty decent and i got a good deal on this. so i will be purchasing more from here as well
 didnt weigh it but so far everthing seems as perfect as described ,flavor persannly isnt my favorite though
 I happen to love coffee flavored things, and so there's that, but the product is also a very fine powder that dissolves very easily in water, making mixing easy.
 It met the guidelines of my medical condition.
 Great taste!
 Get super jacked for an affordable price. Also this flavor trumps all other flavors in life including asparagus. Buy it and get super jacked. Do you even lift?
 good
 This is my favorite flavor of proteins.
 Taste is great and is a quality product
 As far as Optimum Nutrition flavors go, I like the extreme milk chocolate the best. It's not as rich tasting as I would like, but if you blend it with some fruit and almond milk, it's pretty darn good.
 Best protein on the market.
 Tastes amazing and aids in muscle recovery. Perfect.
 The best whey on the market. Extreme milk chocolate mixes and tastes good.
 I bought this product on the recurring plan and it came out cheaper that anywhere else. The taste is not rough at all, it goes down like juice. I believe this is the best quality protein out there.
 Disappointed with the taste.  This tasted like a watered down chocolate and slight hint of mint. Vanilla ice cream is the best flavor I've had yet.
 taste is not that great and it bubbles.. will never buy this again.
 I just wanna clarify some points:<br/>I received the new presentation style, which is great.<br/>Shipping was fast.<br/>Product came in New condition (you know, great shape)<br/><br/>I am really happy with this transaction. I knew the product beforehand and I have to say is great, the taste of the product is awesome. I believe that a better tasting protein keeps me motivated to tear myself at any workout, so it helps somewhat.<br/><br/>Just my 2 cents.
 I got the cookies and cream flavor not very strong or as good as Six Star Elite series from Muscle Tech.  Really don't know if I would buy this again.
 da best!
 Best price/for what you get protein
 Great stuff, I will continue to utilize this product until I can no longer lift a weight or run that 1 1/2 mile.
 Best protein on the market, period.
 YUM!
 Taste is fantastic!  No chalky aftertaste.  Will purchase again!  You get lots for the money.  Double rich chocolate is the way to go!
 Tastes great and fairly cheap.
 Great taste, great balance of high protein, lower carbs and fat than some of the others out there which works well for me since I think my carb intake the rest of the day seems high that I don't need to add a ton with my protein.
 I like the formula, the consistency and the good taste.  I notice though since I bought it the weight is now 4 pounds 9 ounces instead of the 5 pounds.<br/><br/>I bought this for my daughter also.<br/><br/>Elizabeth
 Still skinny as all hell but this stuff tastes good.
 I like that the powder dissolves almost completely after stirring and letting it sit for a few minutes. There is a plastic seal around the outside lid but no seal cap when you take the lid off which made me wonder is this had been used (gross).
 Taste Great. Easy to mix.
 So I purchased the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor. The smell is horrible, and when you mix it, it clumps and tastes like vomit. Regret buying this flavor, don't know what to do with the rest of it. The double chocolate never had this issue.
 I have tried a few different whey proteins over the years and have found this to be the best. It mixes better than any other protein shake with no leftover power you can find in other brands. The taste of the French Vanilla is great and there is no sickly taste that can be found with some of the other protein shakes I have had. Definately worth spending a bit more money on a superior product.
 I mix this with 8oz of milk daily after every workout. It has helped with my muscle building immensely.
 Great protein powder. Everyone always tells me to get c0mbat powder which is sold by a competitor, and even though i have a costco membership and I can get it for fairly cheap there I still always find myself coming back to this. Great protein in my opinion, loaded with everything you would want and has very minimal amounts of things you would not want. Now its not "perfect" with every ingredient accounted for, but if you are looking for something that has high protein, BCAAs, extremely easy to mix in a blender bottle, and very good tasting. Well then look no further. I pair this with ON creatine, almond milk, and a teaspoon of organic cocoa powder and oh my is it good. Even the most intense workout can be overcame with that cocktail. Cheers, and bottoms up my friends.
 Our 4th order or so.  Great value.
 Perfect as expected. it tastes amazing and it helped me a lot to get results
 Heard about this product through StrongLifts.com, and was very satisfied with my purchase. The taste was bearable - unsurprisingly, mixing it with milk instead of water makes for a much more enjoyable beverage. I've tried other flavors since my first tub, and would definitely recommend the double rich chocolate over anything else.
 best protein for your mony there is hands down!
 Cheaper on Amazon than it is in stores. It seems effective enough. As far as tastes goes it's not super delicious or anything, but it isn't tough to drink. A little on the bland side. Quality product, and I will be ordering a second tub soon.
 best tasting protein period and best i have ever used.
 Tastes like chocolate milk!
 no comments
 Usually order from Bodybuilding.com,but after comparing prices (price of item and shipping) Amazon wins. Free 2 day shipping with Prime, prices in general are cheaper. Although you receive a "free gift" from Bodybuilding.com, your order has to be at least $75. If you spend more, you have more choices for "free gift".<br/><br/>Our go-to protein supplement, in Mocha Cappuccino. Tastes great. Mixes great (no clumping). You can mix it in water, milk, or choice of beverage. I've used this as "creamer" for my coffee or you can mix this in water and add some instant coffee if you desire.
 Good product  200%
 Flavor is good. I like drinking it. Not sure if it makes a big difference in building muscle-hard to determine though. My teenage boys like to drink it after sports participation.
 great taste, will continue to buy in future
 Good
 I  love the flavor and it really taste good
 this favor taste great. thanks for the advise from other review.
 No need to say anything. This is the best protein shake in human history. Just get it and start bulking. Worth every single penny.
 Best whey hands down
 it is annoyimg to go every month to a supp store to get the same 2lb whey protein tube... I had enough... i decided to start buying a 10lb whey protein bag. It lasts more, i can even save money!<br/>it surprised me how fast my stuff arrived. I am so happy!! im a happy customer! ill come back again!!
 The chocolate coconut is the best flavor! It's good with milk or water. Love It!
 Much better than the GNC Amplified stuff I was buying previously and cheaper.
 Really light for the stomach and it taste really good, I love Vanilla Ice Cream.
 Love this stuff!!!!!!!!!!!!
 good taste
 The flavor is subtle, not overpowering, with a little sweetness. Mixes easy and quickly with not clumping. Satisfies my hunger after a workout.
 I bought the Whey Gold Standard Double Rich Chocolate on the recommendation of a friend.  While I know that everyone says GNC is way overpriced, I've been using their Wheybolic AMP 60 for a long time and have been very happy with it, both in terms of taste and performance.  The Gold Standard is just as good in terms of performance/recovery as far as I can tell.  It's less expensive, but there is pretty much no taste.  This isn't a big deal to me, but some people might care.  The good news is that it doesn't taste bad, it just doesn't taste like much at all.<br/><br/>I'll probably continue to buy it, although I may buy both this and GNC's AMP 60 and just mix them together and blend both the supplements and the price.  That's typically what I've done in the past with different protein powders while transitioning anyway, but I thought I'd try this on its own so I could write a fair review of it first.  Where this product works really well is if you want to mix it into food, like oatmeal.  It doesn't really affect the taste that much, whereas most other protein powders I've used would be pretty noticeable if mixed with oatmeal.<br/><br/>Hope this helps someone.
 Great product, great service!
 100% gold stanard. very good and i hope it has longer exprietion date.
 Tastes good for protein powder.
 Tastes great compared to a lot of other protein
 I've only tried the Vanilla, will be getting chocolate next time.  Mixes up easy, tastes just fine mixing with water.  Take 30 minutes after working out and keeps the boiler running till lunch.
 This is good tasting, economical protein powder. Being female, this powder gives the perfect dose of protein to assimilate and it is low in carbs for those whom are carb-cycling or following a Keto diet. I prefer the vanilla flavors because you can really change up the taste adding different extracts.
 Great product, have been using this my whole life!
 I had a strong allergy reaction and end up at Kaiser emergency room for two hours. The should warn you about allergist.
 Now, if I hadn't waited 3 months to write this review, it would be much different. It might have gone something like this:<br/><br/>ONE STAR! The cookie dough flavor tastes like what my body produces after eating a plate of chocolate chip cookies and then working out for two hours. Liquid. @$$.<br/><br/>That being said, I'm glad I waited 3 months and gave this product a shot. Following months of moderate lifting and exercise, I understand why this product can say cookie dough is its flavor. All it takes is a stroll outside in my shorts and a tank, and within MINUTES I got women pushin cookies my way. Now I'm waste deep in cookies!!<br/><br/>Given my experience, my instructions would go something like this:<br/>1) Workout erry day<br/>2) Drink this liquid excrement erry day with milk<br/>3)... Repeat 90 days...<br/>4) Release those muscles in the wild<br/>5) PROFIT!! ... with unlimited cookies<br/><br/>Finally, I recommend not getting cookie dough flavor. I have tried vanilla and chocolate from friends and they are much more tolerable.
 Tastes just like chocolate milk or hot cocoa.
 I love this protein, I have 2-3 shakes a day I find this is without a doubt the best bang for your buck. I love the taste and its a clean isolate. Love this.
 Tastes better than expected!  Will purchase for now on.
 Love this protein. Best flavor. Can drink just with water or mix with fruit great both ways.
 I used this for 2 years after gastric bypass surgery, and it was definitely the best-tasting powder out there, and was highly recommended by just about everyone. For those concerned about bloating I find that the common method or either blending or shaking adds too much air / bubbles.  My recommendation is to stir instead.  I also have a great tip to improve taste... keep it cold! Glass bottles make a big difference.  Plastic containers don't keep it cold enough.  The glass bottles that those Starbucks Frappuchino drinks comes in, I found, are the perfect size for a shake, and they're highly portable. They come in a 4-pack. After sitting a while, all it needs is a few swirls (with cap on!) and you can see the bottom to know when you've gotten it all off the bottom.  You can wash the glasses and lids and keep using them.  I pour my mix into these bottles, and go from there.  Here's my tip for the best way to mix:<br/><br/>Stir with a fork in a glass measuring cup.  First add a little milk to make a paste.  Then add more milk GRADUALLY, little by little, while continuing to stir, until you get the desired amount.  Making a paste first is essential.  If you just dump your powder into a large glass of milk, it will clump. Pour your shakes into above-mentioned glass bottles.<br/><br/>I reiterate that using a blender or shaking it adds too much air. Sometimes people like this effect because it gives it more of a cake batter or milkshake feel, but for me it adds to much air that can affect gasiness and/or bloating.<br/><br/>Also, use with milk.  It won't taste good with water.
 The best Protein on the market. Can't beat the taste.
 Very good tasting protein. It mixes well and doesn't clump. Can't go wrong with whey! My muscles love it. :)
 Been using this for a few days now and I'll never buy another brand of protein. I went for the banana cream flavor and it taste like banana laffy taffy, I love it. Mixes perfect in silk pure almond after only 10-15 seconds of shaking.<br/><br/>Taste (banana cream): 10/10<br/>Mix-ability: 10/10
 love the taste of this protein powder mixes very easily.
 it's alright
 I have been purchasing Optimum Nutrition Protein powder for quite some time, and recently decided to try out a new flavor.  To my surprise, the banana flavor has artificial sweeteners.  ON claims it never uses any, so i was quite confounded.  Though it tastes great, I feel deceived.
 Awesome taste! Mocha flavor is my best one so far
 Many times ordered, and always as happy each time.  Wish they all worked like this one.
 great product!
 EXCELLENT
 The Gold Standard 100% Whey Vanilla Ice Cream is by far my favorite protein powder.  I've tried other stuff, but always end up back here.
 Best protein out there
 Tastes great and you get a lot of bang for your buck. One scoop is packed with 24 grams of protein so you won't need to double up that often.
 good
 Has strong coffee smell, but taste doesn't have enough flavoring even at using 8oz of water and a full scoop. Just taste like watered down milk chocolate with coffee smell.
 Great product. Great protein low sugar
 Good protein. The taste is decent and it mixes really easy.
 The taste is the best, in my opinion. Got it 24 hours before the time expected.
 Best protein in the market in my opinion
 Its my best daily drink of protein .I mix it daily with my milk and fruit in the blender.
 Love the taste! Works great with blender bottle!
 I've been using this for over a year now in the morning and after my workouts. After trying many other protein powders, Optimum Nutrition seems to always been on top as far as price, taste, mixture and consistency goes. I'm no expert, but as far as I know this is as good of quality protein you will get for the money.<br/>I wish the subscribe and save still worked though I liked that.
 this is what i need for my new workout...
 i eat it
 love this protein
 very nice product
 Great
 The taste is good.
 I am big into weight lifting and this protein is absolutely perfect. I don't even think of buying anything else.Its got high protein per serving and many amino acids and also got L-arginine to help support blood flow. It has great taste and comes in many different flavors. I cant say enough good things about this product.
 Love the flavor mixes easy
 extreme milk chocolate is by far the best flavor. Goes down like water and mixes almost as easily with a blender bottle. And at like 77cents per serving And 24grams of protein its a great deal. if I want Just protein and not a meal replacement this is the stuff
 the best on the market and  would not get nothing else and it is a value on the cost will never stop buying this
 my favorite protein shake and great price
 Yumm I like it
 I have been using this product for 8 years. If its not gold standard then you played yourself.
 the double rich was excellent however, don't buy Rocky Road... i regret buying Rocky Road... I should have stick with Chocolate or Vanilla..
 Chocolate mint is verrry good. I drink with whole milk and it tastes just like melted mint chocolatechip ice cream bbaaby. Would buy again fo sho
 The ON whey protein is the best value for your money. It consistently shows up on best whey protein powder lists. Not 100% isolate, includes some whey concentrate, but very high grams of protein per grams serving (24g protein per 29.4g serving size by weight). I have mild lactose intolerance, and this protein doesn't bother me at all. The vanilla ice cream flavor is delicious; slightly sweet, but not overly so. I switched to this one from GNC whey isolate 28, and when I had a leftover serving of the GNC brand I was disgusted by how sweet that one was. I drink it first thing in the morning with soy milk and egg whites, another serving in a smoothie pre-workout, and then the chocolate flavor with just water post workout. It tastes better with milk/soy milk, but tolerable with water. Very fine powder, mixes up easily with a shaker ball bottle.
 Very tasty and reasonably priced
 And I've tried them all.
 Good protein.  Taste great.  Great price.
 It is Great.
 this product I use everyday can't live without this
 Really good protein for maintain a healthy body weight
 Great for having pure protein anytime of the day.
 I didn't like the flavor of the cookies and cream (although this flavor is a favorite for a friend of mine).  Shipping was fast.
 There is already a great review(really in depth), I've been using this for a week now and I am very impressed. Not too bad with just water but I mix it with unsweetened soy milk and it's great!
 top of the line whey protein..great service
 Dissolves super fast in water, but clumps in milk/almond milk. Good taste and great in smoothies.
 Nothing wrong with it. It comes in a huge jug, taste fine (I got the banana kind). Over all Good product.
 This, Spinach and Bananas keep me going most days when I am super busy. Awesome.
 Surprisingly taste ok even with water.  A blender bottle is a must with this stuff.
 Fast shipping, love this coffee flavor.
 Consistently good
 I ordered the Cookies and Cream flavor and it's delicious!! It fills me up and tastes great with only water, and even better when mixed with almond milk (I don't drink dairy). It arrived quickly. I will definitely order again.
 I've tried proteins from A-Z, no carb, low-carb, bulk proteins, etc.  You name it, I've tried it.  Honestly, nothing beats price and quality like ON.  After extensive research of so many proteins, this is the best one I can physically purchase.  A lot of speculation I've had with proteins in the past, is protein spiking (googe it).  Many proteins I've tried in the past have been taken off of shelves due to false advertisement and spiking.  One product that's been there since day one, which I've always always always overlooked, was ON protein.  What you say?  It's still here?  Sure is.  This stuff is it.  I'll probably only buy this protein for the rest of my gym-bro days.  Even then, i'd still take it just as a tasty shake.  Flavors are unreal accurate.
 Great product!
 I thought I purchased the plain choclate which is pretty good, but I order the mint one and do not really like the taste of it.
 Great product!! LOVE IT!
 Good product
 GREAT
 CHEAP AND GREAT
 Optimum nutrition is the top tier protein and has been for years now.  Ive been weight lifting for 12 years and tried many different supps and before you decide whether a product works or not theres one rule you must follow CONSISTENCY!!!!<br/><br/>That being said this product is well worth the money, I bought the 5lb cake batter flavor and i love the taste and mixes very easily.  I used this product to build mass as I am naturally skinny (5'11'' 140lbs).  I count my calories and kept my diet consistent for the time that I took this protein while lifting very heavy 5 days a week.  After I finished the bottle I gained 5 lean pounds.  I will continue to use this protein and hopefully they won't change the ingredients like some other companies do.
 This stuff is awesome; tastes great, dissolves quickly.  My favorite whey protein powder by far.
 Great quality no excessive fillers mixes easy. one of the better flavors they have. now im just using  the last words up.
 good stuff, I use with milk for that rich chocolate taste.
 THIS GAVE ME SICK GAINS<br/><br/>10/10 would snort again
 This is my go to brand for protein. Taste amazing and i wouldnt trust any other brand besides ON
 Taste was below average :(
 Tastes great and at a good price. The shipping was bad because the container was halfway caved in and it took me about 2 weeks of using a spoon before I finally found the scoop. Overall though it was a good purchase.
 This is a good source of protein
 Great product but Amazon is jacking up the price.
 Great with a great price
 For protein Powder this stuff is Delicious. I use it after going to the gym and its almost something to look forward to since it doesn't tase like something that died and got ground up.
 It fine.
 Taste is aweful... You can stomach it, but you won't want to. Get the Double rich chocolate. Its good.
 been using for years.
 Great flavor and macronutrient content for a good price.
 Gold Standard is the gold standard of protein powders.  Get it!
 I love the taste, Is so hard to wait to the end of the work out just to take my protein shake!! ;-)
 It tastes like chocolate milk and has very little sugar.
 price n taste ftw
 If you like eating milk-chocolate bars, you may like it, but I will go with a different flavor next time.
 Product exactly as advertised
 Great Product!
 Excellent!
 must have whey for daily workouts. sucks prices been jacked up so much now a days but still beats me having to always stay in the kitchen and make protein based meals 24/7 gold standard from on is a must have in my life.
 Best protein option on the market.
 tastes great especially when made with Almond milk
 Standard whey protein. 5/5
 Best protein on the market
 I've tried many protein products and am very picky when it comes to taste. Unlike many, I drink this with plain water at room temp. This is the best tasting and best disoving I have had to date.
 So far, so good. Boy, it was soooo much larger than I thought!!
 Easily mixes, which is a plus, and the taste is good
 Tastes good to me.
 I'm a woman and take this everyday after my workout. I'm literally never sore no matter how hard I push myself when I drink this and have gained more muscle tone, I love it!
 SEEMS TO WORK WONDERS, ESPECIALLY FOR THE $$$
 Great price. great results
 Taste like Ovaltine awesome !!
 Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard Cake Batter is a pretty good product.  I prefer Optimum Nutrition's Hydro Whey.  But I thought I'd give this version a try.  I mix my proteins with water and this product dissolves very well, even in cold water.  I haven't had any gassy after-effects or bad aftertastes either.  As for the flavor, I don't quite think it tastes like a cake batter (maybe it does with milk???).  I think it actually tastes like watered-down condensed milk...or kinda like those chewy Japanese Milky candies, if you've ever had one of those.  I'd recommend it if asked.
 Tina Turner does not take this but I do and I turned back when I did. I am also pumped.<br/>ON is still the primo protein.
 I've had several flavors of ON's whey, and double chocolate isn't their best. Wish they offered this size bag in a wider variety of flavors. The ziplock can be a little tough to keep closed.
 Good quality and taste.
 Tastes great, and mixed very well.
 GAINZ BRO. Thats all you need to know. I got into a fight at the gym because the weights werent heavy enough while taking this product. MORE GAINSZZZ!!!! MORE PROTEIN!!!
 my favorite protein  - arrived fast and fresh and ready for banana!
 Guys this is one of the most delicious and nutritious product in market and every serving you are getting more than 75% protein...
 A good product.
 My first time trying whey protein and all I have to say is I'm glad I got 5 lbs. There is such a big difference when you don't drink whey protein and work out and when you do. I'm in love with this product and I'm not so tired the following day. I think anyone who goes to the gym and works out should drink whey protein. Without it, it takes forever to see results!
 Great price and this is my Favorite Flavor!
 My go to whey formula. I've been using this for years!
 Great product
 Great so far!
 Good
 Love this brand.  By far the best protein I've tried, not grainy or gross tasting.  They have a lot of good flavors too!
 Have purchased this product multiple times - tasty and blends well.
 I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a quality protein supplement without wanting to spend a lot of money. Taste is very good, Consistency is smooth. Only negative is it occasionally leaves me a lil' gassy but this is very common in most protein supplements.
 Very tasty and good price. Since I use a lot buying in bulk like this is very helpful.
 There are a billion reviews on the product as a whole. Obviously, it's completely awesome, great calories to protein ratio, mixes really easily, etc.<br/><br/>I usually only look at the reviews now if I'm feeling experimental and want to try a new flavor, so I thought I'd leave a review on a less common one.<br/><br/>I just received the Mocha Cappuccino and it's great. Not a super strong coffee flavor, but a hint of that plus the usual chocolate. I actually typically mix instant coffee with mine in the morning.
 Its a Good Product
 Good tasting. Lots of protein.
 The best protient but a nice flavor, but not the best flavor. Chocolate is better.
 my favorite whey protein
 This is a great supplement.  ON offers a great value for the dollar.  My only complaint is that they use artificial sweeteners.
 great product from reliable vendor
 Great product! My husband use only this brand. Vanilla flavor rocks.
 I love the ON 100% Whey Protein, but the Vanilla Ice Cream isn't my favorite flavor.  If you like a very subtle taste, you may enjoy it, but it's almost like drinking sweetened water to me.
 My favorite whey by far! And best deal you can get! Cake batter with a little Oj is my jam!
 One of the best whey's on the market I've tried and have come to love. Chocolate Mint #1!!!
 Excelente
 I have used this product for over 10 years. It is delicious and mixes like a dream. I highly recommend.
 Good protein, tastes okay, got the cake mix...drank before and after workouts
 The tastiest flavor so far.
 Very effective. I barely get sore when i take 2 servings of this.
 Of all the Optimum Nutrition flavors I've tried, this one is probably the best.  It works as a stand alone shake and blends well for making fruit smoothies!
 The absolute best flavored whey protein I've ever had. This is the only protein I will ever buy.
 I've tasted other chocolate flavors but this one didn't disappoint neither. Taste great with just water. I recommend it. .
 Great product!
 the best protein u can get and for its cost u cant go wrong with this stuff I still take it 4 years later
 Price is right, and I don't have t go looking for it.
 I personally think it tastes bitter and nasty. Wish I could get a different flavor.
 Love this stuff. Great quality and good price. I continue to buy from Optimum Nutrition
 I'd try a different flavor next time.  The Rocky Road has too many flavors going on.
 Well from a flavor standpoint this stuff is great. I mix it with real banana and frozen strawberries. I have been using it for about a month so I cant comment on the effectiveness, but others I know that use it say it works. Will be trying other flavors in the future and will comment on those too.
 This stuff is delicious!
 Independent lab testing shows this is one of the best quality protein powders on the market and tastes great. If you're looking for just whey protein, this is the kind to get.
 I love the taste and it has the best protein to calorie to taste ratio.
 Taste is great for what it is and mixes well with just water...performance wise have not been able to work out due to a snowboarding accident to the sholder but I am sure it will live up to its reputation. Price is competative
 I LIKE IT USED BEFORE AND AFTER GYM
 Delicious and gluten free
 Tastes great, good quality product.
 IMO the best protein out there...good pricing.
 I'm already a Gold Standard fan.  After trying many other products, I believe this one is absolutely top tier.  It arrived quickly and well packed.  No issues.
 good price, has all the levels of protein that I need and it tastes great!  We will buy these products again and again.
 Great product,  thanks!
 This stuff is delicious and blends very well
 4 pounds of this goes for $50 at Costco. I'd rather pay the extra $10 for another pound. Tastes great!
 Tastes really good!
 ON is the best value in whey I've found. Vanilla milkshake is delicious with little protein aftertaste.
 In my opinion the best protein powder out there.  Low Carb!
 The price is higher than the market, go buy it from a nutrition store and you'll save money
 This is my go to protein
 Best protein shake out there
 With milk it has a tendency to clump but doesn't clump in water. It does taste good in water but even better with milk. The taste for double chocolate is heavenly with no bad after taste. I highly recommend giving this Whey a try.
 Good
 good value.  best flavor.  i love gold standard whey!
 Mint Chocolate Chip is my favorite flavor of ice cream, milkshake, you name it.  I've always loved the flavor, so naturally I thought going with this flavor for my next order of Whey would be a no-brainer.<br/><br/>Alas, I was disappointed.  While its flavor does contain hints of what seems to be mint,  it really just tastes like a weirdly flavored chocolate and a sort-of minty aftertaste.  Maybe I'm overly critical since I traditionally love this flavor in other forms, but that's just my opinion.  Also, it doesn't particularly mix very well with milk as do the other flavors.  I've tried many other flavors with my shaker cup, and I always pour the milk in first like you're supposed to, but no matter what I do, it always seems to clump up (never had this problem with other flavors).  In the past I've tried double chocolate, chocolate coconut, vanilla, vanilla milkshake, and cookies and creme, and I'd say this definitely comes in last among these flavors in my opinion (Chocolate Coconut is still a personal favorite)<br/><br/>3/5 stars for lower-tier mixability and sub-par taste.
 I use this with my Blender Bottles after every workout.  Double Rich Chocolate tastes great.  Great value for the money.
 Great flavor.
 I bought the extreme milk chocolate flavor.  Maybe I was expecting too much from all the positive reviews, but I'm not crazy about the flavor.  The nutrition facts are great and it mixes well with my blender ball.
 I'm buying more when I get done with this jug.  Mixing with the correct quantity of water leaves a great taste and is not chalky at all.
 Great flavour. I ordered chocolate.
 I've tried a lot of protein drink mixes over the years and the ON Gold is by far the best tasting and the one I've had the best result with. I'm not a big guy, I'm a guy with a small frame that was just shy of 180 lbs when I started using this product and after 5 months I'm now under 150 lbs and I'm now far more muscular and quite lean. while that weight is below what I'd like the mirror tells me that it suits me pretty well and in the end it's what i look like that's more important than what I 'think" I should weigh.<br/><br/>Now I'm not going to sit here and tell you that all this was done by drinking this magic Whey protein as that wouldn't be true. I also cut my daily carbs way down and increased protein intake. I don't eat bread anymore, i cut way down on deserts except on special occasions and just plain eat healthier. I drink this stuff twice a day one before my workouts and one right after. I lift heavy weights for about 40 minutes each work day and then do HIT on a rower for about 20 minutes making my workouts around an hour each day before work (getting up at 3:40AM is rough, but it's paying off). I have to eat like a horse now just to keep from losing more weight because the muscle I've built up is burning calories all day long!<br/><br/>I snack on other protein sources throughout the day which include peanuts, natural peanut butter (right out of the jar), high protein Greek yogurt, a hard boiled egg and sometimes a protein bar. I also drink about 10 80z cups of water through the day. And by the way I'm just on the cusp of turning 50 and my build is better now then when i was lifting in my early 20's! I credit that in part to ON Gold as I'm sure the ingredients are far superior to what i took those many years ago. I'm also lifting weights that are a little bit heavier than when I was in my prime as well. i don't have the endurance i had back then, but my strength is actually slightly better now then it's ever been.<br/><br/>I've tried Vanilla Ice Cream, Double Rich Chocolate, Rocky Road and a mint one (forget the name). My favorite is the Rocky road, but I usually buy the Vanilla Ice Cream because I get more for my money and I blend it with just a a couple strawberries and a few blueberries to give it some extra flavor and it's very good.
 Am I Arnold yet?<br/>No.<br/>But close!
 I was actually shocked at how delicious this was (double rich chocolate flavor). I read some bad reviews about the flavor, but I mixed it in milk, and it tasted awesome, just like chocolate milk. Mixed in really well with a blender bottle. Can't ask for much more!
 Husband only uses this protein mix.
 Tastes yummy! I love adding this to my daily shake for great tasting protein. I've tasted the chocolate, and it's good too.
 Great product.  Thanks!
 have tried a variety of whey powders and this is the best tasting, highest yield, and lowest carb/cholesterol option.
 One of the best protein powders I've ever tried, and I've tried MANY. Wonderful, nutrition packed product. I purchased the vanilla ice cream flavor and will be buying others!
 Excellent results, very fast delivery.
 Nice taste
 I'm told it's a pretty good choice. Tastes alright. Price isn't bad compared to other brands.
 Great item! Thanks a lot!
 Mixes well with milk. I drink this every morning to start my day. Stays with me a long time. Tastes great too.
 Bought for a friend he loves it
 I bought the Rocky road flavor. I mix it with water and it tastes awesome!
 tastes great, wonderful quality.
 Delicious taste - probably the best tasting flavour i've ever had.<br/><br/>As usual gotta dig for the scoop - its in there somewhere folks!<br/><br/>Would totally order this flavour again.
 I have tried lots of different proteen and this is one of the best! The taste is great if you mix it with some milk it tastes like a chocolate shake and it does just what it is intended to do. If your looking at buying some proteen i defentally recomend this product!
 Absolutely love the double rich chocolate flavor.
 Great taste .
 I think you can't get a better healthy product for body building then this, and to be able to make a nice shake too is such a bonus
 Tastes great.  love it.  have had many different kinds of this protein. its good quality and the banana is a good flavor.
 Works as advertised.
 Great price compared to GNC and others.
 I've been using this product as I've been marathon training, it tastes great and helps immensely with recovery time. I have gotten much stronger and faster with my training, and ON has definitely contributed to my advances.
 First time I buy protein powder. Read many reviews of wired tasting products. This one has an excellent taste even with water. Go for it!!!
 Well, it's a protein shake. I like it because it has low carb. I bought mocha cappucino flavor which disappoints me a lot, because many others say it tastes really good. (Maybe only with milk). But overall, i love this product.
 best brand of whey protein!
 My Order arrived with the cap smashed and some of it contents spilled out, will update on effectiveness of the product.
 Other flavors that I tried:<br/>Rocky road flavor<br/>Double chocolate
 Good product.
 Love the flavor and the delivery was really quick delivered on Sunday
 good tasting, high protein item
 Great product.  I got the "Rocky Road" flavor, and it mixes easy with cold water.  I sometimes even put it in my coffee.  Tastes great!
 Great protein. Better than a lot of others I have tried. Helps build muscle and recover fast!
 I love coffee so I tried the coffee flavored whey, which tastes ok. I will probably try another flavor next time.
 exellent flavor
 Great tasting and great shelf life.
 Quality ingredients but you can get it for less at warehouse clubs like Costco.
 This is my favorite flavor so far of ON's Gold Standard Whey. I get pretty sick of regular Milk Chocolate after 5 lbs, so it was nice to have something a little different.
 I drink make this protein w/ room temperature water, I put it in a blender with a glass full of water. Blend it up and pour it, tastes good and I've yet to get tired of the flavor. I drink one everyday.
 Taste very sweet!
 For whatever the reason maybe I did not digest this well.
 I trust ON.  Been taking for years.  I've made significant muscle gains.
 Great product.
 This tastes like real chocolate milk when poured into water. Ive never been able to say that with any other chocolate flavor before, its always been this is decent, this is tolerable... but this is good, even in just water.
 Im a fan for optimum nutrition. I usually order this brand. They tend to have very little calories. I would recommend
 Great value!
 best stuff out there is simply its protein.
 Taste great, no aftertaste, mixes easy
 Solid taste. Solid macros. Drink 2 a day right now that I'm in a caloric deficit to hit my protein requirements.
 the product meets our needs,
 Very good whey protein. I use this with water and there is no clunks of powder when mixing. It dissolves quickly and tastes great! Will order again.
 It's really good and the French vanilla taste good for me
 I don't buy this anymore because the price has gone up so much.  If that doesn't bother you then I highly recommend this product for the quality.  Mixing the chocloate in a glass of milk tastes great.
 Great value &amp; taste great.
 Great taste!  Good buy.
 I had never tried this product before...and it lived up to the billing.....great taste, easy to mix....and shipper was great....very quick shipping.  Product was ABSOLUTELY as advertised.
 Taste is OK, I have tried others with better taste.
 easy way to get some extra protein. save your scoops from other ON products as they always get lost inside the powder. Nothing wrong about this product and nothing special about it, leading to like but not love.
 This is the best protein out there. It taste great, doesn't throw outrageous claims out at you, and is decently priced. You just cant go wrong with this purchase.
 I love it<br/><br/>The only thing Im not confortable with is the fact that it doesn't have the seal<br/>all the other protein have.
 I'm sure everyone knows about ON Gold Standard, so not much more to say here.<br/>Tastes great, mixes easily and has a good blend of protein.  Tastes awesome with milk.
 This is my go-to whey protein.  I am a big fan of the Double RIch Choco.  Mix with some bananas, milk, peanut butter and some ice and you have yourself a pretty delicious shake.
 Great product and excellent service from Amazon.
 best flavor ever .. you can mix it with strawberries .. kale .. bananas .. add some old fashion oatmeal blend it up ! don't forget your bcaa's .. THEN GET YOUR ASS TO THE GYM AND LIFT SOME HEAVY WEIGHTS
 100% Whey Gold Standard is the best Whey Protein Blend for starters and professionals . I am using this product for more then 2 years with great results . Taste great .
 Fantastic, great product
 It tastes ok and it seem to be helping me lost weight
 I found no downside to this product.  I was concerned from reviews that the flavor wouldn't be so good but I think it tastes like chocolate milk should taste. I mix it with a handheld blender so no problem. This has become a permanent part of my daily diet.
 taste great smells great will buy again
 I am not sure why this is, but when ever I use this powder, I drop weight.  And not just any kind of weight but fat.  My midsection gets smaller and my upper body gets bigger.  It only happens on this protein powder.  I have tried dozens of powders but this one is by far my favorite.
 Tastes amazing!! Better than any protein powder I have had before.  Didn't care for the cake batter flavor though..so have ordered vanilla ice cream twice.  Love it!
 My protien of choice for the past few years , great price for 70+ servings. Coffee flavor is great, plus the added caffeine for my after lunch meal is great!!
 This mixes easy, tastes good, and helps keep me full so I don't starve during the day so the 6 meals is easier to achieve..
 Horrible taste
 I use this as a meal replacement. It taste amazing. Very close to hot chocolate and it dissolves pretty well. Its even better tasting in milk. I def recommend this to anyone who things all protein drinks taste terrible!
 Great quality protein, mixes well and tastes great. They keep raising the price though, but it is worth it
 I'm not a fitness " buff " however, when compared with my previous whey protein mix,  this one seems to give me more of a " lift " already. One ; 24 grams of protein IN EACH SCOOP. The other, from ( we'll call it " brand g " 😉 ) requires four scoops of the same size to make 50 grams of protein (24 grams per scoop compared to 12.5)  Two ; Instantaneous dissimilation of the powder whereas my previous mix clumped up a little bit and didn't always seem to fully dissolve ( as well as the mix before that and before that. My friends whey mix also has that problem. No worries brand g ; I'm not just picking on you. ) Three ; It tastes pretty good !  ( I purchased Banana Straberry, it arrived within 24 hours and I got to try it right away ) It's not loaded with sugar like other drinks, so someone with a sweet tooth may disagree. Perfect for my taste buds and nutritional needs though. Add some real strawberrys and bananas if the flavor seems weak. Thanks ON and AmazON.
 Great stuff!!  Use it after a workout and taste is good.
 This is muscle powder. It makes muscles. I use it to increase my muscle size. You too, could use it to increase your muscle size. Trust me, the ladies will love it. Mine does. Wink.
 I love this product and it is an item that I recommended people buying. This was definitely the site to make the purchase.
 Protein supplements have come a long way.  This really is the Gold Standard.  Good taste, mixes easily, and there's no quicker way to remedy a protein deficiency. Delivery was unbelievably quick.
 Just as expected, tastes great and been taking for years!
 Outstanding performance.....
 All good!
 Very good meal replacement. Taste is Ok
 Wife has been using this supplement for years. She loves it and it seems to love her right back. Price is good too.
 Good protein
 Great stuff, will buy again!
 i couldnt really tell the difference from this &amp; vanilla. its still good though
 Delicious!! Just wish the scoop was attached to the lid so you don't have to dig for it.
 Arrrrrrsome flavor and arrrrrrrsom mix! I love this protein!
 Amazon did a fantastic job. This product was shipped from Amazon Warehouse in NH and shipped to my place (Same day shipping). The moment I clicked Submit Order, it took only 17 hours for the product to reach my porch.<br/><br/>This protein tastes delicious and real chocolatey. It came with a free 2 serving Pre Workout but i don't think i'll use it. The whey isolates mix very well with milk and/or water. Its been 2 days and i still can't seem to find the cup that is buried in 5lb. of whey powder. Only problem I have with this is that this is Chocolate (Duh) hence chocolate contains cocoa powder --&gt; Caffeine !<br/><br/>I can tolerate caffeine (no jitters) but am still sensitive to caffeine (increased heart rate, diuretic). I took it last night, took me an hour to go to sleep whereas other days i takes me just 15 minutes.
 This protein powder tastes great and is very fine, so it blends very well.  The Vanilla goes well with anything.
 Always shop for the lowest price.  Whey has increased in the last few years.  If they keep the price down will purchase again.
 It taste not good
 Can't beat the price for quality protein
 Love it
 Worked well
 Taste great !! A must have
 Good protein
 This item was a gift for someone and they seem to love.
 What can I say, I love chocolate and this is one of the best flavors of it I've come across. It's even better with a teaspoon or two of cocoa powder and Splenda. 5 stars.
 My go to!  Favorite flavor at a reasonable price.
 Pretty tasty and not overly sweet…can't beat the price, I've checked all places.
 Love this protein and even better at this price. Will be buying more
 Product mixes well with milk and tastes great. Overall very happy with my purchase.
 Good taste and easy mixing
 I srsly love this protein, its my first one and i have no regrets about it, the best flavor!<br/>I like it cuz it is a really good source of protein and its what i really what any bodybuilder needs to get better.<br/>100% recommended for every bodybuilder and with this flavor it really taste awesome.
 This product is nice and test is good. I will buy it again.
 I think this is very good. There is no flavor at all but it doesn't have the sugar and other additives like Muscle Milk and some of the other main brands. I'd buy this again for sure.
 Good Taste
 Works great in post work-out smoothies.
 Mat seem pricey but O.N. protein is worth the buy.
 Tastes nothing like cookies and cream, but somewhat more like coffee. I like the banana flavor much more than this one.
 Very good, great product
 Top notch product and I've been using it forever.  Mixes with anything, dissolves, and tastes great.
 very good protein powder .
 It taste great and mixes really well.  I haven't tried any other flavors because there has been no need to change.
 Love this stuff
 This is as good as any protein powder. Not too bad on carbs and low cholesterol.
 I bought extreme chocolate milk. I drink it with water. I put the powder first and then I pour 8oz water on top and mix with a fork. Honestly, it tastes WAY better than I was expecting it to. It tastes exactly like hot chocolate mixed with water. I bet if you warmed the water up it would taste just like hot chocolate made with water. You wouldn't need a shaker cup to make it with water but if you plan on making it with milk you might prefer one because it doesn't blend as well. With milk it tastes better than the water but at the same time it's not something I'd want to drink everyday.<br/>As for the muscle gain gain aspect, I can't speak on that... Firstly I've bought it for preventing muscle loss and secondly I've only had it a week.<br/>It came with a gold scoop which was burried in the middle of the powder and if your a goof ball like me you might have the urge to just stick your hand in and grab dig it out (I had to stop myself from doing that) or you can dig it out with a fork or pair of tongs.<br/>As for the shipping, it came stuffed in a box slightly too small which was kind of ripped open on the corners but it came undamaged and it came right on time so no big deal in my opinion.
 Good for the price. Nothing special or crazy. Decent taste.
 Here's a simple review.<br/>Tastes good. I like French vanilla, rocky road , and extreme milk chocolate. I've ordered multiple vanilla variations and they are all fantastic.<br/>I use this daily and when I was on a recent diet used it 2x a day to supplement protien and lost 25 lbs.<br/>There's a reason its consistently at the top of the whey supps. It's quality whey , tastes great, mixes well. Everything you want in a whey supplement.
 Tastes good enough as far as protein shakes go.
 By far the best tasting protein powder out there.
 Came in a day earlier than it was suppose to, great product.
 Got a ridiculously lower price than from GNC. I would highly recommend this product. Blends well and taste fine. I am satisfied.
 Best whey put there imo for price
 Delicious, and I get the Protein I need, without the calories, what more to be said?
 Much better than I expected! The powder is very fine and very dry (good thing). It dissolves so well even in cold water. No grittiness. The chocolate flavor actually tastes like chocolate. It's not very sweet but I think that's a good thing. Also, the gold colored scooper is a nice little touch. They even threw in a sample of their pre-workout in the jar. Great product.<br/><br/>I've been buying BPI Whey HD for the past few months and, wow, was I missing out. Their whey isn't very dry and it's kind of clumpy. The taste is NOT good. I've had their chocolate, vanilla caramel, cookies and creme and I was not satisfied but I finished the jars anyway. When I bought their strawberry cake, that was the final straw. The flavor was so bad it gave me a headache. I had to switch brands. Glad I did! ON, you've earned yourself another loyal customer.
 I love this protein. Taste great and not a lot of fat with it. A ton a flavors to choose from. Cookies and cream are my favorite! Taste like a milk shake.
 Love it, have loved it since I got it. The best on the market IMO. Fast PRIME shipping and taste is great.
 Better price here on Amazon. Taste was good too, especially if mixed with almond milk.
 Mixes so easily with milk or water. Tastes great. Very sweet, kinda like melted ice cream. Just finished 5 LBS and have mocha cappuccino now. Yet another good option
 If you're researching which protein to get, get this.
 Love it
 Great tasting protein is hard to find. I mix this with some skim milk and it taste great. Would buy this again when I run out.
 Step 1: add 1 cup of protein powder to 1 OZ of water<br/>Step 2: Apply directly to muscles you want enlarged<br/>Step 3: Watch yourself get bigger<br/>Step 4: Take a selfie
 tastes good and im actually noticing a nice change.
 Those that attend the box daily in our house are powering this down every morning for breakfast and seem to love it.
 Amazing number of servings for the price. This and isopure are my favorite protein powders.
 What's not to love about this product? It has a great reputation, a great affordable price, plenty of variations between weight+flavor desired, ships+arrives fast, mixes well and even tastes great (Coffee)! Five pounds is a LOT of protein and will last you awhile and per 32g scoop with 24g/protein. Not to mention you are getting 5.5g/BCAA's and 4g/Glutamine+Glutamic Acid in this bad boy and I tell you what this is a great bang for your buck. Tastes great, mixes well, plenty of variety and more than affordable on any bodybuilding budget!! Highly recommended!!
 Great flavor
 The best! Vanilla Ice Cream is a great flavor!
 I love this stuff.  Just add milk and it is like drinking dessert.  I have bought this product many times and will continue to do so.
 -Not sure why people are saying this taste bad. Its pretty good for me.<br/>-Mixes well with water and milk<br/>-Overall good protein from a trusted company.
 Best stuff on market IMO...tastes great and helps me immensely IMO...definately recommend this product and it goes good with water or milk!
 I love ON's whey product's just not this vanilla flavor.<br/>I thought I was ordering banana creme, but I suppose I made a mistake when selecting the product.<br/>Do yourself a favor and stick with banana, its the best.
 On time and as described
 This is something I bought for my son, he is the one that drinks it, and really likes it. Likes the flavor and the cost is a good bargain
 I like it. nice flavor, not too much sweet.
 Great Protein. Taste GREAT! At least when mixed with skim milk.
 Nice light flavor...does have some carbs.
 This is the real deal.Good quality protein!
 Great taste, buying more today.
 Great product, fast shipping time!
 I've tried lots of proteins in the last few years and Gold Standard is a solid product.
 Most of the reviews speak on the quality of this protein, and I don't that the quality is good. The taste on the other hand is horrible! I bought a 5lb bottle (chocolate) of this in May 2015, and it's now December 2015 and I still have about half left. I only use this as my back-up when I run out of my BSN Syntha-6 protein powder. The Syntha-6 may not be as "high quality" as this one but at least it tastes delicious...lol.
 We love the taste. I haven't found an ON flavor that we didn't like.
 Excelente...
 Excelent
 What's there to say. Gold Standard is the best protein on the market.
 Tastes great and mixes well! Packed with protein and I feel amazing since adding this into my diet post-workout. Muscle definition is accelerating faster!
 Great protein powder. Tastes great.
 The best protein shake i have ever had! Also it tastes great too and that is definitely always a plus
 Works for me.
 This is a good protein, it creates a pure mass muscle and help you to recovery your muscles in a fast way for training the next day without problem if you needed to do it<br/>Highly recommended
 This product is high in protein and has great flavor which I never seen before in high protein supplements. I received the product in timely manner and it's more than I expected.
 love it
 Fast shipping and cheap price. Strawberry tastes like astronaut ice cream......
 great taste also
 Awesome!
 My son loves it
 great product
 Got mocha flavor for my first protein shake and it is not bad.
 This stuff is delicious.  The first tiny sip you get that weird protein powder taste but everything after that is ice cream bro
 Tastes like chocolate milk when in milk, doesn't completely dissolve though.
 My favorite proteins
 Tastes good with water, milk, and in recipes unlike some of the other flavors ON has to offer. Now that subscribe and save has stopped, you can easily find a better deal outside of Amazon.
 Bought this for my exercise friendly wife. She makes a shake before every workout session and she loves it  Great
 I love this protein!
 I've seen some mixed reviews on the taste of this flavor, but I find it quite good, reminiscent of darker chocolate rather than the super sweet stuff like a regular hershey's bar.<br/><br/>This whey mixes well (as I'd expect from ON) with no clumping, no hint of harsh aftertaste.<br/><br/>It's a little more expensive than whey you might get at a local big-box store, it's true, but a premium for mixability, a great selection of flavors, and a solid nutritional profile is worth it.
 Delicious and blends well. I just ordered another bag :-)
 I bought this over a year ago and still have it. I haven't been going to the gym as much as I used to when I originally bought this. It still tastes good a year later though.
 This is one of the best tasting protein powders you will find. Mixes easy in a shaker cup with just water.
 Excellent product - good flavor!
 i have been using for 8 months and you can see the difference in my body and i am 70 !
 Solid stuff. Mixes well, tastes great, and helps recovery tenfold.
 Not bad tasting, but it doesn't blend well.
 This is our go-to for getting the most out of our workouts. We always order more before we run out because it has become a necessity in our household
 High quality, if not tasty protein.
 The Vanilla Creme Whey powder tastes great and mixes well. It is my favorite protein powder. I look forward to my protein shakes!
 Probably the best tasting powder I've used. Dissolves well.
 Good staff
 You'll never get sick of this flavor.  High quality proteins too. I noticed large gains while using this product over the course of three months and I ordered a second one (Strawberry this time).
 Protein powder is never the yummiest but the flavor isn't so bad! I like to mix it with PB2 and give it a peanut buttery taste.
 The ON Mocha protein powder has to be the best tasting protein powder on the market. It truly tastes like mocha and doesn't have that nasty protein after-taste. I normally add a teaspoon of instant coffee per scoop of protein powder to give me a bit of caffeine in the mornings.
 This stuff tastes great, with water it tastes like Yoohoo, with milk it tastes like a very chocolatey chocolate milk lol. It is highly filling, and has very noticeable results, not to mention 24 grams of protein per serving, I use two scoops, so it's 48 grams of protein per serving for me, twice a day.
 What can be said, this is the best protein for the price. As far as flavors go the milk chocolate is the best.
 They taste gets boring after time but if you mix it with other things it great. I like it a lot.
 I don't like the flavor but it works well combined with cashew milk.
 my sender was great!! im looking to buying more from them very soon..<br/>OP is the best if you taking OP and your not getting stronger check your self you may not be human....
 Great!
 This is a tasty and useful product just as any optimum whey I have bought in the past. Mixes well and isn't clumpy with water or milk.
 exactly as expected - delicious
 Loved the taste..
 Mocha Cappuccino is the BEST flavor EVER!!!
 flavor is amazing
 I am a frequent customer of this protein powder. I have tried a ton of others and this one tastes the best (w/milk). Delivery is fast &amp; it is the best value for your money. I will continue to be purchase this in the future. Definitely recommend.
 very tasty -- both with water &amp; milk!
 Good quality protein, tastes amazing!!
 I have tried many different brands of protein powder and this is my favorite by far  I use this in the Magic Bullet blender, it mixes smoothly and completely every time. The chocolate flavor is good. I would order again without hesitation
 This is the only protein I will use.
 I am so impressed with how this product got here so fast with free shipping. I got a great deal, it's a great product, and I look to order again. The expiration date was still 2 years away, one of my main concerns before ordering since its a food product and it wasn't listed.
 Excellent product. Exactly as described.
 I noticed the difference almost immediately. I've been working out regularly for quite some time with pretty good results, but once I started using 100% Whey, my muscle tone became more defined with the same amount of effort. Great for muscle rebuild, a must have when you are incorporating strength building in your fitness plan.
 Best bargain for the buck
 Cleanest protein I've tried so far!
 Mixes well, tastes decent and pretty clean compared to most the stuff on the market
 Can't let the gains goblins getcha
 this is the best protein for quality/taste/price you cannot go wrong ordering this....I suggest the rich chocolate thats the best.
 Great price and tasted as good as i expected it to be. White chocolate and vanilla are the only ones I"ve tried but both are pretty good.
 Excellent protein powder, great price as well.
 It's tasty
 Best tasting protein powder out there. Hands down!
 As described!! Fast shipping great quality for the price.
 Follow simple supplement rules and enjoy mass gain with great taste.
 Amazing taste
 Great flavor, good selection, good macros.
 feeling like a champ
 Love the taste.
 Nice
 I love this stuff it's way better then the cheap stuff from Walmart and taste great.
 Great flavor and mixes better than others that I've tried.
 Great quality product. It mixes well, barely clumps, and the protein brings some gains. The only conceivable reason that it does not earn my 5th star, is my personal dislike of this flavor. It was manageable, but just not my cup of tea. I would recommend this product wholeheartedly.
 okkkkkkk
 Tastes good.
 Classic...!!
 Ok, I'm a big fan of optimum nutrition, but the bag it comes in is AWFUL.  First off, the bag was delivered with a tear right down the middle that I had to duck tape.  I'm not sure what caused it, but if it's handling this much powder, it should be more durable material.<br/><br/>And the #1 reason why I will never buy this product again is the zipper on the bag.  From day 1, the zipper would not close the bag, and would take me fiddling around with it multiple times to get it to work.  Tonight the zipper flew off the bag and now I don't have a way to seal the bag. WTF Optimum Nutrtion?!  The other bags I've boughten used to be snap bags, not sure why they moved away from that, but what they currently use is not working.  I regret purchasing this and DO NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE!!!
 This is one of the better tasting why protein mixes I have had. The coconut adds a flavor that helps the protein go down better. I would recommend this flavor to those who are bored of the regular chocolate flavor. Plus Optimum is a great whey protein brand. I have been using their protein since 2006 (off and on) and have always seen gains.
 Too expensive
 The best protein in my opinion, doesn't upset my stomach and tastes great
 I am happy with this product.  Tastes good and provides quality protein.
 The best protein for my money. I always purchase cake batter because it's so versatile. I add it to cereal,yogurt,pancakes,muffins. I'm so hooked on the taste. Plus great gains in the gym.
 muy bueno
 Great stuff!
 This product used to be available for subscribe and save and now Amazon has canceled that.  It's hard to go from paying $38 to $50.  I'll be looking for a cheaper alternative.
 Gold Stardard Whey is a great protein powder. However, the strawberry is absolutely terrible. I gave it 4 stars based on the qaulity of the protein. -1 for flavor. It mixes very well.
 I've been an user of Optimum Whey Protein for years.  It's great tasting and mixes well.
 Great product
 tastes really good
 Tried to order the same kind as before and got a different kind that taste terrible.
 This is probably the best whey I have tried from ON. I have also had double choco, and strawberries &amp; bananas; I prefer Extreme choco cause its not as sweet as the other two.
 So far so good
 I use this product for after workout nutrition and for lunch at work.  I'm not trying to bulk up, just trying to maintain physic.  With sitting all day long behind a desk, this has been a great product to help maintain a constant weight.
 Have been using this exact brand &amp; type for last 5-6 yrs. Its what it is- Pure Whey. Blends well and I almost always get chocolate flavor. I like that one better.
 Tastes great.<br/>24g per 120cal.<br/>Price is OK.
 I bought the Mocha Cappuccino and it is really good, can't tell the protein powders taste and it is not so sweet.<br/>For me the Double Chocolate is just too sweet. It keeps me full which makes me snacking less! Also, I tried some protein drink before and they made my tummy upset. This ON Whey doesn't do that, so far I'm happy with this product.
 Low carb and mixes easily. Love it
 Great tasting and great mixing! I got the rich chocolate and it's just like a milk shake. Mixes real well in a blender bottle.
 it's optimum nutrition's 100% whey protein .<br/>it's a great basic protein shake .<br/>can't ask for more . .
 I love it!!!
 Good stuff, good buy. Makes hitting the days protein intake worry free. Also in terms of protein/$, this is one of the cheapest sources (with a trusted label) I have found.
 There are various whey protein supplements that i've experimented with but Optimum Nutrition is my go to.  The 5 pound tubs lasts me for a month, would last longer if I didn't consume multiple scoops a day!  I like the taste of this product and it dissolve pretty good when stirred nicely.
 Huge Bottle.
 The white chocolate is okay at first but it begins to lose its appeal after you've had a lot of it. Make sure whatever flavor you get its one that you'll enjoy for 2 months or more. Very good for weight loss and muscle building!!
 Excellent as an addition to almond milk.  Great taste.  Easily to digest.
 Love this Whey Protein, mixes well with water and taste great.
 Mixes real easy and tastes great.  One of the better protein powders on the market.  Easy to digest too.  Oh yea
 Good purchase
 This stuff really tastes great, i was very surprised. Great value.
 Doctor prescribed for temporary healing aid. Tasted so good that I continued to take it as a meal replacement. It mixes fine, but I highly recommend an immersion blender. It adds air, giving it the texture of a light and creamy milk shake.<br/><br/>This review is double chocolate, but I have tried and enjoyed coconut chocolate too. Looking forward to trying others.
 Great product at an unheard cost , a home run for me
 White Chocolate tastes great.
 This has a decent flavor but a little sweet for me.  I sometimes add a  little unsweetened cocoa powder to give it a deeper flavor.  Easy to mix, low in carbs.  Add extra flavorings to mix it up, peppermint, rasberrry crystal lite, good instant coffee crystals for mocha.  Enjoy
 good
 Good stuff
 got tired of the taste pretty fast. and it started having was i can only describe as a sore throat feeling.
 Great taste great results
 great product
 best price.
 Great tasting protein! One of the best!
 Love this protein. Great taste, cooks well and great macros
 thanks
 The flavor is really bad. I tried it with milk, and I couldn't even stomach it
 super fast shipping by amazon, and the product is great!  Love the taste and it works
 tastes awesome, mixes well, high quality, and economical.
 Pure and simple.
 I've been buying this stuff regularly for the past 5 yrs (every other month) and love it. Tastes good, great source of protein, and easy on the stomach.
 Awesome whey protein for starters!
 Helped me gain 10 pounds.
 The standard for whey protein.
 Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard protein is s great protein that is worth the price.  Vanilla Ice Cream is the best flavor.
 Ordered this flavor and it is just delicious. The first one I tried was the Extreme Milk Chocolate and I have to say that the Banana Cream and that are my favorite. Its even better when its mixed!! By far the BEST protein powder I have used. :)<br/><br/>My first order actually didn't arrive. I was confused because I had two different tracking info's for different carriers and one said it was delivered. I wrote the company asking about my package and they IMMEDIATELY responded and send a new jug of protein to me at no additional shipping cost with absolutely NO problem. Now THAT is what I call customer service.<br/><br/>Will buy again!
 Tastes great and dissolves well.
 Overpriced for what it is
 Good as always.
 I bought quite a few buckets of this flavor. Somehow the last bucket tastes weird and plain.
 Great flavor and tastes really good.
 Great portion size, excellent taste.
 I've tried almost every single brand of protein out there, and this is by far the best one. It mixes perfectly with water or milk (never clumps and there's never a need for a metal ball whisk). My favorite is the double rich chocolate flavor
 not too good
 Great protein powder!<br/>Been using for months and am getting the results I need, muscle growth!
 Bought for a friend. Always consistently good product
 Use it almost every morning!
 My favorite protein source - the Double Rich Chocolate is tasty, easy to prepare and an all 'round good value for money. A great way to start your day or end a workout.
 the taste is so boring
 I LOVE this stuff/ 3 scoops in one small shaker and it tastes like heaven.
 Here's the best combination drink to consume during P90X strength exercises. I found and tried this formula today, and there is nothing tastier and better to support your muscles strength:<br/><br/>1.<br/>- 2 measurement caps of <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Optimum-Nutrition-100-Whey-Gold-Standard-Double-Rich-Chocolate-5-Pound/dp/B000QSNYGI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard, Double Rich Chocolate, 5 Pound</a><br/>- 1 measurement cap of <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Perpetuem-Sports-Drink-Mix-by-Hammer-Nutrition/dp/B001DCO32U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Perpetuem Sports Drink Mix by Hammer Nutrition</a><br/><br/>2. Mix it into 12-16 fl. oz water bottle  ...]<br/>3. Drink and enjoy.
 Great product
 It's really big bottle!
 Good product.
 Vanilla is very bland, good for smoothies, too bland to drink by itself. I Will be buying chocolate next time.
 Delicious flavor mixes extremely well and great price
 Good
 Been using ON for years, always my go to.
 I am not a chocolate person. And, this coffee flavor tastes great.
 good
 Meh
 Great consistency, great flavor even with water
 Great stuff
 Good supplement to build muscles, no fat.
 The chocolate used to taste good. Now it's kind of bitter.
 This is the best tasting, easiest mixing, highest quality whey protein on the market. Optimum Nutrition makes the best products in the industry. This is their best whey product.
 Best protein powder I've tried
 I buy 5lbs a month. Love this protein! Really tastes good.
 Only brand i use so far. I got vanilla and it taste great while not being too strong. Nothing i can complain about here.
 The overall product here is great. I have always been a fan of Optimum Nutrition products. I recently purchases some 100% Casein Protein from ON as well and love it.<br/><br/>The ONLY problem i have with the product i bought is the flavor. There are a lot of supplements out there with gag-inducing flavors, its nothing new. I unfortunately got a flavor that tastes awful in my opinion. I got the "French Vanilla Creme"  flavor and can barely stomach it....<br/><br/>But dont let my dislike of the flavor stop you though, this product (and all ON products in my opinion) are fantastic!! This is just a warning to make sure you pick a flavor you can like. I got the 5lb tub and have only had a few servings of it due to this. If you are unsure of a flavor to try then maybe just get the smaller tub first to make sure you enjoy it. I have had good flavored protein from ON in the past, it does exist. The Casein protein i got from ON is Cookies-n-Cream and its delicious, so there is definitely a flavor out there for everyone!<br/><br/>Over-all, wonderful product and i highly recommend it. Just be careful when picking a flavor.
 Taste= 10/10-- Haven't tasted a better protein yet.<br/>Texture= 9/10-- a little chalky but have had much worse.<br/>Results=n/a, will let everyone know in a month or two.
 Ive tried many other kinds and will be sticking with this from now on. The chocolate, vanilla, and cookies and cream flavors specifically.
 Get it ur gains will thank you "Thank You". "Your welcome gains"
 cookies in cream bomb dot com but i traded my protein for dumbbells lol
 This product was recommended by my brother and sister in law.  It blends well and actually tastes good.  If you need extra sweetness, you can add some Stevia.
 Double Chocolate tastes alright but a little fake. Ice cream tastes pretty good. Mixes great with liquids and oatmeal.
 Great product. Love the flavor.
 works great!
 Great value and great protein. Highly recommended.
 great protein I feel full before my workouts without feeling sick to my stomach when I work out hard.
 I've been using Optimum whey for years and they have always tasted great. This last tub I bought from Amazon (5lb double rich chocolate) has a weird taste. It tastes like powdered plastic. The smell is fine. I can even taste the chemical flavor when mixed with a banana and peanut butter. I bought a smaller tub from a local store and that one tastes like it should. I'm weary about getting this whey from Amazon from now on. Unfortunately my return window just closed.
 great! love it :)
 I have always been a fan of Optimum nutrition's protein powder, but I wanted something more natural. So I mistakenly bought hemp protein powder, it may have been "healthier" but it tasted like I was on fear factor every time I drunk some<br/><br/>I just bought vanilla ice cream because it was $10 cheaper than plain vanilla<br/><br/>I am very pleased with the vanilla ice cream. I thought it might taste like fake vanilla flavoring, but instead it tastes like a well polished vanilla with hints of vanilla bean
 Best whey protein. The flavor is amazing.
 Great product!
 Great chocolate flavor and it is not grainy whatsoever.
 Love it , easily digestible
 I love the taste!
 This product has a great taste.  I mix it with skim milk and I have it for breakfast.  The chocolate flavor is good, too!
 I think this is the best
 Great tasting whey protein.
 1 cup skim/silk milk, 3/4 frozen banana, 4 ice cubes, 1 scoop of whey in a blender, and you have an awesome chocolate banana milk shake.
 Great stuff. I do like the hydro whey better however.
 Great. ALways will continue using this
 EDIT: Have also discovered dead gnats within the protein powder... Not a ton, but a good 10-20 or so. Free extra protein? :/ Terrific.<br/><br/>This is by far the worst tasting protein powder I've ever had. I literally have to gag it down every time. No matter what I do. Mix it with water, milk, juice, fix it in the blender with frozen fruits and water... It still overpowers the drink/smoothie and makes it taste awful. Thank God I'm almost out... I ordered this product because it was such a good deal, and I figured it can't be that bad... Well, I was wrong. Lesson learned, I will certainly never buy a large quantity of a product I'm unfamiliar with like this again, no matter how good the deal may seem.<br/><br/>The one "good" thing about it (bad in my case...) is that it seems to last a long time. Though, this can probably be attributed to me not wanting to eat it. I'm drinking a glass of it right now, and I'm reminded of the familiar sensation of feeling like I'm going to throw-up after each sip. I've never had this feeling with any other food/product in my life.<br/><br/>I don't recommend it.
 it's not full of flavor but the price is right and it gets the job done. my only issue is that it sticks to everything the spoon the glass the blender so i wonder how much i lose that way other protiens don't always do that.
 I have tried many flavors of Whey Protein but don't ever try the Banana flavor; taste like medicine
 I have been switching through different proteins and have finally settled on this as my main product until I find something else.  The taste is great and it is very easy to drink, doesn't get all clumped up.
 Exactly what I was hoping for.
 This is my go to protein for the great mix of price and quality.  The taste isn't too too strong and mixes very well into smoothies and water.  I generally use it two - three times a day 4-5 times a week.  I've been noticing gains with the protein and I think that it is a solid entry level protein.  There are proteins out there with higher quality protein (i.e. whey isolate as opposed to whey concentrate) but they are much pricier.  This option is reliable and tasty... but not delicious (-1 star)
 Perfect
 great product. Taste is about as good as it gets for such a lean blend.
 IT ON protein. Enough said!!
 Not a bad product. I would go with 30g protein instead of 24g.
 Just got it and not at all disappointed in the taste.
 This is one of the best products on the market.  Got it for my husband &amp; he uses it all the time..
 This protein is great, I love it... The Vanilla Ice Cream flavor is so good, its not too sweet or overpowering... I don't get tired of the flavor.
 Tastes great mixes easy
 Keeps buying this product
 Before purchasing the strawberry banana flavor, I had a 5lb tub of double chocolate. After a good two weeks with the strawberry banana, I still like it, but it's getting old pretty fast.<br/><br/>For now on I think I'll be looking for simple ome-flavor protein powders. They're much easier to mix with other ingredients in a blender.
 This  is a great product, great price, great flavor. Anyone who likes chocolate will love this flavor. Will buy again.
 This is a great tasting product. I usually have some after each workout, but also when I'm short on time for a meal.
 Great price and quality
 See my many other reivews on ON.<br/>All i will ever buy!
 nice product, the collors are nice and i really enjoy. hight quality product. not so cheap but i love it.
 Tastes good, good for you, and cheap for what it is. Great protein for cutting.
 Excellent product!
 GREAT - LOVE IT!
 As stated.  Tastes good.  Mixes easy.
 My go to whey protein
 The flavor is great, and the quality is as well.  Great mixability and the best protein product I've ever used.
 Rocky Road is a little bit on the sweet side, but it's ON Whey, some of the best stuff you can get. Double Rich Chocolate is what I had before, and I liked that really subdued flavor.
 Love it!
 Have been using it for two years,,,very good product.
 With the help of this protein power, my body is in the best shape of my life.  I will continue to buy.
 Doesn't mix as well as other ON Gold powders I've had.
 Its a really good protein. I only wish they had a unflavored version of it.
 I was very excited to get this product. Love cookies and cream. I had my first scoop on top of oatmeal with Almond Milk. It was so good and I was so happy to get this UNTIL I looked into the ingredients and saw those evil words HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP!!!! REALLY!!! How do you put that garbage in a "healthy" product? That totally disappointed me. I was going to return it but it is such a pain to do that. So, lesson learned!!  What's the lesson?  OK, if you are a little slow, ALWAYS know what ingredients are being put into your health supplements before you get buyers remorse!!
 This is my favorite ON protein so far.  I've tried soy, egg, casein natural, aftermax and I like this one best so far.<br/><br/>Good service from the shipper too.
 As far as I'm concerned, 99% of protein powders are the same and you know exactly what you're getting by reading the label-- that being said, compared to other ON flavors, I've found this to be the best tasting and most mixable.
 Flavor is utterly disgusting.
 As described.  Get huge.
 Bought the 5 lb. jar before.  Like the savings of buying the 10 lb bag, plus it's lasting.  Mixes well with milk and the chocolate tastes good.
 Good flavor! No complaints!
 Good stuff, shipped fast
 Awesome product. Tastes amazing.
 The gold standard of whey protein. Been buying it for years and won't buy anything else.
 By far my favorite flavor.
 This is for Cookies and Cream but have seen similar issues from others with other flavors.<br/><br/>They changed the formula and it no longer tastes as good as it used to.<br/><br/>Easily 5* to 2*<br/><br/>#sadpanda
 tastes great and mixes well without clumping up as much as other proteins that I have tried. I have gained 5 lbs in a month using this and not an inch around my waist
 Good product at a good prices.  Search around the web and locally and got the best price here.  This is a good powder.  Tastes good and dissolves decent.  No clumping.  Have mixed with milk and water and both work fine.
 Great source of protein and tastes delicious
 One of the BEST tasting protein powders on the market (in my opinion).  I've used this as a healthy alternative to coffee.  I have a scoop with almond milk, ice, and french vanilla creamer.  I take it almost every morning after my workout.  Optimum Nutrition, unlike a lot of other protein companies, doesn't put a lot of extra stuff in their protein powders.  Just read the ingredients and you'll see that it's very clean.  Finally, the tub was very fresh with a long time before it expires.  I've previously used BodyBuilding.com but the prices and quality is just as good on Amazon.  I always procrastinate on ordering so the 2-day shipping helps get it fast.
 Tastes good !
 Cake batter is one of my favorite ice cream/gelato flavors and I've tried several differents types and brands. With that being said, ON's cake batter flavor completely missed it's mark in my opinion. Getting this flavor prior to having sampled it was already a gamble, but I thought it would be good based on others positive reviews and my sweet tooth for cake batter ice cream. I've noticed that ON's protein powders have a strong scent to them and could smell the cake batter odor as soon as I cracked the lid on it. It stank! I thought maybe it was something in the shipping box that smelled, but then i fully opened the tub lid and took a whiff. Smelled quite repulsive and totally artificial. I decided to give it a try right there and mixed in a single scoop with water. Somehow it smells even worse after mixing. I nearly gagged on the smell when I went to drink it. Smelled like someone left water sitting in the mixing bowl for a month and then poured it into my cup. To my surprise the taste was actually much worse than the smell, however it tasted more like watery butter than cake batter to me (mixed one scoop with 6oz water). I managed to finish the shake and called Amazon right after to request a return/refund. My stomach felt somewhat queasy after that. So I'll be sending it back and ordering the double rich chocolate flavor, which I have tasted before and is pretty good.<br/><br/>Quality of the powder seemed very good. Very fine and soft, not grainy. Mixes effortlessly with water and comes out smooth. 5/5 for quality of the powder but 1/5 due to horrendous flavor. I'd suggest you avoid this flavor unless you have the opportunity to sample it first.
 Great product!
 This is the best protein around!
 The "Delicious Strawberry" product tastes too much like Pepto-Bismol.  Not that I don't like Pepto-Bismol but that is for when you are sick, not well.  It makes it hard to drink for me.  Also the body of the product seems inconsistent for me when prepared either in a blender or shaker.  I am not really sure about this but it just seems that there are portions that are more viscous, almost like lumps, but not quite.<br/><br/>As far as the nutrition effects of this product I am unable to say.
 Awesome product, doesn't clump, great price.
 Great product
 love it pure whey
 I found this works very well especially when used with cassien protein from ON. One scoop of each 4 times a day helps with muscle gain.
 Quality whey protein that tastes great.
 Over 5 years with this product, good price.
 Nice flavor! Mixes so easily hands down has to be one of the best if not the best protein out there!
 Great taste with water. I take several meds with my stack but it appears to be work in combination with them. Quick delivery.
 I saved so much money and this product is great my kids love it i will definetly purchase more in a heartbeat
 The taste is pretty good. For a protein shake it is pretty darn tasty and really fills you up if you have to miss a real meal or a great after workout recovery.
 this stuff is great and tastes delicious!
 Lighting Fast Shipping!!<br/>Taste could be a little better but mixed really well, with out any clumps.<br/>Far from tasting like rocky road .
 It works as described.
 good source for protein
 I have been trying out different protein powders for a while now and ON (Optimum Nutrition) is the one i keep coming back to. After almost a year and a half of using only the dark chocolate I finally switched to the Strawberry and Banana flavor. I have to say it is pretty tasty. I mix only with water (8oz) and use a blender bottle and it comes out fairly good. It does contain super small chunks if not properly shaken for at least a minute I found but this can also vary based on the type of blender bottle you have.<br/><br/>My only complaint on the flavor is the banana is very powerful and has a more banana laffy taffy flavor than a natural banana flavor. Adding in some ice and non-fat yogurt makes this an awesome smoothie :)
 Everything I remember it to be. It tastes goos and works as a meal
 first time using this protein. have seen great results so far. will buy again for sure.
 Taste is on point. Haven't tried with water but is amazing with milk. We'll see how the results go in a few months
 Excellent!
 Great product!
 great
 very good taste
 Yummy
 Tastes great! Love this one.
 Always solid purchase for good cheap protein powder.
 yum
 Taste so good and I love the recovery feeling!
 I use this protein all the time for post workout and in smoothies. Blends very well and tastes good! I've gotten the double chocolate and French vanilla.<br/><br/>5 lb container option is great!
 Love the taste. Great product.
 I have used Optimum Nutrition Protein for many years.  It's made in the USA and does not contain a lot of fillers like the other companies.  I have tried many of the flavors and all of them taste great.  I have also found that Optimum Nutrition has the best serving/cost ratio to other quality proteins products on the market which makes it the best buy for me.  I used to order from various supplement stores, but the shipping costs usually kill you.  Using Amazon Prime, I have found I can get a better price and with free shipping it seals the deal.  I've tried Strawberry, Banana Creme, Cookies and Creme, and Double Chocolate.  All of them taste great!
 Mixes well, tastes great even with just water. Good way to supplement your protein macros.
 Im a newbie. Item arrived as ordered. Tastes great.
 Highest quality powder and best option to buy. Its on the pricier side of protein powders but is hands down the best flavoring and mixes better than any other powders.
 Mom! The Protein! Great Taste
 This is my go to.
 I'm still weak but its tasty
 I really enjoy the taste of this and it gets the job done.
 just what i expected
 This is my first jar of Optimum Nutrition Whey and it is by far the best I have found in whey protein's in terms of taste , effectiveness , solubility.<br/><br/>Taste: Extreme Milk Chocolate taste's good with 8-10 oz of water,more than that its nothing but you're drinking powder with water without any taste. It taste's superb with 8-10 oz of milk and if you are looking for gaining weight,going with milk is best!<br/><br/>Effectiveness: Previously I used to lift 25lb on bench press with some difficulties and within two weeks of taking this. I lifted 40lb on bench press comfortably,so you can see how effective this is. I can also see myself pushing to the limits which I did not do earlier.<br/><br/>Solubility: If you use a shaker like Blender Bottle I think you wont face any issue's of lumping while mixing with water or milk. I have used both a blender bottle and contigo water bottle for making protein shakes within 15-20 sec,my shake was ready without any lumps.<br/><br/>UPDATE: I am increasing the ratings for this review. I have been consistenly using this protein for nearly a year and have seen good amount of gains in short period of time. My recommendation is to consume it with water post workout to see maximum gains or maximum results. Post-workout is suggested as muscle repair requires protein intake and with water makes the consumption in the body as quickly as possible.
 This is a great product. I have been using this since 2011 and it has worked wonders.
 This stuff is good for you and taste good too!
 The Coffee tastes just like bryers coffee icecream, very delicious, it mixes just as promised even with just a spoon. Best bang for your buck, shipped fast, properly sealed, beats advocare protein.<br/>If You're looking for a protein mix and debating on this and others, buy this in any flavor. Optimum Nutrition did an excellent job, which is proven by winning numerous awards. Just get it.
 Taste is very nice specially if you mix it with orange juice
 We have bought this before and love it.  We are seniors so this is a good boost for us and lots of protein
 Great whey for a great price!
 The best protein powder I have tried.
 If you are a fan of Gold Standard banana cream flavor, this is a great price.
 Great taste
 Excelente
 It holds up to its name.  Most flavors are rather tolerable as well.
 Not the greatest tasting stuff in the world.
 Tastes great with just some almond milk and mixes almost completely just by shaking
 Its good taste and good quality.
 the best one!
 1.It taste's great<br/>2.Mixes easily<br/>3.Good price for a QUALITY product<br/>4.It WORKS!<br/>5.Try it you'll like it &lt;&gt; Mikie does
 I love this protein.  I've seen great results with it.  I know some people complain that it's expensive, but you get what you pay for.  Buy this!!
 Tastes terrible don't get it if you're looking for flavor
 ON always has legit stuff.  The Gold Standard Whey is their bread and butter and its just awesome.  If you are looking to put on a little more size I would get the Pro Gainer product, mixes just as well as whey but with more calories.
 best nutrition specs, best price, descent taste
 Good flavor and variety, competitive price.
 Great taste
 Researched this product before buying and it got high ratings for taste, they were all RIGHT. Everything else is as stated, good product.
 It isn't bad, but drink it with MILK AND NOT WATER! Water it isn't that good for me, milk is a lot better.
 It didn't mix well
 Very tasty
 Nom!
 Good product taste good and good price triple G
 This is a highly  rated protein source  at an excellent price
 Great product.  Been using it for 3 years, not planning to change.
 OK first let me start off by saying I've been messing with these flavors for years. chocolate, double rich chocolate, Vanilla, cookies and cream..... UGGGGHHHHHHH they make me sick just thinking about them now. So I read some reviews online and found that people were saying the banana cream mixes better and masks the whey taste you get with some of the others.<br/><br/>I jumped in and ordered it...... WOW it mixes easily and taste sooo good if you like bananas like me this is a no brainier.
 I wasn't sure I would like whey but I have found I do like this particular flavor. I use it in smoothies and to really loose weight drink it in water.
 Great cake batter flavor for the fat kid inside of your muscley body.
 I moved from the Six-Star brand at Walmart to this one. I prefer this one's taste.
 This powder does not taste great with just water...but really, who cares about the taste if the results are there? My girlfriend, last night, told me I was looking "swole". Sounds like it's working.
 Amazing product!
 The best.
 Ok flavour, very good for the price.
 This stuff is freakin delicious
 Outstanding products
 Awesome taste and fulfills daily protein needs.
 great price and we also had a discount to use
 muy bueno excelente 100% recomendable.
 Mixes easily and tastes great.
 The number 1 seller for a reason. It tastes great
 Taste great with milk
 This is item was easy to use.... best used when combined with other ON products... I would recommend this item to any body....
 Tasty!
 Great flavor and fits perfect with my Macros. Continue to order ON, now to just try the many flavors they offer.
 Taste great.  Low calories
 IT as exactly as described, best quality and service. I recommend to anyone that wants 100% of what they are paying for.
 Just great, nothing else to add
 By far the best tasting protein powder on the market
 Received as expected and now I can stay away from local supplement stores for awhile.  a long while.  Happy with purchase.
 Per its label, this whey protein is a better quality than those of comparable price, but a bit more expensive. It's taste, however, is not as good. Since function is more important to me, this is my choice.
 I am new to body building and this is a nice, mid-grade, quality protein that I have researched and received recommendations on. It mixes nicely in a shaker and the flavor is impressive!
 Not a lot of flavor.
 The rocky road flavor is delicious whether you mix it with water or milk. I usually get sick of protein powders within a month of using it, but I haven't gotten sick of this one!
 Great taste, pretty much no carb, pure protein. Love it.
 My default flavor and brand.  Tastes great.
 Best deal I've ever found amazing protein highly recommend
 My husband and I love the quality of this powder and the way it mixes.  Awesome taste, texture and price.
 Works great and love Optimum Nutrition products.
 Great stuff, I have gotten very good results with this product. First Whey protein I have ever liked mixed with water.
 Taste great and easy to mix
 great product and service
 Vanilla ice cream goes great with strawberries, banana, and peanut butter.  Or all three!
 Exactly as advertised, good price - fast shipment
 10 years later, I'm still using this brand of protein.
 This is a very good product. It tastes quite good actually and has a good amount of protein. A real milkshake tastes better but this has no sugar and lots of protein. Worth it!
 I love this flavor, definitely the best tasting whey I've tried so far. Almost more of a mocha flavor then white chocolate but really good none the less.
 Very high in protein, tastes great. I add a heaping tablespoon to my cereal in the morning to add 10 grams of protein.
 Thank you!
 This is one of the better tasting whey mixes I have bought. My recommendation is to buy two different flavors at once, so you can mix it up though and not get tired of one flavor over the time it takes you to go through five pounds.
 Great Product!  Arrived exactly as expected, high quality.
 Mixes well, very strong chocolate flavor, a little too bitter for me, kind of like dark chocolate. I got the double rich chocolate, so I guess I got what I was asking for.
 I have to work out!
 I at the stage in life where I can't live without this chocolate protein powder. It is delicious and the powder dissolves easily in milk. We were getting this protein powder in a bag which is easier to manage. The 5-pound containers are humongous. So we poured the powder into an empty bag. I notice when I consume this I'm much stronger at the gym. When I don't take it, even for a week, I become weak and can't lift the same amounts of weight as before. Even eating protein does not work as well as this powder. So you could say I'm a believer. Nice to be able to have it delivered right to my door.<br/><br/>~The Rebecca Review
 Best!
 I think this protein powder has supplemented well w/ me better than Six Star and other protein powders.  It has a great taste (Extreme Milk Chocolate) and I love buying the bigger 5lb containers because they seem to last longer than others (~72 servings).  I shall purchase a-gain!! ;)
 Good product and price.
 NIce!!!
 I have always used ON as my source of protein. I love it and I see results!
 Cake is gross but it is drinkable
 Excellent product and delivery time thanks
 It seems Optimum Nutrition (ON) has fixed its prices across all vendors at $52.99 for 5 lbs.  So now you can't even shop around for it.  I know all protein has gone up in price do the fact that big food companies are now in the market to add this protein to their products.  I must concede ON, probably has the best pure protein on the market.  However, their higher prices has forced me into shopping other brands.  ON is 79% protein per serving, the highest of any I have calculated.  But others come in at 74% and 73%.  That's only about 7% more protein for about 20% more in price.  It's just not worth it to me.  I wish they would at least get back into the subscription program.  That would get me back on board 100%.
 High quality protein, mixes well and tastes great.
 I like alot taste is good no issues arrived on time. Just purchased Strawberrie Bannana. Will continue to purchase ON Gold
 There were no problems with the product, I think it's just what I wanted, everything was accurately described by the seller.
 Quality - BEST!<br/><br/>-1 star for shitly chocolate taste...<br/>ON - make something, you taste like drugs!
 i bought this because i needed to gain weight and this is perfect. it a lot of protein along with bcaas
 I got it for $97. It's great value for money compared to other brands &amp; vendors. Taste is alright - I used to have some extremely overpriced GNC vanilla whey that tasted incredible so it's hard to compare the two. Taste is similar to chocolate milk.
 its ok
 To die for flavor!
 There is a reason why it's the gold standard. Good taste, no chalkiness, mixes well. What else is there to say
 love this flavor, not too sweet not too bland
 Great flavor
 Taste like watered down YooHoo which is pretty good. Not chalky.
 I've been sticking with Gold Standard Whey for years now because it tastes great and has some of the best ratios for calories/carbs/protein out there.
 Double chocolate tastes great.
 Good Product , Good results. So far i have tried 3 flavours (cake batter , Milk Choclate, vanilla)all were good.
 Just as expected
 I love optimum nutrition Im not a very serious bodybuilder but I do workout and use this after every workout. Dissolves easily into water and taste ok. I don't really care for taste though.
 The best whey protein
 Item arrived much faster than expected. I was pleasantly surprised by how promptly these guys shipped the stuff.  Will definitely do business with these guys again :-)
 Product as expected.
 Tastes great and I love the energy it gives me. I was having some stomach problems and this has helped a lot.
 Great product
 Used for years!
 Good flavor and mixes well
 Great flavor and as always with ON it mixes very good
 Great product. Great taste. Doesn't have that usual gritty taste as most protein powders do after mixing.
 best tasting banana
 They manage to give you a good price per serving and you can see results in about 2 weeks. I consider a great deal compared to the prices of all the other proteins out there and it really helps you out with you want nice lean muscles.
 Super delicious. Try it with some peanut butter and cream. Good to go
 Great price for what you get.  Much better than being forced to pay a high price at GNC after buying the Gold Card.<br/><br/>Product works real well and tastes good.
 I use this in the morning instead of eating, it helps cut down on time to get ready and it's cheaper.
 Tastes really good.
 I hope it will help me to build my muscle. I like this size cause it's more reasonable.
 Best taste, mixes well.  I use two scoops per drink.
 The taste is good and easy in digestion.
 Great
 Bought for my son. He loves. Great price.
 good way  to get protein
 I use this every day. Helps me with my energy and gets me going in the morning. I recommend it.
 I have tried other protein powders but this is the best tasting.  It mixes well in water or almond milk.
 awful taste
 Great stuff. Better than syntha because you get more protein per scoop and less extra carbs, fats, etc. My first switch from syntha and it was totally worth it.
 Quality product....great taste...easily mixes
 It tastes like pretty standard vanilla. I was imagining it would taste like Funfetti cake mix...guess that's too good to be true!
 I got the mocha cappuccino flavor, 2 to 2 and half scoops in a 28 oz blender bottle, fill to top with cold milk and shake! Does wonders! Tastes like Starbucks literally!
 fine
 always the best
 It tastes good, mixes well, and I feel confident about its performance. The Double Chocolate mixed with milk is my recovery drink of choice.
 Very competitive price and super fast delivery!
 Just the best out there.  Need to re-stock soon
 After the first day i could tell a big difference in my recovery. I have been taking this while doing p90 for 2 weeks and feel like it has speed up my metabolism. The taste is great. It taste just like the powdered hot chocolate mix. I drink one in the morning with milk and one post workout with water. There are other brands i have tried and they all have a medicine taste this product does not at all. it cost a little more than other brands but the taste is well worth it.
 The best tasting protein I've had. I feel like I've lost weight and leaned up a lot since taking this every morning for breakfast and post workout.
 Good for our low carb diet
 very nice
 GOOD
 It tastes really good but It does not mix well at all. I won't buy it again.
 You can wash your clothes on my abs because of this product.  LOVE IT!
 Rocky road is their best flavor.
 best value
 You can't beat the flavor.
 GOOD DEAL
 Great product!
 Greta quality, a little pricey though.
 I had little size before using but after I definitely saw change. My shoulders got bigger and my body overall got more jacked. I'm happy
 Quite frankly the best tasting whey on the market. I've tried almost every flavor, but just tried cake batter for the first time. It's phenomenal. Tastes great in milk, water, and mixed with fruit.
 Good stuff!
 Got exactly as you ordered. 5lb of whey protein. Only complaint is that they use too big of container. There a lot of air in it. Just seems like its a huge bin for nothing.
 As a vegetarian (not vegan), supplementing my protein intake is essential. After trying various makers, I have found ON to suit me the best.
 My review is based solely on the taste of the ON Cookies and Cream Whey.<br/><br/>Mixing: I use a big glass and a large spoon and stir. No clumps!<br/><br/>With milk - It tastes great, like a vanilla milk shake. I find myself looking forward to my pre/post workout shake.<br/><br/>With water - It tastes bad! I find myself using a chug technique just to get it down. I dread my protein shakes when I am cutting calories and remove milk from my diet.
 The product itself is great, the taste is a little off.
 Mixes well with water.  Double Double Chocolate tastes great
 I have the Chocolate Malt, the Chocolate Mint and the Mocha Cappuccino. The Mint Chocolate tastes pretty good to me. It reminds me a lot of cheap hot chocolate mix, which is to say, it isn't amazing, but it is fairly tasty and made with milk, becomes quite good. The Mocha Cappuccino tastes a lot like those International Delight coffees - really fake. It's drinkable, but I wouldn't buy it again. The Malt is probably my favorite. Made with milk it really does taste a lot like a chocolate malt. It's the one I will be sure and buy again.
 Tasty mixed with water or milk.
 BEST deal I've ever found on 100% Whey protein powder, but unfortunately the seller is no longer in business. Great product, but too costly (for me) at full price.
 the best whey i have ever taken
 ALWAYS PURCHASING THIS!
 I like the large container because I get more servings for my money. The taste is good and dissolves in liquid easily.
 Best value
 This protein is perfect with its content and flavor.  I switched from Syntha 6 and i had to notice the contents are better and the prices are not too far from eachother.
 Taste is ok.  Was looking for something low cal so it's great in that respect.  Price per gram of protein is very good.  I mix it with Nlarge2 and it tastes great then.
 My wife and I love it!<br/>We use it as a meal substitute in the AM.<br/>Mix with frozen strawberries and you're set!
 Great taste (rocky road) and not much more than the nasty junk from Walmart that gives whey a bad name. Soreness is even down after a hard workout
 Best Deal around for quality whey protein, good taste blends well. Price per serving is hard to beat with this product
 good
 taste great. mixes very easily. You don't even need a shaker bottle. I put them in my plastic water bottle and shake for 10 seconds. Mixes right in
 Love all the flavors. Best nutrition for the value!
 Easy to mix, tastes good!
 a taste what i Iike.
 Out of the all proteins I've had this one tastes the best.
 This and strawberry banana are the best tasting proteins out there. so delicious and refreshing. results depend on you however.
 Great taste, mixes well
 Love this stuff. Tastes like a chocolate shake. Good supply of protein. I drink 8 ounces before workout and 8 ounces after.
 best bang for protein dollar taste great mixes easy
 Probably the best tasting and most effective dairy-based protein whey I've used. Excellent stuff!
 Got the mocha cappucino flavor, it tastes pretty good to me, but your results may vary.<br/>I use a wide-mouth container that has a little spiral metal ball that helps mix the powder. The powder mixes very well with water (I use about 4 oz. with one scoop). I've found that this product mixes far better than other similar products. I also used the Muscle Milk powder and I've never been able to get it to totally mix with any type of liquid except with a blending machine, which is loud and inconvenient.<br/><br/>This stuff mixes well, no lumps/chunks/anything else that makes you want to gag first thing in the morning.
 Very good tasting, very good results. It is part of a total fitness foundation to rebuild my 'temple' for the life I lead.
 a product that truly lives up to its name... one of the best whey proteins on the market!
 Was what I wanted, good taste.
 Cake batter flavor is delicious.
 Excellent product. ill buy again.
 Nutritionals are easy since they are clearly stated on the label, but having never tasted a whey supplement before, I didn't know what to expect taste-wise from a artificially sweetened vs. a more natural product. So I bought two tubs to compare side by side. My selections were the ON Gold Standard Mocha Cappuccino, and the NOW Sports Dutch Chocolate. Here goes a very detailed comparison of the two.<br/><br/>* Nutritionals and label:<br/><br/>Both pack 120 calories. ON has 24gr of proteins, while NOW has the slightly higher 25gr. Both offer some of the highest protein / calories ratio among the plethora of whey supplements available in the market. I don't think that 1gr is significant enough to sway anybody's decision, and the nutrition labels are never 100% accurate anyway. (ON = NOW)<br/><br/>ON is a protein blend, while NOW is a whey isolate. However, going back to the nutritionals, it is obvious that the majority of the ON blend is made of whey isolate as well. At the end of the day, and given that they are both whey based, what matters is the protein / calorie ratio. (ON = NOW)<br/><br/>Both are made in the USA, which often indicates higher quality control in production. ON however also states that they use "domestic and international ingredients", and who knows what that means. (ON = NOW)<br/><br/>ON is flavored with cocoa, coffee, sucralose, acesulfame potassium and other undisclosed "flavorings". NOW on the other hand only has cocoa, "natural flavors", xylitol and stevia. While the latter two are not ideal, NOW at least uses all natural products and definitely has ON beat. In addition, ON has a bunch of enzyme additives, purportedly to ease digestion, but I don't see why they are needed, and I'd rather do without them. (NOW &gt; ON)<br/><br/>Overall: NOW &gt; ON<br/><br/>* Mixability:<br/><br/>I went with the worst case scenario, and mixed both with about 6 oz of cold water in a glass, and simply hand stirred with a spoon. ON was amazing, it dissolved almost completely as soon as it touched the water, and after a few seconds of stirring it was as smooth as it gets. Mixing NOW was not as easy but still okay; it first had a sticky consistency and required about 30 seconds of rigorous stirring, but the final mixture was as good as ON. If you have a shaker or blender, you will notice absolutely no difference between the two. (ON = NOW)<br/><br/>* Aroma:<br/><br/>ON powder smells just like any instant hot chocolate mix. When added water, coffee becomes more pronounced, and smells of more like an instant mocha cappuccino mix. Quite pleasant, no artificial or out-of-place aromas.<br/><br/>NOW powder smells like very mild milk chocolate, but then a more chemical, sour milk/kefir-like aroma becomes noticeable. It is by no means unpleasant, but you know right away that you are drinking a supplement product. With water the nose of the powder stays pretty much the same.<br/><br/>Overall: ON &gt; NOW<br/><br/>* Texture in mouth:<br/><br/>Both were smooth, but thin, and not oily or thick. Neither one had any hint of graininess. They pretty much kept the mouthfeel of water. (ON = NOW)<br/><br/>* Taste:<br/><br/>From start to finish ON is sweet. I prefer my tea/coffee/milk/etc completely unsweetened, and I definitely find ON sweet, but not cloyingly so, it is still okay. Just like the nose, the taste is very similar to mocha cappuccino mixes you can buy at your supermarket, and stays fairly one-note from start to finish. The finish fades quickly, leaving no aftertaste. Overall, I find that the artificial flavors of this one are very well crafted. It doesn't taste any worse than instant cappuccino mixes, and surprisingly you don't get the familiar acesulfame potassium taste.<br/><br/>NOW immediately hits your tongue with a bitter and tannic taste; think a dry over-aged/over-oaked whiskey or wine. My guess is that this is xylitol and stevia playing tricks on my taste buds. However, this bitterness quickly goes away and gives way to... nothing actually. No taste, completely neutral, just like plain water. After you put down your glass and wait a second, the drink finishes with very mild and pleasant flavors of unsweetened cocoa, vanilla, and milk chocolate. The finish lingers for a good 10 minutes, but it tastes like chocolate so no problems there.<br/><br/>Overall, although some may find ON overly sweet, I think it still has the edge in taste. It doesn't have off-notes anywhere, and at its worst, tastes like a cheaply made instant cappuccino mix. NOW is nowhere near undrinkable, in fact it is pretty good as well, but the initial sour smell and the bitter bite on your tongue will remind you that you are taking a supplement. (ON &gt; NOW)<br/><br/>* Overall:<br/><br/>The differences are minor, you can't go wrong with either, and they both get 5 stars from me. But I found myself mostly going for NOW simply because it doesn't have the artificial additives, and while the taste is worse in comparison, it is also sufficiently good. In fact, this experiment encouraged me to try the completely natural unflavored variety of NOW next. I'll probably stick to NOW in the future, and throw in a tub of some crazy flavor of ON once in a while just to keep myself entertained.
 tasty and not so gritty as other brands
 good
 Tastes great
 It's a great product!
 The taste of this Double chocolate whey is too good compared to other whey proteins. Could see very good results
 It's all I will use.  Tastes great and dissolves perfectly.
 Item as described, shipping was good. Thanks
 :)
 I can't afford to buy this often; It doesn't last long enough; I took 4 scoops a day; Gave me enough for about 20 days; Too expensive to buy again.  I am sure the quality is excellent; Wish the price was lower; or that they gave 10 pounds at this price.  Maybe if they got rid of the fancy plastic container and expensive lable and just sold the product in a cardboard box I could afford to buy 20+ pounds at a time at a far less price; Then I would be very happy and give the product 5 stars.
 High quality and great taste.
 Tried other brands but keep coming back to this one. The best. My favorite is the double chocolate flavor.
 Love this purchase! Couldn't be a better protein. tastes good. dissolves quickly. and it is good for anyone to use.
 This stuff is REALLY good, I enjoy it a lot. The Coffee flavor blends well with ice and tastes delicious. I add a little peanut butter and cinnamon and sometimes a banana. I AM going to buy this flavor again.
 Cant say much, it just worked for what I need it to do which was to provide protein after workouts. I recommend to anyone in need of protein and I would definitely say it tastes good when mixed with milk, while I think it tastes much worse when mixed with water.
 Honestly, I was disappointed. I chose to try it cause mint chocolate chip is my favorite ice cream flavor but this just tastes like dirt. Don't recommend!
 No whey, whey.
 I've had chocolate vanilla cream and now banana. Chocolate and banana are probably my favorite but it seems that banana mixes the best. Anyway i love Optimum Nutrition and will continue to buy their product
 my love it
 This stuff works. It tastes alright but the results set the bar from everything I have tried.
 This taste Terrible. I have other company WHEY that taste better.  This taste like I am eating grain and old chocolate.  I got the double rich chocolate terrible flavors.  Also this immediately sinks to bottom has no mixing in water.  I will go back to other company.  I found the brand at walmart taste much better.<br/><br/>Update: 6/1/2013<br/><br/>I gave this to my father he said it wasn't bad he liked it so must be me.  I guess everyone has their own taste.  He also mixes things in his blender which I do not.
 Great taste!
 Tastes great, came highly recommended from my trainer, and a great source of protein since I cut way back on my meat consumption.
 so much better than what i have
 great buy!
 GREAT TASTE
 Amazing flavor compared to other proteins.
 Easy to use.<br/>Good taste.
 I always drink this post workout and I have seen great results compared to no post work protein supplement. Worth the investment.
 Good flavor.
 Has helped by son to gain muscle and lose weight.  He said this the best flavor he has tired. He even likes better than chocolate.
 Best whey out there
 Great Taste!!!
 YUMMY I LOVED IT!:)  Pretty pricey tho! Perfect for my diet plan!
 Taste like s***. Imma truck through it. The banana cream was very very good I really enjoy that would not be buying vanilla whey again. Will definitely buy banana creme
 Best Whey ever!!
 Love the chocolate malt flavor.
 It helps to have something to take first thing in the morning and post workout. It has a good bit of sugar but compared to most other supplements it's not bad.
 love the banana cream flavor
 Have been using the protein for a while now, roughly a 2-3 years. Tried different proteins here and there, but this product has remained consistent and always tastes the same.<br/>Does not come with a lot of extra fillers or names you can’t pronounce to confuse you into thinking it must be good. It’s simple, thin, and does not clunk up.<br/>I have ordered chocolate for the most part, so I can’t speak for the other flavors so I recommend the chocolate.<br/>Has never clunked up in the containter, and last well enough until I finish it.<br/>I have a shake almost everyday, and so it last me roughly a month and a half.<br/>If you have a Costco Card, they do sell a slightly bigger size for the roughly the same price, but other than that I would highly recommend this product.
 Not my favorite texture in a protein powder but I am getting my protein so nothing big to complain about.
 Great product, great taste.
 Chocolate tastes great and feels great.
 Best Protein out there. Been using this for the last 6 years.
 I've been using this protein powder for over 2 years now. It still tastes great and it does what it's suppose to.
 This is probably one of the best tasting whey protein powder I've ever bought
 Better than a whey made with concentrate, faster absorbing, but still has an off flavor compared to platinum hydrowhey (the higher priced alternative)
 great!
 Classic choice.
 Rocky Road flavor tastes good, ON is a reputable company. That's all I needed to know.
 Great taste for who might need to switch things up a bit and curve that sweet tooth!
 Great product for a great price!
 great
 The double chocolate taste was amazing
 Love it
 This is my first purchase of protien powder. I got the banana cream flavor.  I have it as a post workout drink with skim milk and sometimes add peanut butter. I also bought  the bottle blender from amazon which does a very good job of mixing the contents. I enjoy the drink and would highly recommend it.
 Good value and tastes good.
 The best out there
 Mixes well with water or milk. Taste is great and meets my standards for Whey P.<br/><br/>I will buy it again
 Does not get very thick like the cheap brands from Wal-Mart and the like. Would buy this again. AWESOME PRODUCT!
 The taste is awesome!!<br/>Great protein, love it.
 I've been using ON Gold Standard Whey for awhile.  I'd previously used numerous brands including, EAS, Body Fortress, &amp; Muscle Milk (ick).  This is the best tasting and best quality of the proteins I've used.  I usually go with Double Rich Chocolate or Vanilla.  However, I decided to try a different route this order, and purchased the special edition Coffee flavor.  Now, I thought ON double rich chocolate was the best whey I've ever tasted until I got the Coffee.  The coffee is flat out delicious.  It tastes just as good mixed with water as it does with milk.  It has a slight coffee ice cream or frappacino like taste.  The only issue I have with it is it does contain real coffee, so that means there's 40mg of caffeine per serving.  I quit drinking caffeine a couple of years ago and really should have checked closer before buying it.  That said it's still delicious, but I have to be careful with it in my post workout shakes if I work out at night.
 A friend recommended Optimum Whey. Seems to be a good product. Tastes good, not clumpy.
 Good product but the taste isn't so great. I've had better chocolate tasting proteins and doesn't dissolve that great. But, good source of protein, probably won't buy it again though. After a few uses I couldn't stomach the taste
 a good protien
 I like it better than the vanilla, chocolate, fruit punch (was not good anyways), and banana.  It was creamy and sweet.
 This stuff tastes great when I mix it with 8oz of almond milk, or in the morning with some fruits and granola in a blender.
 extreme milk chocolate is definitely the best flavor. it's so delicious that i would drink this just for the taste.
 This product l chose not first time
 I want to express my sincere gratitude for Soap.com replacing a bottle of protein powder that was bad. Soap is deserving of praise since it was not the distributor's fault – rather the manufacture's error. Because of their honest concern, I will always order from these good people.
 Best flavor I've had
 ok
 Awesome.
 Have been enjoying the double chocolate flavor for years -- thousands of dollars spent on it. Just tried the coconut-chocolate. Horribly sweet and overflavored. Also ingredients include "nondairy creamer," which includes palm oil -- not very much since grams fat only goes up 1 over double chocolate, but got physically ill after two days of three shakes a day. Felt fat and queasy. Disposing of this garbage and recommend you avoid any of the flavors with new formulation that is oversweetened or has palm oil added.

 Good whey after working hard in the gym
 It is the standard by which protein is compared.  It has a good mix of whey isolates BCAA's.  Optimum nutrition has a great reputation in the fitness marketplace, as opposed to some other supplement companies the use some questionable techniques.  Whey blends are much more efficient in entering the body than protein from regular food sources, and they lack many of the other less desirable nutritional components (calories, fats, etc).  So whether you are bulking and trying to keep your calories low, or cutting, a good protein blend is pretty much essential.  And you cannot get better than Gold Standard.
 I'm no expert in the technical of whey protein so I won't get into that. The taste is good for protein shakes, the chocolate goes well with yogurt and fruit. I've been using this for years and have no complaints.
 Great price for the product
 This ON Whey Protein (Milk Chocolate flavor) is the best that I've tried. You get the best deal when you buy the 5lb jar. Great tasting whey.
 Best protein out there. Blends well with shaker cups, not with a spoon!
 Good product, taste so good.
 This it the best protein out there.  Tastes great and is perfect for after my workouts!
 It's great, but I don't know why it has so big  pot, when I opened it I was so surprised because there is only half of  pot.
 Optimum Nutrition makes the BEST protein powder.  This flavor is so rich and chocolaty.  It is very smooth and easy to drink.
 As my fourth Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard flavor, this one beat my expectations. It has an amazing taste and if you let it cool for an hour or so, the cream rises to the top and it tastes a lot better. If you like bananas and cream together, this is for you!
 Great product!
 Tasty, best Whey protein
 Can't beat the quality for the price!
 Liked the flavor, plus itmixes really well with the milk, not like other kinds that stay at the top and wont mix
 Great taste. Recommended by a friend
 Love it.
 I've tried several different kinds of whey protein and blended protein but this is the only one that I keep coming back to.<br/><br/>The flavor is great, the price is pretty good, and it's a great brand with high quality product.
 Horrible taste, does not mix well without a blender
 This is the best whey protein product out there.  Don't waste your time with the others.
 I've tried many other proteins. I have been loyal to GNC Whey 60 for 2 to 3 threes. Finally decided I was paying way to much since they stopped their Gold Card Discounts. This is one great in taste, price, and delivers the same results. It also mixes better my shaker than GNC protein. Try it. You won't be disappointed.
 ok
 I love the strawberry flavor.
 5 stars because of the 23g of protein and delicious flavor. It tastes like I am drinking a chocolate milkshake. Best way to reward yourself and get the required protein after a workout!
 All ON whey is top quality. White Chocolate is a pretty good flavor.
 Great protein supplement, I buy this because it's also low in calories.  Because of this though, its not the best tasting, but it isn't nasty either. Getting it for a deal on Amazon is cheaper than getting it for more money at GNC, and this comes to your door.
 Initially tried with water, not that great, but started to mix with whole milk, tasted pretty good. Ended up mixing with chocolate almond milk, and that tasted pretty good too.
 Tastes good and I feel it' works for me.
 Great taste, i've been drinking this for over a week and i wont regret anything. i take it with water and still taste good
 Love this powder tastes great. I would recommend this to anyone who likes milk chocolate flavor. Won't buy anything else.
 my husband use to shop gnc for chocolate caramel religiously but then they started to only have 1  tub when they had their buy 1 get 1 free. and they also raised their price. no longer a gnc customer. will keep buying thru Amazon.  Good product and flavor.
 great!
 I love this product because it has the least fillers of most other protein powders. The taste is pretty average for powders, but without the nasty aftertaste. I don't lift weight like I used to, but I like this for my protein in the morning.
 solid gainz.
 great thanks
 I have been using this for a few months now and it is a great protein supplement.
 Super fast delivery ......Super product
 Always a good product!
 Good stuff!
 This is the only protein I use, tastes great and is of the best quality.
 Try out double chocolate! Great flavor!
 Great product Came on time!!
 I have tried many types and brands of whey protein supplements.  Optimum Nutrition is definitely the best I have found.  It's all I buy anymore.  I use the vanilla mainly for making smoothies or when mixing fruit or other flavors with the whey since it has a more "neutral" taste.  Strawberry is the best tasting ON Whey flavor to just drink straight with water or milk.  They have a great taste and mix up easier than any protein powder I have tried.

 Love it!
 I am a repeat customer on this one.  Whey. Good taste.  Easy mix.  Inexpensive. I would recommend this to any and everyone.
 good i think. i ordered it for someone else. dont bother reading my comment, all i know is the price seemed fair
 only 24 percent protien
 Not much to say, except that I have been using this product for years and I love it. Works great.
 works good. tastes like hot chocolate. not super chalky. you can feel and see slight diffrences after around 5 days of takeing it after your workout
 Best protein on the market
 Gold Standard tests well for protein content, and the protein/calorie ratio is about the best you can get. I don't like this flavor though, it's sickeningly sweet and has an odd coffee taste.
 Great protein. I've gone through almost 15 pounds of Whey and 2 of Casein from ON and it was all great. Chocolate Mint and Banana Creme were great. Cake batter was too rich. See a lot of gainz with this product.
 Great product. Fast shipping. Total satisfaction.
 Has stayed shelf stable for six months.
 Quality.
 I love this protein powder. This is my favorite brand on the market. Great prices and extremely fast shipping. I will definitely be a returning customer !
 Came as advertised
 love this
 As described
 This is probably one of the best supplements for keeping muscle and gaining it , I do a lot of cardio so keeping the muscle I have is key and this helps 100%
 taste good
 ON whey protein is one of the top product hands down I've only used them now this is my first time using this flavor it smells sooooo good just like a cake to my surprise there was actually colorful sprinkles in it wow these guys go all the way for buyer's satisfaction lol and its actually not that sweet.
 The french vanilla is not as good as the regular vanilla but it is still good.I like to mix the vanilla with orange gatorade-it taste really good.
 Ordered this many times.  Great product.
 Very quick delivery, faster than the bodybuilding.com website, only problem is you dont get free stuff with ordering protein compared to body building.com  Either way all I wanted was my protein!
 Tastes great.
 I've purchased this a couple of times and do like the taste.
 amazing,,, just amazing
 excellent flavor, mixes wonderfully!
 can't tell the effect yet but feels good still.
 ive tried many protein powders.. this is the best by far. i take 3 scoop in the morning and 3 at night. it helped me build bad ass lean muscle in 3 months. i workout 2-3 hours a day. i would definitely recommend this product for anyone who wants lean muscles mass.
 This ships very fast and the extreme milk chocolate is good but not as great as many other people describe. I only drink with water because milk adds more calories.
 Double Chocolate flavor is delicious!
 love it
 Favorite go-to brand of whey protein. A little more expensive than it used to be, but still a great combo of miscibility and taste.
 Excellent quality, price, and consistency are what set this product apart in a market awash in fancy and flashy marketing gimmicks. Walk into any GNC or other supplement store and see the vast amount of different protein powders that are mostly just repackaged products, often from the same parent company but with a picture of a celebrity sponsor. Optimum Nutrition's Gold Standard Whey has a simple label that doesn't try and sway you with flashy graphics or pictures of freakishly muscled body builders. Instead, they rely on an outstanding, well balanced product and they deliver time and time again. This product truly is the "Gold Standard" as far as I am concerned.
 This is not delicious and if a strawberry had an arse, this is probably what it would taste like. Tried to return it but no returns excepted. Bummer because they used to accept returns. Anyways, I would not recommend this.... unless you like wasting your time and money. I should have stuck with the extreme milk chocolate. That one was decent.10 lbs of strawberry arse in a bag.... probably wont be able to give this crap away. Seriously... very disappointed Optimum Nutrition.... tsk tsk tsk
 I have found the protein powder for me.I will continue to buy this product for as long as I can.
 ON does a great job and delivering the pure needs through their supplements. When I'm not on a low-carb diet but still need good sources of protein, this is the stuff I take and can still enjoy it.
 This protein tastes exactly like chocolate and marshmallow, good quality protein. Not lumpy and doesn't leave behind tons of residue.
 Tastes great.
 The Best Whey Protein hands down. Good taste, and mixes well.
 good quality product .
 nice
 Great product fast shipping
 good one
 Optimum Nutrition kept good care of me. Delivery and advertisement was executed perfectly. DEFINITELY recommend and I will be back!
 with milk it tastes like chocolate milk.  The best I've tried over the last 10 years.
 Yummy
 very good thanks 100% recomended
 Tastes great and mixes well with just water.
 Well-priced.
 ok
 Lovely protein powder, very cost-efficient.
 Best whey , enough said
 I have tried 4 or 5 different types of protein powder and keep coming back to this one as my favorite.  Best taste, mixability, protein content per serving, and price!
 Best per serving price, great taste can't wait to try other flavors.
 good
 It is what it says. Double Rich Chocolate tastes great with water. I use a magic bullet and put two scoops on top of the water and blend it for 30 seconds.  I put one or two ice cubes in it and blend it again. Great post workout source of protein. Sturdy bag. A little expensive but whatever.
 I have been using this product for some time. Very happy with it.  Mixes well, tastes good.<br/>Does the job as far as I am concerned.
 Very good
 I will continue to purchase, and do recommend.
 This tastes good and is enough to last  for a while. pretty fast shipping, I work out 5 to 6 days a week.
 taste nice and make it work well
 excellent
 I purchased the chocolate malt and it is delicious...  The double chocolate is also good.
 GOOD
 I've tried all the different protein shakes out there from Muscle Pharm to Pro Performance and i must admit that i always return to Gold Standard because they have the best tasting protein and best quality.
 I LOVED the Rocky Road flavor. But cake batter is awful. Hard to make it through the tub.
 Whey of my choice. Can't beat it.
 This is a good whey protein. Its easy to stir and rinses out of cups easily.
 Tastes Great. Goes well with fruit and in smoothies.
 Helping my workouts as expected, blends nicely with any fruits and nuts keeping the taste in tact.
 The best.
 Best protein powder around.
 taste real good. I also had the vanilla flavored one which tastes better,  but this was still good.  the price was fairly reasonable too.
 Great!!
 I can't really add anything more than what has already been written. I feel the flavor of the double rich chocolate is good enough. Not as good as a shake, but who would expect that? Definitely a good way to get the needed protien needed to grow muscle. I also don't get the "gas" attacks that I sometimes get from other protein that I have tried.
 This protein is just wonderful. The carb/fat ratio is low, protein content is high. You don't have to worry about fillers or random garbage in it either. Good quality whey protein!
 Mocha Cappuccino flavor is amazing, especially mixed with chocolate milk haha
 The container is like the size of a 55 gallon drum, hence the price. You get a lot of mix.  Taste pretty good for a protein shake.
 5 stars!!!
 I drink it with milk.<br/>Delicious! Better than Banana Cream and Cookies and Cream.
 cheap and best
 Hoping for weight gain on an 85 year old skinny cancer patient. Slow going.
 Highest quality you can get
 Taste Great and is a high quality product. One of my favorite protein supplements. I plan to buy it again.
 Product tastes great. I always feel energized after making the shake. The ingredients are exactly what I was looking for.
 Great value and great taste. An easy protein filled breakfast.
 The flavoring(s) really cover the nasty fake sugar taste that seem to be in ALL these type protein drinks (ie. the cookies n cream)
 well...is my second buy from vitamin shoppe and It was sucessfull.  It was fast, too fast.....3 days.<br/>I recomend this page to buy.
 Great protein. The mint chocolate flavor is much better than other proteins I have tried.
 Excellent protein at an excellent price! Highly recommend Gold Standard Whey, best tasting protein for those after workout shakes!
 yum
 If you feel that vanilla or French vanilla are a little blah, try this. I love to cook with it and put in my oats or coffee for creamers. MMMMmmm
 I swear by this protein and recommend it to everyone that is starting to work out or looking for protein. I have found that, for a reasonable price, this is one of the leanest protein powders that you can buy. It tastes amazing with milk and just takes a couple of days to get used to it with water.<br/><br/>This fits a small niche for people that are looking strictly for protein. This doesn't have a huge amount of calories and won't bulk you up fast because it's NOT a gainer (though some may think all protein shakes are supposed to do that). This is for strict protein intake.<br/><br/>Serving sizes are about 30g and with 24g of protein, it fits well. 5lbs will last me about 1.5/2 months with 2 servings a day.
 I love Optimum Nutrition, but I didn't like this flavor at all.
 best protein to drink in my opinion, very easy to drink with minimal mixing.
 Very good!
 The absolute best flavor, consistency, and value....bar none.
 I really like the ON double chocolate.  Very lean with high % of protein per scoop.  ON leaves out the higher fat content without much sacrifice on taste.  It mixes VERY easily.  I even put a scoop on a bowl of cereal.  Chocoolate Rice Krispies and Shredded Wheat with a scoop of this stuff makes a great tasting snack!!!
 Great price on my fav protein for post workout. Flavor is delicious too.
 Great taste! Great price!!
 great protein and taste really good
 This is the best tasting protein powder I've used. I've mixed it with Whole Milk and Almond Milk and have come away impressed each time.
 This is the best protein for the money and taste really good.
 It's good enough
 By far the best tasting protein i ever had.
 Tastes great. That's all you can ask for with protein.
 Taste great doesn't expire soon
 My husband uses this product for protein shakes. He has tried other brands and didn't like the flavor. He says this is good.
 Super Yummy. Good Stuff!
 great taste no results
 Arrived super fast and tastes great! I love it with almond milk!
 This tastes so good.<br/><br/>When mixed with milk, it honestly tastes like a chocolate mint milkshake. When mixed with water it does not taste as good, but that is to be expected.<br/><br/>One of my favorite flavors that I've ever tried.
 Taste great!
 My favorite flavor so far!
 Rocky Road is a really good flavor, in water tastes alright in milk tastes like a choclate bash
 Pretty good. Mixes well with peanut butter or fruit.  Good neutral flavor to have on hand. Mixed well as always.
 Tastes great, mixes great, works great.
 I got the vanilla ice cream flavor and it's definitely one of the best tasting whey protein I've had. It doesn't dissolve as well as I'd like in milk but it digests very well and I've had no gastro-intestinal complaints.
 Been buying this for years. Works great and many great flavors.
 taste good with water. great protein.
 Terribly sweet flavor, it kind of makes me want to spit it out, it's that terrible. I made a mistake by ordering this flavor instead of what I usually get - the Double Rich Chocolate. That one is delicious, you can mix 3 servings with 16 oz of milk and it is good. While Extreme milk is forcing me to use just 1 serving per 16 oz of milk, to be tolerable. I guess combining it with cereal or using it in some other way might make it less terrible.
 I have a very strong gag reflex and this is the one and only protein shake that I can drink and enjoy. The taste is really, really good. Not chalky, not funky sweet. I mix it up in those blender/ shaker things with the wire ball. It blends SO well. A few vigorous shakes and it's totally dissolved. I mix it with rice milk and love the taste. Thank you to all the other great reviews that attracted me to buy this product.
 High recommend, has made a huge difference.
 Such amazing flavor!!!!<br/>It isnt gritty going down<br/>I absolutely love this protein
 Great tasting protein!!
 Why go with anything but the best?  ON Gold Standard is exactly that, the Gold Standard of protein powders.
 Love the taste &amp; the price.
 It's not great, but it's not terrible either. Has a very funny aftertaste.
 Delicious and has the nutrition parameters for which I was looking.
 good taste
 Tastes terrible waste if your money
 Great protein i love it. DO NOT GET VANILLA FLAVOR, CHOCOLATE IS THE WAY TO GO!!!
 Purchased this product because it was relatively low on calories compared to other products and overall it had good ratings. After trying it, it actually tastes really good when mixed with milk (or almond milk). I generally take it immediately after working out and before dinner. Seems to help with both weight loss and muscle gain. 5 pounds will easily last me two months having it once a day. For the price, I really can't complain. I plan on continuing to buy it.
 High quality protein with the right mixture of BCAAs, includes enzymes to make for easier absorption.  Mixes very easily with just a shaker (hate having to use a mixer).  Best tasting whey protein I've tried (out of ten or so), especially the double-rich chocolate flavor.  Highly recommended.
 very good
 Great taste, mixes well.
 taste good and works
 Best protein powder out there tastes very very nice this is the best flavor
 It's always right on the spot for my husband.  He loves it.
 Great product. Quick shipping.
 Tastes great.
 Compared to other protein drinks, it tastes incredible. Mixes great with water or milk. It also mixes easily. Highly recommended nutritional supplement.
 Okay
 I've ordered this brand before in chocolate,  which was great.  I recently ordered strawberry and it's the most God awful tasting crap ever.  I tried to pawn it off on my husband (who will eat ANYTHING) and he almost puked.  He tried it another time to see if that was a fluke and again almost barfed.  I'm stuck with a giant container of protein that I can't even give away.  I'm super bummed and want to change flavors.  I literally choke down a shake at the gym bc I feel like I'm wasting my money if I don't drink it.  So disgusting.
 Good protein
 I've had several protein powders over the years.  Between flavor, absorbency, grams of protein and the quality of the protein, this is the best.
 Delicious.
 Good stuff.
 Great product! Tastes great! This is the cheapest I've found!
 This is too sweet... feels like you drinking sugar.
 Tastes pretty good and mixes very well using a blender bottle.  The flavor also satisfies the occasional chocolate craving!
 We have tried many protein powders- Soy is awful. This is the best tasting Whey product out there.  It also mixes up very well!  Have not tried every flavor- that is a personal preference but this is perfect if you want one that is chocolate.  Highly recommend!
 Good
 This is probably the best quality protein given its price. It tastes great, as well as is easily asborbable. I have had my best gains while taking this protein in comparrison to several others i've tried.
 good!!
 So yummmyyyy!!! With water, it tastes like watered down chocolate milk! Haven't tried with fruit or milk!
 Very good!
 It taste amazing (Extreme Milk Chocolate) it reminds me of the chocolate drinks I use to have when I was a kid.
 Love this protein, taste great. 100% recommend for anyone lifting or Needing meal replacements. Don't buy the crap at Walmart. This is quality.
 Good product, I just didn't like this flavor.
 I love the favor of this, and it's so smooth and it's just perfect...
 10 pounds of chocolate whey at a great price.  Whats not to love?
 I am a college student who lives with 5 other housemates. We trust ON for our standard product. It is cheap and effective.
 Opened up my shipment and the safety seal around the lid was scotch taped closed.  Not very safe.  Extremely disappointed.
 great, easy to mix and drink
 Athletes like Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey protein for their pre workout regimen.  Muscle building protein is what they are looking for.  The Milk Chocolate flavor helps it go down easy.
 These is top of the line best flavor and best results  i tried muscle tech and gnc products and i dint liked them.
 This stuff is great for everyday protein supplement for anything that you do. Not that tasty though, but a great price. That must mean its good for you if its yucky. lol
 does the job. better to drink it 1hr after exercise and go with carb.<br/>my roommate and i both uses it.
 Great price.
 Taste good!
 A solid protein shake.  Rocky Road is very good.  Great value for the price.
 Delicious and works well after a workout!
 taste good
 Great product!!!
 Great
 IMA GET HUGEEEEEEEE
 nice product with low sugar!
 the best
 Yummy
 I use about two scoops every morning daily and two scoops post workout. Although not the cheapest out there, it certainly works well. I've seen results, and being the big-boned type that I am, I use this in moderation.
 GREAT PRODUCT!
 Great stuff
 Great taste, good product
 Great value, high quality, taste is a little watery, but  with almond milk, a little better. Dissolves great in shaker bottle. no clumping.
 Great product. Wonderful taste.
 Would have given 5 stars but price has gone up over 30% will not buy again. I use over 2 bags a year
 Great for muscle
 jice
 My son loves this product. Seems to be working!
 Good Product!
 Not sure how to describe it but it doesn't really taste like coffee. Not that the taste is bad; it's actually quite good, but not like any kind of coffee I've ever had. Bottom line: Would buy again.
 This is a great whey powder. Nice flavor that mixes well with multiple types of shakes. Just sweet enough. Blends well and has no bad after taste.
 I have ordered Gold Standard Whey in the past &amp; have never been disappointed.  I use it for breakfast after an early morning workout.  Taste is great &amp; it mixes well with water.  If you are adding fruit, I always order the vanilla &amp; create my own protein smoothies.  I will continue to order this product, I have found it to be one of the highest sources of Whey Protein Isolate.  I love the tast &amp; the results.  Thanks for the great products.<a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Optimum-Nutrition-100-Whey-Gold-Standard-Natural-Whey-Natural-Vanilla-2-Pound/dp/B003KD8B14/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard Natural Whey, Natural Vanilla, 2 Pound</a>
 Definitely doesn't get better than this! It tastes great and you can definitely tell a difference with the muscles healing faster and growing faster
 Good protein. Just getting a little too pricey
 I love this chocolate flavor. It tastes good. But 5 pounds are too much for me, I think I need to spend one year using up this bottle of protein powder.
 great taste, no results yet
 Id buy it again, great taste! and Solid
 good product/price
 I like the taste.  I bought it to try something different.  I would purchase it again.  I would recommend it.
 Exelente
 Optimum nutrition really has it down when it comes to supplements. This protein powder has yielded the best results I've had with a variety of different protein supplements.
 This whey protein dissolved fairly well, as advertised by the "instantized" feature. Taste was good, but could use a bit more sucralose. Recommended.
 if you can get strong by taking ON you are not human...<br/>get it now....... if you want to feel and look great...
 good product
 For me is the best whey in the market nutrition, it has a good taste and easy to make pancakes.
 I've been using this for a little over a year now and I am completely satisfied.  I don't get the bloaty feeling and gas that I get with other protein.<br/><br/>With that said, in the year, I have gotten a lot bigger without getting fat.  I gained 50lbs mostly muscle and couldn't be happier. My workouts are pretty much the same with the exception of this.
 Taste really good and works great!
 My husband mixes scoops of this into a large glass of milk every morning and he enjoys it very much.  The price is also very reasonable for this large quantity.
 Cake batter is ok but next time I'm definitely going with cookies and cream or chocolate. It's not what you would expect, it almost makes you want to barf after taking it so if you do purchase this flavor wait a good 30 minutes post workout.
 Good
 I love this protein flavor. However - seller sent me what appears to me a different flavor that is labeled as chocolate coconut. Not cool!
 Tastes great, great customer service from optimal nutrition
 This is my 4th 5lb tub of ON Whey. I have tried Vanilla, Chocolate, Strawberry and Double Chocolate. Double Chocolate is by far the best tasting of the four. Not that the others were bad by any means, they are all great tasting. The Double Chocolate is just far more superior. It satisfies the sweet tooth while suppling you with great protein and BCAA's.
 Best protein for the money. Just protein without other crap!  Been using it for over 10 years! love it.
 No bull to point good ole whey exactly what I want &amp; good price to my door
 Great Taste, expiration date is long lead time.<br/>Excellent quality, package very professionally and quick service.<br/>Recommned this for anyone who is looking to gain weight with low calories and protein.
 I love it, everything as described.
 I don't know whether or not I have a whey allergy. My reaction may have been to this product or to whey in general. When I was taking this product I had bad gas, constipation and when I sweat, it would irritate my skin. When I stopped taking it the symptoms went away completely. This review will probably get buried under the thousands of other reviews, but I thought I would put it out there in case someone else has the same symptoms.
 el producto es lo que esperaba, llego en buen estado y es lo requerido, buena experiencia con la compra se recomienda el vendedor
 I love this stuff.  It's got the protein I'm looking for, and it's not pricey, especially considering the amount of servings the 5 pound container has.
 Very good protein with good taste as well! One of the best tasting whey proteins I have used. Great overall product!
 My favorite protine
 DELICIOUS
 I've used several protein powders and this is one I keep coming back to.  When compared to others, it's inexpensive, has good taste and has the desired effect.  I would definitely recommend this product.
 I mix it with skim milk with a blender. Bought the Mocha Cappuccino flavor; tastes good; it's not very sweet. Easy to drink.
 The most reliable protein powder in market!
 I want to get another whey protein, it work great for skinny people and body builders.I received a great promo code with a fair honest review
 Great product.  Mixes in liquid very, very cleanly.
 Looking for a good protein powder for a muscle building gains? This is the product that will get you there.
 Everything about it is great except the taste. It is rather tasteless. The price is good and it mixes well.
 You will get what you expect
 Tastes great!
 Love it!
 It was great. One scoop after a workout does the trick. I also tske it on.my days off from working out.
 my 4-5th order. great everytime!
 This is a good product &amp; a pretty decent price.  Used all of it &amp; it tasted just fine &amp; was very helpful in recovery after workout.
 One of the best whey out there
 Not only is the protein excellent for muscle building and repair, but I got the best deal in town.  You can't go wrong!
 tastes great!!!
 I like the taste very good! I will buy it again
 Lost more than 60 pounds using this whey protein with veggie shakes.
 I tried this during weight loss, I was on minimal diet, working out three times a day. This is a tasty flavor, but as always it is not exactly cake batter so keep that in mind. Blends well, tastes great!
 If you're a choco-holic, you're going to love it as much as I do. I love having a post-workout shake that consists of this protein, bananas, and peanut butter. It's' heaven in my mouth :D Good buy.
 I like it  but i think the flavor can be better.
 Flavor tastes great and protein feels awesome. all you need is protein, don't buy any of those other supplements or heart-attack causing pre-workouts. be a man
 Dissolves COMPLETELY and tastes delicious. Especially with some whole milk or almond milk.
 awesome as usual
 Love this stuff
 One word : perfection
 Great quality, tastes good,
 Best quality protein for the money. Tastes good too
 Great Tasting Protein, Great Value
 This is my second big container of Whey, my family and I love this product. The taste is great! I highly recommend this to all.
 This is a great product! I use it every time I work out and it's given me fantastic results! I highly recommend this product to others. Don't waste your time with any other protein powder; get gold standard!
 Great value and the best tasting product I've tried.  I used to dread the metallic taste of protein powder before I found this.
 My favorite whey protein, love it!
 Overall I love this protein powder.  It taste amazing, doesn't clump and has some pretty good nutrition compared to some other proteins I've used.  Overall I would and probably will but this again.
 Mixes and tastes great, not a bad price for what you get. Almost 80% protein by weight, great product by Optimum Nutrition.
 Have us d this product for several years.  Have tried others but always return to ON.
 My Favorite!
 I enjoy a lot the flavor of this protein, but it's not my favorite, even so to vary it's a good alternative
 💪
 so large!!!
 The protein is very good in terms of performance. It mixes very well and is good for putting on muscular weight. As for taste it isn't to die for but it certainly is good enough for me to go through the whole jar without feeling sick. Very good price and good quality protein. Great shipping from Amazon.
 I was always against supplementing.  To me, it seemed somewhat unnatural and I wanted to build a strong athletic body rather then one that was huge but had no purpose or practical use.  I didn't want huge bulging arms, a 200lb chest or be able to bench press 400.  As a martial artist (I do chinese wushu, which is similar to advanced gymnastics in terms of the toll it takes on your body), I needed to build a body that was lean, fast and flexible.  I accredit this product with helping me, and currently, achieve that goal.  You won't get BIG of this product.  What you get is exactly what you need if your aiming for the build that I am still working on getting.  If your a man/ woman who wants to build that athletic body everyone ogles at in health magazines, this product is probably right for you.  If you want to get huge, you may want to try something else.
 All time best protein powder. Nothing else compares. Mixes smoothly, tastes great, digests great. I highly recommend this.
 I do not like the flavor :/
 Excellent product, taste is very good.  Great source of protien, but significant amount of calories also.  Lactase is added for those who are lactose intolarent.
 Great powder for the price but it didn't taste that great.
 Perfect product and love the taste.
 great taste with milk or water. Doesn't give me bad gas.
 The only protein supplement I'll ever use again. Just perfect. Price is right. Gains are right. ON got it right!
 Good clean whey can't beat it!
 Great chocolate flavor, dissolves well with shaker bottle, little to no aftertaste.
 Tastes good
 I use this with vanilla soy milk - taste is great.
 Love the extreme milk chocolate flavor
 Great taste and easy to mix. I love this product.
 Not a fan of the coffee flavor, although the brand is truly the gold standard.
 Mixes easy, tastes great, and has a solid amount of protein and other nutrients.  It also doesn't break the bank which is great!
 The best whey protein out there. It taste great and has no after taste. I've seen significant gain in muscle because of it. Calories low and high in protein. Can't ask for anything better.
 Really good sweet taste. Pretty sure it helps with my soreness
 So, it tastes good.  Has a decent amount of protein per serving. Mixes well. Is priced well. Has a huge variety of flavors.  No intent to switch protein powders.
 Mixes well even with just a spoon. Tastes much better than most I've had. Slightly more expensive but definitely worth it.
 Average!
 I like ON products, they seem to work well for me.
 Great taste
 best protein on the market
 Great taste and can feel the benefits.  Have always loved this stuff.
 Delicious
 Fine
 Best protein and delicious.  Low sugar is my favorite part.
 Good flavor. Gets me big
 use it every day
 getting buffed
 My gains are so out of this world that UFO's from outer space keep begging me to procreate with them.  I'm like, "Bishes, you need to chill.  you're too sprung on this chiseled physique that you're embarrassing me."  They then ask me where my gains came from and I tell them, "Hardwork and Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Whey, bish."  They then leap for joy and rush to go buy some.
 This protein powder is rated by bodybuilding.com as the best protein powder out there by consumers. I've been taking this brand for years and wouldn't change brands, because why change a good thing right.
 Should be 5 star!<br/>I bought this for my friend, actually I have no idea how he think it about yet...<br/>I have to write more than xx words, so brutally honest...
 perfect
 It tasted alright, its a little sweet and has little cookie bits in it if you're into that sorta thing.
 This is the third protein I've tried. I've taken myofusion, dynamatize, and this. This tastes like 3/4 water with 1/4 milk when mixed with water. Seriously has no vanilla taste to it. Even when i mix it with less water all I taste is the water with a lactaid flavoring or something.
 I mix this protein powder with 8oz of milk and 12oz of water and it mixes very well in my shaker cup. I previously used EAS vanilla whey protein, which is also tasty. The taste of this chocolate protein is not too sweet, its quite similar to a high quality chocolate ice cream, where the ice cream has the right amount of bitterness to it. Overall very smooth and tasty and i would buy it again, there is no grainyness whatsoever. Does not have as many BCAAs as some others but i dont really know what those do so im not in a position to comment beyond that.
 drink has a good taste and it feels good. we don't go to gym frequently but this helps us feel better.
 Awesome - pumped, swole
 Simple the best protein I have ever used. Extreme milk chocolate is surprisingly good, and tastes great when mixed with oatmeal or soy milk. It might be a little expensive compared to other brands, but you get what you pay for. No cramps, bloating, or gas..Ever!
 Loved it!
 On time and as expected.
 Best protein supplement I have ever had. The taste is great. Extreme chocolate tastes like chocolate milk even in straight water!!!!! It works great in a blender. Gotta love optimum!
 Great product
 This is by far the best tasting protein powder I've found. I've tried 3 other brands and none of them compare to how easy, smooth, and tasty this stuff always ends up.
 MY favorite
 fair
 Optimum nutrition is #1 for a reason. I've tried all their flavors, all of them are great, but this is by far my favorite
 High quality protein at a great price when you buy in bulk 10 lb bag. Works great, no digestion problems.
 Great product !
 Does the job I think. Doesn't taste bad.
 Really good!
 Like it but the mocha cappuccino flavor isn't that great.
 THE BEST
 Results are slower
 excellent protein
 talk about protein farts
 Good quality protein at a cheap price. What more is there to say?
 Tastes fine for the price and good amount of protein per serving. Double chocolate is the best flavor I've had so far.
 Amazing product and fast delivery!! Thanks!!
 taste good
 It is a healthful source of protein. I've been using it for years.
 Good stuff
 Great Stuff!
 I have try other protein products, but this the best whey protein in the world. The taste is really good, many people say that cookies and cream is not good but form me is the best flavor of all.
 Tastes good. No adverse side effects. Will recommend to all my friends who need to take protein for muscle improvement.
 Great product, taste great in my smoothies
 Well, it is what it is, a cheaper brand of %100 Whey protein. It's not a bad product, and I'm sure it is actually %100 percent whey protein. It's just that that's all their is to it. Nothing flashy like the muscle tech products, and no fancy literature on the container like BSN is known for.
 I love the taste and how the protein works. Ive always been a customer of these products. Ive tried synth 6, the hydro whey and all that, but this one here tops all of them. Great stuff
 This product mixes very well, and I drink it everyday. Flavor does not get old to me. Would highly recommend.
 I was happy with fast delivery service, and now expect to get effect from this protein powder soon.
 Best tasting powder with low carbs for the price!
 Very good product giving decent results for my requirements. Using it for last two years continuously.
 Best protein around, been using this brand for 8 years.
 can never go wrong with ON and for the price on sale
 great taste
 Great product with a large variety of flavors too. I've tried other protein powders and they don't compare to this one. It mixes well and taste great with milk or water. 5/5, would buy again.
 What else can I say that hasn't been said already about this amazing stuff?<br/><br/>Mixes well - even without a blender, tastes incredible, and gives me all the performance and recovery I need to keep slugging it out. You'd be an idiot to go with anything else.
 Not a huge fan of the flavor, vanilla ice cream, but ON has great products and would purchase again... Just a different flavor.
 Mixes well and taste alright.
 Love this protein.  Flavor is excellent.
 Love this protein. Trying a few different flavors and so far I've enjoyed them all. Great product that I'll continue to use.
 good
 Delish! and a great deal
 Tastes good
 A+++
 :-)
 works great!
 Love the product! Great taste.
 The chocolate shake flavor is better.
 No issues with quality or indigestion. We were used to a slightly different flavor with a different brand. Had to go back to other brand.
 Best protein on the market
 Great!
 Good source of protein
 This is the best protein for getting lean mass. Can see the results soon but will have to work hard for it. Tastes very good as well. The vanilla ice-cream is the one I got.
 Great product! I use it daily. Great with milk or alone mixed with water.
 As someone who's drank thousands of protein shakes from tons of different brands, this is still my go to. Taste is good enough, nothing to complain about. Mix-ability is where this product shines, I can fit 2 big scoops in my 12oz shaker and have no issues with powder stuck to sides or clumpyness. If you're looking for a solid, bare-bones protein powder with a great profile and none of the fluff, go with ON, you won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>Also: If you're getting a 5lb or bigger, just do yourself a favor and get chocolate, most other flavors you'll get sick of, but you can drink chocolate forever. If you want to try others, definitely get smaller tubs of them.
 balance between quality and price..it.s ok
 Amazing! I get great energy and fill full after taking a serving with a little peanut butter and banana...also has a great taste and for me it seems I will never get tired of this product with an amazing flavor it's a must have
 Good taste. Good ingredients.
 I've tried many different types of proteins, but I've always been a huge fan of the good old fashioned Gold Standard.<br/><br/>Price: (4.5/5)<br/>5-Pounds for ~$55 is a great deal.  You can probably find it a bit cheaper other places, but nobody else delivers in 2 days or for free.  If you go into GNC or any other large supplement store, they are going to charge you around $70 for the same product. Also, if you are someone who buys pre-made protein shakes at $2-$3 a pop, STOP RIGHT NOW!  One scoop of Gold Standard has 24g and at the current going rate of $58, that’s about $0.75 a shake.  Plus, the 5-pound bucket should last you at least 1-2 months, as long as you aren’t taking 3 scoops a day.<br/><br/>Flavor: (4.5/5)<br/>This is category that will trip up most people when buying protein.  I don’t care what anybody says, taste matters.  If you are going to be drinking a shake every day, or nearly so, you don’t want a nasty, chalky, chunky drink.  This is something that Gold Standard does really well.  I like the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor a lot, but their Delicious Strawberry, Banana Cream, Strawberry Banana, and Double Rich Chocolate Flavors are all awesome as well.  The recommended 8 oz. of water per scoop is a little high for me, as I like a creamier shake, so I usually put 6 oz. in and it’s perfect.  I’ve also had a lot of success putting scoops of protein in various smoothies, on PB and J sandwiches, in my yogurt etc.  The only better tasting brand of protein I’ve ever had is Syntha-6, but for the extremely low fat and carbohydrate ratio in ON-Gold Standard, this one tastes amazing.<br/><br/>Mixibility: (5/5)<br/>This is one of the easiest mixing proteins I’ve ever had.  My shaker bottle makes short work of any powder, but even if I forget that, a spoon in a cup or even just shaking up a scoop in a bottle (sans blender ball) does the trick.  As I said earlier, I put protein in my yogurt some days (by the way, Vanilla protein in plain yogurt = vanilla yogurt… mind blown) and even that takes minimal mixing with a spoon to get it completely mixed in.<br/><br/>Ingredients: (5/5)<br/> <br/>I touched on it earlier, but Gold Standard does it right with their ratio.  24g of protein in only one scoop, with less than 1 gram of fat, 1 gram of sugar, and 2 grams of carbs.  Also, it has been a long standing tradition with ON to only use high-quality protein isolates, which, if you care about your body at all, is a very good quality for a company to display.
 Excellent
 I didn't expect it to taste so good! I fully expected that horrible artificial chocolate taste.
 probably the best tasting flavor IMHO
 it was good satisfied
 ON 100% Whey is by far the best on the market.  I love Double Rich choc., Banana Cream and French Vanilla.  I've seen good gains using this.<br/><br/>The only problem:  Why take away Subscribe &amp; Save?  I loved saving the 15% and getting an automatic shipment... good thing I just bought a 10lb bag before it ended!
 I have loved this product for over 15 years. The canister I received yesterday is being returned. The poweder is sickeningly sweet. Ughhhh! I can't believe the formulas was changed so drastically, Optimum, what's the deal?????
 it teaste good it works i will buy again
 Just as advertised. Very happy. Thanks!
 Too much sugar
 Everyone always recommends this, and its pretty good if you use it in milk, but tastes horrible and doesn't mix very well in water.
 Awesome
 delicious, might be my favorite flavor
 Great product!!!
 I usually get just vanilla, goes GREAT with almond milk, French vanilla is way to sweet for me though, I would stick with vanilla.
 Double rich chocolate is delicious. Mixes easily in water and I enjoy drinking it whenever i finish a session at the gym
 Original and effective. I'd highly recommend it.
 I really like it. If you are looking for a good protein shake, get any of the Optimum Nutrition, they are all great!
 So delicious and a great deal!
 Didn't like the taste. Makes me feel bloated.
 Came exactly as advertised the coffee flavor is delicious
 I love the flavor!
 Best whey i ever tasted, best quality protein. Easy to mix, easy to down. Fast protein in the system #100
 Very Good Taste
 Great product<br/>Taste 5/5 tastes great with water, even better with milk<br/>Price 5/5 for the amount and quality of optimum nutrition products you cannot go wrong<br/>Overall 5/5 I am a serious bodybuilder and this is a staole product in my regimen along with ON casein
 Awesome stuff
 I can't yet say anything about the effectiveness of this product, since I've only been using it twice. However I won't be buying this specific product again because of it's flavor (vanilla ice cream). It is way to sweet / too much artificial sweetener. I could barely drink it and didn't feel to good afterwards. I'm currently using half of the recommended amount/shake to solve this. Probably not buying this product in this flavor again though.
 these type of protein are very good to our body, we can go to the gym using it, we can drink it as a supplement too.<br/><br/>the product arrived in good condition, I loved it, you have a good service.
 Good protein at a good price ... French Vanilla Cream has a good flavor
 Clean, much cheaper than some other clean options out there. Tastes great!
 This is a great flavor and I don't even like rockyroad ice cream.
 Great taste. Blends great in blender cups.
 Tastes really good..almost exactly like "Runts" candy, the bananas.  I drink it with water because having chocolate with water has never tasted good to me.  I'll definitely buy this flavor again.
 Nice
 I am Tayeezy. Brooklyn born and I approve this message. Ya diiiiggggg! Will purchase again and to all you haters keep drinking that other back stuff.
 I always like this one. It mixes properly(unlike their casein one). Tastes good. Way cheaper than same product available in stores.
 Chocolate coconut is the best! Delicious. Mixes well. Love the profile of calories carbs protein and amino acids. Really got me off of a body composition plateau.
 Great taste!
 Good stuff.  Double rich chocolate tastes like Nesquik made with water.
 I like the flavor but I think having a variety would be better.  Will have to look to see if another flavor out there appeals to me. But I would definitely recommend this product. High protein to small carb ratio...
 Always just as listed...
 Didn't like the taste and it's not thick at all.
 good
 Great tasting quality protein powder.
 (-) aminogen and (+) sucralose<br/><br/>When companies compromise their quality to make money :|
 I like this protein because its not overly sweat.
 Just got it, smells amazing, great price.
 The  Best.
 luv ON! This is my favorite flavor!
 Great protein great price
 Tastes awesome (a must for me), and mixes well with a variety of items. Highly recommend.
 5/5
 Tastes very good and goes down fairly easy. I wish they had more flavors, but this one will do for now. Gets the job done.
 Always my go to for protein. The flavor is amazing and I would highly recommend either the Milk Chocolate or mocha cappuccino. Only made with the best ingredients.
 cool
 cant go wrong. Finally a protein powder that tastes great, low on cal and carbs and mixes well and not lumpy.
 great quality protein powder
 I had a 5 lb tub of the Double Rich Chocolate before this purchase and this tastes much better.  More rich and sweeter.  I don't consider myself having a sweet tooth but the other chocolate tastes watered-down compared to this.
 The best whey available at a decent price.
 This product is great. Not only does it taste great, but you get fast results. In order to recieve great results, you should be dedicated to going to the gym 4-5 days a week and you should be dedicated to a high-protein, low-fat diet. I got better results by taking this for two weeks then I did by using Muscle Milk for over a month.
 Tastes great mixes well
 Nothing tastes better
 I live this protein! I didn't want to spend the extra 10$ at first but it is amazing!! Mixes super easy, doesn't give you bad gas, and it's all whey isolate! cAnt beat that!
 I love this stuff.  I started out on that cheap crap you find at Walmart or Kroger and was never a fan.  Tasted terrible and never seemed to mix the way it should.  Guess that's why it's cheap.  ON is the opposite of that.  Mixes well even if you're just shaking it and really does taste great.  It's actually something I enjoy drinking and doesn't taste like a "supplement" at all.  And I'm yet to find a better price than here on Amazon.
 arrived on time, like the deal
 At 34$ shipped (subscription), this is the cheapest source of a good protein! Taste is good, Price is good, protein is good = life is good.
 Tastes decent but if you can get a 20oz+ shaker bottle, which I recommend, fill it with chocolate milk, I like whole, it tastes very good, and it also helps me get my protein requirements for the day.
 Gets me swole
 This powder is awesome. It taste great in a smoothie, my favorite being banana, and shaken up in a Blender bottle. There isn't any chalkiness or gross texture either. It has very low sugar too, making it almost all protein for bulking up. Any person serious about getting big needs this product. Without all the heightened cholesterol and large fat intake your body is exposed to eating red meat to get protein, you can rest assured this is going to work sans health issues. I recommend it to anybody looking to build muscle mass.
 5 lbs of gainz
 Best protein on the market for the price!
 Was a gift.  Recipient said it was just what he wanted.  Flavor was great
 Great for recovery got everything I was looking for.
 Very good taste.
 Decent taste...
 The chocolate and vanilla versions taste much better (which isn't saying much). The strawberry flavor is very artificial and more like strawberry milkshake than strawberry.
 Best tasting and value for the money
 Yes, great.
 5 stars for an awesome tasting whey protein.<br/>Always calculate the price per serving and this gives one of the best value besides Dymatize.
 as advertised
 Taste is okay and it has a good amount of protein in it, the artificial flavors and sucralose in many of the flavors are what ruin it for me.  I've switched to grass fed whey isolate which usually costs a little bit more but it's healthier, has a better amino acid profile, and most of the brands selling it don't use any artificial ingredients.  If you're just looking for whey protein and you're not worried about where it comes from or if the mixture contains artificial ingredients, then this stuff is just fine, but if you don't care about any of that stuff then 90% of protein powder out there are fine as well, so I give it 3 stars; it's okay but not great.
 Product Mixes well and tastes good. I use the product as a meal supplement and mix with water.  Have also mixed with milk and with shakes, and that produces a little thicker drink.
 Cake batter is the best.
 Tastes good, no milk needed. Great for pre and post workout.
 Have been purchasing for years!  Completely happy with this product..
 Tastes Great/Great Value. Will certainly purchase again. We have been using for about a month now (2 scoops per day), and we probably have at least a months supply left.
 It tastes great and effective.
 I've tried tons of different protein powders, and ON Gold Standard is one of my favorite.<br/>The only flavor I've tried that I didn't like was the strawberry, just tasted like medicine.  But everything else is delicious.
 Tastes great and gives you energy!  A bit difficult to mix with soy milk but I can expect that growing up on nesquik
 Over last 8 months, I have tried several flavors of these protein drinks. I would say French Vanilla is probably the only one I have little complain about.<br/><br/>French Vanilla - The Best. Very natural mild taste.<br/>Cookies and Cream - I almost throw up. Some medicine taste together with artificial cookies flavor. Will never buy again.<br/>Chocolate Coconut - You could easily feel the artificial coconut flavor. Average.<br/>Chocolate Mint - Mildly bitter taste. My kids don't like it. Below Average. Will not buy again.<br/>Delicious Strawberry - Close to natural strawberry flavor. More sweetened which I don't like. My kids like. Above average.<br/>Extreme Milk Chocolate - Artificial flavor taste. More sweetened. Average.<br/>Double Rich Chocolate - Above average. Strong chocolate flavor as the name says.<br/>Mocha Cappuccino - Taste is not close to Cappuccino drink. Average.
 Was not as much of a fan of this flavor. I can't really describe it other than it does not taste much like chocolate to me.
 Delicious.  Best whey protein powder I've ever bought.
 Great flavor and a lot cheaper than buying little 2 lb tubs. Great product by ON that supplies you with not only the protein needed but also bcaa's
 A++++ Thanks
 I've had a few of their other favors and this one I would say has a good taste.<br/>I would recommend to anyone that likes taste.
 Very high quality whey protein. Has a superior tastes to other products that I have purchased and blends very well without a gritty taste that others have
 Great product received very quickly.
 This stuff mixes very well. The taste is very light when compared to Muscle Milk, but it's really not bad. For the price, you really can't beat it.
 Tasty!
 Awesome!<br/>After painstaking research I found this to be best bang for your buck by far to include amount and quality.
 great!
 I love that Whey protein but chocolate flavor is much better, vanilla is terrible.
 Probably one of the best all round proteins for the $$$.
 Quick shipping  taste  great  super easy to mix
 Second time I buy this product. Works Great.
 Throughout my 4+ years of lifting I have tried many whey protein brands and Optimum Nutrition has provided the best product. It is easy very easy to mix and it also has a satisfying taste. The protein to gram ratio is also good.
 Good stuff.  I don't know the science behind it, but there's a lot of product for a reasonable price and it tastes fine.
 Tastes great. I've been using this stuff for years.
 Great product. It works best for me it helps me recover faster so I can get back in the gym without feeling as much soreness
 Very quality protein
 Finally, a protein shake that's easy to mix by stirring with a spoon AND tastes good when made with water!
 Great!
 Nice flavor
 Very clean protein,  not a lot of ingredients<br/>Would definitely recommend
 Great for an after work out drink or if you just need to add more protein to you diet through out the day. Taste good too, I actually look forward to it after working out, a post work out treat!
 Excellent!!
 This protein is the best mixing protein Ive had.  Even mixing just with water, it isn't as chunky as Syntha-6.
 Very good
 I would recommend to any weight lifter, any level. No additives. I use one scoop after every workout and it has provided a great protein addition to my diet.
 VERY GOOD
 Great brand, great product. Mixes well. Would personally recommend another flavor than "Cookies and Cream". I first tried "Double Chocolate" and it was definitively better in my opinion.
 as always I love this product
 The reason that the 5 lb is better than the 2 lb is because it lasts longer. The best chocolate that I have ever drank, protein or nonprotein. I just smile while I am drinking it and want more.
 Taste Great, works excellent.
 Excellent.
 Great as always
 As advertised
 great! will buy later on again in the furture thank you
 Yes!
 ok
 Best protein on the market!
 best protein on the market and ive tried a ton
 Simply love this.  Drink with water pre-workout, drink with milk and food after.  It really taste great in comparison to other protein powders
 Great tasting, disolved better than other proteins I have tried (I used a blender bottle). Best value I could find on the web.I have definately seen some improvement in physique, though that could be partially from a change in lifestyle.
 i had the banana and it tastes very fine.
 Having tried many different protein shakes and bars, this one is by far the best tasting. It's not dessert or anything, but if you make it with at least half of the liquid as whole milk it's really great for a protein shake. It's not bad made with just water either. With my last pregnancy my OB suggested that I get at least 75g of protein a day (which is quite a bit if you look at nutrition info). I brought in the nutrition label for this product and she approved it as safe for me to have once or twice a day while pregnant. I'd suggest asking your own OB before starting to drink them all the time, but they're the best option in my opinion.
 Pretty good.  Mixes ok.  Tastes good.
 Great flavor.  Great results
 I absolutely will not use any other brand or flavor of whey. ON got it right, and I cannot live without this now.
 IM SO RIPPPPED!!!
 I like it and I use it one time daily but I will recommend it to any one may need it.
 I have tried different flavors of the same brand before, but this one is my favorite. It mixes up nicely in my blender or my shaker cup. Good product
 Came with ziplock top, awesome!
 Decent taste, high protein content and dissolves easily when stirred into water. Not much more to ask for from protein powder.
 perfect
 This product is the best in market dont bother your self by searching here &amp; there. it has a rich and balanced  taste &amp; easily can be disolve into water or milk.
 Very delicious. Uses 8 fl.oz. for scoop and a half. My favorite ratio.
 I bought the cake batter flavor and it is gross... Very bitter... I will not be purchasing this flavor anymore
 Great taste. Use this one for baking.
 Have always loved optimum nutrition!!!
 ive tried many proteins, way better than muscle milk by a mile. second time i got this. dont waste your time with the 5lb bag, just get the 10lb one ahahah.
 the vanilla ice cream flavor is good, but get old after a bit.  will order chocolate next time.
 Great tasting, mixes smooth, and easy on the stomach!
 OP has a reputation for great protein. I used this as a supplement pre and post workout along with large protein and carb meals during the day. I noticed faster muscle recuperation and hypertrophy within the week of consuming this product - it was definitely a boost from my meals. That being said - if you are looking to grow bigger, make sure you take this as a supplement and not a primary source of protein. You simply cannot gain muscle volume through this alone - EAT YOUR CARBS AND ANIMAL/PLANT PROTEIN! I've tried both the vanilla and chocolate flavor and both are great. I've also heard that cookies and cream becomes "too much to handle" after a while. My advice: stick to classic flavors.
 I was using cookies and cream earlier and that was tasty and I enjoyed that having with water. This time I ordered Double Rich Chocolate and there is no taste of chocolate in it, leave alone 'rich'.
 This is the best protein ever, I can mix 2 scoops of protein powder into 14 oz. of water in a shaker cup and its not clumpy and it taste great.
 My son worksout and uses this as part of his program.  Likes the taste and says the price is reasonable. Thanks again
 good
 This is my go-to protein for 15 years. I love this stuff. I think the formula changed about 5 years ago, but it's still the best protein on the market.<br/><br/>Great price, high quantity, high quality, and fair marketing. If you need a protein supplement, this is the product to buy.
 great value
 Great and inexpensive
 Good product.
 Quality protein for the price
 Getting gainz all day everyday.
 Chocolate Coconut! So good!
 Great Product. Tastes better than chocolate in my opinion. Honestly probably the best value for my dollars in the protein market.
 10lbs of Protein! sign me up
 The drink is easy to mix and it taste pretty good. My only complaint is that the protein seems a bit low.
 My son is a 36 year old weight lifter and he loves this stuff.  He says it is a great protein source.
 High % Protein ,Low calories, Excellent Taste
 Great Tasting, and easy to mix
 Awesome
 I love cookies and cream in general, so my rating is a bit bias. I'm sure after a month of drinking this every day, i'm gonna be pretty sick of it.
 Best working out post shake, for years! With excellent taste!
 Always a good bargain!
 Really happy with my purchase. Cheaper than in-store prices around my area. The French Vanilla Creme flavor is good. I like to add ground cinnamon to my shaker cup with it and it tastes like a Horchata. :)
 tastes great and easy to share
 Tastes great, especially with some ice in it!  Fast shipping!
 Works great
 Taste great. AWESOME price
 Took a risk and it is now my favorite flavor so far. I've tried atlas 5 flavors, just to give some context.
 It's great very delicious...and reasonably priced.<br/>This is very good also. We are finding that a lot of supplements are over priced. We appreciate Gold Standards pratice of not gouging it's clients.<br/><br/>We love that too!
 Great taste.  As close to chocolate milk as I could imagine a protein shake.
 Nice. Good quality x costs. It was a nice to my diet. She loved it. Good taste of chocolate. Good
 This Whey Protein is OK.  The taste isn't as good as other whey proteins that I've tried.  It's a good value for the money.
 My go-to protein powder. Tastes great and good nutritional specs. And decent price.
 use it every morning
 Got to me quick. Tastes good and mixes good in my ninja blender. No complaints
 This is the second time I bought this. The taste is even better this time.
 Just started working out and I drink two servings of this afterwards.  The flavor is tasty and i'm already starting to see the gains.
 The smell alone makes me want to go out and pump some iron just so I can justify guzzlin down a scoop of this fine grade protein. Not only have I noticed a size increase but a drastic increase in the amount of babes walkin into my life!
 Great product and always delivered on time...
 gold star product whey protein with amino ..... awsome
 Great product and received on time as described!
 It's good.
 I've tried about 2 other whey protein shakes besides this and this mixes the best. It also tastes good, I bought the double chocolate, haven't tried the other ones.
 Best whey protein in the market according to my research and other reviews. Chocolate flavor is good if you like chocolate.
 buen producto
 I love this product for its taste, not too sweet. the double chocolate mixing with milk taste like smoothie ..... hmmm. I love it. Recommend this product.
 The taste is amazing the only thing is i have yet to find the measuring cup. I dont know if its not included or if mine is at the bottom but it was pretty annoying
 Does not taste as good as some of their other flavors
 muy bueno
 Great flavor (Mokaccino)
 I have never set taste as a very high priority when determining what brand to go with. I could always just wolf it down. This is by far the tastiest protein shake I've ever had(i am big into bananas). Tastes great with low-fat milk or water. I will update with results in the coming weeks because i just began using this product along with my second time through p90x( first time through was last year)
 My favorite protein by far!  They have the most variety in flavors that I've seen and this is one of the proteins recommended by the gym I go to.
 My son loves this brand
 I typically use the Yoli Yes shake and still prefer it but thought I would check this out and it seems to be an "OK" sub.
 This is my go to protein powder.  It mixes easily which is a big factor.  I have used it in smoothies, milk, water, and oatmeal and never had an issue with clumping.  The artificial sweetner is probably the biggest downside but I have not been overwhelmed by current research out so I go with it.  For the price this is one of my favorite and has a good protein to serving size ratio which is also nice.
 The milk chocolate has to be the best one of these I have tried yet
 Tastes good, doesn't mix as well as other powders I've tried
 i've been using this product for 4 years now and im very satisfied with it. i would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a protein powder that is low in sugar and has a higher protein concentration per scoop than most other products
 best mixing protein aroud and at an awesome price.
 Best protein ever! - flavor variety is big, extra milk chocolate tastes great! 5 pound tub is huge, enough for a very long time)
 I've tried a number of other proteins and this one gives a better result for me.  I have also tried 5 other flavors from this brand and prefer the chocolate malt.
 Awesome  product!
 Fast shipper great products!
 👍🏼
 good
 Seal was broken also the cover when you take off the cap was also opened i am very unhappy with what i have paid for especially considering shipping and custom duty fees..
 Tastes fairly good and mixes alright.
 yum
 Is it 24g of protein per serving?  I have no idea.  Does it taste good.  Yes.  Does it mix easily?  Yes.<br/><br/>Will I keep buying ON Whey?  Of course.
 Great product, a very clean protein.
 I've been using this whey for over a year and it's definetly taste good compared to other products.
 Very essential if you want to bulk up. My second one this year, and will be getting new one petty soon.
 Been using this for years.. This is as good as it gets. 💪
 Good taste. I mix it with creatine,bcaa. Flax seeds, oatmeal, milk , banana and it taste amazing
 This protein powder blend is one of the best I've tried.  I first used the product in 2003.  Almost 10 years and it's still one of my most preferred recovery drinks after weight lifting, running, or martial arts.  The protein is hydrolyzed and can be blended into a fruit-protein-shake or works well with powder + water in a shaker bottle.  Research different brands and professional metrics per brand on bodybuilding.com to be sure this is what you need.  Particularly important is the low metal count found in the Optimum brand.  I found the unadvertised low metal values of this product to be quite acceptable for the price and excellent quality!<br/><br/>TRAIN HARD WIN EASY!!
 I gave 2 stars because hate is a strong word. Really dissapointed is the best description for the following reason. I had been very pleased with this product in every way after receiving several 5lb bottles of it, until all of a sudden I received one which was different in texture, taste and results. It seemed diluted when compared to the last bottles I had ordered. I really like the type of protein, the great taste even with water, etc. But when this last bottle came it took 2-3 scoops to even approach the flavor and consistency of 1 scoop of the last bottle. So, thinking this was a fluke I sent it back and requested a new bottle, same thing. I tried one more time and still the appearance, taste, everything seemed very diluted. I would to love to have this back at its original strength. I am a healthcare provider and people ask me for recommendations for these type of products and I also share with collegues who are health conscious (no, not all of us are...unfortunately!). So please correct this problem. In the mean time I will be using a different product. Not sure which yet.
 Good quality protein.  I got double chocolate and was quite pleased.  Great price, pretty good taste, and most importantly high in protein and low in calories.  I turned to this protein when I noticed that while I was gaining muscle w/ my old protein, I was gaining fat too b/c of the high calorie content (due to sunflower oil being the second ingredient from what I remember).  I got strawberry flavor the second time I bought this protein.  Not bad tasting, but extra artificial tasting compared to chocolate.
 you know it's the best...just buy it.
 Top
 I love this whey powder. Its so good in taste and quick in mixing with any drink
 such a good flavor!
 Tastes great, mixes well in a shaker bottle. So good it's hard to not want to drink it when I haven't worked out.
 My favorite protein ever. Best taste. Best ingredients. Optimum Nutrition is the best.
 Tastes good
 Love this product. It's the only whey we will buy.
 Good taste, good mixing ability, good price, and low carb. This protein works great for me. Mix with milk and you're set.
 Great stuff, drastically reduces recovery time after any workout or labor intensive day.
 Great Product . ! Great taste ! Great quality ;)<br/>Hands down fave protein .
 Muy buen resultado 💪💪💪💪💪💪💪
 will always use this brand and flavor. hands down the best results and best price.
 Good product. Other proteins caused stomach reactions but this one is great. Tastes great too! Will be buying more!
 Using it since several years. Product is the best. Packaging and price also great.
 I bought this for my boyfriend just because. He is big into protein and he was running out! it was basically the same as what you'd get in store without me having to try and find a place to get it at! it was shipped quick and maybe even a little cheaper then the people at gnc would have bargained me for. it was a huge 5 lb tub but i'm pretty sure amazon shipped it for free. really great service!!
 I dont buy any other brand .
 This is about as good of a product as you will find for the price! I switched to this protein powder a couple of years ago, and for me it's a perfect supplement for increasing lean muscle mass with proper exercise and diet. I was blessed pretty good genetics and a high metabolism (I gradually lose weight when I quit working out for an extended period of time), so this helps me rebuild more quickly after taking long breaks. For those trying to shed the pounds, this is still a superb supplement because it's low calorie and isn't filled with a bunch of junk that your body doesn't need.
 Thanks!
 Good stuff here.
 ON Whey Gold Standard has been recommended by everybody I've read. I've been buying it from Amazon for about a year now. Rocky Road &gt; Double Chocolate &gt; Cookies n' Cream<br/><br/>The only complaint is the scoop usually comes buried somewhere in the middle, but it's a problem with all the other brands. I just reuse the one from previous batch.
 My golden meal for building muscle.
 Best in the business.
 I don't think I can find any other quality whey for the money. My biggest concern is the heavy metal content, which gold standard is the lowest(except for the more expensive ON hydrowhey).
 Pleased with product quality. I would buy again. Delivery was fast.
 My local nutrition store have this product about 20 dollars more expensive. Good deal lasts me about 2 months. Optimum Nutrition Whey is good quality if not the best Whey isolate out there.
 Good product
 The cookies and cream flavor of the Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Whey tastes delicious. The mixability is very good. There are even tiny pieces of cookie in the powder (amazing).
 Lots of protein and tastes good too.
 This is a #1 protein supplement
 Love this stuff! Awesome price too!
 i love this protein
 Delicious.
 Tastes good with milk, don't even think of trying it with water. What to say, muscles getting bigger ...
 I've been using Optimum Nutrition for a few years now and find that it works just fine for my pre and post workout nutrition.
 love it
 Love the flavor.
 Good protein shake, taste is not soo bad, low in fat and sugar.
 Tastes amazing, great packaging, I would recommend this seller to others! I plan on trying other flavors as well following this purchase of ON's whey protein!
 thank you
 Tastes like Milo
 love it priced well
 Full of proteins.
 Great Product
 Good
 Hands down, best powder I've tried.
 get buff
 Great deal, great product
 Best whey experience period, mostly in regards to how easily it mixes. No globs no fuss.
 Very satisfied, will buy again.
 There's a reason why it's rated #1. This is the only way to go and has great tasting flavors, well so far I have only tried chocolate and vanilla, but it's perfect.<br/><br/>I have had probably about a dozen different brands of whey protein and this is hands down the best. No foamy or synthetic tasting stuff here.<br/><br/>Nothing left to say except "buy some".
 Great price and fast shipping for some of the best whey protein out there.
 Best price for quality
 Love this flavor - I hate vanilla so this is great and mild as to not overpower other flavors I want to add to my shake - like PB or coffee
 ok
 Good flavor
 Great stuff, I am hooked!
 awesome thank you
 good powder
 This is by far my favorite brand of Protein and the best flavor (Strawberry Banana) It may be harder to find but I enjoy drinking this every day! Price is great and quality &amp; taste of protein is the best by far.
 This is my second 5 lb of this product.  The flavor is somewhat sweet but if you add more water it's easier, or you can just think of it as a milkshake.  Gold Standard is a well known brand and the amount of protein is better than what I had been using. I keep a smaller container in my gym bag and replenish from this 5 lb tub.  Purchasing in bulk like this is a money saver.
 Flavor is pretty good especially if you like blended strawberry banana shakes which I drink after every workout. A little pricey but you're paying for quality. This makes hitting your protein macros easier.
 Great for those who workout on a regular basis.
 ON makes the best stuff, truly worth every penny. I'm sure you could search around and find something with a better profile but good luck with that. Any time I try a new product I compare it to ON 100% Whey. It is very much a gold standard.
 Yuck. I got through about a third of this and just threw it out. Way too sweet.
 I have finished my first 5lb tub of GS Whey, and I'm impressed. It tastes acceptable, is easy to drink, and for the most part, it sits in my stomach fine.  I use this for my breakfast and post workout supplement.  I feel I'm benefiting from the protein.  Mocha was good, but I'm trying double chocolate this time.  I highly recommend it for those trying to lose weight or gain weight.
 Cannot beat it for the price...
 Best tasting with the best results for me!
 Tastes great. Large enough quantity where I don't have to reorder for a couple of months. Love it!
 Mixed amazing but taste like crap
 The best whey protein out there, in my opinion.  Tastes decent, but I'm not looking for taste in this type of product anyway.  Definitely recommend this to anyone buying protein supplements.
 THX
 Been using this product for years. Usually buy the double rich chocolate but the chocolate mint is pretty good too. Bit of a weird aftertaste.
 Tastes good and mixes with about anything.  Prices are high though.
 best value for your dollar
 great product, mixes well even with water, strong chocolate taste, highly recommended
 Great product but the after taste is terrible...you get used to it about 1/3 through. Great product but I will not order this flavor again.
 Awesome like always!
 This protein powder (I got the double chocolate) is really tasty and blends smoothly into COLD liquids (don't put it in hot liquid or it will turn into cat food).
 This whey tastes great and has all the protein I need. The price is great too!
 Great product.  Good taste.
 Good stuff!
 I have used gold standard in the past. unquestionably, coffee is my favorite flavor so far. previous was double chocolate.
 Deeee-lish.  Tastes like chocolate milk.
 Unless I get a deal on some off brand protein, ON is the way to go for protein, and literally just about anything else. The quality is excellent and there's not a lot of extra crap in the protein. Hence the good protein to serving size ratio. Perfect mixability, never any clumps, and the taste is always spot on. This is truly the gold standard.
 good taste wish it wasnt as sweet not much sugar but a lot of splenda im sure
 I dont feel the Cookies &amp; cream gets enough love. I have vanilla, white chocolate, Strawberry banana, double rich chocolate. This one and the double rich chocolate is the best.
 Excelent Product.
 Taste good, although white chocolate taste pretty artificial but not bad with just water.  Haven't tried adding milk or anything else but great for price.
 I just wish it came with a plastic scoop. Regardless, it's a great deal for the same delicious tasting powder.
 I've been using this only through my whole life. And I will not change my protein.
 Excellent
 Great Value and great taste!
 I and my wife use this everyday, and it is working beautifully well gives us enough protein our body needs. The quality<br/>And economy is good too.
 I bought the coffee-flavored whey protein just to realize that it's not just coffee FLAVORED, but rather the second ingredient is coffee.  So it's actually whey protein plus coffee.  Each scoop contains 40mg of caffeine.  I take 2.5 scoops, so that's equivalent to a full cup of coffee.
 taste great. easy to mix
 This ON protein mixes well and is super high quality just like all of their proteins and Cake Batter has to be one of my favorites.
 the best protein on the market by far, and I have tried several
 Could taste better
 Strawberry banana is not as good as regular strawberry or banana. Seems to be less solid than the others I have had.
 I use his product as part of a diet plan my Doctor recommended.  Mixed with Almond Dream with coconut milk, this is a very satisfying, low carb treat.  Also a great price!
 I ordered this as a supplement b/c it's quite hard to get all the protein you need in one day from food. As most bars and shakes, especially power bars and muscle milk, taste disgusting, my hopes weren't high. In fact, when mixed with just water, this shake is hard to down. But with milk and some cocoa powder, it's fantastic. Tastes just like a frosty.<br/><br/>1 scoop of powder<br/>1/4 cup of powdered milk<br/>2 tbs of cocoa powder<br/><br/>350 calories, 39g of protein, 1g of fat<br/><br/>Sometimes, I add in a tbs of peanut butter and that makes it more of a desert treat, but IMO, adds unneeded fat and calories as the taste is still superb without it. This is far better than any other shake/bar I've tried, and I've had lots of them.
 Best whey protein out there
 Excellent Product!
 Loved this protein, the taste is not bad.  Mixes really easy in the nutribullet.
 I love the taste.
 Use this twice a day and it taste soo goooood
 Tastes great!
 Very good product
 Tastes very good, especially with milk.
 I have found this to be the best protein<br/>as it has extra nutrition. I had purchased<br/>this for my son, however, I started using it<br/>also. I am highly lactose intolerant.<br/>This is the only brand I have found that I can<br/>digest. Of course I did not look further after<br/>finding this one. This was the best price so it was a<br/>terrific buy.
 you can't beat the price plus offered under amazon prime.  This is a great protein and would suggest anyone who lifts of is trying to maintain muscle mass to use it.
 I'd believe if someone said its just a chocolate milk powder! I just love the tastes! I just have it whenever because...it just tastes really good and i can't help myself haha What a great product!
 Great product. Does it's job.
 I've been using O.N. Products for years. As for this one, I've been using after taking a break from lifting for a while. Starting this a few weeks ago, I've managed to pick my strength back up and see immediate gains in lifting. I only take 1 scoop in the morning in a shake, and that's it. Many people stack the protein throughout the day as suggested on the container, which shouldn't be done. This stuff works well, and is more efficient if you don't take it multiple times a day, reason being your kidneys can only process so much protein at once and the waste just builds up and can destroy your organs. Just be smart about using it. There aren't enough disclaimers out there about supplements.<br/><br/>As far as this protein, the flavor is great, the size is affordable, and this stuff helps your body recover and grow mass, while still cutting you. It i definitely one of the leaner proteins out there.
 Excellent quality. revived on time. great price
 Its called gold standard for a reason. It's great tasting and high quality protein. I stopped drinking it for a few years and I feel they refined their formula and now it tastes even better.
 In my humble opinion...this is the best.
 Always a good buy
 just fine
 I can't talk about the effectiveness of this protein, not sure how much difference the brands really make, but this one doesn't seem to have any really nasty ingredients as others have pointed out.<br/><br/>I got bot the strawberry banana and the cookies 'n cream.<br/><br/>the strawberry banana is freaking gross unless you blend it with milk and a banana / Peanut butter.<br/><br/>Cookies and cream is pretty good.<br/><br/>all in all, its protein...i don't think it will ever taste like a gourmet meal
 One of the best whey protein powders out there, and this is by far the best value I've found anywhere!!!
 It's pretty tasty with, especially with milk. But there isn't a whole lot of coconut flavor there.
 Everything good
 Taste very bad I don't like it
 This is easily the best power mix I have ever used. Not only does it taste great and break up easily when mixed, i have seen results.
 We prefer the Chocolate flavor.
 Great high quality protein for the money.  Mixes well and tastes good.
 Terrible taste. Do not even try it.
 Does the job
 Good flavor.  Mixes well.
 Good product
 Definitely worth the money! Saves you cash by buying in bulk rather than little 2 lb tubs. Great flavor as well!
 Perfect.
 amazing product highly recommended.. will continue to buy this product for my work outs. check it out best product yet.
 This whey powder is by-far the best product I've tasted. I've also shown a lot of growth in pure muscle after using it. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a great protein supplement. Just mix with milk or water and you're set.
 Great stuff! Easy on my stomach and holds me over until the meal after my workout. Everything else out there is bull. Isolate is the way to go.
 The best !!!!!
 Great price and very tasty. The powder mixes well, there are never any clumps of unmixed powder floating around. Great even when it is only mixed with water.
 I enjoy the taste and the price is great. I will continue to purchase this product.
 Perfect!
 Taste good and is great.
 You pay a premium for "whey isolate".  Why?  Because it's such a pure form and Hydrolysate whey spikes your insulin.  Well guess what, the geni at ON decided to use the ONE artificial sweetener that spikes insulin as well.  I wasted $60 on this tub.  Why would you use Acesulfame Potassium?  I've ingested this stuff for the past three mornings and totally killed any fat burning I was doing upon awaking.
 This is the best for the price.
 Great stuff!
 Good product! I love it. Really help my muscles.
 Too expensive
 The good stuff! Nothing compares..
 Product works well as expected, have bought it several times and will keep doing so.
 Protein taste great, not to much water and will taste sweet. I prefered Extreme Milk Chocolate protein
 I blend with actual coffee, this and their coffee flavor are my two favorite flavors by far. I use this every day
 I got choclate malt it tastes pretty good . This is my first time trying optimum nutrition protein and the shiping was superfast ordered it on friday and it came on monday ! Over all loved everything
 Perfect
 Its the only Protein powder I use and I like it. I usually get the Double Rich Chocolate.
 I love this flavor and product. Nice milky chocolate flavor, mixes well, great protein source. Optimum Nutrition is generally great!
 Best ever
 Good product overall, just not my favorite flavor!
 The taste is good with milk or substitute and ok with water. nice product with good results will buy again
 Pros: Mixes well. Tastes Good. Great value price.<br/>Cons: sealing the bag was difficult. Found for cheaper price on other websites.<br/>I would purchase this again.
 Love it, tastes great, makes my protein intake very regular and easy. The chocolate taste is very natural, not like many other artificial nasties you often get in protein powders.
 The plastic seal was unopened but had powder all over the container when I took it out of the box. When I opened the lid the paper cover was already open. I do not know if it was already open or if it some how opened during the process of the delivery. It makes no sense why they would ship an open container. The time of shippment was good but the powder was all over the container and the second seal was open. The delivery was messy and the open cover seems suspicious, not sure if I should try it. Don't know how much powder was suppose to be in the container because the powder was all over the container therefore, I do not know how full it was initially. In general the delivery and presentation of the product was a dissapointment.
 This protein is the best out there. It's clean and really helps with recovery. I saw a lot of gains when taking this product.
 Good
 Good
 Tastes delicious great deal!
 Have been using this stuff for years, it is the perfect balance between quality and price.
 Amazing!
 Great taste and dissolves easily.
 Great product.  Exactly as described.  Does everything it says it will do.  Has an OK but not great taste.  Came in fast time and perfect condition.  Would recommend!
 Good taste!
 I've used this protein for a while. Typical whey protein.
 Great, cheap, quality protein. Tastes great too
 Been getting this stuff for a while, great for breakfasts and post workouts. Tastes fantastic, mixes easy. Wont go back to anything else.
 I love this stuff more than U M P
 This protein is my favorite, love the flavor.
 This review is simple: a great protein to supplement your goals, with a delicious taste.  Optimum Nutrition Chocolate Mint tastes like "Thin Mint" Girl Scout cookies.
 Great product.
 Great
 I've tried many brands over the years and ON Gold Standard is by for the best and for 2 reasons. 1: It works.  2- Tastes great when mixing with water.
 My son loves this stuff!
 Best protein powder on the market.
 I take this every morning as my breakfast withThe Amazing Grass Green Superfood shake add I also put fruit in it
 taste great!
 I got the strawberry flavor. It is uber tasty, and mixes well. My suggestion:<br/>8oz Soy milk, or water<br/>handful of blueberries, and a small bit o ice..<br/><br/>awesome shake for anytime.
 I tried the samplerpack before purchasing the 5 lbs tub. This was my favourite flavour it is almost passable for chocolate milk. The nutritional stats speak for themselves.
 Very good!
 Cheap, effective protein. Always love it
 The flavor is really good when mixed with sweetened almond milk or 2% milk. It is a good post workout supplement.
 Chocolate Mint is much better. This stuff does not taste very good, but I'll still finish it off because I payed for the protein not the taste.
 Tried other brands but this taste the best and I think it works pretty well.
 :)
 I've always loved this protein. Low carbs, high protein, good taste.
 Excellent customer service. Excellent product. I recommend this seller to everyone. I will definitely buy more.
 Have had good results - and it tastes good too
 ON provides great products, and their 100% Whey is no exception. Low in fat and calories; high in protein, BCAAs and taste. ON's 100% Whey mixes easily with no clumping. This is the only protein for me.
 Love it, not loaded with sugar
 It is what it is, wxpensive but it's really good!
 Great for shakes and also used frequently in baking with excellent results.
 Great protein for a great value.  Taste is just a bit above average, but the quality of the protein makes this product A+.
 Taste great!!
 High quality protein...pretty good taste when mixed with milk and served very cold. Will order again for sure.
 I had to switch it up from Double Chocolate, and this was a refreshing flavor.  Tastes like girl scout thin mints.  ON puts out great supplements and this one lives up to their reputation.
 Great product and alot cheaper than what i would pay at the store and for similar product. recommend it to others best bang for your buck
 Never been disappointed using Whey protein, great value for the money.
 Mixes well, tastes great and is great for you. Casein protein from animal products are harmful for you body. 100% whey protein is very beneficial and this deal was a steal. $98 for 10 pounds of this. Can't ask for a better deal.
 Best Protein I have found. Taste great with water. Strawberry is my favorite!
 En una proteína muy buena para usarla en cualquier momento del día, idealmente para usarla después de entrenar, el sabor es agradable.
 fast shipment and no damage!
 taste very good, mixed with ice and milk in a blinder then you will have something similar to mcdonald milk shake/ smoothie
 Very big! Great size for the cost! Bought it for my bf hasn't started using it but reviews have been great.
 Affordable, double chocolate is a great flavor
 The stuff works great, and it does not leave me with a werid aftertaste like my last protein powder.  I ordered another flavor today, and I am excited to try it!
 the best
 Great product!
 can't beat this deal
 Best tasting protein powder.
 best protien by far and is worth every penny
 is good
 This protein is pretty good. The choclate tastes good, fairly few calories and 24 grams or close of protein. I consider it decent mid grade protein. good bang for your buck.
 The rocky road flavor is delicious. Great value and great quality.
 Tastes great to me, and I love how much you get for the price.
 Good flavor
 Taste good and excellent results
 Did its job well. I recommend Dymatize 100 over this though. More protein with less carbs and sugar. But you can't go wrong with Optimum Nutrition. There's a reason they call it the "Gold Standard"... Basically the Apple, Inc. of proteins... Not the best, but one of the best tasting (chocolate milk flavors) and by no means "bad" protein (see Muscle Milk).
 All of The Optimum Nutrition Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard, are all worth every penny. Amazing taste and excellent quality protein!!<br/><br/>Well Done!!
 I've been buying Gold Standard as my protein of choice.  The double chocolate tastes great and is a welcomed treat after a hard workout.
 Supreme protein for pre and post workout!
 excellent
 Best on the market. Easy to mix
 Great protein. As advertised and I prefer any of the chocolate flavors even though I haven't tried them all
 Great product!!! Thank you so much!
 Really happy with the white chocolate. It's delicious!
 its good but to plain for my taste. otherwise a great additive for oatmeal, shakes, etc
 Love this stuff, it works phenomenal. Best protein powder I have ever used. Definitely recommend it to anyone looking to help build muscle.
 the taste is good, and it is a good product!
 it's a renowned brand and it has a great number of fans. It tastes good and it can help me to enhance my strengh, I love it because I'm a sports lover
 Wow! value for money
 Good cheap and does the job it's suppose to. It does exactly what it says on the back of the tub.
 Love it. The price is a little high but the quality is excellent and I'm seeing  the result quickly. I would highly recommend this product.
 Best protein powder I have ever used.  I place it in my coffee in the morning and it always mixes easily and stays mixed.
 It was good
 reliable as always
 Great taste, great product
 This is the the meat and potatoes of protein. It's classic, and has never failed me.
 Mixes very smooth, tastes delicious... just a tad pricier than other options out there.
 UPDATE: don't know how fresh it is, haven't even used half of the protein and it doesn't seal whatsoever.  Cheap quality zip!<br/><br/>Great protein as usual with awesome % of protein.  I do NOT know why they changed the way the bag is sealed though.  The new design with a zipper like mechanism SUCKS.  It doesn't close and always ends up having a hole midway through the ziplock mechanism.  Not sure if I would buy it again because it is a hassle getting the damn thing to close and we've had to use clips to try and "seal" it.
 Shipped very quickly. Bought the bag a while ago and I'm only half way through. 10 lbs is the way to go to gain muscle.
 Great taste and great price for this product
 Perfect
 This product is very good. It everything that i expected and I do not have any regret. I recomended it.
 Taste great
 This whey mixes so easily with any beverage I choose.
 The best Whey Protein in the market. I really recomend it. It tastes delicious. I love it.
 Excellent product
 Awesome!
 I bought the coffee flavored version and this along with some milk taste great. Very high quality protein that disssolves easily with no clumps.
 really good and works well
 I am using following a proper diet for muscle hypertrophy and has given me very good results in the short term I encourage you to use. It is very effective
 loved it
 Ive always taken optimum protein. Nice and lean protein. Not a strong taste which I'm okay with. Mixes great with water, all you need is a spoon!
 What you'd expect
 ON gold standard whey is one of the best wheys I have bought based on its price range. It does what it says and it helps you after a tough day at the gym. It's easy to use and the scoop sizes are not gigantic but fair towards your body. Also the taste is not the best but is very significant improvement compared to other low quality brands. Other brands I count even drink the protein without mixing fruits but this product I could drink easily without doing anything although it is best to add things you like in the protein shake. All in all it's a great product and an investment because you are basically investing in yourself. This whey will help you gain muscle and weight depending on your intake and gym workout but I would reccomend this product to people who are going to or plan to go to the gym. It can really boost you along he way.
 I have been having this for a many months now. Its a highly rated economical product with nice taste and I dont get bored by it. I see myself sticking to this product for a long time.
 You never go wrong with this brand!
 Best stuff ever!!!
 good product
 I have been using this for 2 years, best Whey protein in the market. This is my favorite flavor, and goes great with milk and instant coffee. Highly recommended!
 It's protein.
 Very good flavor! No funny aftertaste!
 I use this protein powder in the morning, afternoon and after my workout with a scoop of Casein, Will recommend!!!
 I go through one of these every month and have never had any issues. I keep debating to switch flavors, but this is good enough for me.
 It's called gold standard for a reason. Lives up to it's name and will last you a while. Tastes great too!
 Best protein
 Best protein on market !
 Possibly the best tasting protein I've ever had.  Not nearly as sweet as most of the other flavored powders I've had.  Mixes great with water in a shaker cup.
 Good product!
 Best flavor protein ever!
 Best protein out there for the money.  I stay with this stuff. Buy it in larger quantity for best value.
 I try to avoid meat as much as I can.  Taking 2 scoops a day with smoothies.<br/><br/>21/10/16 - update<br/>Recently found out that sucralose (chlorinated sugar) alters gut microbiota  ...]. For years I have been searching and avoiding things that causes GI distress. After I stopped taking this, I feel much better. ON makes quality products but they need to remove the artificial sweetner so I am changing the rating to 1 star. I started taking unflavored bcaa supplement and the rest from food.
 Good product and service. Just wish the price would stop going up...
 Taste okay
 Compared to all the other Whey protein offerings, ON 5 pounds is the best value for money!
 Taste great just what I need thank you
 Great quality, prompt delivery, and tastes great too.
 I Love this protein powder!!! It has a great taste, not chalky and dissolves well.
 the best
 Me encanto...
 Great tasting protein complex!
 Great taste!! I use this stuff mainly as a post-workout supplement, and sometimes in a morning protein shake. If I'm watching calories, I mix it with good ole H2O, and it still has a good taste. If I'm not watching calories, I mix it with nonfat milk, peanut butter, and bananas, and it's absolutely incredible! Try it!
 Only protein I will buy, Not full of junk or fillers.
 My Favorite protein Powder, taste is 9/10.<br/>Blend is 9.5/10
 Tastes really good and mixes well with milk or water!
 Works well with milk, gives you protein. Its a good value for what you get. What more could you ask for in a protein powder?
 BEST PROTEIN, NO EXTRAS NEEDED.
 Excellent product.
 As advertised
 excelente producto, proteina de altisimo nivel, la recomiendo para despues del entreno, gran precio para este gran producto, especialmente en la presentacion de 5 libras
 love it
 my gainz can only be explained by the steroids in this tub of powder.
 The double chocolate is really good. I do one cup water, one cup 0% milk, and one scoop of ON (sometimes two if I need to hit my protein for the day). The +2 scoops makes it really delicious, but I get most of my protein through chicken and tilapia so there's really no need. I ordered the big 10 lbs. bag, and it is totally worth it. I don't think I will run out until June or so!<br/><br/>I had previously owned and used the Walmart Body Fortress Whey (for almost 2 years), but some guy ran a protein analysis on all the major brands and the percent protein of the BF brand was around 40% claimed, whereas the ON Whey was around 90-92% claimed protein content. I switched to ON right after reading that. Sure, there were flaws with his study, but a 40% protein content is significant, and I don't think it could be wholly attributed to systematic error. Switched to be sure anyway. Get ON! It tastes good, and it works for a decent price.
 Excellent product
 Such a good deal!
 good deal
 Delicious, but don't drink it with water. It's much better with milk, or black coffee if you're trying to cut calories.
 This may be the best whey I've ever had. It tastes great and dissolves easily. What more do you want?
 With fitness, there is only one right way to get in shape, and that is to eat right and exercise. If you want to add a bit of hard muscle, this is the stuff to get, I was already kind of built, but I can literally feel the hardness density of my muscle has greatly increased. This particular flavor goes great with Light Vanilla Silk (soy milk).
 Just as described and tastes pretty good.
 Mixes easily.  Tastes good.  Has a good percentage of protein per serving.
 Recommend for the coffee flavor, it is awesome!
 arrived on time and as described
 Taste good to me, love it
 Tastes great, doesn't clump. Great product. Wish it was cheaper though.
 This product taste great and it dissolves fast. Good amount of servings and would highly recommend this product to anyone
 my go-to general purpose protein. Seems to mix up fairly smooth. I don't notice the taste much when I use this to make things like smoothies or pancakes or something but It does have a slight taste when I just mix it with water. If you're looking for a REAL serious chocolate taste make sure you add powdered baking chocolate to it.
 It's just good
 really like it, help me a lot，
 Best taste imo.
 Love it! Tastes great!
 Helped me gain 50lb after basic training, that's something.
 The real stuff.  I love ON.. Can't go wrong.
 Optimum Nutrition is an excellent brand that i have been using for years. I ordered the double rich chocolate flavor and will more than likely order the same next time.
 Excellent protein (80g/100g) for a great price!
 One of the better bang for your bucks Whey.  My go to flavor from Gold Standard.  Was able to get free shipping with Prime as well.
 best
 Perfect.
 Best tasting protein I've ever had.  Recently got the Choco mint as well, and this one is better tasting.
 el producto es muy bueno, un suplemento para subir de masa muscular y aumentar la energia en el entrenamiento. hay que usarlo despues del ejercicio
 Great product !
 I've been using this stuff for years. Really good price, flavor and results. Would definitely recommend. Banana is the best flavor though.
 Tastes great. Mixes easily.
 Like the taste better than any others I've tried.
 The Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard, Double Rich Chocolate, is the most delicious protein I have ever tasted. It is perfect for oatmeal breakfast mix with sliced bananas as well as a protein shake with soy milk. The aroma contributes to the taste as it is an aroma that overtakes your taste buds and makes you want to take a spoon and just eat the protein.
 By far my favorite protein!
 it's a great product.
 Anyone looking to get quality protein at a reasonable price should look into this product.  Super great stuff and I highly recommend it!
 Excellent
 I first tried a 2lb container of the 'Natural Strawberry' and loved it.  I mix it with bluebrries and it's a great way to start the day.  I liked it so much that my next order was for the 5lb container. I thought I was getting the same thing - strawberry, but the 5lb was 'delicious strawberry' and it's not good in comparison.  It's got a plastic artificial sweetener taste that is so overpowering I can't even taste the blueberries.  Be careful when selecting a flavor.  The product mixes well and I definitely feel better... more energy.
 Exactly what I wanted
 Great product at a great price. If you're looking to add more protein to your diet it's a good bang for your buck.
 helps me feel much better the next morning. i plan on ordering more once mine runs out in 3 more weeks.
 Our son thought his dad looked too skinny and tired at 74. So I ordered this product. In one month, my husband has regained his weight/pep and is much more focused and lucid. I see a correlation between this and taking the "Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard".  I'm thinking about taking it myself since I've seen such an Improvement in him.
 Probably the best protein supplement out there. and for this price you get 75 servings. seriously a bargain. it lasts quite awhile. ncaa approved too
 Tasty and given very positive reviews by my personal nutritionist.
 After so many positive experiences with ON's casein protein, I thought this would be a slam dunk. It was far from it.<br/><br/>I don't know if I happened to receive a tainted or "unofficial" product. It was supplied by Amazon, so I assume it was legit.<br/><br/>That said... this was the absolute grossest protein I've tried in 10 years of using protein products. It was so bitter that I could not stand it when mixed with greek yogurt. It had a very odd behavior to liquify in any base I added it to, so it wasn't possible to make a thick shake with it. In order to make it palatable, I had to throw in a half scoop of another brand.<br/><br/>When I sampled a pinch directly from the container, it had a waxy, sticky residual feel and almost no discernible flavor. The only way I can describe this product is "weird" when compared with every other protein I've used. I'm not even sure this is protein.<br/><br/>When I see other people's reviews, it really makes me think that this MUST have been some kind of switcharoo, because I can't believe that people use and enjoy this on a regular basis. I'm tempted to get a small sample to compare with what I have, so if it's truly not the right product, I can alert Amazon to the issue.<br/><br/>Anyway... this is total barf, and unless you enjoy that kind of thing, steer clear. Please note, the same does not apply to ON's casein, which I strongly recommend. Just the whey. Yuck. Bleh. NO.
 This is way better than I thought it would be!  Delicious and well worth it!  I love it, thank you!
 Great product with an amazing taste . Showed up on time and with everything promised. Very happy with my purchase
 This taste awesome!
 tastes great, works great, breaks up very well. I would suggest taking it with some milk! You can't tell its a protein shake.
 The double chocolate is my go to Whey protein. I have been using this for over a decade and it has helped me regain muscle weight after two abdomina surgery where I've lost 10-20 pounds, and being only 100 pounds, that is a lot of weight. Dangerously low weight. Thanks to Standard Gold Whey, I am now at 108 after three weeks of taking this protein with a nutritious diet and daily workout to re-build my muscles.
 Seriously the best protein you can buy.  There is nothing more I can say about it that needs to be said.
 The good thing about this product is how easy it mixes with water. I tried cellucor whey too. Cellucor whey is a little bit sweeter and more expensive. I would still prefer optimum nutrition whey over cellucor.  I got animal whey too in cinnamon bun, and banana cream, but haven't taste it yet. Animal whey got more flavors,  that's the reason why I got two. But all this products are good whey powders.
 good product
 Realer than real deal Holyfield.
 I use it in strawberry smoothies or occasionally just in yogurt.  It mixes well even without the blender and tastes good.
 I've ordered this three times now for my husband and he loves it! I will keep ordering this product.  I
 Tastes so good. I get one scope after working out and think it has been effective. My muscles have got bigger and stronger.
 Great product. I recommend!
 Good product with great taste.  No complaints.
 Best Protein powder on the market for the price!!!
 Extreme Milk Chocolate tastes great.  This is my go to protein.
 Only protein powder i use and it easy to digest.
 Good product and it also has a good taste. I can see the change in first two weeks by taking only on the days I workout.
 Great for post workouts
 Awesome flavor
 This is a pretty large jug but I don't care because it tastes great and goes well with a ton of other foods. Would buy again.
 Excellent
 as described
 This is the best protein I have ever used. The taste is not the greatest  but pound for pound this stuff is the best in the industry. And if you buy from Amazon, they have the best customer service and shipping I have ever seen. I highly recommend this product through Amazon.com.
 Great
 Great product!
 One of the best product and it is what I want.
 It's less coffee flavored and more coffee creamer flavored
 This stuff is amazing!
 Sweet, but not too sweet. I used unsweetened almond milk to mix it with, but I think it would be great with regular milk too.
 great for my kid
 great price for the amount you get and the quality
 Great tasting product.  Love it!  Will be buying it again.
 Great taste, great value
 Great taste, not thick at all. Drink everyday and don't get tired of it. Love it. Price seems great too.
 This is a very good protein product. Tastes great with milk or water, or both, mixed half and half ;). Would recommend. Cheers!
 Taste great!!!
 I still haven't bought the 10lb version, but I totally should. More up front but cheaper in the long run.
 The taste is just perfect (Double rich chocolate). Not too strong and not mild. Just right !<br/><br/>I just finished 10lb's of syntha-6 protein and it was pretty good but im glad I decided to try this. This will be my main protein from now on.<br/><br/>Easy mixing in a shaker cup and just pure quality ingredients!
 Best protein powder out
 Good taste. Good price for this Gold Standard product compared to other places.
 Highly recommended! Made some PRs with protein. Taste is great and mixes well with water or milk.
 Great taste
 Great price, great product!
 Good flavor. Good price.
 Best flavor I've ever had so far.
 i love it
 Tastes just like a mocha cappuccino! Has a great amount of protein per scoop too!
 I have been using this for a couple of years. Read some 1 star reviews slamming the new formula for a variety of reasons including everything from tasting bad to causing global warming (OK I  lied about the last bit...) so I ordered the smallest quantity. Verdict - might taste somewhat different to some however I can't tell a difference. I use it in smoothies and blended with OJ - no change.
 ON is good whey, but it does not tast that greaet and its hard to stir if you dont have a good shaker
 Without a doubt the best flavor.<br/>I used skim or 1% milk instead of water.
 swole patrol
 I recently switched from the ON over to the Twin Labs. I consider it a mistake. The ON is definitely the better tasting product, and it mixes much better. I would recommend it over the Twin Labs to anyone.<br/><br/>I have only tried the chocolate in both brands though.
 The gains are real.
 I bought this protein and it is great. The Rocky road is a great flavor, not chalky at all. I will definiitely buy another when I finish this one.
 Can't get any better
 I've been drinking the double-rich chocolate regularly for about a year now. It is outstanding and not difficult to drink at all.  I work out in the morning before I eat, and my after-exercise protein shake holds me over for about 2.5 - 4 hours.<br/><br/>I blend a scoop of powder, 8 oz skim milk, and a half cup of berries until smooth.  Then I start adding ice (maybe a cup or so) to the blender.  This makes two huge glasses of great protein shake - I drink them both while keeping in mind that it's just a cup of milk, a half cup of berries and the powder.  What fills two very large glasses is mostly ice and air.<br/><br/>I've used all kinds of berries/cherries, and my favorites in order are:  blueberry, strawberry, raspberry, cherry, blackberry.  I make sure the berries are also frozen when they go into the blender - it keeps the shake thick.<br/><br/>After I started on my first 5-lb jar, I thought I should get another flavor just so I didn't get sick of the DRChocolate.  The French Vanilla wasn't nearly as good, I thought.  Too sweet.  I thought it would be good with melon or peaches or pineapple - things like that - and you couldn't taste the fruit hardly at all even though I was adding a cup of fruit to the cup of milk and scoop of powder.  The melon/peach flavors just weren't strong enough to get past the heavy taste of the vanilla powder
 very very good product, deliver on time :-)
 Right now, I am using the 'Optimum Nutrition Glutamine Powder' + 'Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey' (Taste is decent) + 'Prolab Creatine Monohydrate Powder' + 'N-Large 2 Protein Powder' (Best taste out there). And I have added 34 pounds on 3 months with just few body fat. Sorry I cannot review the product individually, I felt I would not be fair if I do so.
 Love the flavor good stuff will continue to drink before and after workout also will recommend to everyone. Good luck
 Fast delivery, reasonable price, effective product
 Been using this for years.  Straight whey, no fillers.  Buying this is a no-brainer.
 4.5/5 Great product, mixes well in water or milk, tastes OK.<br/><br/>Causes gas if I use more than one scoop.
 Arrived on time, Cake Batter is by far my new favorite flavor, Optimum makes a reliable great tasting product. Loved the taste.
 I feel great after using this protein.
 I've tried a few others from department stores. None of which mix as well as this whey. Their vanilla flavored mix is dessert-like. I will pass on the strawberry as it tastes like amoxicylin in liquid form, yet it is tolerable. I can't wait to try the other flavors. You can't beat the price of this stuff. THANK YOU OPTIMUM NUTRITION FOR NOT SUCKING AND BEING TOTALLY AWESOME! YO GABBA GABBA!
 good
 I, unfortunately, didn't do my homework before I purchased this product. I failed to read the ingredients!<br/>I had opened it and mixed up a drink with it and noticed that it contained artificial flavors. I dumped my drink and threw the reaming out. I'm buying this https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B018UPBFUK/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1 instead.
 Very good.
 WPI's baybeh
 Good flavor!
 I will reorder another when this is empty. The price is right and you get twice as much for you money.
 ON makes the best whey protein.  Super easy to dissolve in water or milk.  Has a great flavor, especially when you mix it with a banana or some peanut butter.  And when you do and you blend it with a blender, you forget you're even drinking a protein drink, instead, it's just like a real milkshake!
 The taste was good and easy to drink.
 Best protein on the market. Gold Standard Whey Protein powder mixes great and leaves the competition in the dust in taste
 The best protein i have ever had. It tasted so delicious that i drank three shakes daily with double serving.
 Great product I use this Gold Standard Whey as a daily dietary supplement and found the brand to be one of the better on the market. Will continue to buy this product
 Delicious
 I actually tried to order the other chocolate flavor of gold standard whey and was very disappointed to find out this one tastes terrible. It's obviously my fault for ordering this flavor by mistake, but I have to say there is just no redeeming qualities to this flavor. The smell is just as bad as the taste, and it left my blender bottle smelling disgusting, even after washing it immediately. If you are looking for a chocolate whey protein I would still recommend gold standard, but go with the double rich, which is delicious, and not the milk chocolate.
 i use this in my oatmeal, mix it with milk or water, in pancakes mixes in very well and the flavor is amazing
 9.8/10
 I was a little skeptic about not buying some chocolate flavor but I am so happy with how this one tastes!!
 Very Good!
 good value for rhe price and mixes well. the taste is good to me , however ,  taste is up to the individual.
 Best whey protein
 Great stuff...the best!! The taste is great
 Good Quality and flavor
 all day all day
 This whey protein powder is superb!  I have it for breakfast nearly everyday and feel good for hours.  Who wants to cook in the morning when you can get 24 grams of protein in 3 minutes mixed in water?!  It is such a great support for cutting back on calories too.  We were going to try mixing it with other things but it tastes so good in plain ole water that we haven't bothered.
 Great product!
 delicious
 The taste is great and you don't always need to use a blender to mix it with milk or juice if you're in a hurry.
 Great product!
 Tis a little gamy
 Awesome taste, mixes well, and gives great results.
 Good product, but very expensive
 Taste Great!
 Authentic and taste good thanks again
 The chocolate tastes way better than any other brand I've tried (and I have tried a bunch).<br/>Mixes up really well too.
 It tastes pretty good considering it is one of the cheaper low cholesteral protein supplements. Overrall good deal, obviously if you like banana.
 Quality product.
 Does what intended.... Buy a different flavor tho. This is no chocolate milk. Vanilla is probably one of my favorites.
 Good product, the only negative is that if you are not using a blender the powder never dissolves very well
 Very good product and arrived on time in good fashion.
 Mixes well, great taste! High quality protein!
 I've been using this powder for years now - great stuff, great taste! But it! You won't be sorry you did!
 Great flavor.  Great product.  Goes down smoothly and digests easily.
 One of the best on the market.
 I Love this stuff. Mild taste, mixes well, and clean! I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a quality protein supp
 Great cost and benefit! ON still is one of the best brands!!
 good quality
 very well
 Great product and taste good too. Can't say much more about this product but had to use 14 words.One more word was required.
 It came quickly and it works in my smoothie
 Great tasting. Best protein shake mix I've had to date.
 This is your basic no frills, trusty old whey standby. Always among the cheapest available, and definitely the easiest to find.  Tastes like choco milk. Can't go wrong!
 Great
 Great protein! Tastes great
 Love the taste and value of this product. I've tried other products but keep coming back to this one. Highly recommend.
 This product mixes very well.  It tastes good.  I use it with either water of milk along with a banana or other fruit and some crushed ice.
 I'm not a power lifter or looking to get huge, but I do some working out and running and was looking for a protein powder to supplement my diet.  I started with a small tub of muscle milk (vanilla) but after doing some research, I decided to get the ON gold standard.  It is low in fat and carbs (compared to other powders out there) and for the price, is a bargain.<br/><br/>It didn't mix as well as the muscle milk in my blender bottle, which is the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5.  Mixed with milk, it tastes pretty good.  You can tell it's a protein shake, but the flavor and aftertaste are not bad.
 it's greatest choice.
 ON is truly the gold standard. I was satisfied with the quality, the value and the rich chocolate taste delivered.
 Very quick. Amazing product. Would buy again and recommend.
 Never disappointed with this brand. Reasonable in price and effective. Better than any other product out there. Thanks a lot
 gainzzzz
 The best protein I have ever taken. It taste good and it's cheap anyone can afford to buy this product
 100% Whey
 The banana flavor is amazing, and its working very well for me. I plan on looking into some casein by ON soon.
 great price, fast shipping, will purchase again
 Tastess goood.
 Only the best.
 My second purchase
 Great product at great price.
 I always get ON Double Chocolate., but this one is also great! Great taste, highly recommended.
 I love the Vanilla Creme, good flavor.  I like to switch up the flavor and add fruit, or cocoa powder.
 It's not so bad with water when I drink it with milk it comes off to sweet for the small amount I use but it's still not bad tasting and is doing its job
 Great product! Easy on the stomach.  Have used for years!
 Best whey protein you can get. Very fast shipping.
 Everything i needed in a protein. Best bang for your buck. If it was more expensive I wouldn't get it.
 I love this product
 No.1
 Taste pretty good.
 the standard king
 excellent product...
 Great nutrition supplement
 live for this stuff
 Great product, quick delivery
 Ok
 sin novedad negativa el producto llego sano sellado tal como lo pedí en el anuncio, ahora a ejercitarce!!!<br/>despues a subir testimonio visual
 Love it
 My blood sugar has reduced about 10 %. I feel very energetic whole day. I would recommend to all my friends.
 Great protein!!!
 Taste better than excepted
 Excellent!!!!!!
 Tastes great best protein I've ever bought
 good product
 Great!! Extreme chocolate taste very good
 I strength lift about 3 times a week and play basketball about 3 times a week - each session lasts about an 1.5 hours -been using this protein for about 3 months now. I'm naturally very skinny, regardless of caloric intake, so it's no surprise that this protein showed no weight gains. Also I'm not sure if it does anything else like muscle efficiency, repair, and everything else the bottle claims since it's hard to really measure. Delicious Strawberry flavor tastes fine to me and it's reasonably priced. Overall, it's okay but I'm highly unsure of it's effectiveness. Best route would probably be to consistently workout and eat right.
 By far, the Optimum Nutrition brand is the best for the price AND taste.  I've tried Double Chocolate (mix with instant coffee), Vanilla (great with fruit), and my fav Cookies and Cream (eat with a 1/2 banana and you're set).  Lost 35 pounds while gaining incredible upper body muscle, and I have this brand to thank.  Four months later, it still doesn't get old.  That's a big plus.  I'm ordering anoth 5 lb tub as I type this review.
 My friend likes it.And the delivery is really quickly !
 best flavor. don't hesitate
 This product is considered one of the best....it is!  It mixes well with water or other liquids.  It has excellent flavor.
 Been getting this stuff at stores, but realized its much cheaper buying it online in a large amounts (10 pounds).
 Good product, excellent price
 Good flavor and easy to use!
 great product for the occasion ... 100% reliable fully successful sending different part of the world .. Store recommended saludos
 great as always
 This is one of the best products, but I did not like the banana cream flavor, I will be trying another flavor.
 Its my first time to use protein with gym, but it feels good. Muscle is coming with lots of exercise
 Great product fast delivery. Been using it for years as a good general whey source after workouts. One of the best in the market.
 This bag will last you forever. Gets the job done and will last you for months even if you are taking 2 scoops a ay.
 This is by far the best whey protein out on the market, it's very smooth and mixes very well. I have already tried Birthday Cake, Double Chocolate, and Starberry and I would recommending any of these to anyone as they are all good but the birthday cake is a little more sweet. This gives you the BCAA you need plus the protein that you need. The only down fall is it uses artificial sweaters which can be bad for you but don't feel that would decrease the stars. I recommend as taste amazing
 Awesome Taste. Helped me gain Muscles.
 excellent whey! I have bought it many times :)
 Best whey protein iv'e taken!
 Very good protein for me the best I think I'm going to get another one is amazing protein the best
 I bought 2 pounds of the cookies and cream flavor. My god this stuff is actually delicious. I could drink it for fun.<br/><br/>But its practical too. I find myself much less sore the next day after my workout, and i've noticed more muscle growth.<br/><br/>Good stuff, if you're looking for protein this is what you want.<br/><br/>Chocolate mint is an ok flavor, but its too strong, and doesn't seem to mix as well.
 Tastes Great!
 Didn't like the flavor with water.
 Taste Great and mixes very easy without any globs of powder like some other proteins.
 The item works extremely well, tastes great and is no hassle at all. The item was snipped on time too.
 Awesome product, good price and shipped on time!
 its great.
 Tasty!  I make a protein drink with a scoop of this, a real banana, and some water + ice in a Bullet blender as a post-workout.  Delicious to the point where I probably won't ever try another flavor.  If you don't like Bananas, don't even bother.  Otherwise no strange protein taste and mixes very well.
 Good to use
 My wife has been using this product for years...usually available at health food stores.  When we found it at Amazon we were amazed at the low price.
 Got the product on time as promised. It's larger than I thought it would be, but that was MY mistake. I was pleasantly surprised. :) Larger is better in this case.
 This tastes good, and mixes well.
 This works for me, I always buy it.
 Good stuff!
 Wonderful product
 very tasty
 Ive tried lots of protein but this stuff tastes the best and works the best, theres no substute, this stuff works for whatever your goals are
 Double Rich Chocolate. Tastes very good, best I've had. I mix it with milk. You've got to get one of those Blender Cups, OMG, well worth the price. Never again will you use a spoon to stir. But for the protein, I highly recommend. Quality protein and not overpriced.<br/><br/>You can make all kinds of GAINZ with this stuff. After drinking I just look at a dumbell and I get bigger.
 very good
 I honestly struggled to even make it through this entire product. I have tried several different types of protein and I will say that this is definitely the worst one. The taste is so difficult to stomach because it leaves this horrible aftertaste that seems to last forever. I would not recommend this to anyone and would suggest Syntha 6 or Muscle Milk.
 Best protein shake taste ever .milk choclate is awesome .<br/>I am never switching back to any other protein .try milk choclate with no fear
 Great product plus I also love the flavor
 Perfects protein!! Good for bay and very nice to drink!! Buy it! I'm really pleased to have buy it! I suggest to all
 Just like what they sell at GNC but at a better price, and without the silly attempt at pseudo-science up-selling.
 Nice protein I can say. I tried Dymatize Whey before which also was not bad but I think ON is probably more qualitative.<br/><br/>And yes I would recommend this product to my friends.
 Great price
 Love it
 Good stuff, good flavor. Must buy.
 This is some of the best protein you can buy. It can be expensive, but when it does go on sale try to snatch up as much as you can. Good sales on this don't come around too often, maybe twice a year. The mixability is perfect in a shaker cup, and the taste is good. I find you need to use less water than it says to. I only use 4 ounces and it mixes and tastes fine. The quality is higher than most and has less contaminants than most other brands. You can never go wrong with Optimum Nutrition.
 I would give it zero stars if I could.  I bought this product previously in GNC, and the quality was fantastic.  I mixed two scoops with 8oz of water and it was rich and it mixed so easily.  The product I ordered off amazon is different.  The taste isn't the same, it's not rich and it doesn't mix very well at all!! Leaving tons of clumps of protein in my shake bottle.  It used to take 3-4 shakes with my original purchase of this product.  Now I have to mix for minutes and I'm still left with tons of tiny clumps.  I'm very disappointed, either the batch is bad or the manufacturer has changed their product which would be even more disappointing and at which point I would look for an alternative.
 Its good!!
 Great taste, a bit to pricy.
 Awesome taste. I love this shake!! Great value as well. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a good supplemental protein shake. I add water and a little peanut butter.
 it is delicious,  and it works well.  my favorite protein on the market for the price, quality  and effectiveness it offers.
 this is the best you want for protein...
 This review is for the French Vanilla Creme 5 lb. tub. After recently recovering from knee surgery, I wanted to get back into shape and lose some weight. I got a spinach-based protein powder that tasted pretty awful. I got this hoping it would taste a bit better, and that I could actually enjoy a protein shake. This stuff is delicious. I really enjoy that it doesn't have added vitamins, which I get enough of elsewhere. There are only 110 calories per scoop of this protein with 25g of protein, which is better than most other brands. However, this flavor (not sure about other flavors of this brand) does have sucralose. Not that it would have stopped me from ordering it, but some people don't like artificial sweeteners, so that's just a warning to those people. Combining this with PB2 and a banana makes a great breakfast/snack with low calories and high protein! I would definitely recommend this whey protein to a friend.<br/><br/>Please feel free to leave any questions/comments and I will reply as soon as I can.
 Delicious protein powder.
 Delicious taste and easy to mix. Tastes great with water or milk.
 I like the product and results. great pre and after workout product. would get it again and recommend it to friends.
 Nutritious and delicious. Tried all sorts of protein on the market and this one hands down is the best tasting one.
 I love it. Great product. I really highly recommend this product among others
 Tastes awesome and works great. Definitely buying more of this stuff!!!
 Good product with decent taste. It's given me really terrible acne though. I know evidence of whey/acne is considered anecdotal, but I've certainly noticed a huge surge of acne since I started taking this supplement.
 Always pleased with this product.
 Awesome whey, ON is the best.
 Ordering this product from Amazon made product's arrival speedy compared to having to wait for stores to reorder.  This flavor is very popular and hard for stores to keep in stock.  The coconut flavor is a bit stronger than I like but very good.
 Great
 Taste great!!
 Great taste and value for a reasonable price.
 Excelente suplemento
 Excellent
 Great product, prices was a little too high but service was good. Highly recommend it! For sure I would buy it again!
 They have coming a long way in taste !
 The price is great, taste is great and I feel that I am getting stronger and building more muscle mass.
 Great protein, mixes nearly completely and easily even if you don't have a shaker bottle (but one with a top helps!). It is not too sweet and the double chocolate flavor is tasty, almost like dark chocolate. I have also tried the vanilla which is even better and more neutral of a taste. When you mix these proteins with water they taste okay but a little empty. However, when mixed with milk they taste fantastic. Would recommend to friends.
 It was a great value and tastes just like I thought it would. I will definately buy this protein powder again.
 So big that one
 No scoop came in the package but no problem, I put 2 tbsp per 1 cup water. Taste is a bit on the sweet side. Shakes work differently for everyone, I suggest buy a smaller package first and try different brands, makes to help finalize your decision on which works best, no need to rush.
 Great product arrived very very quickly
 I got strawberry and it taste good
 The very best there is.
 This stuff tastes great and mixes well with milk and water.  A great breakfast before hitting the gym in the morning.
 Great taste on its own or in a smoothie
 This flavor is much better than any flavor I have tried from this brand, among others. I would stay away from the vanilla, but thats just me I guess.
 Great product. Does not make you feel full. Excellent value.
 Use the right ingredients.
 I've tried a number of protein powders over the years and this is my new favorite.<br/>Isopure, Muscle Milk products, GNC protein and others.<br/><br/>I've experienced mild stomach issues with some of the other ones I've used, but my biggest complaint was always the flavor and texture. The Mocha Cappucino really tastes like it's name. I've been doing paleo and supplementing with the whey protein, so to reduce dairy I mix it with water. Most other mixes are horrible with water, this is delicious. Cold water in a blender bottle and I can't be happier!
 Tastes good, but posted NO results or gains in strength or endurance
 This is a good deal for the money. I've tried others and this always comes out on top. Definitely buying this again.
 as everyone knows it..
 Some of the best tasting whey protein I have tried. Great price when compared to some of the other proteins.
 Great taste, great price.
 Best protein, no doubt!!!
 I have been loving this protein powder. I got the strawberry banana flavor which is a great change from all the plain vanilla and chocolate flavors that other brands have. The best part of this powder is how quickly it dissolves in water and has a smooth taste. There is no thickness from the powder unlike a lot of of other brands. I even drink this after a meal for dessert sometimes.
 Quick, fresh, as described. Will buy again
 My son was in heaven when he received his product. Thank you
 Love optimum nutrition
 Great taste.  Mixes as easily as any product I've tried.
 Good flavor
 my son like it very match
 I have been using Optima for years. This is the best flavor yet. Almost like getting to eat desert. I will be getting again.
 As a fitness enthusiast and a Science guy, I am always curious to find the real value of a supplement. What works and what does not work. More importantly, I believe the analysis of a product should be based on strong scientific knowledge base, combined with good old fashion practical use of the product, and only then one should come down to the final conclusion.<br/><br/>This product review and analysis was conducted based on 3 parameters<br/><br/>A. Constituents: What comes in the box, the real value of the product<br/>B. Assimilation: How does this product goes down in your system, how much of it will your body assimilate<br/>C. Usability : Long term usability and and effects.<br/><br/>I believe this is one of the best supplements available in the market today. The Question is Why?<br/><br/>1. The Quality of protein. Since its manufactured by Glanbia (who owns Optimum nutrition), this product is coming straight from the manufacturer. This is a BIG factor, 90% of the protein supplement companies source their raw materials from third parties, often importing them from third world countries.<br/><br/>100 grams of Whey protein isolate from one source is NOT equal to the 100 gram Whey protein isolate from another. Inferior resources usually have high level of Heavy metals and cattle Hormones. This has been elucidated from recent tests and published widely in the consumer reports. ON aced this report with minimum levels of such harmful residues. Reason is simple, they make their own whey in a plant which has to abide all regulations under US law.<br/><br/>Just for the point of reference. I am from India, and therefore know first hand how many poorly regulated cheese plants export their whey to Europe and US. So make sure your Whey protein is coming from Whey extracted in the US!!<br/><br/>The Additives<br/><br/>2. Ideally, I will prefer the protein powder with no artificial sweetener. But lets face it, such a product will be hard to sell. However, Golds whey keep artificial sweeter to minimum. If you check Bodybuilding.com forums, lots of consumer complain that its not sweet enough. I request all such folks to realise that is actually good for them, if you feel this product is not sufficiently sweet for you. Its better you use lesser amount of hydrant (Milk, water, juice etc), or add a tiny bit of Honey.<br/><br/>The Profile- The Myth about Isolate vs a Blend<br/><br/>3. This might be hard for some people to digest. However, the truth is 96% people who use Whey supplements, will have no additional benefits of taking an Isolate vs a Blend. Please note, when I use the word blend, I mean a product lile Golds whey which is well balanced with Whey isolate and Whey Concentrate. (not any junk product form the market). If you take the blend, you might get 1 gram of extra fat or 2 grams of extra carbs which is absolutely nothing. You can burn this by adding 1.5 minute to your jog routine or walking for 2-3 minutes. You will get the same result and effect as the Isolate, so its not worth spending extra refined Isolate. The Isolate rumor is just a Hype created by the supplement industry. I will repeat this again, if your blend is as good as Golds whey i.e you are getting 24 grams per 30 gram scoop, you don't need an Isolate.<br/><br/>Who all comprise the 4% population who can benefit from an Isolate. First people who are extremely lactose Intolerant. I have used the word extremely since all good products add enzymes to digest the little amount of lactose residue in the supplement. Lactose is not a a bad thing, its simply the milk sugar. So if you are highly allergic to Lactose, Isolate will help (they have negligible levels of lactose)<br/><br/>Second tier of people who can benefit from Isolates are professional athletes who are pepping up for an upcoming competition. This competitive set is consuming 5-8+ scoops of Whey protein daily and therefore will benefit from reduction in additional fat or carbs.<br/><br/>4. Why go for Whey protein blend when you have specialized protein powders with Whey,egg and Casein.<br/><br/>Its simple science, Whey is just better with the best Biological value*. This means that your body will better absorb and use the protein source from Whey more than any other source, therefore no wastage. Egg is also a great resource, which is just behind Whey. However in real world it lags behind Whey substantially, even the delayed absorption rate cannot compensate much. Scientifically it has been proven that Whey is just better, since it doesn't tax your digestive processes as much as an egg protein.<br/><br/>Question of Casein:<br/>Its true that Casein has an edge when it comes to delayed absorption. Its anti-catabolic properties and slow absorption makes it an ideal night time protein. This said, its best when you take Casein in concentrated from, i.e. if you need Casein, take only Caesin, do not mix it with Whey... Why do I say this, Its a big topic based on metabolism response(will add a different thread later). One last thing 24 grams of Whey protein is NOT equal to 24 grams of Casein as the Biological value of Casein is lower than Whey.However Caesin does have its own benifit of delayed response, provided you actually need it.<br/><br/>*Biological Value: Biological value (BV) is a measure of the proportion of absorbed protein from a food which becomes incorporated into the proteins of the organism's body.<br/><br/>Whey protein concentrate: 104<br/>Whole egg: 100<br/>Cow milk: 91<br/>Beef: 80<br/>Casein: 77<br/>Soy: 74<br/><br/>Last Thoughts:<br/>Always keep a note of how much protein you are consuming from Supplements Vs straight from the food. Ideally one should keep protein sources from supplements under 25%, but if your life style is demanding and you are unable to get hold of good meals rich in protein, you should always keep your protein dependency under 50%. In layman terms, for most of us who are looking for fitness, keep it not more than 2 scoops/day. For those who really pump some heavy Iron keep it upto than 3 scoops/day. (let me know if you wish to know the science behind this)<br/><br/>In the end Supplements are only Supplements. The word Supplement has a lot of Drama attached to it, as if, if you don't take a protein shake within 30 minutes of your work out.. you will never make good gain. Total Crap. This is not a make or break factor(its just beneficial). Baring few exceptions. Supplements adds up only 20 percent of your fitness equation.
 Good protein, just tastes awful
 It is good
 great value
 Great! Product as advertised. Quick delivery!
 Best tasting protein I've had to date. Awesome product.
 Fake product, it was half empty, without any seal and scoop was not included either.<br/>Please don't buy this fake product.<br/>I am quite disappointed
 Flavor is amazing !
 This tastes really good, but I like it when it is made with milk better than water. This doesnt mix as well as I'd like so I use a mixer cup.
 husband loved it and it tastes great!
 Excellent, fast shipping
 To me it tasted like cookies, not like milk chocolate. There are other flavors which are better than this one.
 Best Whey out there, hands down
 I love it, finally seeing results. You need this for your workouts
 I eat this whey for breakfast, lunch and dinner. ALL DAY EVERYDAY.
 If I can believe the packaging information, this product provides all the essential amino acids and health supportive whey protein that supports the body. It's easy to mix snd pleasant to the taste buds. I eat a vegan diet, so this product fills in the nutrition I may be missing.
 My wife needed a new protein powder to go along with that new 2-year gym membership. Well, she's been to the gym once and this still hasn't been cracked open. I bet it's good though, I enjoy their other flavors. I think that I'll just consume it myself.
 good product. Would like to order more in future.
 Been usuin this for years. This helps feed your muscles after working out. Speeds up recovery.  Recommend this for all who want to see growth.
 I love this product..
 Tastes great and dissolves great, the two most important parts for protein in my book.
 good
 Dissolves really well, easy to drink in shakes and helped me gain some size. I also dropped body fat. With more muscle mass my energy went up even after workouts. I decided to also take the male enhancer <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Livigra-by-Biotek-Nutrition-–-Male-Enhancement-Pills-Testosterone-Booster-–-Increases-Size-Libido-Energy-Mood-Performance-Stamina/dp/B0733SPKXQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Livigra by Biotek Nutrition – Male Enhancement Pills Testosterone Booster – Increases Size, Libido, Energy, Mood, Performance Stamina</a> because I was more confident with my body structure but I was not with my manhood. It really helped me get that extra self-esteem boost with more size and better performance behind closed doors. I also take a test booster and pre-workout supplement and the combo seems to be perfect for me.
 Super
 This isn't the best tasting protein that I have ever drank but it is very good.  The calories are very low compared to some other brands.  280 calories for 48 grams of whey protein blend.
 Beta protein I ever use.
 Best protein powder ever! But no spoon inside.........
 Great.
 good buy
 I will admit I have been spoiled by BSN Syntha-6's taste but this stuff is more than tolerable and for better protein amounts with less fat and carbs I will take it. Also came with a sample of pre-workout inside, like being a kid and finding a prize in your cereal box!
 Very good taste.
 great
 Choc-mint is great!
 If you need any workout supplement, this is where it starts. tastes greats and would normally cost much more in a store
 Good
 Good stuff.  Came as described.
 taste alright
 Mixes well and tastes great
 Good taste. Quality product.
 This tastes pretty darn good when mixed with milk.  I haven't tried to mix this with anything else.  I do advise everyone to not heat it up.  I thought I'd heat it up and the whey curdled up, I felt like I had to chew my drink.  Cold, yummy, hot, not.
 Great
 Great stuff
 I think this is the best protein powder I've tasted. It's pretty close with Syntha-6's chocolate, but I favor this one.
 Component, looking forward to good effect
 Name brand Whey For a good price!! This particular whey came recommended by my personal trainer as the best one around!1
 Yum
 I've been drinking 2 shakes/day of Optimum Nutrition for about a year now. Here's how I'd rate the flavors on a 10 point scale:<br/>Vanilla Ice Cream: 9<br/>Extreme Chocolate: 8<br/>Cookies and Cream: 8<br/>Delicious Strawberry: 3<br/><br/>Something just isn't right with the Strawberry flavor. It tastes....almost chalky, like a TUMS. I tried adding sugar, creamer, strawberry syrup, couldn't get a good taste out of it.
 This stuff tastes great and I've actually noticed It has helped me bulk up over the past 6 months of use.
 Works well for me. Wish there was a 5LBS bag as well..
 Excelent!!! Best flavor ever!!
 Tastes really good
 Tasty.  My wife blends it with straight water, but I put it in 1%  milk.  The mix thickens the drink and it tastes great.<br/>Its good to blend it for a minute or two.  I can stir it in, but the texture is much better if it gets a thrashing.
 Only bad thing was a price mark up..other than that everything was fine
 Best protein around.
 Does it's job
 Best tasting protein shake I have tasted (Rocky Road)!!!
 This was a horrible experience and had to be returned..The taste was like chemicals and smelled awful
 Great protein, easy to mix, tastes great and works! The best protein I have tryed and it is easely digestable as well.
 TASTES GREAT!!!!
 Great!
 IT TASTES GOOD.
 Some of the best protein I've ever used
 Great taste, easily mixed and overall a great protein.
 Being a vegetarian, i rely on this to get enough protein. I was very skinny(about 120lbs) for 5'9'' height.<br/>Took a scoop of this in the morning with lot of warm water and did 200 push ups every day for a month. I gained about 5 lbs and got reasonably good shape.
 tastes so good
 Use:<br/>Daily Supplement, Occasional Meal Replacement, weekend athelete.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Taste<br/>Digestibility (as someone prone to gas, this is important)<br/>Value<br/>Quality<br/>Mixes well<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>I can't possibly store all the flavors!<br/><br/>Overall:<br/>I have used this powder for a long time and love it.  Doesn't get my as gassy as many of the other popular powders I have tried.  Mixes well and works well in recipes (Pancakes, baked goods, shakes).  My girlfriend is picky about drinks and she loves as well.
 I've used ISO-100, Body Fortress (Wal-Mart, nasty tasting, didn't mix well) and Syntha- 6 without any issues of nausea, cramps or bloating.  I purchased the Gold Standard, really excited about the cleanest protein supplement I've had to date.  I thought I was going to die after taking it!  I'm not saying don't buy or try it but I'm throwing all but 3 servings in the garbage.  Not sure if it was a bad batch or just an ingredient that is not for me.  I made a shake with one scoop of milk on Friday.  By Saturday night I thought about going to the emergency room.  I had an awful pain in my stomach and severe nausea.  I thought I had gotten food poising.  I was able to go to work on Monday, still had a sick feeling in my stomach, not fun.  Since I had not eaten for several days I drank a shake, trying to take in more calories.  I become seriously ill again and that's when I figured out it was the Gold Standard. Two days later (Thursday) and I'm starting to feel like normal.  I will never try this whey, ever again.  I'm going back to the Syntha 6 or Dynamize, if I can get the courage to drink another whey protein shake.
 Exactly what I wanted
 Tastes great!
 ON as we all know is one of the best whey protein out there. I had been using MP combat powder since a year and wanted to change that and I can say that I don't regret switching.<br/>I don't know about others, but I was skeptical about the authenticity of this product and I prefer buying supplements from other more reliable websites like bodybuilding.com. But after more than a month use, I am sure this product, as well as the seller, are top notch. Would highly recommend this product.
 Great taste , great value and excellent results.Ranked #1 whey protein and very affordable with around 50 servings in the 5 pound jar.
 I enjoy the product with water, but it lacks variablility. I used to use costco brand vanilla and decided to try this brand since it was so popular.My mistake. It taste like hot chocolate. I can't mix the stuff with anything because of the odd taste. I would rather have a plain chocolate. My old stuff I used blueberries, strawberries, veggies, and it tasted good. This stuff taste bad with fresh fruit and vegies.<br/><br/>Side note my girlfriend loves it.
 Great product.
 Good
 This is the best protein on the market! Also, if you buy the 10 lb bags online you can save a ton of money rather than going to GNC and paying outrageous prices for half as much.
 Best tasting whey from the best company in the game.
 Good price for the 5 pounder.
 This protein powder is GREAT! (vanilla &amp; cookies and cream) taste great. It mixes quite easily in a cup or shaker and blends well with a bannana and strawberrys. Its packed with protein...just read the label and thats all you need to know!
 I have been using this product now for more than 3 years. It is faboulous. I like the flavor a lot.
 Neither ISO 100 or Syntha 6 compare to the yumminess of the cake batter Optimum. I also has a very high protein to calorie ratio, very low fat, and very low sugar.  Get it!  I will definitely be trying out the other kinds too.
 Vanilla ice cream is a great flavor for mixing with fresh or frozen fruits to make a good protein shake. We use it almost every morning after work out.
 Tastes goood if you like choclate. It tasted like hot choclate. It tastes even better if you use some sugar.
 So tasty!!
 muy bien
 I use this product every day. It allows weight loss without hunger. Try it for yourself. Delicious too, if you like chocolate.
 Mi proteína favorita
 Although expensive, the quality is great and is as good as you are going to find for Whey protein in quantity.
 Great look forward to the next one
 I have tried many protein powders along the way over the last 25 or more years, and this is by far my favorite.  It mixes easily with a spoon (scoop the power in the container *first* before adding milk or desired liquid drink) and is easier on my stomach than many other protein drinks.
 We bought this protein and absolutely love this flavor. With nothing added, the flavor is perfect. I personally add bananas and peanut butter to mine and it is delicious. This was a good price and I am excited to try the other flavors.
 Works, cheap, best. I take it twice a day, once right after my workout. I workout in the morning, and once in the evening. On non working out days, I take it as soon as I wake up.
 I like it
 Use probably 3 - 4 days a week for a blended breakfast drink with some fresh fruit and frozen yogurt.  Great!
 Good! It's large.
 The purity.
 Best protein there is and the taste of it s good I highly recommend this!<br/>Best when mix with milk.
 Rocky road flavor taste great!
 Thanks
 Of all the protein powders that are out there this is by far the easiest one to drink!  Highly recommend!!
 For just over 50 bucks, you can get 5 pounds of the stuff- which is about 70 servings. It's packed with nutrients, and has some of the best protein density around. I'm partial to the mint chocolate- mix it with some almond milk and you're good to go!
 Great Product
 The only brand of protein I buy.  Vanilla Ice Cream flavor is great for shakes!  You can also mix it with orange Gatorade for an intraworkout shake and it taste like an orange creamsicle!  Highly recommend!!
 Best on the market
 Great Product!
 Very good product, fast shiping
 double rich chocolate taste great. It mixes well so, blender is not necessary.  Great protien content per serving and one of the best values.
 Product came very quickly and was substantially lower in price than the exact products at my local health food store. Definitely coming back!
 They used to have the single one time buy for under 40 but now you can only get that price if you subscribe to a monthly mailing of it. I don't like that because I don't necessarily go through that much of this powder. Not sure if you can subscribe, get the subscription price mailed once, then cancel before your next arrival.<br/><br/>Otherwise, it's a great protein powder. Taste is good and not too sweet. Double chocolate is the best.
 I liked a lot, but the taste with water isn't the best. with fat free milk it gets better
 this protein has a funky nasty taste when mixed in water.<br/><br/>In milk, it'd decent tasting.  Not sure how effective it is in terms of building muscle, but it is definitely not the worst protein I have had, or is it the best.
 Love this place, shipped right to my door for less than I can but it in any store around.I would recommend this company to anyone.
 This is the best Whey Protein on the market, period. It even comes with BCAAs which really helps the healing process as well as save you money from buying another separate product. The taste is pretty good, and there are lots of flavors. This doesn't make me gag like other proteins.
 Very pleased with my product.
 I use to use pre mixed shakes and muscle milk powder. This is the best protein product I've ever used.
 Usually I add fruits &amp; veggies to my protein shake. This coffee flavor is so divine that I just blend it, with ice in my Nutri-Bullet. I used to have only one serving of shake, daily, now I have two. Goodbye Chocolate ... welcome Coffee!
 Very good. It arrived on time.
 ON always makes a good quality product. I personally like the vanilla ice cream flavor because it is more dynamic of a flavor. You can get sugar free cocoa and mix it in to make it chocolate, adding good flavor and fiber. I recommend buying from "Hamilton Shop". They have super fast shipping and great customer support, they even gave me a sample packet of another ON product which is awesome.
 This is an excellent product in all aspects.<br/>BTW, Amazon is great with its commitment, quality as well as shipping etc.<br/>Keep it up!
 This protein has really helped me gain some lean muscle over the past few months. Only protein I'll ever buy.
 All that it was suppose to be. Packaged nice and neat and arrived sooner than the date I was given. Thanks
 love it
 Don't be hesitant to put higher concentration. I haven't tried other flavors, but double chocolate is SOMETHING. In my first try I put a small portion into the water and regretted it. Then I put all 100++ grams into a cup of milk. It tasted as good as nesquick, or better, even despite a hard dissolving. You can chew the chocolate not dissolved balls , still good. I think I'll purchase again since that's the first tasty protein I've tried in my life
 This stuff has helped me lose 35 pounds (with a proper diet and exercise).  I have a shake almost every morning and this stuff keeps me full until lunch, whereas other breakfasts (like cereal) do not.  It's also the only shake that I've had that tastes good.  I've re-ordered several times.
 I bought this for my brother and he stated that it tasted delicious when stirred in water or milk.  Previously we bought the strawberry flavor and there was nothing wrong with that but this by far exceeds that in taste.  Highly Recommended.
 Coffee flavor is the best!!
 Smells and tastes great, the only thing I am disappointed about is that there is no scoop included! (As far as I can tell.) This is a large tub so if it is in there it must be all the way in there. Not trying to dig around and so for now I'm using a scooper from a different whey product I used.
 I've been using Whey Optimum Nutrician for 5 years and it is a great protien supplement as well as very tasty.
 Stop looking for something else.
 Best protein I ever purchase wife and I love it
 A+
 Awesome
 Great taste &amp; good results. cannot beat the flavour of this mix. you don't struggle to drink this, unlike so many of the others.
 It is an odd thing, the taste of cake batter.  But it is very tasty.  I can down it no problem in water...  but in skim milk or Almond Milk, it is a very nice drink.<br/><br/>I have tried this and the chocolate and I prefer the Cake Batter.
 I like this flavor.
 Whey is always awesome!
 This description is a bit confusing.  The description says Vanilla, but the picture says Vanilla Ice Cream (when you zoom in).  And Vanilla Ice Cream is what I got...<br/><br/>Now I like ON products - Chocalate Malt and Cookies and Cream especially.<br/><br/>But I would only advise buying this flavor if you like drinking melted vanilla ice cream.  And I don't.  So I have that going for me.
 great Whey Protein ,ITS REALLY WORK FOR ME,pls try<br/>great Whey Protein ,ITS REALLY WORK FOR ME,pls try<br/>great Whey Protein ,ITS REALLY WORK FOR ME,pls try
 Best quality!
 Great Value for the money ! Our whole family will be using this product.<br/>I would recommend it to anyone.
 Great Protein. Great power while taking it.
 Tastes great!
 Tastes like hot cocoa
 I normally buy Platinum Why by Optimum Nutrition - and decided to save a little money and bought this product figuring since it was the same manufacturer it should taste similar. The taste of this product was so bad, I threw it away. Before throwing it out, I went and bought Hershey's chocolate syrup and began adding it to try and make the flavor palatable -- didn't work. Bad tasting product.
 If you are buying this for taste then you probably have no idea what you are doing.  Flavored protein does not taste good.  I do not care how good it tastes.  This product is worth every penny.  Taste should not factor in to your decision to purchase this.  It is good.  Just get it.
 Before using this protein i was barley able to flip over a car, now i routinely boot over trucks and freight trains. If you want to take your strength to a new level and curl 200 Lbs on the regular like i do, By this protein.<br/><br/>I typed this review with my eyelids.
 I've been using Iso Senation 93 for awhile now but wanted to try something new. I was a little worried about the ON taste compared to Iso Senation but the ON tastes great! I got the extreme milk chocolate flavor. Mixes reallt well too. Plan on staying with this whey protein for awhile.
 Cake batters a terrible flavor
 I ate this and now I have so many muscles I can't fit through the doorway of my house and will never see the outside again.
 What further can be said about this product?  Mixes well in a Magic Bullet, tastes good, reasonably priced (comparatively speaking), and does seem to help my muscles stay fuller longer, must really have some BCAAs in it.  I'll just keep showing my appreciation with dollars.
 Awesome product fast shipping!
 I dunno why but at first this tasted fine and I could drink it very often. But eventually the taste just got to me and I couldn't drink any more of it. About half of what is left is sitting on my counter collecting dust. I will probably throw it out.
 Excellent
 I used to love this stuff. As others have said, they changed the formula so it's full of crap you don't need now.
 One of the best!
 i rarely try anything else. on gold standard keeps me going lifting heavy 3-4 times a week and ive made great progress using it. tastes great mixes well. worth the $$
 Great stuff.
 A+ thanks
 Good
 It took me a while but I finally found a protein shake that is not only bearable to drink but delicious! I take a scoop after every workout &amp; can definitely see &amp; feel the results. Highly recommended!
 I'm not a workout-a-holic, but was looking to add more protein to my diet. I gave this a try and the rocky road flavor is really good! Everyone one in the house enjoys it. Definitely recommend this product.
 This has been my post-workout shake protein for a while now, and I adore it. The taste is the best I've ever had (double rich chocolate); it tastes like Swiss Miss hot chocolate when you let it get cold. I also love the BCAA's right in the protein. Highly recommended. Price is great, too.
 Good stuff
 i love
 Chocolate Mint: Oddly very bitter! 1 star<br/>Natural Vanilla: ok, but best mixed with something flavorful. 3 stars<br/>Caramel Toffee fudge: very caramely, tastes great by itself. 5 stars
 Awesome product with a great taste.
 This is one of the most, if not THE most, widely used protein powder in the world.  It is low calorie compared to grams of protein and it's cheap.  I'd recommend you stick with Double-Rich Chocolate.  Extreme Chocolate sucks and so does Vanilla Ice Cream and Mocha Cappuccino.
 I am a big fan of ON products and have been using the 100% whey along with their casein protein powder as well. It mixes well in water or milk in a blender bottle. My favorite thing to do with it is to throw a scoop of extreme milk powder in a blender with a frozen banana, milk and natural peanut butter in the morning for breakfast. It makes a nice smoothie to get your day started.
 Excellent
 Love this flavor
 I've sworn by ON for years. High quality and low price for every product I've ever tried by them. Don't pay $$$$$$ for some overly hyped, "name" brand - buy this stuff, sit back and count the bread you've saved whilst sipping on this delectable nectar.
 Very happy about fast arrival of the product. Will continue to order more protein supply. Thanks
 If you want to get large with better tasting stuff, guzzle this shake.<br/>My biceps now have triceps... Doooo eeettt!
 excelente producto, recomendado.
 This stuff is great! My recipe: 2 scoops powder, 8 oz. unsweetened almond milk, 1 banana, 1 spoon full of chunky peanut butter, 2-3 ice cubes and blend it up. It tastes like a milkshake and it's good for you!
 This is one of the top protein powders in quality and other aspects. Dissolves well, tastes ok, isn't powder (it pours into a container rather than poof powder everywhere "CytoSport") and has other important bcaa's. Tried many but used this for years.
 Great taste but I am still hungry after mixing 2 scoops in with almond milk, where other protein powders are more filling
 Best tasting protein out there.
 I'm not sure how to contact the seller but I personally was really disappointed with the Rocky Road flavor it's too sweet in my opinion and upsets my stomach. I'm not sure what I can do but it's shame that I didn't enjoy it and only had 1 serving from it
 escelent
 Good stuff. I always finish my workouts by going straight home and making a shake with this protein. The only thing I have to say about it is that I'm a little lactose intolerant and sometimes (only sometimes?) it kind of messes with my stomach. Overall great product, on the sweet side, but I would recommend it to a friend immediately.
 Can't believe the jump in price and will cut back the use of this product.  No complaints with taste or quality of the product.
 taste is way too sweet for me; gives me an upset stomach. and i'm trying to avoid artificial sweeteners like Splenda. I found one I like by by MRM that is unsweetened or there is one with a light vanilla flavor and Stevia.
 I have never used supplements before and just got this a couple of weeks ago and I can tell a difference. I usually don't like flavored things but this tastes good. +
 Use as a meal replacement or after a hard run. tastes great even using one scoop with 16oz of milk. its expensive but the best tasting of the whey protein powders ive had. get a shaker cup as it doesnt mix well with a spoon. thats the only con ive had with it
 The Extreme Milk Chocolate flavor is delcious and doesn't leave an aftertaste... It is a great product, with lots of protein!
 they set the standard for high quality protein, what else can i say? you can't go wrong with optimum....hmmm.....but make sure you pick a flavor you like cos drinking 75 servings of the flavor you hate can be a nightmare.
 Genuine!
 Mixes "ok" with water, but love the quality of sources in ON products. Mix with skim milk, dog milk, or almond milk for a much better taste. Or chug it fast right after working out for the full effects, with water in a shaker, like me because I don't give AF! Smiles.
 Good
 This is my third time i buy whey protein and actually its really good but my last order rocky road flavour the powder texture is different than my other orders and its so light that it disolves without shaking it so i dunno if this is normal or not please advice
 I bought this protein so that I won't get sore after a hard workout. It works, though I have to up the servings pending how hard I hit the gym. Both Vanilla and Chocolate tastes great!
 I don't like the flavor at all. It's incredibly sweet. I wouldn't recommend.
 Extreme milk chocolate is awesome and cake batter is very good.  With the chocolate you get 71 servings and the cake is 73 servings.  I mix either one of these in 12 ounces of milk and they mix well and taste like a milkshake.  Also shipping is extremely fast. I ordered this on Saturday and had it on Sunday afternoon!  If I could give more starts I would.
 Very good product
 this is a pretty good thing if u are trying to get big or muscular. it doesnt have too many calories and it is easily digestable.
 Great stuff
 I really like this flavor, it's mostly chocolate with a hint of mint which is perfect. It's not overly sweet and since I got the small blender bottle at the same time it didn't clump at all in reduced fat milk. Planning on drinking this with unsweetened almond milk to reduce the calories but I can see why it is rated so highly. If you're unsure just get a traditional flavor.
 Good whey protein for great price.  Tastes pretty good.  Mixes pretty good in a shaker cup.  Uses mostly whey isolate, which is good.  No complaints.
 It tastes good, and I don't know how to evaluate anything else about protein stuff. I'm a picky eater so trust me, it tastes just fine.
 Taste is really good. If you're using water, keep it down to about a 1 1/3 cups for 2 scoops. If you're using milk, 2 cups is good. As always, if you add fruit to it, less milk would be good, but water should always be 1 1/3 cups for 2 scoops. The taste is good, it can get old after awhile though. Regardless, it's a good product. I've seen some improvements, and i recommend it.
 Good
 Good protein product.  Cookies and cream flavor powder smells a little like artificial sweetener, but tastes good
 I've used this protein for over a year now, and I keep ordering for a reason. Best value for product and tastes good.
 Not sure why this chalky powder is on the top of amazon reviews , but IMO it was just okay. Taste was just passable and that explains why it took me about 11 months to finish This big bottle. Recently I purchased "syntha 6" chocolate flavored whey, and I've been blown away how good that is, with a small trade off.
 Ordered it last night, was drinking it by this afternoon. I officially love you people.<br/>Unfortunately, I shared some with my son and he came wandering back to ask me for my recipe, so...DOOOOOOOM. I may have to share.<br/>Poo.
 The Tropical Punch flavor looks and smells like Pepto Bismol. No, really. It does. I like the chocolate flavors better. Still however the best damn protein on the market.
 I like this product, but feel the company is fleecing the public. It used to be relatively cheap a few years ago, but a couple years ago, they marked the price up about 4-5 times higher. So sad. They should have remembered how McDonald's became great until they now, no longer are.
 So to be honest I am not an expert on all the ingredients in here, I would mostly like to review the coffee flavor. If you like the taste of coffee, you'll love the taste of the coffee flavor! I usually put it over ice or actually in a room temperature coffee and it tastes great! I always used to get the standard chocolate flavor but now that I've tried the coffee, I'm hooked!
 As a connoisseur black coffee drinker, I can't really enjoy this one.  With water, it's gross.. When made with milk, it's tolerable, and if a smoothie, it's decent.<br/><br/>I have so much of it left, but I'll power through it.
 Mixing incredibly easy, tastes fine and is very high quality protien. I will be buying again soon. Best I've found for the cost/quality ratio.
 Been using this for along time and its a great product mixes easy and taste great highly recommend this to any one who wants a quality affordable Whey.You wont find it for a better price any where plus free shipping
 Very good whey. Good gains and keeping my muscle while I lose weight. Has low calories and taste great. Mixes well, any made by on is top notch buy with confidence.
 This stuff tastes so good mixed with milk that it's sometimes my sole motivation to go to the gym! This is the only brand of whey my friends and I use and we have all been happy with our gains while taking 1-2 scoops daily. The 5lb container on amazon is great value.
 First of all, I like the taste of it. I got double rich chocolate flavor and is my only choice of whey. Other whey products give me allergies so I tend to stick with this. Well it also works great for gaining!
 I went through 5 lbs of the Vanilla flavor mixing with water and it tasted fine.<br/>I decided to try a new flavor this go-around, so I bought Vanilla ice cream flavor.  Big mistake, tastes like chemicals.  Others have mentioned taking this with milk, so i'll try that.
 Hands down the best.  Great flavor, great results.  Quit messing around and use this as your defacto protein supplement.
 This is the best protein on the market.  Tastes great mixed in water or milk.  It may be more expensive than other brands, but it is worth it.  I lift weights 4-6 times per week and this protein has helped me reach my goals faster than compared to other proteins I have used, and I have tried them all.
 This is the type of protein i always use because it is the best one i've tried. It tastes good, it mixes well, its not too expensive, and it works great! I've noticed I get stronger a lot faster when I am consistently using this stuff.
 This is my first time that I ordered my protein from Amazon and I am a bit disappointed because it did not come with a scoop and I put my hand deep in it hoping to find it. I still had my old protein box so I reused my old scoop. I have purchased this protein a few times already from different sources and it has always came with a scoop. Other than that everything is fine.
 First serving consumed as directed made me violently ill.<br/>An hour later &amp; still heaving.
 Got a good deal on it, its popular, tastes good, and was shipped and arrived on time. Thanks!
 I got Double Rich Chocolate.  Alone in milk or water this protein powder is somewhat bland, but that is exactly how I like it.  Blended with frozen fruit it's actually delicious, which is new for me.  It doesn't try to convince you it tastes like something else.  I am definitely picking up a tub when I finish my first pound.
 I tried this stuff because it is marginally cheaper than Quest. I bought the double chocolate flavor, and mixed it with a cup of milk.<br/><br/>It tastes HORRIBLE. Quest tastes like slightly chemically chocolate milk. This just tastes like chocolate flavored chemicals.
 I love mint flavors, and the chocolate mint is really good!  When I was looking to try flavors I was looking through posts trying to find a comment so I'm putting one here for chocolate mint.
 White chocolate flavor is the best one so fat. I have tried Mocha capuccino and vanilla ice cream, but this one is the best.
 I'm 34 yrs old and just starting using a supplement because I wasn't getting the gains I once got as a younger man.<br/><br/>I've taken up strength training off and on (unfortuneately) for about 15 years now.<br/><br/>A friend told me about Optimum, so I gave it a shot.<br/><br/>I started to notice a difference in both strength and muscle mass almost immediately.<br/><br/>Highly reccomend this product.
 I purchased the double chocolate flavor and find it to be much easier to drink than several other brands that I have tried.  I usually just mix it with water and it tastes fine.  It also dissolves very easily and with relatively small amounts of fluid--I just shake it for a few seconds and let it sit.  With other brands, I had to use twice as much liquid to have it come anywhere close to fully dissolved.  This brand is also very affordable, so you can't lose.
 This stuff shrinks your shirts.<br/>It damages your wingman skills, as it makes all the ladies want you.<br/>It makes babies scared of you.<br/>It makes mirrors better.<br/>It puts the elevators you ride under more stress.<br/>It makes the people around you smaller.<br/>It makes everything around you smaller.
 good product and i shopped around prior to purchase of this item.  I resent having to write a paragraph to give a review.  I liked it and gave it 5 stars and that should be enough.
 Excellent!!!!
 I got the Double Rich Chocolate and the flavor is good, although it could be more chocolatey, triple rich chocolate should come out soon :)  It mixes well. It's well worth the price. You can easily find more expensive protein that is not as good of quality, or as good of taste.
 This one tastes really good although a tad sweet for me. My favorite way to have it is with 1cup almond/coconut milk blend, 1/2 of a frozen banana, 1 TBSP natural peanut butter mixed in the single serve cup of my ninja with a couple ice cubes, delicious!
 It says it mixes with a spoon but you need a shaker cup. The spectrum shaker cup I got here on Amazon will do the job. I had to leave two stars off because I was swallowing chucks no matter how long I stirred it with the spoon.
 This is a good product with a high protein concentration and needed BCAA's for muscle growth and repair.  I prefer a bit more texture and flavor, which is the only reason I rated it with 4 stars.
 I'm going to pump. ....you up. This is widely known as the standard among athletes everywhere. Good protein content and quality relative to the price. Delicious flavor.seems to continue to get better.
 This is my default protein. No gas or runs, a high quality blend, and its cheap for the quality level. This is a great protein shake, and the chocolate mint flavor is really good, and probably my favorite.
 Product is the best. Save your tubs and transfer. This bag WILL NOT re-seal for anything.
 Its whey protien that taste great with water. Amazon had best price. Real lifters don't go to GNC they search the web for best price.
 I've always been a fan of all of Gold Standard's flavors (that I've tried). This is no exception. Like all of Gold Standard's protein it mixes extremely well. I usually mix it in a shaker without a blender ball. The best way to mix it is with a blender, which makes it come out really airy and rich tasting. Also, mix it with some eggs or egg beaters and it makes an awesome pancake.
 Great product. No filler, 24g protein per 31g serving. A solid, quality pick.<br/>This is top pick for value and quality on many fitness communities such as bodybuilding.com and /r/fitness.<br/>The taste is good not great (cheap-o chocolate for me), but you can't beat the value, so I just gulp it down and move on.
 No Doubt this item is THE BEST for beginner or Intense workout.<br/>I have suggested this to my friends and they went crazy with the performance of this Whey. Quality and Taste surpasses any other protein supplement available in market.<br/>And result is simply WOW.<br/><br/>Use it and have fun!!
 Works great. Would prefer the standard chocolate over the cookies and cream but this one tastes good enough to finish
 Had been using for over 3 months. Love the result, the taste and the consistency of the product. Highly recommended
 This flavor (chocolate malt) is very good. I had strawberry banana last time and it was not so good. This powder mixes well and doesn't need to be mixed with milk to taste good.
 I haven't had a chance to try the Rocky Road flavor yet as Amazon (not a merchant) sent me an open container.  There wasn't a broken seal inside my Amazon box.  Be careful to not consume it if it isn't sealed!!!<br/><br/>I've had the Double Chocolate and it's very good.  The Mint Chocolate tastes artificial to me, but my boyfriend liked it.  It's not bad with chocolate almond milk, but gets sickening to me after having it for more than a week.  The Double Chocolate is a safe bet for anyone who hasn't tried any of their flavors yet!
 Has kind of a weird aftertaste, but it gets the job done. Not my favorite flavor so far, but I usually mix it with almond or soy milk which masks any unpleasant aftertaste quite well.
 It is big enought for one month and two kids (one junior and the other senior). Excellent investment and excellent size.
 Great product!  Tastes great as described.  Many other flavors available.  Better than other supplements I have used in the past!
 I don't like the sweetener used, and will not buy again. I think I might try <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Optimum-Nutrition-Gold-Standard-100-Whey-Naturally-Flavored-Vanilla-4-8-Pound/dp/B00QQA0H3S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Whey, Naturally Flavored Vanilla, 4.8 Pound</a>
 Great product. I tried others but I seems to always come back to Optimum, so i guess time, I'll stay with it.
 I was always a chocolate flavor lover.. tried Strawberry flavor for the first time and it doesn't taste good..
 Really tasty and not chalky. Tastes best with milk but doesn't taste too bad with water either.
 Mixes well, taste good, and supplements my fruit shakes better than any protien I bought before. Problem is this tub gives me some major stomach, leg, and foot cramps. I limited my intake and still got cramps and bloating. I switched to combat powder and all cramps went away. This stuff is good, its just not for me.
 I am using isoPure banana mango flavor. That taste great but this one is like cough syrup :(. Not yet seen the performace of protein and yet to look at it.
 Simply the best combo of price/quality/taste. EAS used to give it run for the money but they changed the recipe for the worse. This tastes like melted vanilla ice cream, especially when mixed with skim milk.
 I look like Arnold now and Rocky now I'm the best in the world at everything I do nothing can stop me!
 I have had this protein powder before and loved it. However the reason for my 3star review is that I was not able to enjoy my latest shipment due to the lid and seal that had shattered during transit to me overseas. Powder was EVERYWHERE including all over my other items it had been shipped with. (Thankfully they're all okay and could be rinsed or wiped off) I am requesting a replacement, and then will adjust my review accordingly. Hate that this happened, this flavor is so good and I was looking forward to a change-up from the plain vanilla I'm trying to finish up.
 Good flavor and all, but its a huge tub and I'm currently halfway thru and getting tired of it. Next time I'm going to get the smaller size so I don't get too burned out with the flavor.
 Cheap, fast digesting, best mixability, and best taste. There is no reason not to order this. It contains the best micronized protein than any other supplment and chocolate acutally tastes great, not bad at all or bitter like some other post workout proteins.
 One of the few strawberry protein powders that don't taste nasty when you mix it with plain water. Mixes well in shakes also
 Dissolves well, tastes fresh and great, and it sure helps with the chocolate cravings. Optimum nutrition makes some great products and this is one of them.
 Very good stuff. The taste isn't too sweet and it doesn't clump together.
 Been using this since 2008.  Refreshing after a work out.  Price however is going up like a thermometer in Arizona in the summer time!
 Not a fan of the double rich chocolate taste, but for the price I got this item I'll put up with it!
 This used to be my go-to protein powder for the last 5 years, but this new formula almost makes me sick. I have a feeling it's from some sort of artificial sweetener. Taste is worse too. I won't be buying this again.
 good taste and the best priced protein in the business.  Standard whey protein with not much else added.  It's a good base to any fitness persons diet.
 took be a few days to figure out, but basically, this stuff makes me feel nauseous after i eat it... Not a good thing. Should have started with trying a smaller quantity. money wasted.
 good whey, was taking it for a while and now snitched for other brands . become bored with the taste
 I like the taste a lot. But I’m very disappointed that it has Sucralose. I remember the gold standard by having it in their list of ingredients.
 No flavor!  Too frothy to use in a blender smoothie, blows out the seal of the NutriBullet.  Do not recommend at all.  Would give it no stars if that was an option.
 Bought for a friend. It's good quality. Not grainy and totally dissolves.
 This is my favorite protein powder of all times. I tried many brands but I stick to this one for a long time since I never liked anything more than this one!
 This stuff taste awful. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. I bought chocolate flavor and it doesn't taste like chocolate to me.
 Does what it is supposed to do. I use as a Pre &amp; Post workout drink. Just add a little dextrose to help get in your system quick.
 Tastes great and you can't beat the price.  Blends well. A great source of protein. The strawberry is my favorite flavor.
 Absolutely pleased! It's been ten years since I ordered some Optimum Nutrition Whey Protein and this batch is as tasty and pure as the last. Thank you for being so consistent and reliable. Took a risk ordering a flavor I had not tried before; as usual, I'm thrilled with the flavor and quality. In my opinion, Optimum Nutrition truly is the gold standard of whey proteins. Could not recommend more.
 I'm lactose intolerant, so finding a good whey is hard. This stuff is great though, pretty easy on the stomach, especially if I add some greek yogurt in with it. Good taste, good mixing (though it doesn't thicken) and okay for cooking. Only thing I'm not fond of is that it does get a little grainy when cooked into pancakes.<br/><br/>Overall awesome though, definitely recommend!
 Not sure if this is the reason, but I'm a bit 'wirery' but very athletic build and I think this has helped me put on 8lbs...so far...only 10 more to go.
 The advertisement is wrong. It doesn't taste good, it tastes like s***. But, this is protein powder so I was already expecting that. 4 stars for an awesome product.
 This product is good in taste. As after taking it for about one to two months I did notice muscle increase. Great product to take after work out. I felt a difference once I took it right after my work outs.
 The protein package came with a hole in it and protein inside the box. I don't know if it was the package or the manufacturer but I'm extremely unhappy about receiving my protein with a hole in it.
 My daughter loves this and she is 19months.  Great leaning tool. Good distraction for when having to cook in kitchen and needing to keep lil one busy!
 I love this whey and have the chocolate one already. Purchased the mocha cappuccino and it smells and taste like chocolate, too ? Idk if that's okay
 This is my third ON Protein, gotta love the taste on the Mocha Cappuchino. Also loved the Cookies and Cream flavor!!! Two thumbs up.
 This is simply the most practical Whey protein out there. It's not some hardcore, mass gain, nonsense protein. It's just Whey, lots of BCAAs, and no sugar. The flavor is very good, not over sweet, and doesn't taste like chemicals. Mixes well in water or milk. Worth your money.
 You get what you pay for. I was using Syntha-6, which I liked, but this has fewer calories and cholesterol. It also has more protein per serving. The taste isn't as good, but it's not terrible.
 I have tried alot of the other Optimum flavors and so far this one is the best one. Good source of protein for all styles of athletics
 Mixes smoothly and easily in water. doesn't thicken over time. Flavor is a bit sweet but light.
 I liked at first, all flavors taste great. But started to get brain fog. Cut this out of my diet and the fogginess went away
 doesn't even taste like you're drinking protein.... so delicious! esp with fat free milk! yummy!<br/>totally worth every penny. don't ever stop making this flavor cuz i won't know what to drink next.
 You really cant match the quality of Gold Standard 100% Whey Protein. My favorite flavor is the Double rich chocolate. I would advise anyone looking at "Cookies and Cream" to think again. It has more of a coffee flavor than anything.
 This worked until I discovered Hemp Protein.  Hemp doesn't taste as good, but it's better for you and just seems easier on my digestive system.
 Finally a protein powder that mixes evenly without chunks! I primarily drink this to get protein into my diet since I do not eat very much of it! I've tried several other brands of whey protein and this one far outshines the others. I love mixing a scoop of it with my coffee to work as a creamer! Another bonus, you get a LOT of powder for a cheap price...thank you ON!
 It produces me acne
 This is the best whey protein there is, as simple as that, the price is excellent, it mixes really well, and the taste is just the best, specially cookies and cream.
 This protein has good flavor and is supposedly all natural.  I wish it was still on the subscribe and save. I guess so many bodybuilders subscribe and optimum nutrition is losing out on the bottom line. Oh well switched to twinlab, which is only $29 for 5lb after subscribe and save.
 perfect for post workout and general fitness
 Has a strong artificial sweetener and chalky taste to it.  I'm really surprised because I love all of their other products.  I wouldn't buy.
 Worth the 50 price tag mixes well tastes good and does not go through you.  Also smaller scoops lasts around 2-3 months depending on use
 I'm not loyal to any one brand. I shop based on price and Gold Standard tends to have the best price for 5#.
 THE NUMBER #1 PROTEIN TO HELP YOU GET GAINS!
 This is a great product at a great price.<br/>My wife has a protien shake every morning.<br/>This product is always fresh.
 It tastes better than I thought. Good product.  I feel more energetic after 4 weeks of this daily protein drink.  Chocolate is the best.
 great protein powder - very happy.  Highly recommend for those looking for a supplement to their diet - or looking to lose weight.
 It's ok.  Always too chunky every time I mix it and I've tried different shakers
 This is my favorite protein hands down. Tastes great. Mixes easily and is high quality. This is the only kind I get.
 This is a great deal and the taste is top notch.  Goes especially well with milk but even better with frozen fruits and yogurt.<br/><br/>I used it to help me recover from long runs in my marathon training and it got the job done.
 The most preferred flavor among the group.However the new batch has Strong after taste of Almond essence.<br/>Use to taste much better.Hope some one is listening.
 i have purchased the vanilla ice cream flavor which is much better than this one.  i do like the brand of the product just not this taste
 It's good, but I find it way too sweet.  Used about half and gave up.  I might start drinking it again just to get rid of it.
 I ordered it because ON have big name,,, but its only big on name,, the product is ridiculous,, did not work for me at all. took 3 servings daily with a nice workout but I did not see this to be working..After this I tried Nitrotech products which worked better for me... I would not recommend this product who are serious to gain some muscles.
 My husband likes this product, but I've mentioned that after that protein shake he has bad smell from his mouth. That's confusing.
 There are better brands out there for a bit more money.
 I love ON and its whey protein flavors (except the "delicious strawberrry" flavor). Ironic how the only flavor that says "delicious" in its name is the only one that isn't. Anyway the chocolate malt flavor tastes pretty good. I would recommend taking it cold.
 It's protein, what more can you say?  It came with a scoop and it is in a big jug.  Exactly what I dreamed it would be.
 Only had one shake of this so far but in LOVE with the flavor, tastes like a cold cup of coffee with milk and I only added water to the powder, gives off a very faint coffee smell, but the taste is pure coffee and milky goodness, another great job on the flavor by ON
 Chunky after a few weeks.
 I really liked the product. Served as expected. Beautiful, versatile, soft, comfortable, excellent acquisition, I recommend everyone.
 Creates bubbles. Would be good for a bubble bath
 One of my favorite proteins. It's definitely the best value in this package. The flavor is great and you'll be hard pressed to find anything better at this price.
 Used it over swim season, drank it with milk after every multi-mile practice (two per day for three months). Little to no results.
 My only wish is that the product would be 20% cheaper, but when your the top you can charge a little more.
 I have been using this for 3 months in conjunction with a mass gainer, I have not seen any change whatsoever though
 I like the taste of choc. mixes easy-- good value in amount of protein contained--for the 5 lbs --<br/>I have used other brands this is a good one for my hard efforts on bike--!
 One of the best tasting protein powders I've ever used. I've tried three or four of their flavors, and I have to say the Mocha Cappuccino one is my favorite, with this one being a close second.
 See no difference using this product. Have been using this product for 8 months now and don't see any difference.
 Good price  I have no idea what to write here except that it's protein powder and it seems to have less questionable ingredients then other powders.
 Terrible taste.
 nasty. barely tastes like vanilla. would not buy again i should have went with the double chocolate but at the price not willing to buy.
 My second time ordering this product, I love the taste and the flavor. Delivery was prompt , will definitely order again , Satified customer : )))))
 I thought i would try this out. After using Gaspari Myofusion for about 3 years i decided to try out the Optimum vanilla ice cream. first off the taste was a little off but i thought i would eventually get used to it. About the second day of using it i started getting really bad headaches all day long. I started feeling really sluggish and when i went to the gym with a headache, my energy was just not there. After 2 more days of feeling the same way i decided to go back to the Gaspari Myofusion. After about 2 days with the myofusion i started feeling alot better no headaches and my energy came back up. Maybe i got a bad batch but i don't think I'll be experimenting anymore. I saw some good reviews but it just didn't work for me, i thought i was being poisoned.<br/>update september 2018: I thought i would try a different flavor but i will be damned if i didnt get the same headaches.
 This is the best tasting protein shake I've ever tasted. The Chocolate Malt flavor is out of this world.
 nice
 Very good product!
 amazing like ice on sunshine
 It's the best taste I have found and have used it for Years. Choco Malt and banana mix well with fruit such as Cherries,Blue Berries and Bananas.
 Good product, taste is better than most, but had to dig for a while to get the scoop (I bought 5 pounds of vanilla ice cream).  They should put a slot on the back of the lid to hold the scoop. But I will buy more in the future.
 I have been a person that does not really stick to one type of protein but I have used this twice or three times.  There are better proteins in the market.  This is a nice and cheap alternative if you do not have or want to spend too much on a protein.
 Works okay for my son who uses it after working out at a fitness center 3 times a week.
 I does its work, but even thougt I gain some weigth, the side effect was i could'n sleep using the product
 Eh.
 Bought the wrong size, if I had bought the 10 pound, it would have lasted much longer
 Everyone I know that workouts/lifts suggests this protein, specifically the extreme milk chocolate. Worth the money without a doubt.
 Tastes descent but wasn't cheap enough or tasty enough to replace my current protein.
 THEN GRAB A DOUBLE SERVING OF THIS AMAZING MUSCLE BUILDING SCIENTIFIC FEAT OF MANKIND.  THIS PROTEIN GAVE ME SO MANY MUSCLES THAT&lt; AMAZINGLY&lt; MY LOWERCASE KEYS ALL TURNED INTO UPPERCASE KEYS&gt;
 No doubt a great product I wish it was at a better price point.  I would buy again
 Been using this for more than 3 yrs, i have tried more than half of the flavors, the one flavor i like the most is the banana one, it doesn't taste good but you can still hold your breath and choke it down, better than other flavors from ON.  I definitely built tons of muscles out of this protein.<br/><br/>Anyway I switched to musclepharm, at first i didn't want to switch it to other brand other than ON, but Costco only carries musclepharm, so i gave it a try, and oh my god, the cookie flavor taste so good i almost cum, but it tastes a bit too sweet. So now i'm just switching between those two brands of two flavors.
 Taste pretty good and shipped in a timely manner. Overall I would give this product 8.5/10 because it taste pretty good with milk and not too bad with water.
 Always my favorite. So Much so that this flavor of French Vanilla seems to always go out of stock immediately.
 Vanilla is my favorite...blends well with other flavors to make a nice fresh fruit smoothie.
 Tried double rich chocolate and chocolate malt, neither one taste good, chocolate malt straight awful.
 Lid arrived open and powder everywhere.
 If I could give no stars I would. Shipping was fast but this flavor is absolutely disgusting. I was incredibly disappointed with the taste. I'll finish it because it's protein but I'm not happy about it.
 If you like mint chocolate then it is ok, but I'm not a big fan of it. It kind of have a iron taste to it... suppose to be the minty taste I'm guessing.
 Good protein and dissolves easily but expensive. I guess you pay for the brand.
 I haven't had any of the other flavors, but the double chocolate is amazing!  low calories high protein, this has helped me achieve my desired body fat percentage.
 Great taste, mixes well, does what it's supposed to -- I haven't had any problems taking this, this is my third container and I definitely see myself ordering more when the time is due.
 This flavour is delicious. I have no other way of gauging its efficacy.
 As claimed by this product,this is far better in quality.Previously i used this product from some other brand and it was not this great.I would definitely recommend this for anyone who wants to have an awesome protein shake..
 Great protein. If you want gains make sure you take this after working out. It helps a lot on reducing soreness especially after leg day. I even  use the vanilla and chocolate flavor to make protein pancakes.
 A little too sweet. But if I add a tiny pinch of salt... not too bad
 Great protein! Couldn't ask for a better price with a better blend.
 Very good and take it after the gym. I got to the gym every day!<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>Glenn
 Milk chocolate is the best flavor of any protein powder I've ever tried.
 Gr8 value, though packing cud hav been some wat better thought it was d individual pouches like wat my gym sells but it wasn't, it cums jus as if ud hav bought a 2 or 5lb tub.
 If I keeled working out I'd be swol but I'm lazy. Good taste.
 Good tasting and easily dissolves in shaker. Recommended.
 Cookies &amp; Cream Flavor Review<br/><br/>This flavor is very bland, hard to tell why they call it cookies and cream because it lacks cookie crumbs entirely and the cream flavor is more like a bland/dull vanilla. I would not recommend this flavor.
 As far as protein powders go, this one won't let you down. It tastes good and dissolves quickly. Don't put it in anything, hot though - I tried a scoop in a cup of coffee and it turned into styrofoam.
 Did not like this flavor as well as the double rich chocolate!
 Works and tastes good, highly recommend.
 Excellent service great product thank you very much.
 I love this product! I have a shake after every workout to replenish and fuel my metabolism. Also have a shake at night to help rebuild muscle. This shake mix tastes great and blends with everything. Havnt had a bad flavor yet.
 Taste. Is. Amazing. Great in smoothies and protein pancakes!
 Wow! This product is one of the top selling Whey Protein Powders for a reason! Packed with all the good stuff and is actually pleasant to drink! You'll actually want to drink more of this stuff! Thats how good it tastes.
 first of all the Protein powder is the best one and also packet in right way. Shipped very fast and reached safely. i recommend this product and it is easy to intake too.
 Great meal replacement. A little expensive at 1 dollar a serving.
 Good powder that mixes well with a shaker bottle, no problem.  Never a clump when I make this.  The flavor (Double Chocolate) is the only one I buy and I like the taste.  No chalk.  Regardless, the product is, in my opinion overpriced yet I continue to pay for it.  I don't fix what ain't broken so to each their own.
 This does not have a chocolate taste.
 Great taste and performance! Great price as well.
 Double chocolate tastes just like a light chocolate shake
 the platinum is way better worth the extra money.
 I'm no mad scientist but this stuff mixes well and tastes great.
 I like how light it is and filling. Tastes great. Blends great if you shake well in blender bottle or stir real good. Great in oatmeal and Greek yogurt (add fresh strawberries to it mmmm). I wanna buy again. And soon!
 Love me some protein powder. Great flavor/taste.
 The coffee flavor is not very strong.  I end up making it with coffee, instead of water to get some flavor.
 Better value than Muscle Milk, but not as tasty.
 Get's the job done and tastes great. Keeps you full too! Definitely noticed the results from this product, but I can't emphasize enough how great it tastes!
 Hated this. Tasted more watery than chocolate.
 The double rich chocolate flavor is delicious.
 i love this stuff. it fully dissolves and tastes good.
 I think it will be fine! I haven't used it yet.
 Just exactly as advertised - it's great.
 So far best price by what you get, you can find better proteins without many fillers but they are more expensive.
 Tastes great, simply protein powder.
 High quality whey without too much added sugar.
 Great protein powder/brand. Tastes great.
 Tastes great, mixes well and I use it.
 I have used this for years, best protein powder out there.
 Worked as advertised.Top of the line protein powder.
 Take this if you want to be like mike.
 Great product, would definitely recommend!
 Cant be beat, and the flavor of the chocolate malt is A+. I actually tripped out last night and thought to myself I was having a chocolate malt. Stirs up easy, goes down great.
 2nd best protein available.
 great price on prime day.
 This is just my go to brand for protein
 There's nothing negative to say about this product! I picked Vanilla Ice Cream flavor and it tastes just like a milkshake when I make my protein shakes! I recommend to anyone looking for high quality protein!
 Love this stuff. Def worth the purchase
 Love this protein! low sugar and sodium content!
 Will buy again.
 Best Protein ever have
 Excellent taste, good results.
 Think sour milk.<br/><br/>No one tasted this before it got shipped out of the factory. It is a scourge and should be discontinued. Other flavors of Optimum that I've tried are good enough: Double Chocolate, Vanilla, Toffee (just OK/too sweet?). I would rather drink NOW Foods Protein Isolate, which is no picnic, than Cookies &amp; Cream. Why in the name of everything I did even try this? Because Promax Cookies &amp; Cream protein bars are amazing and I thought maybe there was some secret industry chemical that would somehow transfer to another brand's protein powder. It is possible I that got a bad batch. My next flavor candidate is Mint Chocolate Chip. I hope Optimum totally redeems itself.
 Taste well and mix great. But product has milk in it and cause stomach ache.
 Good Price! Great Flavor!
 I don't know what people are talking about when they say the Chocolate flavor is awesome.  This flavor sucks.  And I'm stuck with a huge tub of this crap that I'll just end up throwing away.  It tastes thin, weak, and like a bad super watered down version of Chocolate Slim Fast.  Gag!  Skip this for sure.  It's really gross.
 The scoop is missing!! How can I measure it??!!
 I got the extreme milk chocolate and tried it for the first time today, it's by far the best tasting whey protein iv'e ever had. Reminds me of Ovaltine (which is a good thing!) it mixes extremely well. Would definitely recommend, i'm pretty happy with it so far.
 This protein came in on-time and I couldn't ask for more "literally". It has an excellent amount of protein made to last I am a happy customer.
 the flavoor its not cool
 Could have been named vanilla.  Love me some of their Chocolate Malt flavor, but not so much this cake batter.  Food for thought.
 Good taste and profile
 as described--fast shipping
 Have been using this same brand for going on 4 years now. Extreme milk chocolate is my favorite
 Arrived on time best flavor so far.
 Good stuff but not a wonderful taste. I like strawberry way better.<br/>I drink in the morning and after workout. Works well.
 Optimum Nutrition On Protein Energy Supplement,...has fewer calories and less sugar.
 Need to buy more soon
 I love it
 worst possible aftertaste
 Solid middle road protein powder. Decent pricing. Not much else to say. Read the Nutrition info.
 Great taste!!!!!!! Mixes very well with little effort. Great large container so will last forever!!! Would recommend and will purchase again!!!!
 Goes well with almond milk :)
 my friend said its okay
 Great
 I love ON Gold Whey, but am not a fan of the white chocolate flavor. It's a little too sweet, and doesn't taste like vanilla. I much prefer the chocolatey flavors.
 Love this brand
 Vert good !
 Love this stuff!
 DON"T GET THE COOKIES AND CREAM FLAVOR ITS HORRIBLE! get the double chocolate, you won't regret it.
 tastes great, easy to chug, pretty inexpensive, and great gains
 I've only tried 2 so far along with the Extreme Milk Chocolate which are pretty close in taste. I give the edge to the Double Rich flavor though.
 Why change such a good thing?!? I get plenty of sugar and salt in my diet as is... definitely don’t need it in something I’m taking after I workout...
 Nice Flavor!
 Great stuff
 Delicious!!
 Not the best tasting protein shake. I was expecting much better and something that resembles vanilla ice cream. This one missed the mark.
 Taste good and makes Greet smoothies
 Good product!
 one of the best tasting whey proteins i've ever tried.  definitely tolerable. it makes taking protein shakes after workouts more enjoyable than it should be.
 good
 Less than $10/lb at Costco ($62.99 for 6.4lbs)
 It tastes horrible and has only about 20 grams of protein.
 The taste is way too sweet and horrible, hard to completely dissolve.<br/>But I might give another flavor a try, once this one's done.
 worth the price
 Don't like!
 The only whey I buy these days.
 I havent seen any real evidence this works. I have been taking it for 10 months now, changing dosages from 2 scoops per day to 5, and I never felt or saw any difference. I am not a novice lifter, but I never took whey before, I felt like it was all overpriced garbage and well.....I havent seen anything to make me think otherwise.<br/>3 stars, why? Well amazon charges far less than gnc or any place youd see in a mall, so 1 extra star for that, and with peanut butter this shake doesnt taste all that bad, so theres 3 stars.<br/>Nothing beats real food. But if you just can meet your nutritional requirements from food, do your research and know what your getting into. This didnt work for me and after 10 months I dropped a good 700 dollars on this product that I saw no results or weight gain from.
 thank you
 Great
 I like the flavor!
 I have used this stuff for years and it has always worked for me. Tastes and mixes great.
 Perfect
 Thanks
 cool
 taste great, taste even better if you add 3 spoon fulls of peanut butter to it.
 Great buy.
 i love the taste of strawberry
 good
 I have been a regular user of this product. But somehow this tub feels like you are mixing in Glue and the taste is not that great too.
 good
 I was drinking double chocolate flavor for past 5 years. Decided to change this time. I do not like extreme milk chocolate. It has some weird aftertaste.
 Awesome taste..will buy again
 Tastes like chocolate milk.  Powder so fine,  it dissolves great!
 Gives u gainz
 One of the best Whey Protein in the market. Chocolate flavor is my favorite. It mixed easily on water.
 great product - quick delivery
 Good
 Great stuff.
 This stuff is so good. Blend two scoops of it in a nutribullet (or something similar) with a little water, frozen banana and 3 cubes of ice. It's literally the best thing I eat every day.
 I buy Optimum Nutrition protein everyone and then trying to like it but I just don't. Flavor is chalky and tears my stomach up.
 My absolute favorite protein powder. Great texture and taste!  Highly recommend! :)
 perfect product
 Tastes good, mixes easily, and I love that it is low in sugar and calories.
 I've been using this protein for about 5 years and its hard to find a better value.
 HNNNNGGGGG This stuff tastes great.
 Worst Taste Ever I basically gave this crap away jus to get ride of it
 Second time to purchase this flavor. Great product
 One of the easiest and better tasting proteins out there, very easy to mix!
 It has a synthetic sweetner, I gave the product away.
 Tasted like absolute garbage. We bought the big bag and had to throw it out because we couldn't bring ourselves to finish it.
 LOVE IT! By far the best flavor Optimum has to offer. I would recommend this to anyone wanting a good, everyday protein whey.
 Good protein!!! Taste very good.
 Tastes great.  Blends great with my stainless steel shaker ball
 NICE
 Saw a few negative reviews on the taste of the double rich chocolate... It tastes fantastic! Can't wait to try some of the other flavors as well
 This product seems to be less effective than the firs time I used it, the reason most probably is the online version is not pure. The packet I received last week doesn't have hallmark and the seal is not air-tight. I'm not buying this product online again and advice you the same - To buy it in person rather than online.
 now if I can cut way down on the carbs
 Great flavor. Great product.  Solid results (personal work required).
 It used to not have sucralose.  Now I have to find a new source of Whey protein.
 Terrible flavor! Avoid at all costs
 LOVE this protein. I've had a few different flavors of it and none have let me down. Currently on the Mocha Cappuccino one and it's awesome! Easily mixed, great taste, quality product.
 Don't like it 1 pound isn't worth my 20 bucks just go to a Walmart to buy a 2 pound for the same price
 Amazing taste, blends well
 I like the specs and nutrient breakdown, but the taste was hard to look past. I purchased this based on reviews of flavor. I was really disappointed.
 Good
 I'm hooked! Don't know if its a placebo effect, but hey, it makes me work out.
 Great product. By far the best whey protein on the market. Would recommend to anybody, regardless of fitness goals, because it's simply a great supplement staple to have.
 really good
 This is a large plastic container that is full of protein in a powdered form that tastes like cookies and cream. The description on Amazon of the product was a large plastic container that is full of protein in a powdered form that tastes like cookies and cream. Therefore, I am very satisfied with my large plastic container that is full of protein in a powdered form that tastes like cookies and cream. If you are looking for a large plastic container that is full of protein in a powdered form that tastes like cookies and cream, I suggest you buy this large plastic container that is full of protein in a powdered form that tastes like cookies and cream.
 Great product, have been using this brand for awhile. But my latest purchase didn't come with a scoop. Luckily I still had the one from my previous jug haha.
 I ordered the milk chocolate flavor and it tastes like garbage. Blech. Hard to use a protein you dread tasting!
 Best tasting.
 Taste is so bad I can't even use it.
 I would not rebuy this product.  It did not come with a scoop, though not a big deal, if it were not for the fact it is impossible to know how much product to use.  Directions say, use one scoop.  Is that a tablespoon or 2?  Who knows.  Called the company and you get to talk to a computer.  Press 4 and nobody answers, try pressing 3, which is for retailers, phone is answered and the nice lady, doesn’t know, but transfers you back to April, who apparently is doing her nails or not at work, so the phone just rings.  Left know with a 5pound 50 dollar paper weight.  Ok. If this happens to anyone else, April called me back!  A SCOOP IS 4 tablespoons or a 1/4of a cup.  Hope this helps.
 after 3 lbs it started to hurt my stomach, not sure what ingredient is doing it, but I switched to diff brand and no pain
 Awesome
 The product did not meet my expectations as advertised.
 This stuff tastes horrible. Amazon didn't have the delcious double choclate, so i got milk choclate instead...thinking how different can they be, right? Night and day. The milk choclate is probably appealing to boys in elementary school. it's too sweet.
 Great taste no grit
 Great price, great product.
 tastes great and the nutritional facts are exactly what i need for good clean power.
 great taste
 Great Product
 it is really good protein i would advice you guys to buy it, and i'm going to take another one.
 Best protein powder on the market! Mixes well and tastes great!
 The taste is bad.  Its protein though just like every otherprptein.  I won't spend $53.00 on this again when I can get it cheaper.
 vanilla flavor is great
 This is a good protein powder. Low in carb high protein.
 Taste good.
 Taste like vomit... literally. I Paid almost $60 for it so I'm just going to tuff it out.
 If you're looking for something that tastes good and gives you terrible farts, look no further!
 Don't like this not enough protein power for me
 I used it before and had developed a great amount of muscle.  I use it as a pre-workout with a few carbs and use as a recovery drink after a great workout.
 I have been using this product for 5+ years and nothing else compares. Great flavor,  strawberry banana taste bomb also.
 I bought this product from amazon about three times with different flavors. The last one was the delicious straw berry. it smells straw berry but somehow it doesn't taste straw berry. It doesn't taste anything at all. I mixed it with water and milk although I don't drink milk but no taste of straw berry. Make sure you check it before you buy the 5 lb.
 Best tasting protein powder I've used. Have both the milk chocolate and vanilla ice cream and I like them both.
 Can't go wrong with ON. A++
 Arrived as expected
 The cost of good quality protein shake mix can get expensive.  This protein shake mix tastes great and is well worth the price.
 Good stuff! : )
 I never learn! I know better than to buy flavored protein. I bought the coffee flavor and it makes me want to puke just thinking of it. Also It ONLY mixes with Water and cold water at that. If you mix it with anything else it gets really nasty and clumpy. Would not buy this product again.
 The bag had holes in it when I opened my package.
 Not a good match for me.
 Tastes great! Just like a Wendy's frosty when you blend chocolate malt with ice.
 It is going pretty good have not completed yet. It is working out for me so far being in Afghanistan.
 Awesome, as expected.
 Tastes good and you'll get swole af
 yuck
 Great price vs buying local.
 Great product! Taste fantastic!
 I am not a trainer, exercise rarely -- just trying to eat well and live a longer and richer life (more and better than my current 74 years).  I was hesitant when purchasing this Whey product given that many complained about the taste.  Alas, the taste could not worse then me attempting to eat the required daily fruit, but I could gulp it down.  Surprisingly, the Malt Chocolate complimented my taste buds.  I do not care for anything too sweet or much of a chocolate taste.  I add no sugar, only fruit (berries), Plain Greek Yogurt and Almond Milk, juice from 1 large orange and vanilla extract and/or whole fresh vanilla bean.  Voila! a smoothie that is a treat and great snack while looking at that young un, Jimmy Fallon.  Oh, and the comments regarding the sweetener used in this product, and trace amounts of preservatives -- Live it up.  You're taking life too seriously, and not necessarily extending your life.  Got to go and exercise !!!!
 Out of all the Whey Protein shakes I have tried, this is the best tasting. It still leaves a chalky taste/feeling in your mouth, but if you rinse you mouth with a swig of water it goes away. Overall I am satisfied with the Gold Standard Double Rich Chocolate, and will be buying it again when I run out.
 Best product that money can buy and great value too.
 Great
 The Ricky road taste is alright not great but not the worst that I have had.  Overall a good product.
 Awesome taste.
 Great product and I'm so happy it tastes great too!  Will be purchasing from them again.
 Cookies and cream is really good! I've been buying this stuff for a while , great results.
 Everything was as expected!
 Best protein on the market. Have ordered several times and will continue to order this on Amazon.
 my favorite whey protein! goes great in any shake!
 Great product!  Tastes great!
 I got this expecting it to be minty with a hint of chocolate. It is chocolaty with a hint of mint. Very comparable to those mints that are circular, brown, and green. Taste: Not great. If you like Chocolate, get the chocolate one. If you like good tasting protein, get the ON Vanilla Ice Cream and put it in milk, if you like mint, too bad.<br/><br/>If you become uncomfortable easily, stop reading this.<br/><br/>Of all of the protein powders I have tried, this has given me the worst protein gas sessions.
 It's what you need to for the gym and it already has plenty reviews so it speaks for itself.
 Good in calories count<br/>Bad in taste!
 Good stuff ! Good price !
 cookies and cream is the best flavor from this brand
 My dad and me have always used ON. They aren't all tricked out like most supplements.
 Good taste as always from on
 Tastes great, mixes well...love it!
 Aaaaaaaa
 It dissolves in water very easily. The flavor is not bad. It's doing what is should be doing.
 Good Taste. Seems To Help Recovery
 After reading about their new ingredient I thought that all of us consuming this on a regular basis should be aware.<br/>Please share this information and if you decide to do your own research I would suggest using independent studies, not corporation financed studies (like FDA).<br/>I hope ON will give us back the product everyone loved.
 I really do like this product I'm buying this again but this time I'm going for a 10 pounder!
 Great!
 Love it !!
 This protein is the Honda Civic of protein, very reliable.  Tastes great (as long as you mix it with milk)
 It really helps for my exercising
 Banana cream so bad taste do not try
 Best Whey, best flavor I've ever had, i love chocolate, this is perfect
 The best product to further support muscle mass gains, very pleased with the product ..
 Excellent product
 Top notch!
 A great investment.
 Fast delivery.<br/><br/>Recomand for all
 THANKS
 Great product.
 Great as always!
 its good
 Nice
 Good product
 Purchase for a co-worker
 Really good protein with BCAAs and whey, perfect for a lean body.
 Good product, although i felt it too sweet after using for some days in a roll.
 I like the shakes , but not as much this flavor , double chocolate is better!
 Amazing flavor
 High quality, great tasting
 Whey better than just strawberry !!!!
 77 servings of 24g protein mixes with water or milk without a blender. Has 5.5 grams of the BCAA's people buy on there own and 4 grams of glutamine or glutamic acid. Love this stuff. no bloat. A+  *UPDATE Contains asperflame, didnt catch that the first time around. Taking off a star for that reason, wish they would use stevia leaf extract for a sweetener.
 Not as much of a banana flavor as one would hope.
 Great stuff for my grandson who is a gym rat.
 who can tell me when and how to take this protein
 Mixes well, tastes okay, great quality!
 I have been using Optimum Nutrition 100% gold standard  whey for over years now and it was the something that made me loyal to Optimum Nutrition products. But this particular order was a total disappointment . It was nothing close to the my previous Optimum Nutrition 100% gold standard proteins and after a regular use of the this particular order for over a month ,I am convinced to most extent that it was not original ,in other words IT WAS FAKE...
 Incredible taste.
 We were big fans of this protein, loved the taste and the fact that had very little sugar but tasted great added to our morning fruit smoothies. On my last order, my family and I notice that it was noticeable a lot more sweeter and leaving a bad aftertaste. We compared the ingredients and sure enough they added sucralose and label it as a "New, improved great taste". Too bad...Pleaaase, go back to the original formula. It was much better and I will buy it again.
 I was excited to see that there was only 120 cals per scoop. And a lot of protein in this product.<br/><br/>The taste however was off to me. I had the banana cream and felt that something tasted awfully "chemically" to me.<br/><br/>I checked the ingredients and found that this item is FILLED with cancer causing agents one of them being Acesulfame Potassium.<br/><br/>Acesulfame Potassium is a Genetically Modified (GMO) sweetner. Some of the symptoms include respiratory disease and depression.<br/><br/>This is highly concerning for me because I strength train and eat right to try to avoid these very problems.<br/><br/>I tried to see if I could return this product, but as I suspected it is against Amazon return policy. And I have the 5lb.<br/><br/>My fault for not checking the ingredients prior to the purchase. At least I know for next time.<br/><br/>Next time I'd much rather get a protein that is filled with sugar and calories.
 cookies and cream flavor is the worst.
 Always 1 hunnit
 Taste good and gives u that feeling that your looking for after a good work out.. Must try it out.
 Warning to all! This tastes like absolute crap! I tried my first whey chocolate  protein shake, and I immediately threw up in the cup. Surprisingly, it tasted even better after that! Ive been drinking it now for 3 weeks and Ive tried everything (blender, milk, water, etc) to improve the taste but it is still awful. It's disgusting no matter how you formulate or mix it. Buyer beware!
 Good product and service
 Seems a legit and original product.
 The Double Rich Chacolate is very tastey and mixes really well
 Amazing as usual. Shipping was fast, great product.
 I thought this would be as great as Gold Standard Whey Double Rich Chocolate.  It is disgusting...no real coconut and it contains ASPARTAME...SO DISAPPOINTED.
 Yikes. . . My stomach and this product did not like each other therefore it's not the protein powder for me.
 ON whey protein is a great way to add protein to breakfast, supplement nutrients in your coffee, your favorite smoothie, and of course your pre-workout and post-workout.<br/><br/>From what I've read and in my opinion, it's crucial to get at least 30g of protein within 30-45 minutes of waking up. For me, that's where ON comes in. For those on the go, ON whey is perfect to get the protein you need quickly. Also, vanilla ice cream flavor, mixes easily into any smoothie, shake or blended coffee. With 24 grams of protein and only 120 calories, why would you choose any other protein?<br/><br/>UPDATE -- I've had Vanilla Ice Cream, Chocolate Coconut and White chocolate flavors and would say the flavor breakdown looks a little something like:<br/><a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Optimum-Nutrition-100-Whey-Gold-Standard-Vanilla-Ice-Cream-5-Pound/dp/B000GISU1M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard, Vanilla Ice Cream, 5 Pound</a>: Flavor 7.5/10; Ability to mix with different ingredients 9/10<br/><a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Optimum-Nutrition-100-Whey-Gold-Standard-Chocolate-Coconut-5-Pound/dp/B002SG7NFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard, Chocolate Coconut, 5 Pound</a>: Flavor 8/10; Ability to mix with different ingredients 6/10.<br/><a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Optimum-Nutrition-100-Whey-Gold-Standard-White-Chocolate-5-Pound/dp/B0030FU6VA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard, White Chocolate, 5 Pound</a>: Flavor 9/10; Ability to mix with different ingredients 8/10
 The protein is good/tasty in itself.<br/>However, not on the floor.<br/>When I received the package<br/>there was a puncture through<br/>the side of the box and penetrated<br/>the bag. When I opened the box,<br/>about 1/4 of the whey spilled everywhere.<br/>I managed to salvage most of it<br/>and put it in different containers,<br/>but there is a sticky mess for me to clean<br/>up. This may have been bad luck<br/>but with the poor wrapping the odds are<br/>higher that the bag could be damaged.
 I didn't see QR code  on my whey protein
 goodgoodgood
 Great protein, great value, taste good.
 Thanks
 Taste like medicine
 great product great value
 Taste great
 this chocolate was horrible, made me sick, will be throwing away 10 pounds...not happy.  Will stick to the other flavors
 + Actually I liked this product since I started using it 6 months back. It had a good consistency and a nice taste compared to all other whey proteins in the market.<br/><br/>+ It indeed gives you muscle gains which is its main purpose, although not so rapidly.<br/>+ It is cheap compared to the amount of protein delivered.<br/>+ the vanilla flavor was my favorite, because if you get bored with the taste, you can mix it up with coffee, tea, starwberry syrup, chocolate syrup, bannans and introduce variety, which is difficult to do with other flavors<br/><br/>- dries out your mouth, causes odour in your breath.<br/><br/>------ BUT the most important of all, the reason I am writing this review: as much as I loved when I started taking this product, I hate it so much now for all the huge amount of BACNE, HAIRLOSS and BALD PATCHES I developed.<br/><br/>I am not sure whether this increase in Bacne, and Baldness is due to strength training in general or whey protein, but based on all the research I have done it appears whey protein isolates are the culprit.<br/>Again it does not cause bacne and baldness to everyone using it, but only for the people who are already genetically predisposed to bacne or baldness. It accelerates the already existing condition of bacne or baldness.<br/><br/>So folks who already have a history of baldness in your family, use this product with caution. And if you see more acne/bacne spots developing or losing more hair, whey protein could probably be the cause.
 in love
 It has great nutritional content, mixes well and tastes good. What is troublesome to me is the artificial sweeteners.. I am throwing this away and moving on to a protein powder with NO ARTIFICIAL  SWEETENER.
 Best tasting whey I've had!!
 Optimum Nutrition has been my go-to protein brand for quite some time now. I like the various flavors and the large containers. I use this powder every day, but the tub lasts me a few months. My favorite flavors are Coffee and Double Chocolate.<br/><br/>My only wish is that the milk used to make this whey came from humanely treated animals not treated with hormones or antibiotics. I would pay more money for a good tasting protein that didn't cause me nagging concerns about my impact on the animals it came from.
 Great price
 Never getting this flavor again, (cookies and cream) Im sure the product by itself if great but the flavor is disgusting.. i have to add a banana and some peanut butter to make it drinkable...
 Wonderful!
 OMG, Best in the world
 Good
 Good taste, I need to hit the gym more often before I actually see results from this product. I only gave it 3 stars because my local Costco has the same product for the same price.
 Tastes great. Only giving 2 stars because it comes unsealed. Not even a seal under the lid. I don't know if I got the full amount I paid for or if this was a return. Not good.
 ON Gold Standard 100% Whey is generally considered one of the best if not the best whey protein out there. While it taste good and mixes well, I didn't find it much better than the alternatives which are $10-$15 cheaper which can add up. You can probably find whey protein half the price with similar ingredient if you are willing to forgo taste, mixibility, etc.
 i can't say i love the taste of this stuff made me gag everytime i had some and i didn't even notice any results, drink this stuff atleast 3 times a day
 I don't need my protein to be amazing tasting, but this is so nasty that I dread drinking it.  I originally got Strawberry to mix with smoothies, and as an additive to someting with real flavor, it's fine. But on it's own with water or milk, pretty gross. I was hoping vanilla would be a little better, but it's 10 times worse and leaves an aftertaste that makes me want to gargle with mouthwash.  Not to mention, the package says it's "Instatized" because it supposedly dissolves with simply stirring.  Yeah, definitely not.  Clump city, but yet so thin.  I'm mesmorized y the horrible nature of this protein and can't believe how many people love it.
 Great
 I paid $63 last time for a protein powder which only had 60 servings. I paid less for this and more servings. Haven't really tried the product yet
 I've been purchasing through Amazon the last 6 months. I purchased through costco last month, tasted better and bought it for the same price plus it was 6 lbs instead of 5lbs
 Absolutely the best protein I have ever had. I was a bit worried because whey normally closes my throat and I struggle to breathe for a while. The gold standard mixed easily and tasted great. I was using quest before this and that was great but I still felt tired after drinking it and this purchase has solved that issue.

Because of that, unless I am offered to review/test a new brand, I ALWAYS buy this.<br/><br/>• So you want to know why Whey Protein more specifically, Whey Isolate is extremely important, should you be using it &amp;/or is this a good product? Well let me break this down a bit in hopes I can teach you something you may not have known and help you with your buying decision.<br/><br/>————————————————————— Product Information: —————————————————————<br/>• Whey Isolate - it's important to realize that not all forms of whey protein powder are created equally. Whey protein isolate is the most complete forms of protein because it contains the greatest protein concentration coming in at 90-95%, while the rest of the whey protein powders range from 25-89% total protein content. Isolate contains the lowest level of lactose, so perfect for anyone that is lactose intolerant. Benefits of Whey Protein include: helps support a healthy immune system, supports heart health, helps with maintaining a healthy body weight &amp; composition, promotes muscle growth, loss of body fat, reduces the risk for breast cancer in women, helps control blood glucose levels &amp; helps prevent muscle &amp; bone loss older adults. Whey Protein, more specifically Whey Isolate is extremely important, for those reasons. Remember that protein is the building blocks of muscle. If you are dieting or looking to bulk up, Whey protein is your best friend because it provides your body with all of the amino acids it needs to promote ideal health results from workout/training, it's low in calories, carbohydrates, fats, cholesterol &amp; very convenient. The more protein you eat the more muscle &amp; if you are dieting you will be able to keep more muscle.<br/><br/>—————————---------———————————— PROS: ———-----————————————————————<br/>• Glanbia is a global nutrition company with their own farms and supplies MANY protein companies, BUT OWNS Optimum Nutrition. So why buy from a secondary source when you can buy right direct from the #1 source &amp; that my Amazon Family makes them the best for a reason!<br/><br/>• This is Whey Protein Blend with Isolate being more abundant.<br/><br/>• My favorite flavor is Banana Cream &amp; taste unbelievably good.<br/><br/>• I always make my shakes in a blender so mixability isn’t an issue for me but I assure you that even in just a shaker cup the mixablity is phenomenal, which leads me to my next pro..<br/><br/>• This is absolutely 100% instantized!<br/><br/>• Has Digestive Enzymes which is extremely important for me. I have been using this for many years now &amp; never once has my stomach been all jerked up, so another thing i can assure you is true.<br/><br/>• This is Ultra-Filtered &amp; any top of the line Whey would make sure the Whey is carefully micro-filtered or Ultra-Filtered to remove any harmful bacteria. The Whey will pass through a special micro-filter &amp; immediately after, bacteria &amp; spores are separated. This process also separates any denatured (altered/cooked) whey proteins from undenatured proteins so that the result is a high quality whey protein rich in alpha-lactalbumin and beta-lactoglobulin (two special proteins found in whey that have immunological benefits) and low in fat. Un-denatured whey proteins obtained in this manner also have better solubility, which means it dissolves easily in any fluid added to it.<br/><br/>• Optimum Nutrition list down the breakdown of their entire Amino Acid profile! That my Amazon Family is excellent!<br/><br/>• This has approximately 28g of Amino Acids which if you did not know, is a pretty healthy amount. Many won't list it because<br/>1) it is embarrassing low or<br/>2) They have something to hide.<br/><br/>• Did I mention that this has approximately 5g of Glutamine. Many Whey Proteins do not add any.<br/><br/>• I always buy the 5lb jug &amp; the cost $57.99 is an exceptional price, in fact, many lessor Brands of Whey cost more!<br/><br/>• Only 2g of sugar &amp; 4g of carbs per scoop. Not sure where that sugar comes from because I read the “other ingredients” and don’t see it. Uses Sucralose, unless the sugar is coming from the “Natural flavor”.<br/><br/>• 24g of protein per scoop which is more than most brands.<br/><br/>• Has more flavors than ANY company on the planet, so you will never get bored!<br/><br/>————————————————————— CONS: —————————————————————<br/>• NONE!!!!!!!<br/>—————————————---———————-— Final Thoughts: ——————--———————————--————<br/>• So this is the ONLY protein brand I spend my hard earned money on &amp; will ever! This is my honest &amp; professional review &amp; I was not given anything in return! I paid full price for this &amp; worth every cent!<br/>I been buying this for many many many years.<br/><br/>—————————————---———————-— Personal Note: —————————————---———————-—<br/>• Buying a respectable brand is actually extremely important because many companies are selling a container of Whey Protein Concentrate as isolate &amp; unless you ran a analysis on it or really know your proteins, you probably wouldn't even know you were using a cheap form of WPC until you started gaining body fat, started feeling bloated, getting gas, etc., and not getting the results you wanted from using this stuff. You would be surprised at how many companies do this! I 100% recommend <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Optimum-Nutrition-100-Whey-Gold-Standard-Banana-Cream-5-Pound/dp/B0015R3AOA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard, Banana Cream, 5 Pound</a>!!
 Frm dis product i can see lots of improvement... I luv dis whey protein ..specially my fav double chocolate taste great tooo...
 I bought the extreme chocolate, and when you open it--smells like Nestle Quick.  It doesn't taste amazing--tastes like choclate milk, just a little chalky so it's not bad at all (better than most other brands for sure)  I recommend it because I am trying to lose weight (and succeeding).  I've lost 20 lbs this month, but that's incorporating eating healthier (higher protein diet) and excersize. I drink one shake in the morning (I just mix it with 8 oz of skim milk), and one after weight training. It works for weight loss because it does not contain all of the fat, calories, and carbohydrates that other protein powders contain, e.g., Muscle Milk.  Don't get me wrong Muscle Milk is good for those trying to bulk up, and pack on the muscle.  This protein powder simply gives me the protein that I need to build/maintain muscle compostion which subsequently burns my body fat. On the flip side, if you are doing a lot of cardio rather than weight training you could probably use a protein powder with more calories.  If you don't eat enough calories, and you have a strenuous cardio routine your body will resort to burning muscle for energy rather than fat.  This is because your body will go into "conservation mode" and store fat for survival while burning muscle for energy.<br/><br/>*Basically, if you are eating healthy, have a weight training routine, and want to lose weight: BUY THIS POWDER.
 I did not get a chance to take this substance yet, however, the bottle was huge and it smell good when I opened the bottle. will start to take it next month.
 After using this supplement i have gained so much muscle that i have to turn sideways while walking trough doorway .
 If you have diabetes you should avoid this product.  The potassium used in the sweetener is bad for your kidneys.
 I ordered this product and I have NO scoop inside...really how expensive and NO scoop. So I can't comment in taste quality of product but so far not impressed w it! Esp for $$ and NO scoop included!!!  I could have bought a cheaper product and it would have included the scoop. VERY disappointed!
 I have used this product on a consistent basis for years. However, the primary problem is that it can be shipped in an almost  spoiled condition. By that I mean it either becomes  somewhat malodorous very soon or it can cause stomach cramps. Neither is good. While the product might be very good at a good price when fresh the whole idea does not work when it makes you sick. I am switching to Muscle Milk
 Worst tasting protein powder I've ever bought, ended up throwing it all in the trash. Not to mention the high cholesterol level. My suggestion and what I'm switching back to - Beverly International UMP protein powder!
 Tastes like powdered coconut. I had such high hopes based on other reviews but alas this is about as bad as the original strawberry flavored protein powder I used to buy when there were no other options.
 Extreme milk chocolate - Stronger taste, slightly clumpy, tastes amazing! tastes very similar to ovaltine cold malt chocolate. By far favorite flavor mixed with milk.<br/><br/>Double Rick Chocolate - dull taste, goes down easy. tastes pretty good.
 I run between 5-6 miles per day 6 days a week and  I am looking for a way to  easily increase my protein intake following my runs. I can not tell if the product has an impact on muscle mass because I was only able to consume it 3 times.  Besides the fact that it has a very metallic taste (and I mean really metallic like drinking liquid aluminum) , I got physically ill all 3 times I consumed it,  including bloating and nausea. I tried mixing it with water and gatorade and same result (I don't drink any dairy, soy or almond milk products).  So now I will cook a chicken breast each night and have it ready to eat after my run.
 Meatheads come one come all!!! This is the protein for you! If you lift massive amounts of weight and douchely slam your weight on the ground THIS IS FOR YOU!! If you scream at the top of your lungs when bench pressing two plates.... THIS IS FOR YOU!!! If you wear glitter hats, string tank tops, and constantly admire your sweet LATS in the mirror!! THIS IS FOR YOU!!!! PROTEIN will make you stronger, especially while drinking this while deadlifting 400 LBS. Do not hesitate. MEATHEADS!!! THIS IS YOUR PROTEIN!!!
 This review is not on the product itself but rather its false advertisement. If you look at the images for the product, the shot of the nutritional facts tells you that there are 149 servings per container. I would assume that those contents were referring to the actual product I was about to order, so my cost analysis was based on that. I was disappointed to receive the 5 pound jug and notice that it only had 68 servings. I think this is wrong that Amazon is letting Optimum Nutrition falsely advertise its product.
 POOR QUALITY
 If this world wasn't so politically correct than they could have named this flavor "s***". You see where I'm going?
 Best protein hands down.  I have tried multiple whey proteins and this is the best tasting plus results.  Will only buy ON
 Gained 50lbs lean muscle
 I was fine with it for the first week or so, but then it started taking a toll. I would feel nauseated a few hours after working out and drinking it. Now I vomit any time I use it unless it's in very small amounts. I read up some stuff about digestive enzymes and whatnot, but it seems like this was a waste of money since I'd have to take pills just to use it. This probably isn't the standard reaction, but it still gets 1 star in my book.
 I've been ordering this product mainly through Bodybuilding.com. I went ahead and purchased this 5 lb., choc. chip flavor from Amazon, due to the fact that I saved on free shipping and no tax.<br/>I first opended the product and noticed the smell of it was different. I mixed up a protein shake and immediately notice bland taste to it.<br/>I can compare it to the choc. chip I purchased from Bodybuilding .com, which has a fresh taste to it.<br/>So, it seems to me that Amazon receives Gold Standard Whey products that have past their expiration date. It still works as I do drink it daily, sometimes twice on the days I work out at the gym. I'm still getting good results and can tolerate the taste.<br/>I believe I'll not order this product from Amazon any longer and continue to order from Bodybuilding.com<br/><br/>This is only my opinion, take it or leave it...good luck!
 Tastes no better or worse than anything else.  Mixes well, value is good.  I always come back to the ON Whey for my go to product.
 Wow, did not like this flavor at all. Here's a much better alternative:<br/><br/>http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QSNYGI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000QSNYGI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=amarvw-20&amp;linkId=MCKGPUQWXNRSLTA2
 Mint chocolate sucks. Cytogainer is better, but I'm sure this one is better for you.
 I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone I remotely like.<br/><br/>I ordered the "Double Rich Chocolate" 5LB. It does not taste like any chocolate I've ever tasted; it's truly disgusting. However, since you don't really buy protein powder for the taste this isn't the reason why I dislike this product. The reason I dislike it is because it's really hard on my stomach especially when I add it to milk. I guess I'm lactose intolerant, but I also think that the artificial sweeteners got a lot to do with it.<br/><br/>If you have to buy a smaller portion. Try it out first before you go for the 5LB. It may help your work out, but you shouldn't put that ahead of your digestive system, and your overall health.<br/><br/>I am throwing mine away. I guess I'll take it as a learning experience.
 Good buy for t he money.
 I use this product online regularly, but this particular flavor is lacking.  The taste is more like vanilla ice cream that forgot it was supposed to add flavor to it.  Imagine ice cream without taste and sweetness and you have what this taste like.
 I don't know what the other people who reviewed this product are used to in a great tasting shake, but this ain't it!  Fresh cup of hell no!  I can't speak on the nutritional beneifits because I couldn't finish even one shake.  Try at your own risk.
 When I decided to start using whey protein powder, I did extensive research and found ON Whey Gold Standard was reviewed to be the best.  And it was.  Best taste, best consistency, best protein.  I started out at 120 pounds of skin and bones and now I'm a robust 220 pounds and it only took 6 weeks.
 One of the best protein mixes I have used. It is carb conscious, and has many of the aminos you need (some that are neglected by other protein mix distributors). Great for bulking and even fat loss!
 Want to get big
 The Best Whey
 Whey Protein Isolate not 100% Pure but 90%
 Best tasting protein shake I've had.
 It's ok like most protein powder
 GREAT PRODUCT
 My go-to protein powder.  Dissolved easily.
 Good product
 This stuff puts me right to sleep.
 This is probably the worst tasting protein I've ever had. I don't know why people rate it so high! My advice, look around for a better tasting one.
 Great taste but I dont see effect
 good
 Like the taste.  Will buy again
 I just ordered Muscle Milk for the first time since Amazon informed me that Optimum Nutrition has pulled this from the subscribe and save program.  I like the product, but not very happy with the company for pulling it from the program and raising the price.
 tastes great!
 Terrible taste
 HAVING SOY IN YOUR PROTIEN WHAT AN OXYMORON  SOY IS A SUBSTITUTE FOR ESTROGEN WHICH IS A FEMALE HORMONE !!!!
 This tastes horrible when mixed with water. I mean absolutely awful. Almost utterly undrinkable. When I mix it with milk it tastes better than my preferred brand of protein. One star when mixed with water, FIVE stars when mixed with milk. Averages out to three stars.
 thx
 Good stuff! mixes well and tastes good.Will buy again.
 worth it
 I WAS MAKIN ALL KINDS OF GAINS!!!!<br/><br/>ALL KINDS!!!
 Based on the reviews, this seems to be a popular product. I bought it and tried it out. First thing I noticed is that it's very sweet. Much sweeter than other protein powders I've used.  My mistake for not noticing earlier but the ingredients list includes Sucralose, which has been linked to migraines, liver disease and tumors. It's also just REALLY sweet so a little goes a long way.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the seller does not accept returns so I'm stuck with a 5 pound can of unusable product.
 Great flavor
 Tastes like burnt plastic mixed with dish soap
 Taste is ok
 Great product
 Wicked tasty, visible gains.
 Solid value,  tastes good.
 none
 Works great
 good price
 Get vanilla ice cream or chocolate. This taste like a popped zit.
 I ate 3 pounds with a gallon and a half of milk and produced a magnificent stool. It must have been at least 6 courics. Unfortunately, the consistency deteriorated and the feces became unsuitable for preservation.<br/><br/>I would give this a 3/5 overall. I feel like it's the generic "walmart" style protein enhancement. It will no doubt produce results (7 courics folks) but the stool lacks a certain character. Other powders (such as JYM pro) will provide a more charismatic and aromatic experience, not unlike that of a double order of PF Chang's Orange Chicken. Sure, these other powders are more expensive. But you know what? It's worth it. From only 2 pounds of JYM pro, I was able to produce almost 8 lbs of excrement!<br/><br/>Bottom line folks (pardon the pun), is that this protein is great if you're just going for quantity. Its cheaper than its competitors and will undoubtedly give that colon a workout. But if you want a quality deposit - one that provides marker butt and sticks to the bowl for days afterwords - treat yo'self and splurge a little on the good stuff.
 The Evil Duke and his friends love this.  Now they all are buying it.  Apparently flavor is important.  The Evil Duke likes the chocolate.  One of the vanillas is OK and the other gak!  One of his friends gets the good vanilla. Another friend is now getting the strawberry.  The all lift weights and do weight training.
 Not good
 I used to buy ON's Gold Standard for some time but for $50......will not buy it any more. No subscribe &amp; save option- greed!<br/>Sam's club sells 5lbs of Muscletech for $32.
 Amazing taste.
 This stuff is the best....hands down....<br/>I lose weight and keep muscle with this.  Period.  No fluff or filler.
 Tastes great, mixes well, little to no chalky after taste. This will probably be my next subscribe and save product!
 To anybody who currently uses Double Rich Chocolate and is debating switching to Extreme Milk Chocolate...DO IT! I just made the switch and I'm glad I did. Double Rich tastes good in milk but just meh in water. Extreme Milk tastes AWESOME in both. It's much better than Double Rich, I'll never be going back to that one. It tastes a lot more chocolately and is really good in just water which is better for cuts. Highly recommend this flavor.
 ON opted out of the subscribe and save program.<br/><br/>Now I go to COSTCO and buy Muscle Milk's 6lb bag.<br/><br/>I prefer ON, but for $6 less and a pound more of product, MM gets my money.<br/><br/>I'll go back to ON if they come back to Subscribe and Save.
 I made one shake and I was able to deadlift 500 lbs on my first trip to the gym in my life.
 Good Protein powder.
 Great protein.  Been using it for about 8 years now.  Double Rich Chocolate has never let me down.
 I'm an amateur body-builder on a budget.  Most body-building experts suggest a minimum of 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight per day.  That's a lot.  I used to eat several cans of albacore (tuna) to achieve the protein requirement but got concerened about Mercury levels in my body from eating all that tuna.  Plus, you can only eat so much before you just get sick of it.  This product makes getting all the protein one needs a breeze and at a cost signicantly less than that of tuna or any store bought food.  In fact if there's a better grams-of-protein-per-dollar value available, someone please let me know about it!  And from what I've read, Whey is the way (no pun intended) to go as far as protein supplements.  Lastly, I think it tastes pretty good (close to chocolate milk) too, and doesn't have a lot (any?) of sugar, although it's hard to avoid clumps without a blender.
 I purchased the french vanilla flavor. It tastes horrible and that's not even the worst part.<br/><br/>This product also contains soy (lecithin) which is a  source of phytoestrogens. Search on google and read the abstract: "Estrogens in the daily diet: In vitro analysis indicates that estrogenic activity is omnipresent in foodstuff and infant formula" for the source. I don't know how much soy lecithin it contains though, could be little or could be a lot because there is no way to find out.
 Not sure how they're doing their packaging nowadays, but I found a large white hair when pulling out my first scoop. I live alone and have short black hair, so there's no way it came from anywhere else.
 The bottle was open and half of contents were out
 the product is false and is not described .
 The 5 lb jug is 9.80/lb, this is more then 11$. Buy the 5 lbs. Great protein by the whey
 This tasted awful. I had to get rid of it
 Works great and fits perfect, looks like it's part of the PS4!
 I did not get this. It tells me it is as Delivered to the inbox but it was not there when I went there today I need to know what’s going on with this item since I paid for it already and it was very expensive
 You deserve this one star for making Double Rich Chocolate the default flavor. I stupidly presumed I was buying Extreme Milk Chocolate...<br/><br/>Now I'm stuck with a 10 pound bag of this stuff.
 Pros:<br/>Tastes fine in water or milk<br/>Can be made thin or thick, when you make it thick it's not too gritty<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>My scoop was buried half way down!

 I was looking for something to replace my MagLite but didn't want to spend a bundle. This flashlight is every bit as good as my MagLite but costs 1/3 the price. Might get another one for my truck.
 You know what this is.  I'll just add it's the best flavour on the planet...don't think about ordering Dark Chocolate or Mint Tulip or Strawberry Milkshake...this is the one flavour you need in your life.  Don't kid yourself.
 I have read some very bad things about Whey protein.  Did not finish this product.
 Didn't see any difference from not using it!  Another way of wasting your money!
 I've been using protein supplements for over ten years.  There are a variety of factors that determine the price of protein powders, the two most important of which are quality of the protein and taste.  For the most part, you get what you pay for.  Cheap protein isn't very high quality and often tastes like chalk.  Really expensive protein is high quality and tastes good, but you're often paying for advertising.  Optimum Nutrition is a solid quality product - not the most pure, but very good (and I'm not convinced there is a big difference between moderate range and elite range proteins). So, the quality is very good, but on top of that, the Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey line is one  of my favorite tasting protein powders I have ever used.  I have tried most of the flavors, and they are all above average; Most I would rate 4 to 5 stars (you can buy a package with a single serving of about 15 different flavors - I got mine from Bodybuilding.com).  For the price, this is by far my favorite protein company. I go through one five-pound jug every two months. I recommend it to all of my friends.  My favorite flavor is Extreme Milk Chocolate (5/5 stars).  It is fantastic with just milk, and I like to make shakes with it in the blender using ice, milk, bananas and peanut butter. It has been one of the best selling supplements on Bodybuilding.com for years for a reason.  Try it, and you won't be disappointed.
 I like to put my protein in mason jars. The strawberry one I had already take a single scoop of and the chocolate one wasn't even opened when I put it in the jar. I noticed a difference. You get less chocolate flavored protein (probably because it's more popular therefore creating a higher demand). I ain't even mad I just thought it was super shady! Both bags were the same in weight and in servings according to the package, but the inside product tells a different story.
 I just removed the plastic wrapping around the lid. I opened the unit expecting a seal to peal off from the container lip. That would be standard for contamination protection on any powdered food container. Nothing there. I did not like to see that at all.<br/><br/>I expected to see the scoop at the top. It was at the very bottom of the container. I had to dig my hand and arm down to find it. It's not flipping sanitary to have to do that.<br/><br/>Is this normal for everyone else?
 I bought this product for a friend. So I cannot honestly offer an opinion on how it performed. Sincere apologies.
 Avoid delicious strawberry.. It has to be one of worst tasting proteins I've had.. The chocolates (extreme milk and double rich), creamy french vanilla, cookies and cream taste pretty good... Going to try rocky road next..<br/>Update: Rocky road is great..  5 stars for gold standard all together.. But now ON has decided to no longer participate in the subscribe and save plan.. Sure going to miss that.. Delivered just in time for the previous one to run out..
 Broken package....
 This brand is pretty good and it works but I'm giving it 2 stars cuz I have Lactose intolarance and this product has lactose so it made me sick sometimes and it made my acne worse
 Sorry haven't used it yet very nice size tho
 Unlike most reviewers here, I am not a bodybuilder. Instead, I use protein powders for correcting digestive problems. I'm prone to bacteria imbalances and inflammation in my small intestine which make it hard for me to digest meat and cheese. Forget about building muscle. As a result, I rely on protein powders for my protein, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I get to avoid the negative side of meat consumption and besides, I get higher quality protein from whey. Over the years, I've tried many protein powders (from not only whey but also egg, soy, pea, rice, etc.). Remember that I have digestive problems, so I can tell you which ones cause symptoms and which ones don't. This Optimum Nutrition Whey is the only one that doesn't. Why? Probably because it doesn't contain a bunch of weird carbohydrates and sweeteners that ferment in my gut. This stuff is sweetened only slightly and did not cause me to bloat like so many other protein powders. Also, I've noticed that most protein blends have some other forms of protein in them, such as soy or casein. This one is 100% whey, as it should be. No hard to digest carbs, no hard to digest proteins. This brand, in my experience, is the most effective one for rebuilding a damaged intestinal lining and for easily absorbing the complete proteins that many of us have a hard time digesting.<br/><br/>I hope this helps other people with digestive troubles.
 very bad for your body has a lot of chemicals made my SO very sick do not recommend. go organic
 bad deliveried
 ON Gold Standard Whey is one of the best i have tried in terms of the muscle building and recovery effects it has, it also has an awesome smooth texture to it and has remained great over the years, i also recommend going for the double rich chocolate, mocha or rocky road flavours as these are all very nice to consume on a regular basis, this along with their pre workout and gold standard mass gainer are top notch and work well to support gains in muscle strength and size.  Since using this though i have discovered another version which is just as effective from MyProtein named The Whey,  I feel this is a direct clone or atleast close match of this whey protein blend and contains the same sources of whey isolate and hydro whey as well as the addition of the digestive enzymes, it also mixes easily and is available in great flavours such as decadent milk chocolate, chocolate caramel and salted caramel which are all very nice, i only recommend going for that version as the more economical version but does not mean lower in quality which it is not based on my personal use of the 2 different proteins, with Gold Standard i feel you are paying more for the brand and marketing.<br/><br/>if you found any value in my review and would like to go for The Whey as a sub to this protein powder then please use code: GEOFF-RDT (*on myprotein.com when ordering direct) and all in capital letters at checkout to get up to 80% off order depending on current offers, thanks and I hope this was of benefit to you :). *current offers is usually general sale where items can be 50-60% off, so base 30% off + offers lead to full 80% plus.
 Sure taste wise it may require some getting used to, but you know what, for what ON packs in the bag it's worth it!! I typically take 1 scoop with water for breakfast and workout an hour after. Since I have been doing this I feel great!! I am also not a big eater so having 24g of protein per scoop is awesome. I love that is not something crazy like 50 or 60g because I do not think my body could handle that much per scoop! Mixing wise, it mixes best with water and if you are going to be using milk I recommend you blend it. What about the vanilla that they sale at Costco? It tastes terrible!! HOWEVER, I find that the vanilla is great for baking or mixing in with recipes like protein cookies or protein brownies. So just because you cannot drink it does not mean you cannot use it :) Best flavor I ever had was Extreme Chocolate milk but The Double Rich Chocolate is what I can afford right now. But if you have the extra cash and want it all, then definitely get the Extreme Chocolate Milk!!
 So far I've tried 3 flavors of this stuff. Coffee is my favorite so far. I have a hard time deciding whether I prefer ON or bsn protein, both are excellent quality and make some really good flavors. Typically with proteins I stick to the chocolate, coffee or peanut butter flavored varieties. I hate the fruit flavored stuff.<br/><br/>Coffee - 5 stars! Tastes exactly like instant coffee with a bit of milk/cream. Probably the single best tasting protein shake I've had to date. Without a doubt the best tasting when mixed with water (I HATE using water for most shakes but don't mind with this)<br/><br/>Mochachino - 3.5/5 stars. It tastes exactly like someone mixed the coffee flavor with the chocolate variety. Not the best flavor but not the worst either. Doesn't mask the protein flavor as well as the "coffee" flavored variety. I don't even see why this exists honestly it's just a worse version of the coffee flavor. I can't see anybody preferring this over the coffee.<br/><br/>Double chocolate - 2/5 stars. I think this stuff is foul! I had trouble choking it down. It's the worst chocolate flavored protein shake I've ever had by far. It isn't sweet enough and has just an odd nasty taste to it. Horrible. I'm going to try one of their other chocolate varieties next and god I hope it's not this bad! I give this two stars because even though it's bad it doesn't come close to how bad some of the flavors from other brands I've tried are. Not good tasting stuff though, I'd avoid this flavor if I were you!
 ON Whey has been my main source of protein for a decade now. I try other protein powders but always come back to this. I see a lot of people complaining about the "new formula" and such. I bought a tub (Coffee) and see for myself. IT TASTES FINE! What are these people talking about? If you really want to taste bad protein powder. Go try the vegan stuff. I actually just got done sampling a few tubs over the course of a year or so and that stuff truly tastes horrible, but I still didn't complain. Remember, this is a protein drink. You're not sipping on it like a hot cup of coffee in the morning. When I take this post workout I down it in 15-20 seconds. So even if it did taste like shit I wouldn't care.
 I use this protein powder in a lot of different recipes. Bars, shakes, cookies, etc I've tried a lot of flavors, but extreme milk chocolate is definitely one of my favorites. I mix it with greek yogurt, almond milk, banana, chia seeds, psyllium husk powder and ice every morning for my smoothie. Tastes great!
 After my previous whey seller upped their price too high, I was on the lookout for a new whey.  This blend is predominantly whey protein isolate, tastes great, and mixes fairly well (not 100% isolate well, but not "for clump-lovers only," either).  Only real gripe is the price.  It's a delicious, easy-to-mix, high quality whey blend from a reputable manufacturer. Other than "please by me more of the vanilla ice cream flavor," there isn't much more to say.
 I've been lifting for a few years now; started with powerlifting and moved the olympic weightlfting. The vast majority of my protein comes from food sources, but I liked to add a scoop or two of whey every day. I've tried ON Gold Standard Strawberry, Chocolate, and Natural Chocolate, as well as Dymatize French Vanilla, Cookies and Cream, Chocolate, and Vanilla. I've also tried GNC Chocolate (horrible protein powder, loaded with filler and it's all whey protein concentrate, mixes horribly).<br/><br/>The chocolate and the natural chocolate tasted almost identical, except natural chocolate had a much more natural cocoa taste, like when you eat brownies or hot chocolate; the taste is very similar to hot chocolate, whereas the normal chocolate tastes thinner and it has the strange artificial aftertaste. Neither flavor was bad by any means, but chocolate protein powders are always kind of bland and not that tasty, plus, out of all the protein flavors, they stink the most if you accidentally forget to clean your protein bottle afterwards.<br/><br/>The strawberry flavor is what I'm using now, and it's pretty great. I like it with water more than milk, but with milk, it tastes just like strawberry milk. Don't expect actual strawberry fruit flavor; this is the type of strawberry flavor they use in strawberry milk. It's very sweet, but it has much less of the artificial sweetener aftertaste that chocolate has. I don't even like strawberry milk and I really like this flavor, would definitely recommend.<br/><br/>My tip for choosing protein powder flavors is to generally go with vanilla or vanilla flavors, as you can never really go wrong (cookies and cream is a vanilla flavor) with them, whereas chocolate can taste terrible and fruit flavors can taste really bizarre. Dymatize cookies and cream is probably the best tasting protein powder out there in my opinion, it's a real treat to drink, even with just water.<br/><br/>Anyways, moving on the actual protein content and nutrition, this is a pretty good powder. Barely any filler, it's mainly whey protein isolate, so the cholesterol level is very low (the easiest way to tell if a protein powder is generally concentrate is to look at the cholesterol, its usually 20-30%). That's pretty great, and this protein goes on sale a lot, so it's much cheaper than the whey protein isolates other brands sell (truenutrition, ON whey isolate (sold only in costco for some reason), proteinfactory, now foods, isopure, etc). If you want to buy in bulk, get from truenutrition, but if you're buying 10 lbs or less, get ON Gold Standard on a deal.
 This is my first ON flavor which I only got because I had a coupon that made it more cost-effective to get over my favorite coffee-flavored protein from Dymatize (the Cafe Mocha, which is also the best tasting protein I've ever had in general) and I have to say I wasn't immediately impressed but that's because this flavor requires a little less liquid to bring out the best taste. I have 2 scoops for breakfast and normally use 12-14 oz with any protein I've ever used but with this flavor it tasted akin to pouring water in an already watered down cup of coffee. I tried it with almond milk though and it was delicious, I could taste a luscious coffee flavor with a nice hint of chocolate. This is a great flavor if you enjoy your protein with milk, if you want to use water though, I'd recommend as little as 4-5 oz per scoop so it doesn't taste too watered down. I give it 4 stars because even if it's a little odd with the typical amount of water, it's still better than the usual chocolate/vanilla/cookies &amp; cream flavors out there.
 What can I tell you, it's a huge tub of protein. ON brand is the best protein you can get for mixing / flavor, and chocolate is the best flavor in my opinion. 24 grams of gains per scoop, and only 150 calories per scoop.<br/><br/>The only downside to ON Gold Standard is that it is one of the most expensive 'mainstream' brands, but between the flavor and how easy it is to mix, I still buy it every time. Buy it in bulk to get it slightly discounted.
 Being a #1 seller on bodybuilding, I gave this a try years ago and it's immediately become one of my go to options when it comes to protein powders. The taste is always very good, especially with water. The mixability is phenomenal which is a huge factor why I like it. It leaves me full for hours without getting the bloating feeling. The value for this protein is unbeatable.
 It gets two stars because I realize, nutritionally, the product is great. No argument.<br/><br/>However taste is subjective and "Double Chocolate" left me wondering where the chocolate was? On top of that this brand's powder for whatever reason, makes for a very watery shake I don't like at all. I'm a fan of thicker shakes. (2 scoops to 1.5 cups almond milk= watery shake, no thickness, even adding peanut-butter)<br/><br/>I get that maybe other brands might not be as protein dense, but I'd rather have slightly lower quality and better taste, than this level of quality that produces something I can't even stand to drink it tastes so bad.<br/><br/>I will give the product some credit that it does seem to work well in shaker bottles. Just not a winner for me. Onto the next!
 I used to love this product, and used it for years.  Recently they changed the formulation and added Splenda; not sure what other changes were made.  I found the new version to be sickly sweet -- even when mixed with unsweetened almond milk.  It also left an unpleasant feeling of coating in my mouth.  When I wrote to the company they stated that the changes were based on focus group feedback, but I don't know who would like that!  They do have a version without artificial flavors and sweeteners, although the taste still isn't as good as the old version of this.  Plus they only sell that one in a 2 pound container so it ends up costing a bit more.
 This is the best brand of protein out there. I tried multiple brand and they had some problem or the other. Either they would have smaller content of protein per serving or would produce gas after intake. So now I always go with Optimum nutrition. You can never go wrong double rich chocolate. however I have tried few other flavors as well.<br/>I usually take a combination of whey and casein. Whey every morning and after work out. Casein at night.
 Taste is surprisingly good when you mix it with whole milk or almond milk, if you're lactose intolerant. Great delivery, no stomach discomfort. Do NOT try mixing it with water. Gagged and heaved.  Taste in milk is 5 star. The high level of sweetness, etc. Gets the 1 star off. There are better and more pure powders out there. They compromise taste, though. This one has hit a really good balance with taste, cost, quality, factored in. The BCAAs in this one are great. Complete Amino Acid Profile right on the package. Noticable increase in recovery with this powder
 I recently started aerobic circuit training, which burns a lot of calories. I needed something that would provide me with great amino acids and protein, fast. Optimum Nutrition is an insanely good product. After working out and drinking my Naturally Flavored Chocolate, I feel amazing. The taste is great. Although at first I noticed the string cocoa flavor, it disappeared after drinking a couple of shakes. I have found that mixing Plain Greek Yogurt and Chia seeds into my (almost) frozen milk, and then adding my ON powder is the absolute, most satisfying way of drinking my protein. Awesome product.
 My first experience with ON's protein was with their Performance Whey line of powders. Those differ from Gold Standard in that they use a blend of isolate, concentrated and hydrolyzed whey protein with additional fillers to make the product somewhat more marketable and a wee-bit lower in price. While this made it a lower-quality and somewhat carb/fat-heavy mix, it tasted *heavenly* both in milk and in water. (It, literally, tasted like a chocolate milkshake in milk and like melted chocolate in water. It gave my usual dessert cravings a run for their money.) Perfect for use in bulking or, depending on the circumstances, cutting.<br/><br/>I "upgraded" to Gold Standard and was slightly disappointed by the taste but am happy with my purchase overall. It mostly uses protein isolate which is absorbed fairly quickly by the body. This alone makes it a fantastic choice for post-workout drinks. It also mixes extremely well in water and milk; I can get a smooth drink by mixing it with a spoon. The taste, however, is a little muted relative to its "entry-level" companion. It tastes pretty good when mixed with milk (though nowhere near as good as how Performance tasted), but tastes pretty terrible in water, which is pretty displeasing.<br/><br/>Give it a try and get the 2-lb version. Either way, you'll make gainz.
 The coffee flavor (not mocha cappucino!) is flat out astonishingly good.<br/><br/>I've tried so many kinds of protein over the past 5 years, and this is the one that I can drink everyday and still look forward to it.  It reminds me of coffee flavored ice cream, something I never would buy to eat.  But as a shake, it's amazing.<br/><br/>It's hard to find too.  Amazon has it, but a lot of other sites don't carry it.<br/><br/>Oh, and Rocky Road is awful.  I read one review praising it, but it has a REALLY harsh salty aftertaste.  1 out of 5 times, this aftertaste will unleash itself on your unwitting tastebuds.  Avoid!
 I love ON's whey protein. It was the first one I ever tried, and even though I've tried others, I always come back to this one. It dissolves wonderfully in a shaker cup, and even if you're just mixing with water, the taste is really good (as far as whey powders go). If you've never had whey before, it's going to seem like an odd taste at first, but believe me, that taste can be horrible in other protein powders. I am a die hard chocolate lover, and since I'm carefully watching my diet, and trying to gain more lean muscle, I'm not supposed to eat candy or chocolate, so this ends up satisfying my that craving for the day (most of the time).
 Gold Standard Whey turned me into a believer. I was once a skeptic on all kinds of supplements, especially because of the price tag. I gave in and decided I would purchase this product, just to see if the hype was real, I was not disappointed. I didn't realize how much of a protein deficit I have been putting my body through until I stated consuming a scoop of this after workouts. My body recovered much faster than ever, and it kept me full for a long time. I now drink at least two scoops a day, along with my normal diet. Taste isn't much of a concern for me because I normally throw it in a smoothie, but the times I have just put it in water, I wasn't disgusted by any means.
 I have consistently used this brand for over 10 years. I have tried a few different flavors but the Chocolate Malt is my favorite hands down. It reminds me of Ovaltine from when I was a kid. This has no chalky flavor or aftertaste. I have even sprinkled it on top of oatmeal and it turned it into a nice chocolatey oatmeal breakfast. I once sprinkled it on ice cream and it was so good. You really can't do that with many other brands because it tastes awful like that. I don't even think it's a protein powder, it more like a chocolate powder to have "chocolate milk"
 Optimum Nutrition is a well known brand, and known to be high-quality. My issue with this product is that it doesn't mix that well, or at least as well as other brands I've tried, and the flavor (this particular one was chocolate) is less dessert chocolate and more oatmeal with a bit of unsweetened chocolate powder. I guess that's how I'd describe it. It's palatable but it's not that pleasurable. Still, if it lives up to the hype, the quality of the protein provided is good enough to warrant its purchase. Just don't expect to have a decadent dessert shake after your workout like some other brands provide.
 Don't listen to the 1 star reviews, it still tastes great. I got the extreme milk chocolate which has always been my favorite, mix it with 8 oz of almond milk and it's awesome. Good macros, works well; just buy it.<br/><br/>If you mix it with water like the rest of the 1 star reviews, of course it's gonna taste horrible. Just use milk or almond milk and you'll be good.
 I've been using this whey protein for a couple of years, and I'm definitely a big fan of the product. This isn't the cheapest protein that you'll be able to find, but it's also not the most expensive. Optimum Nutrition's Gold Standard is solid protein powder for the price that tastes great and mixes well.<br/><br/>Most of the time I have this powder (double rich chocolate) mixed with a spoon in a glass of skim milk. In the past I've tried plenty of protein powders that essentially turn into cement at the bottom of the glass, but I don't have that problem with this product - it dissolves/mixes in well and goes down smooth. Occasionally I get fancy and get out the blender, adding a banana, strawberries, almonds, etc. and this protein works great there too. I've tried plenty of protein powder in the past that leave a nasty aftertaste in your mouth, but this Gold Standard doesn't have this problem and does taste fantastic - I actually look forward to drinking these shakes. Highly recommended!<br/><br/>UPDATE: I tried the "Delicious Strawberry" flavor, and don't like it at all. Unlike the double rich chocolate, it tastes funky and leaves behind a very strong aftertaste. I'm very disappointed in that flavor and would never buy it again.
 All protein powder is a scam. Eat real food and stop wasting your money.
 Just received my order! I order the extreme milk chocolate and I must say the favor is the bomb! And also the product mixes well.
 Bought this through Amazon some couple of weeks back. It's a big tub--bigger than I thought it would be. There's a scooper cup inside the tub but it's buried underneath all the whey. You'll have to use a spoon to dig it out.<br/><br/>Since I have never tried any other brand of whey protein, I can't speak for the quality relative to those other brands but I can say that when I first bought it, I thought it was going to taste like crap. Reading various horror stories of whey protein powders that ranged from tasteless and bland to downright nasty from various health forums scared me a bit but some people claimed that this brand wasn't bad relative to others. So I took a dive in and hoped for the best. I was pleasantly surprised. It wasn't that bad. In fact, it's pretty good for what it is.<br/><br/>I bought the double rich chocolate because I like chocolate and well, this powder comes pretty damn close to eating a Hershey's chocolate bar except in a liquid form.<br/><br/>I do suggest buying a shaker cup as this doesn't mix very well with just a spoon. It'll clump up using a spoon. It's not a bad thing, if you don't mind melted clumps of whey protein. Frankly, I don't care one way or the other but if you're trying to down this in under 10 seconds, you're going to have a bit of difficulty. It's still drinkable, don't get me wrong, and the taste is still the same but if you prefer to chug it like water, shaking it in a shaker cup will make it a lot easier to drink if you're in a hurry.<br/><br/>It does contain sucralose and cocoa powder, so if you're concerned about that, I'd suggesting looking elsewhere but personally, I'm not terribly concerned about that and I don't think you should be too concerned about that either unless you're just one of those health nuts.<br/><br/>All in all, I recommend this brand for its taste to price and value. I think it's worth it.
 HIGHLY RECOMMEND GOLD STANDARD<br/><br/>Excellent protein powder with the best blending of any protein powder we have tried. Great flavor as well.<br/><br/>We had been using Myotein for a long time but decided to try a few others as the Myotein would often upset our stomachs, even after years of drinking it. Myotein blends well and tastes great but Gold Standard blends better and is much easier find online and in stores.<br/><br/>We also tried Syntha-6, which we do not recommend.<br/>1)  It didn't blend well at all.<br/>2) The flavor was terrible and reminded us of the protein powder we would choke down in the late 80s.<br/>3) The mix is 40% carbs! What is the point of a protein powder with that ratio?
 I purchase Double Rich Chocolate (2lb) and Delicious Strawberry (2lb) just to try it out.  I didn't like the taste of Double Rich Chocolate - I barely tolerated drinking it with water. The Delicious Strawberry tasted ok with water.  Both tasted better when I reduce the liquid to 6oz and use unsweetened almond milk.  I don't think that I'll be purchasing either flavor in the future.  Once I finish both containers, I plan on trying the Mocha Cappuccino and Rocky Road  next (based on other reviews). I don't plan on purchasing a 5lb container until I find a flavor that I like.
 I bought this protein powder to simplify my meals. Soylent is all the rage these days, but I'm not interested in the price, the nutrition points, or the idea of walking around with gas all day. Instead, I use a scoop of this, mix it with a glass of whole milk, dump in a multivitamin and 8-9 ice cubes with a little water and pulverize to make a delicious meal-in-a-cup. I drink 2-3 of these a day and supplement with 1-2 meals to meet my specific dietary needs.<br/><br/>So far I've only had the cake batter flavor, but it's delicious. It still tastes like a protein drink (don't kid yourself into thinking you'll end up with a cake batter milkshake from cold stone!), but it's really good. Not so good, however, that I don't want to stop at the end. It fills me up for hours and I have no cravings for junk food whatsoever! It's my favorite to drink at night for this very reason: I'm a night-time snacker and once I've had this I don't want to reach for the cookies, candies, crackers, etc. AT ALL!
 Mixes great, tastes great! This protein is top notch. I've tried muscle pharm combat, gnc pro performance, muscle milk, nitrotech, and Lindbergh protien powders and you can tell the difference in the quality by far. The others gave me bubbleguts while I had no problems digesting ON, even while taking it up to four times a day. I got the strawberry flavor because it was on sale. Wasn't a bad taste but I'll probably get chocolate next time. I bought a 5 lb tub and it was definitely money well spent. I workout 5-6 days a week with a busy family and work schedule and I definitely feel like this supplement is a great addition to staying fit and healthy.
 This is the best value in whey. I've tried about 8 of optimums flavors (everything involving chocolate) And I thought Double Rich chocolate, Chocolate Mint, and Mocha were the three best, probably in that order. Ive also tried EAS, Bodytech, Dymatize Elite, Musclepharm Combat, Muscle Milk, and this seemed to be the best tasting brand. While its more than all of those per 5 lbs, the grams of protein per dollar is still very good compared to a lot of cheaper brands for a better product. I've bought 5 lb of whey every 3-4 weeks for 3 years and this is one of two brands I would still buy (and the only one I'd buy without it being on sale).
 The French Vanilla tastes amazing! It mixed well and from my short experience seemed to work well. The price is very good compared to what you are getting in other Protein Shakes. I will definitely keep buying!!<br/><br/>UPDATE: 9/14/17 - I have now purchased the Mocha Cappuccino. While the taste is still top notch, this flavor seems to not mix as well. No big clumps or anything, just small bits of powder that don't dissolve as well as the French Vanilla did. Still happy with my purchase.
 Great product, especially for the price.  Most flavors are delicious. Wish they'd stop using Sucralose as a sweetener though. Probably will buy unflavoured next time since I typically make my protein shakes with something that adds flavor anyway (coffee, fruit, etc).  Companies need to stop using Sucralose and instead use Monk Fruit.
 Whey Gold Standard protein is probably the best protein powder I have tried. It provides essential proteins, as well as taste really good(I use it with milk, or almond milk, water makes it a little weird) without all the crap. I use this protein with mass gainer and bcaas, and I usually take it before bed. Most certainly recommend this for anyone, especially those trying to gain some muscle. For me, I have been able to gain quite a bit of muscle with this product without putting on fat but this is also because I combined it with good nutrition.
 I use this whey daily. I prefer the double chocolate flavor. I think The 1 gram of sugar gives it just the right amount of sweetness. I add this to my morning smoothies with some almond milk and water and it dissolves fairly well. If you have problems with it not dissolving to your preference, adding it to something with citrus will help.<br/>I buy the 10 pound bag when I can and it's a great value. Though compared to the container, it can be a little difficult to open and close at times.<br/>I guess my only complaint is that it has acesulfame. I'm not sure how necessary it is to the flavor, but it would be nice if they could find something healthier to use. Other than that I think this is a good product.
 The product tastes pretty good, is high in protein ( 2 scoops= 48g), stirs very easily, and is the most popular protein in the world!  If it doesn't taste like a ice cream milkshake it's because it's not an ice cream milkshake. It also has a fourth of the calories of a milkshake so...what did you expect?
 French Vanilla Crème YUMMMMMMMMMMMMMM !<br/><br/>Optimum Nutrition Hit a homerun on this FLAVOR AND PROTEIN!.<br/><br/>Whenever I take this Post workout , I think to myself is protein suppose to taste this GOOD?. If you use Milk and Some fruits I swear its like a milkshake that I would drink all the time ! With Water? Meh wouldn't recommend with water or with any other protein its just Not good !<br/>I haven't tried chocolate but I would recommend getting vanilla as you have more choices of stuff to add to it.<br/><br/>24 GRAMS OF HIGH QUALITY PROTEIN ! Best quality top notch.
 This is the GREATEST protein made. Most protein per scoop, no unhealthy fillers i.e sugar, fat etc. and extremely cheap. This is the best protein you can get. I gained 17 pounds of muscle when on this stuff after I combined it with their Casein Protein at night. Total for me was 150 grams of protein per day, my target weight goal. I also stacked it with Alpha Fuel X. Gained a load of muscle and best of all I get it free haha. I'll put the link below if you want. Message me if you want pics of gains! Gettin' craazy huge :) At 142 now, was at 125 before I started lifting. Should be at my goal soon haha!<br/><br/>Free Trial Of Alpha Fuel X: freealphafuelx . com<br/>You can get the Casein Protein I combine the Whey protein with cheapest on Amazon here:<br/>http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002DYJ0M0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002DYJ0M0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=bestprework06-20
 Not only is this possibly the best whey protein out there, but it is also the best flavor and consistency of the powder. I usually don't mix it with anything; just put the powder in a cup with some creatine and pour it in my mouth, then add the water and swallow it. That way I don't get any stuck to the side of the cup. I've only been working out for about 2 months using this, but damn I feel a difference.
 Absolutely love this product! Ordered both chocolate and vanilla and love them both! No chalky taste whatsoever!! Highly recommend
 This is my first time purchasing protein for myself, being that I am on a diet, and I was not disappointed. I didn't know what flavor to purchase because they all seem so tasty (just by reading the name) so I decided to go with: extreme milk chocolate and my hubby took rocky road. I first tried with half 1% milk and half water and it tasted like cold "hot chocolate," which was not bad at all. I just prefer it warm. Now, I can drink it with water only and I even add oats and its delish! I even took a scoop of my hubby's and its great too! I am able to drink it cold and warm and adding oats makes it a great way breakfast. I am happy with my purchase and have a faster more healthier way of starting my day.<br/>My hubby drinks protein on a regular. He has tasted them all! and for him to say this brand and flavor (rocky road) is good, means  a lot!<br/><br/>Extreme milk chocolate: Great chocolate taste, mixes well with both water and milk (warm or cold), delicious, and filling. **if warming do not make too hot...mine got a little lumpy and when blending it, it turned foamy**<br/><br/>Rocky Road: Light chocolate taste, mixes well with water or milk (warm or cold), tastes great.
 I grew tired of using Wal-Mart stocked whey protein powders because of the high level of cholesterol and fat in each scoop. So, I decided to give Optimum Nutrition a try a couple of months back based on its reviews and its low cholesterol. I have noticed an improved muscle gain with Optimum over the other brands I had tried, though this could be because I used it more frequently throughout the day since I am not concerned about the cholesterol content. Whether or not I plan on working out that day, I will use a scoop in my bran flakes to get me going with most of my nutrients for the day. With half of my recommended daily protein intake for the day in each scoop, it is actually a very cost effective way to maintain a proper protein intake. So, whether you are a body builder or just conscious of proper nutrition, I highly recommend this product because it is one of the healthiest, pure sources of protein available, and it is very reasonably priced.<br/><br/>Thus far, I have purchased the French Vanilla Creme and the Coffee flavors, and I have been very pleased with how much I actually enjoy the flavor of the powder. Let me begin by saying the powder dissolves very easily when mixed with a liquid, so it can be versatile in its use. The French Vanilla Creme is very appealing as a generic flavor that works well with most foods or liquids you would normally add it to. However, the Coffee flavor is more distinct, and does not work with everything the French Vanilla Creme will. I am a coffee lover, so it isn't a problem for me, and I really enjoy the Coffee flavored powder. When ordering it, I had my doubts about its "coffee" flavor, suspecting it may be just a powdery and light flavor. But, because it actually has very finely ground coffee in it, the coffee flavor is really strong! I suggest mixing it with a low-fat milk for something resembling a cappuccino. If you like coffee, get the coffee flavor.
 Extremely disappointed in this product. I used to love it. It used to be my favorite, but now the ingredients have changed and it’s a lot more sweeter, which I absolutely dislike. I will not be purchasing this anymore.
 ON Protein is really good considering the flavor, mixing and micros.<br/><br/>But to be honest you must admit, it is not a great deal when it comes to managing a budget.<br/><br/>You can find other brands that have possibly less appealing micros profile, maybe harder to mix a bit but the price gap will make these differences insignificant.<br/><br/>I still really enjoy it when I have the money to afford it!
 Much better alternatives as this contains a chemical sweetener: acesulfame potassium. I don't know why these companies use this when they could just use stevia. I'd rather have no sweetener at all or just a little good old raw sugar. You can get the real deal from  other places without the bad tasting chemical.
 warning: This product has 30mg cholesterol per scoop. If you use it often, make sure you get your blood checked by a doctor. I take about 3 scoops/day, eat very healthy, yet in 7 months from taking this protein my "bad" cholesterol jumped from 98 to 130 (my diet remained the same). Fish oil pills will help keep that down.<br/><br/>My initial impressions is that the taste (Vanilla Icecream) is acceptable as I've had tastier with other brands. Still acceptable, and within a week I got used to it and it started tasting just fine. I mix it with just a spoon in a mug . . . small chunks float on the top, but good enough and doesn't really bother me.<br/><br/>I find this protein really helps with the recovery period, and it has a great blend of other additives in it.
 I see veryone is scared about the "harmful" metals found in powders. like heck, who wouldn't! But trace metals are found in cocoa powdeds and tap water and i feel fine. This is very high quality protein powder with the least trace metals but now does NOT contain aminogens which is supposed to support protein digestion. It now has other added stuff which I don't kno what the heck is. Don't buy its expensive and change ingredient :(
 This protein powder has been highly recommended by everyone I've talked to, and I picked up a 2-pound package of the vanilla ice cream flavor. It has a VERY chemical aftertaste to it, unfortunately - noticeable on its own, but not when mixed with other things (like stirred into oatmeal or yogurt).  It dissolves well in room-temperature or cold liquids. I had no luck getting it to dissolve in hot liquids - it does NOT double as a powdered coffee creamer, unfortunately. ;)<br/><br/>Next time, I'll buy a smaller package of a 'safe' flavor like chocolate, I think. But I'd love to know what folks think of the more interesting options, like chocolate-coconut, tropical punch, or the caramel toffee fudge.  They certainly sound like they could be fun.<br/><br/>UPDATES:<br/>Note: I mix everything with water or almond milk in a blender bottle - no other add-ins.<br/>* Cake Donut - I don't usually mind the fake flavors, so I took a chance. It isn't a cake donut, that's clear - it's more of a sweet cake batter flavor. There's a bit of a 'fake' aftertaste, probably the sweetener, but overall it's not bad. (It doesn't make me gag like Isopure's Cookies &amp; Cream, at least.)  I'll keep trying it with different add-ins - maybe a scoop of chocolate or pinch of cinnamon will help. Really wish it came in a 1 lb package so I don't have so much of the 'bad' flavors to get through.<br/><br/>* Extreme Milk Chocolate: No. Just no. Weirdly sweet and a funky aftertaste.<br/><br/>* Double-Rich Chocolate: Tastes like chocolate milk. (The nestle/swiss miss kind, not ovaltine.)<br/><br/>* Mint Chocolate: Also no - this one made me queasy. Something about the fakey-mint and fakey-chocolate flavor. If you're hoping for a Thin Mint Cookie or Andes mint, look elsewhere.<br/><br/>* Vanilla (I think it was French vanilla? I dumped it in a Ziploc to free up cabinet space) - Much more of a true, mildly sweet vanilla flavor.<br/><br/>* Banana Cream - If you like banana cream pie, banana runts, etc., this is a good one. if you don't? You won't like this. :) It's sweet fake-banana flavor, not real-fruit-banana flavor.
 One of the higher end protein powders for sure. It's never going to taste incredible, but it's not unbearable like cheap whey. You also get 5g of BCAA which honestly is plenty. And low/no sugar. Worth it.
 Love the Vanilla ice cream flavor. Generally blend it with a frozen banana and almond milk, and it tastes like a milkshake.  I have tried the chocolate too - that was ok but had the weird protein aftertaste. This one tastes like vanilla and nothing else.
 Overall this product is good , It gave me the desired results also ive been using this product since a long time , Sustained and would recommend this for beginners at gym , No side effects but the last experience was not good they have changed the formula and it tastes different and results have dropped!!
 a good protein used by beginners as well as advanced level athletes. If you are trying to maintain lean muscle use platinum hydro whey by ON. Else this is also a decent one in the market.
 After months of trying different protein powders, I have finally found the right balance. Great tasting, thick and filling. This is exactly what I was looking for; a balance between a post-workout pick-me-up and a meal supplement. There are some brands that are thicker and/or sweeter, but they tend to have more carbs than I would normally prefer. The value is incredible and made with top of the line ingredients. I don't think I can go back to other brands. The Double Rich chocolate is my favorite, but I often use Vanilla for green smoothies in the morning.
 The flavor is nothiong spectacular. in fact, with water, it's close to terrible. I think im getting used to it but at the beginning it was very bad. With milk the flavor is OK though. I have only been using it for a couple weeks now (3maybe) and during this time i have gained a lot of mass. I cant  say it is solely becaus eof it but it has helped me maintain a very good macros ratio. My protein intake has gone up. Now i am not losing any weight but it is because im getting a lot more protein and am building more muscle mass than before. The product seems to be very good, but i honestly dont have enough time with it as to give a proper rating about its mass building capabilities. It seems to best protein bang for the buck though. 4 stars because i didnt like the falvor too much. I understand the extreme milk chocolate is better than this (double rich chocolate) but it doesnt come in 10pounds bag.<br/><br/>EDIT. March 25th., 2008.<br/><br/>This is my second review of the product. I gave 4 stars to the previous one. NOw i feel like upgrading to 5 stars. It was the double rich chocolate flavor. I think the product is very good even when i dont have any reference to compare, since i havent tried any other brand. I ordered along with this whey, a syntha-6 and a ON casein protein. They are both supposed to be great products, with syntha6 being considered the best tasting protein power out there. Some say Muscle milk is better, but apparently is a close race.<br/><br/>I felt the need to do another review because of the great taste of the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor and because having taken 10.37pounds of the product i feel i could definitely comment. After being in a very long diet I have lost more than 65pounds in exactly a year. Even on a caloric deficit Ive managed to build a few pounds of lean mass and I must say I am convinced than supplementing with this product has been a key factor in this success. After I started taking it i noticed a difference in the time i needed to recuperate from workouts and aybe it was just timing but I am looking more muscular than ever. Also, the truth is that I wasnt having near close to enoguh protein before i started using this product, so what i mean is that this is just protein, and it will make your life much easier when it comes to proper dieting and having enough protein every day.<br/><br/>If you are concerned about taste, you cant go wrong with the Vanilla Ice cream one. It is so good that after my first cup of milk with 1.5scoops I felt the need to come here and share. With water it is not good, but what is it? Even nesquick taste like crap with water...it is a great product. Remember, have at least one gram per pound of bodyweight...do that and it will be really hard for you to be on calorie surplus, then you'll lose fat.
 I'm finishing up my first 5lb tub. Getting ready to order my next tub. I only take it after I work out, so I'm definitely not hard core with it.<br/><br/>The issue I was hoping it would solve was that as I'm approaching 40, it seemed that my recovery time was getting worse and worse. I especially found that as I lifted legs hard, they would just get more and more sore. Sometimes being sore for 4 days after I'd lift. And I try to lift legs 2x a week which was getting more and more difficult.<br/><br/>Since taking this I've found I am not nearly as sore as I was before. I've also noticed myself going up weight much quicker. I'm also putting on a bit of muscle (which I don't really want although I look better), but I'm willing to deal with it for the improved recovery.<br/><br/>I've always drank 2 16oz glasses of skim milk every day. Now I just take one of those glasses of milk with the Double Rich Chocolate after I work out. I honestly think it tastes better than most chocolate milks. I don't understand how anyone could complain if they mix it with skim milk. However, I've never tried it with just water.<br/><br/>I could not recommend it more if you are like me and maybe not recovering like you did in your 20's and early 30's.
 I drink a protein shake daily with breakfast (these do a great job of keeping my hunger under control until lunch time).<br/><br/>So far I have tried French Vanilla Creme and Extreme Milk Chocolate. They both tasted great, but I prefer the taste of chocolate.<br/><br/>When it comes to stirring these with milk I much prefer to use a blender bottle. Stirring the protein powder with a spoon gets the job done, but there are little clumps left behind.<br/><br/>Overall I am enjoying this protein powder and would recommend it.
 Delicious - I usually take this after a good workout (only one scoop for me) or in the morning if I can't catch a breakfast. If you have a magic bullet or a blender - cut up some banana and a scoop of pb - AMAZING!!! I found that using milk (I prefer skim milk, but any milk will do) and using that to blend it then using water tastes better - I'm not a big fan of using the shakers cause sometimes the powder clumps up - so a blender (if you have time) is the way I would suggest. Doesn't taste chalky or powdery to me but I am a fan of protein bars and shakes -
 I've been using Optimum Nutrition (ON) whey protein for years and I was really excited to find it on Amazon.com &amp; for subscription. I've tried many different types of whey over the years and found nothing even remotely comparable to ON's whey.<br/><br/>Pro's:<br/><br/>Taste - I love almost all of the different flavors I've tried (bunch of different chocolates, vanillas, strawberry, etc) with Extreme Milk Chocolate being my favorite. Whether mixed with milk or water it tastes like you're drinking a milkshake. You have to choke down some of the other proteins but ON is a joy to drink. The only flavor I've tried and didn't like is the Rocky Road but that was still better other brands I've tried.<br/><br/>Mixability - an actual word and not something I just made up. ON mixes flawlessly with milk or water in just a simple shaker bottle. You can use a glass and a spoon but it takes longer and it doesn't mix quite as well as shaker. Some other brands I've used basically require a blender unless you like drinking solid chunks of protein paste.<br/><br/>Nutrition - They can advertise this stuff better than I can but they have a high amount of protein per serving and loads of BCAA. When I researched whey protein supplements I looked at grams of protein per dollar spent and ON topped the list.<br/><br/>Con's:<br/><br/>Price - You get what you pay for and ON is more expensive than some of the other brands. It's well worth the money in my opinion or I wouldn't be writing this review. Also, with Amazon.com's normally low prices and the subscription cutting another 15% off it's hard to even consider price a problem.
 I can never really tell when nutritional supplements actually do anything for me, but my results don't lie I guess. I'm a small guy, 5'11" and 140lbs, and started working out regularly with regular doses of Optimum Nutrion's 100% Whey protein. Maybe it's just because I started working out regularly, but 1 month later and I've gained 12lbs of what I assume is mostly muscle. I don't know how much I can attribute to the protein, but I definitely cannot discount it! I also like how fine the powder is, making it easier to blend.<br/><br/>My only gripe is that this is a little sweet for taste, but still tastes much better than 99% of the things I've tried.
 I have to say that I bought this protein due to so many good reviews on this site and others. I was taking Cytosport Complete Whey when I began reading the reviews. I had not worked out or taken a protein powder in years and was trying to get back into working out. Many people who liked Cytosport also like this protein and some were switching saying that it was more cost effective, etc. It does have a good amount of protein, and it doesn't have some of the cholesterol and other undesirables that Cytosport's Whey has. It is cost-effective and relies more on isolate than concentrate as opposed to Cytosport's whey. I got the vanilla bean when I bought the Cytosport and naturally gravitated toward the vanilla ice cream flavor of this one. I don't really care for chocolate protein shakes. I will say that the Cytosport Whey tastes better especially when mixed with water. This one is hard to handle for me in just water. They both are great when mixed with milk (e.g. skim milk). Having said that, Optimum Nutrition's whey protein is probably the best for you; however, I do not look forward to drinking it the way I did when I was on the Cytosport Complete Whey. I know now that they have another vanilla flavor and maybe I will try that one instead. But that's just my opinion. In most of the reviews I have read, people have really liked the taste. Ultimately its your decision.
 Tastes awesome with milk or water. I love my mocha-cappacino flavor protein. I put in half a scoop more than the actual serving amount due to the fact that the scoop seems small even though thats the serving size, which is great!
 Skeptical about strawberry flavoured stuff. I don't like chocolate and strawberry is my favourite anything flavour. So I purchased the small bag to try and I've got to say it is yummy! Recommend mixing with ice cold water or after a good shake, place it in the freezer for 10 mins. Yummy stuff!
 I got this after I ran out of my elite dymatize just cause I wanted to change flavors and see what ON was all about.<br/>First let me say this review is for the Cake Batter flavor.<br/>I use this as a supplement, not a meal replacement or anything else. Let me say the taste of this is great, my favorite ice cream flavor (from cold stone) is cake batter and this is just the next best thing. Mixed with almond milk or plain Greek yogurt tastes just like cake batter. ON are truly as good as they say on the flavor department.<br/>Will I recommend this flavor? Yes.<br/>Will I purchase it again? YES.<br/>You don't like cake batter, should you purchase this? No, it's not going to be anything special to you if that's not your favorite flavor
 We've tried several brands of protein over the years. Optimum nutrition gold standard double rich chocolate is the best - 80% protein and great taste. We've repurchased 4 times within the last 2 years and will keep repurchasing in the future.
 Great product - can't go wrong with anything in the Optimum Nutrition line.<br/><br/>This is a staple in my fitness regime.<br/><br/> I've tried many flavors, but I'm currently on the Cake Batter flavor. It's a bit sweet on its own, but when I mix it Half and half with Optimum's chocolate Caesin, it tastes like brownie batter. Delicious!
 basic protein, i'm not up on all the latest and greatest on whats supposed to be the best protein, but I like the taste of this and it's a decent price.
 My son is a hockey player and I purchased this for him to use as supplement after practices and games.  Previously, we purchased the EAS powder, but after reading the Consumer Reports article decided that it would be better to find a brand that had less issues with dangerous impurities.  The Optimum brand items reviewed in Consumer Reports passed.  He mixes it in milk and it tastes fine, not great.  It would be nice if it disolved easier, but it is no worse than the EAS powder.  My daughter (a soccer player) makes fruit smoothies and adds the powder.  Really can't say if it helps or not, but we are happy with it.  As a parent, I like it for my kids as a snack replacement after exercising, but not as a meal replacement.
 Awesome protein powder! Excellent taste and not grainy at all. This is the best protein powder I have tried. The flavor is great! It taste just like hot chocolate. Will definitely be buying again and trying other flavors!
 I picked this flavor because I love chocolate and thought I'd try a "spin" with the Rocky Road.  Yuk!  I didn't find anywhere that sold a smaller trial size.  Probably because ON wants to stick it to you and get at least $60 a pop.  It would really help if there were ratings in order of best to worst flavors.  But, then again I looked at bodybuilding.com and everyone has different opinions.  There's just so many reviews about this product that it's tough to figure out which flavor to get.  This is gonna suck to have to swallow 5 lbs. of this s---.  I also read that some people get gas from this.  (Yes, after the fact I found out this is true.) I previously had EAS Lean which was a great chocolate flavor but decided to get ON due to the amount of protein.  (That's why 2 stars vs. one.)  I tried what a couple of guys mentioned in reviews:  1) use 2 scoops vs. 1 in order to get the most flavor.  UPDATE - this doesn't work. 2) after shaking the mix with milk, let it sit a few minutes to let the "bubbles" settle down in order to relieve gas.  UPDATE - this doesn't work, either.
 The only other whey protein powder I'd tried in the past was EAS Myoplex, specifically a flavor they tried to make palatable by calling it Cookies and Cream.  Imagine gagging down a tumbler of pus from a large abscess.<br/><br/>What a relief to find Optimum Nutrition's 100% Whey Gold Standard.  I got a couple 5 lb containers each of the French Vanilla Cream and the Extreme Milk Chocolate.  I mix either with non-fat milk, a heaping tbsp of PB2 powdered peanut butter and some whole ground flax seed meal, and the result is killer.  Awesome for breakfast, before a workout and after.<br/><br/>I'm sold on this stuff.
 Despite what anyone else says, this is the best and most consistent Whey Protein powder on the market...i've had a lot of bad ones. It tastes awesome, no artificial-tastes...haven't tried all of the flavors, I always alternate b/w the vanilla and either of the chocolate flavors- they are spot on delicious.<br/><br/>A quick word about mixing/preparing these- Some reviewers make this so much more complicated than it has to be...it's this simple: Buy 1 or 2 Nalgene wide-mouthed bottles to use for this (and the inserts that make sipping/drinking easier if you like, I don't use tho). Put a scoop or 2 of powder, a big handful of ice, and as much water as u see fit. Shake like hell, drink. The ice serves to keep ur shake cool in the warmer months, and does away with the need to have an expensive "shaker bottle". Shake before each drink...stays delicious to the finish.<br/><br/>I tend to mix almost 2 scoops, and drink 1/2 before my workout and the rest on the way home. Use Optimum Nutrition's Natural Casesin for your b/w meals, slow release protein needs...this will keep you from being ravenous throughout the day, especially the day after a really hard workout. On weekends or non-workout days, i tend to mix both products for a one-two punch.<br/><br/>Make sure to consume some protein and carbs 30 min before your workout, but most importantly make sure to get some protein in your system less than 40 min after your workout...this has been studied and proven. If you don't do this, your body starts eating muscle and your gains go out the window.<br/><br/>Cheers, and happy muscle gains!
 Always liked ON products.Little expensive but quality products.Tastes good, long self live. Packaging could be better.
 I went through at least 4 large containers of Turbo Chocolate Platinum Hydrowhey when I realized that the cost is getting too high.  Tried the Gold Standard and almost done with this container.  First thing I noticed is the taste of course.  Double Rich Chocolate is wayyy worse than the Chocolate Platinum.  I suspect ON did this on purpose to make me spend that extra buck if I want the good stuff!  So to finish this container off I resorted to mixing it with flavored creatine, blending it with peanut butter and bananas... anything is better than drinking this by itself.<br/>Does it work better or the same as Platinum?  Couldn't really say.. Yes, I feel like I recover faster than if I were taking nothing at all.  Mixes almost as easily.  Can't really say that this is worse than platinum (except for the taste).  I may actually get another container of Gold Standard because I'm starting to blend my own weight gainer shakes anyway.  Tip: Don't drink store weightgainers.  Blend your own with protein powder, creatine, banana, peanut butter, and slow cooked oatmeal.
 Bought the 'Double Rich Chocolate' variety and use it to make protein pancakes, smoothies, or just mix it with water in a shaker bottle. Delicious in all its forms, when mixed with water, tastes like dessert. Great post workout or in a smoothie to replace a meal.
 The powder doesn't mix well with whole milk. It clumps up and sticks to the side of shaker. The flavor is ok and I prefer flavor of Muscle Milk.
 I bought this product because there were so many reviews that said it tasted great.  It doesn't.  It reminds me of watered down Ensure.  I can't speak to it's helpfulness in losing weight or helping with recovering from workouts, but I can tell you, if you are looking for something that is a joy to drink, this isn't it.  If you have no problem choking something down, just for it's benefits, well, then, you may be able to stand it.
 Best tasting protein powder I've ever had! Tastes delicious and has very little sugar. The double chocolate flavor doesn't contain sucralose or any weird ingredients unlike some of the other flavors.
 I have consistenly been working out for the last three years and have tried just about every store bought whey protein, mass gainer, creatine and other suppliments out there. I've used this for the last 4 months and I think I found my new favorite suppliment. I use alittle more than the average serving, but mix it in 24ounces of milk with a bananna and a few other vitamins. I haven't changed up my workout schedule, but I notice a considerable gain......and its not just waterweight like creatine or other suppliments I have used. HIHGLY Recommend
 I’m in love with this protein powder. The mocha cappuccino is so flavorful. I can mix it alone, with almond milk and ice, or blend it with spinach, almond milk and ice to make a frozen shake and it’s awesome every time. The shakes fill me up and don’t leave me craving snacks in between meals.
 Works great and is delicious. I understand people are mad about any change in the formula- but that doesn't change this being the best. I've never been able to weigh more than 95 lbs but my body building older brother recommended this and I have lean muscle and a healthy body weight now. No bloating or nausea that other supplements gave me and I cannot say enough how my having muscle is a miracle.
 Just started this brand and was very impressed at how fine the powder mixes with water.  Taste is good.  I miscalculated...I think I could get 2 scoops in a cup which means I should be able to get 4 scoops in a day which means 96g of extra protein in a day.<br/><br/>Very impressed so far.  I only need a hint of flavor as I don't like milk.
 I have tried a few different protein powders over the years. I've always liked Gold Standard. I'm sure that if you're looking at this item, you've already heard that it is a great choice. However, this flavor is just awful. When I purchased this, I would have appreciated someone saying telling me. I had an extremely difficult time getting this down because the flavor really was so bad. It isn't quite so bad in almond milk, but in anything else the flavor really stands out. I can't wait to finish it and get something different.
 I'm normally a chocolate person.  I was trying different products and came across this. I ended up getting chocolate milkshake from Syntha 6 and the French vanilla creme from optimum nutrition. Needless to say, I actually enjoyed this product more than the syntha 6. I know you're not supposed to compare these two products because they're different types of protein but I'm just comparing it by the taste.<br/>The French vanilla creme tastes good with vanilla almond milk, half a banana, and strawberries. Doesn't upset my stomach at all. I have been using this for 6 weeks now. I take it right after my work out and I've noticed a big difference in my appearance. For a very skinny and petite girl, I've been gaining muscle from consistently keeping up with my protein intake and weight training for 1-1.5 hrs (with 20-30 min of cardio) almost everyday.<br/>Within 2-4 weeks, you will start to see results. I've recovered much quicker and I feel great to lift again the next day.<br/>In conclusion, French vanilla creme tastes amazing. Leaves no after taste. This whey protein works. You will see results if you workout and take this right after. Wish I could post pictures to prove it.
 I usually really hate protein shakes, so my goal in trying a bunch of samples was to find one I could drink without visibly grimacing. I haven't tried most of their lineup yet, but I just tried the Chocolate Mint, and it's magic. Not only did I not hate it, I really like it! I'm annoyed there was only one in the sample pack! So if you're like me and you're tired of seeing "tastes just like chocolate milk" reviews only to end up with something that tastes like gritty chalk, try this. It really does live up to all the claims the cheap stuff makes.
 Yes! I like the French Vanilla flavor, it's the best!<br/>I used to buy this protein powder regularly, and I believe it has effect on my body-building. I would definitely recommend this product to my friends who also want to keep fit and stay strong!
 I bought the Mocha Cappuccino, and I gotta say it's amazing. Got it cheaper than other flavors and tastes so good. Post workout I put two scoops with a spoon of cinnamon and it takes the cake! Great product, Great taste.
 A lot of people advised against buying this brand because they said it tastes like mud and I fit into that category where I thought I didn't care what my protein shake taste like as long as it worked. And than I tried it and I was like wow, this stuff really does taste like someone put an old sneaker into a blender and had you drink it. It is just vile. I was using muscle gauge, which I really liked. It was lightly sweetened and overall had a very watery taste which was much more preferable to this ON stuff. That was, until Muscle Gauge rearranged their formula, replaced the Stevia with Sucrose and charged 10 bucks more. So I decided to go with something else this time around. After a week of use I feel a lot more effective in the gym and it has definitely helped me go beyond my peak, but it still hasn't become any easier to drink. It is extremely bitter and has a very metallic aftertaste. I dont know what else to say but I think for 40 bucks you can do much better.
 I ordered Gold Standard as many online forums name it one of the best quality and best testing protein powders.<br/><br/>I'm sitting here with a shaker bottle trying to choke down one serving. It's horrid with simply water and difficult at best to drink even when using other mixers like coffee &amp; cream to try and mask the taste. The chemical taste is inescapable even in comparison to dirt cheap protein powders.
 ON has the best protein/calorie/taste balance. Even my wife likes this stuff and that’s saying something. We’ve tried probably 7 other Pretoria brands and always come back to ON.
 I purchased the Rocky Road flavor of whey protein because I had read it was absolutely delicious. That was not the case...at first. Upon opening it, it had a scent I was not used to. One of my friends compared the smell to that of Smores. I tried it in 8 oz. of milk (as I do with all the other flavors of Optimum Nutrition) and it did not blow my socks off. However, the taste did grow on me and now I can't get enough of it!<br/><br/>As far as efficiency of the product goes, I don't really notice a difference. I use it as a protein supplement along with chicken breasts at meal times, not as a recovery drink (I use Endurox R4 for that). I do, however, drink it 40 minutes after I drink my Endurox post-workout.<br/><br/>4/5 because I had to get accustomed to the taste.<br/><br/>*Side-note, it tastes pretty good in 6-8 oz. of water
 The cake batter flavor has a funky, rotten smell when mixed with water.  I've tried switching bottles, but even with a new bottle, the gross rotten smell persists. It's really hard to drink when you're stuck smelling the rotten smell the whole time
 This isn't a review for the Coffee flavoured protein powder (though I'd really LOVE to try it sometime!) but I'm too excited to put this anywhere else right now lolz.I received my On OP Chocolate Mint Whey Protein powder and it's my favourite flavour so far! I've been using the Gold Standard On Protein products on and off for years and they've ALWAYS tasted amazing. I want to have a range of flavours at my disposal (of course, will need to taste some first before committing).I just recently started a workout regimen once again, this time seriously, and I've come back to On. I've amassed my first stack - Opti-Men multivitamin, OP Chocolate mint and Double Rich Chocolate Whey Protein powders, and French Vanilla Casein. Very proud of it, too! I mix my shakes with water instead of milk because I certainly don't need the extra calories; trying to lose fat as well as build muscle. The On products are a safe, delicious, not to mention effective, way to go. No need to look elsewhere! :)
 I needed protein that was a good value and wanted to try something different than muscle milk or any of the other countless brands I have tried in the past. This fits the bill well.  I take two scoops to get 48 grams of protein...I am a big guy at 6'2 and 250lbs....so 24 grams at one sitting is not going to cut it for me. I love the fact that it mixes very easily with a spoon or fork. The taste is neither good nor bad when mixed with water. Muscle milk tastes much MUCH better...but also has double the calories. This is perfect for what I need.
 ON/OPTIMUM has done it again. They have managed to keep producing an outstanding Whey Protein. If you think it couldn't get any better then get your hands on some of their new stock (just look for the new label). I found that the whey grains are finer, its mixes better and it tastes even better. Plus they decided to give samples sachets of their new release products, like Vassive in some containers.<br/><br/>The new look label is very neo. I really like how it looks. They have really boosted the whole deal considerably.<br/><br/>Switch any bodybuilder's Whey Protein drink with some Optimum 100% Whey Protein and watch as he wants to put a barbell through your head for giving him a McDonald's shake. Once you have convinced him that it is indeed a Whey Protein supplement he will want to see the list of ingredients with the important protein to carbohydrates to fat ratios that will prove its fatty content... only to discover that Optimum 100% Whey Protein just beats all other Whey Protein into submission with its astonishing lack of fats and higher protein content. So automatically the bodybuilder assumes that the stuff is probably twice the price of other Whey Protein supplements with half the amount until you whip out the bottle that is twice the size of other Whey Protein supplements for the same price.<br/><br/>The end result is simply - every single bodybuilder is switching to Optimum 100% Whey Protein. The only downside is finding out that it is not available and having to pay up for a Whey Protein supplement that gives you less and does not taste as good. Once you are supplementing with Optimum 100% Whey Protein it is difficult to swallow another brand. This stuff has revolutionized bodybuilding supplementation.<br/><br/>Calories 130<br/>Calories From Fat 15<br/>Total Fat 1.5g 2%*<br/>Saturated Fat 1g 5%*<br/>Cholesterol 30mg 10%*<br/>Sodium 60mg 3%*<br/>Total Carbohydrate 4g 1%*<br/>Sugars 1g<br/>Protein 24g 48%*<br/><br/>As an added note: I have tried a few flavors, and while I expected Chocolate to be the best I found that the new Banana flavor is really good and it has my vote. I recommend trying it out.
 This is the best tasting and most affordable whey protein product I've found. I don't really care about the bodybuilding thing any longer, but I like to supplement my protein intake and this is a nice sort of energy shot in the morning. On days when I can't make time for breakfast, this keeps me from getting light headed without stuffing myself with empty calories.<br/><br/>It is artificially sweetened, but not over-the-top. Likely just enough to overcome the bitterness of the cocoa.<br/><br/>I generally put a scoop in with cold coffee from the fridge and a splash of soy milk. If I do an intense weight session, I'll have another scoop either in almond milk or in the coffee concoction again.<br/><br/>Note: I am mildly lactose intolerant and this stuff doesn't bother me at all.
 This is my second shipment of ON Whey protein. It is the best bang for the buck. I did my research and ON met my needs the best, at the lowest price as well. It mixes easily, but on occasion does clump up. I usually make some smoothies with it, or take it mix with 2% milk or some soy milk. I wouldnt recommend it with pure water, tried it once and could hardly stomach it. Tasted too too horrible with pure water. This of course is my personal taste, so stick with milk or smoothies. Overall great product, great tasting and cheap as well.
 I've been using ON Whey exclusively for a number of years.  I absolutely love this stuff and drink a scoop or 2 after every lifting session. As for flavors, Rocky Road is by far my favorite. I can add plenty of water for a bigger drink without worrying about it tasting awful. I tried strawberry, but it tastes too much like pepto for me - and double rich chocolate needs to have the right mixture of powder to water or else it tastes nasty. My buddy has even recently switched from his protein to ON due to better price and positive reviews all over the net and at our local supplement store.<br/><br/>This protein tastes good and is very filling. It is smooth, no chalky feeling of after-taste like some other brands. It also mixes very well with water. I used to mix vanilla with orange juice and that worked well too. Mixing with milk produces a very thick drink though, and hard to stomach after lifting (personally).
 IMHO the best whey power protein out there. It mixes very well and the taste is excellent especially the rich double chocolate. For one scoop it packs a lot of protein compared to other brands. I've seen good results taking these for years.
 I got this as a sample from an Amazon sample box and I really liked it. Easy to mix, great flavor, and good protein to carb ratio. Low calorie, too! Perfect for my needs.
 Have used this brand of protein for over 5 years. No other proteins mix as well and as easily as this one does. I also like the fact that it is not as sweet as other proteins. There is a reason this protein is highly ranked in different fitness blogs and websites.
 I have been using ON protein for years now. If you are on a budget this is about the best tasting and protein per dollar brand you can get. It has been slowly going up in price and I was truly disappointed to see Amazon get rid of subscribe and save on this but its still a great price. It mixes well and is very light unlike other powders that can be thick and heavy. My favorite flavor is the Coffee. I also love the chocolate coconut and chocolate mint is great as well. Also you can never go wrong with the regular chocolate if you are unsure about the funky flavors.
 I have been using this the ON Gold Standard Whey protein for a few years now.  It's the best tasting one I've used.  I have tried the double chocolate, Cappuccino, Mint Chocolate and now the Coffee flavors.  I like them all, and until I got the Coffee flavor, chocolate mint had been my favorite.  The Coffee flavor is the best one I've had so far.  Its really really good.  Taste like coffee ice cream.  Very smooth and creamy.  I highly recommend the mint chocolate and coffee flavors.
 I am a vegetarian and it is hard for me to make 200g of protein as a full time graduate student and intern. I've been using protein shakes for almost a year and literally dreaded it. I couldn't even drink as much as I should, thus no serious gains. I literally downed those Pure Protein and Cytosport powders like gross cough syrup.<br/><br/>This powder is different. I am already incredibly satisfied with the nutrition label and how much less ingredients it has than the other ones I've used (text is so small I'm not even completely sure of what I'm taking). Not only that... I absolutely enjoy drinking this shake. It tastes like Nesquik chocolate milk or some really nice quality chocolate milk with a bit of a minty undertone. I can drink two of these a day.
 this is the best tasting easy mixing whey protein for me, it is easy mixing with no blender required and also it does not feel overly sugared so that is a bonus.  its quite light to drink so it will not fill you up so you can basically have it with another food source without feeling bloated.  its ideal as quick protein ix but not designed to fill you up as a MRP<br/><br/>the benefits are that you dont get the excess sugars and cards so this can work well for lean muscle
 Good flavor (not overly sweet if that's what you're looking for) and great macros for my way of eating (lower carb, higher protein and fat).
 This is the second 5 lb tub of protein powder I have purchased from Optimum Nutrition. I also purchased the Natural Whey they offer. They both taste really good, but I would say that the Natural version tastes a bit better. The Natural also seems to dissolve more quickly in liquids, which results in fewer powder chunks if you are mixing with a shaker bottle. Both versions are absorbed quickly and cause me no digestive problems. I really like both, but if I buy another tub, it will be the Natural Whey.
 Buy the cheapest flavor, they taste great, are widely regarded and do the job
 This protein mix was recommended to me by two male nurses in the Navy Nurse Corps while deployed in Afghanistan. I maintain a fairly healthy diet (not a crazy strict diet but probably healthier than the average soldier), and work out regularly (boxing and running). After two weeks I definitely appear leaner than before. I'm a 26 year old male, whose never taken any supplements before. The stuff tastes good too. I have the vanilla flavor. I mix it with water, soy milk from the DFAC, or Strawberry milk from the DFAC. I also mix it with pudding, I've even put some in black coffee. As for people saying "it mixes really well" who gives a s***? I just want high quality protein that I can't get in a regular diet because I'm deployed in Afghanistan. But I think i'll stick with it after deployment as well. It seems to have made a difference in only two weeks. I have the Whey, and I also have the Casein which I drink about an hour before I go to bed. These two mixes, combined with a healthy diet with plenty of fruits and veggies and all that good stuff- you can't lose. I'm a Hospital Corpsman in the United States Navy and I'll recommend this product to any service member who might ask me.
 Don't know about the other flavors, but the Double Rich Chocolate tastes pretty good. With milk that is. I have tried it with water, and it's drinkable, but not at all pleasant. As for using a spoon to mix it, you'll find it requires quite a bit of stirring and you'd still be left with small chunks of powder that couldn't dissolve. A shaker is therefore essential, and I think it's more practical than an electric mixer, unless you're mixing in chunks of fruit.<br/><br/>Lastly, there's a plastic scoop in there! Mine came with the scoop buried inside the powder and I had to dig in to get it. I didn't know about it until a friend told me, so just wanted to share this info if you ever receive yours with no visible scoop inside.
 There are three important things to me when it comes to which whey protein to buy: Nutritional Value, Taste, and Cost. And in all three of those areas Optimum Nutrition has hit a home run.  They managed to pack 24g of Protein into only 120 Calories with only 3g of Carbohydrates and 1g of Sugar. And at less than $45 on Amazon for 74 servings I couldn't ask for much more. Oh, and by the way, it tastes great.  I happen to prefer the double rich chocolate flavor myself, but either way you go, you won't be unhappy.
 Great product! I used to take <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Whey-Protein/dp/B074SBSRJH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Whey Protein</a> by MIT NUTRA but this one seems to be working really well!
 This showed up on time and this waaay cheaper here then it is on Optimum Nutrition's site. This kind doesn't make my stomach hurt like other protein powders. Also it tastes &amp; mixes better too, it doesn't get in nasty clumpy chunks in the shaker cup. I'm not in love with the price, but i really don't know where you would get this any cheaper.<br/><br/>I got this in january 2013, maybe because it was dead in the winter I got the ten pound bag for about $80. Now that it is about $104 I would look around a little more before buying it.
 Although I was initially taken aback from the price, I would strongly recommend this protein powder. The powder easily dissolves in water and it is not at all grainy. The flavor is really good, but it does leave a slightly unpleasant after taste (a theme that is not isolated with just this protein powder),  Overall, very satisfied.
 OK, so this review will cover the taste and smell because I just started taking it but I will upload a result review along with exactly the list of other products I'm using...<br/><br/>The smell when you open this is like you just opened the front doors to the willy wonka chocolate fountain room! Your mouth instantly starts to water! And the taste is just as amazing... feels almost sinful if your on a great diet. I drink this every morning before my morning jog and as my 1st meal replacement. I put in my <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Black-28-Oz-Blender-Bottle-W-wire-Shaker-Ball/dp/B001C3CG4M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Black 28 Oz. Blender Bottle W/wire Shaker Ball</a> with a raw egg,2 1/2 teaspoons of peanut butter, about 1/2oz vanilla bean soy milk, and also a teaspoon of <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Optimum-Nutrition-Creatine-Powder-600g/dp/B002DYIZEO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Optimum Nutrition Creatine Powder, 600g</a> and 6-8 oz of water. I think the taste is delicious and I am ready for it every morning! Now again I will post up a results review after faithful routine usage.
 Decent taste for the calories. Just not a fan of the foam when shaking. Only bought bc it was on a sale.
 I been moving up in weight like crazy ever since using this stuff. Only thing is do not get vanilla ice cream. Its pretty bad. I heard banana strawberry was good, that's my next pick. Also you want to mix this with milk not water, preferably low fat skim milk if your serious about burning fat and gaining muscle. Before I started using this I was'nt overweight at all but I did have a little beer gut coming on, I sometimes replace this with a meal, for instance usually my breakfast is 2 scoops of this. I lost a few pounds but mostly just turned fat into muscle. Best protein IMO.
 Word of warning if you plan on taking more than 2 servings a day. This stuff has a lot of cholesterol in it. It was enough to elevate my cholesterol from 185 mg/dl to 213 mg/dl and my LDLs from 111 mg/dl to138 mg/dl to with no other significant diet changes. I will be switching to the Whey Isolate as it has dramatically less cholesterol in it.
 I did have an allergic reaction to something in there. Really got worried as my throat got really swollen and I wasn't able to breathe properly for a few hours. Tried to return it but didn't get a response. So I would give 0 starts if I could.
 I was planning on buying this product but after reading some of these recent reviews, I do realize that the new formula looks really bad. Thank you all those who wrote the recent reviews; you guys saved me 50 bucks.
 i was taking the one from walmart but then i read up on this one and it comes out a little more expensive then walmarts but the taste is really good i tried double chocolate and vanilla ice cream i was taking it with water but now i take it with one banana, ice, soy milk and a little creatine and wow its really good. Any way i  am 35 years old i am 5'8 200 pounds i been working out exactly 3 months to this day  and been taking this protein for like 2 full months i am on my third 5 pounder. so one 5 pound last me a month. when i started lifting i was only benching the bar and a 25 on each side and today 8/01/2011 i maxed at 250 : ) yey. i been working hard for it and give credit to this protein. i take it with creating from same company.
 About a month ago I was hanging out with a group of friends and they were talking about weight and such. I have a pretty high metabolism and it is really hard for me to gain weight. For the past 5 years I have faithfully worked out and have gotten myself very toned but because of my excessive workouts I can't gain that much weight. Several friends said that I should drink protein shakes to help gain weight and increase muscle. So I searched the internet and found this Whey Protein. I purchased it and within 2-3 weeks I already felt a difference in my energy, my muscles and my work outs.<br/><br/>I purchased the double rich chocolate and I mix it with milk. Also I sometimes put hershey chocolate syrup in it for extra carbs because weight gain is a big factor for me. I think it tastes great. Great product overall. I plan to buy again.<br/><br/>Added: If you want a really nice chocolate taste I suggest mixing this with half milk and half yoohoo. It sounds crazy but it is incredibly tasty.
 LIARS- NO LISTED INGREDIENTS? WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO HIDE? NO CHEMICALS LIKE SUCRALOSE? ACESULFAME? THERE WAS NO INGREDIENT LIST AT THE TOP OF THE PAGE GENIUS.
 I have been taking this protein for over a month now. I really like it over other brands that I have tried. As far a muscle gain and retention go, I think it is on par with any other protein. The flavor is pretty good too. Its not exactly strawberry banana but it tastes good. But lets remember that we don't take this stuff for the flavor. Where this protein really stands out is how well it mixes and digests.<br/>It mixes really well with either water or milk in a blender cup, digests really easy, and does not give me gas like other people say other brands of protein gives them.
 Compared to cyosport, that muscle milk brand. I don't get why people like this one so much...
 Tastes good but im ditching the artificial sweetners. Mike as well drink diet coke.  Im switching to met rx natural with only fructose. Its a start and product gets good reviews.
 First time ever using this product but I have seen amazing results from switching to this protein versus my last kind, I will most definitely be buying more of this
 Taste was good
 The Milk Chocolate isnt that bad at all.  It has a creamer in it that makes it very smooth and milkshake like.  I only tried it with skim milk and a little water or almond milk and a little water.  either way it tastes really good.<br/><br/>I tried the cookies and cream and i like that much better but who doesn't like cookies and cream.<br/><br/>Next i want to try the toffee one but that usually is the most expensive of the bunch
 Optimum Nutrition is a name you can trust.  After intense weight training in any of the disciplines: bodybuilding, Olympic Lifting or powerlifting, you HAVE TO repair and recuperate and ON's 100% Whey is a lifter's necessity especially for post workout replenishment.  This was the best price out there on that particular day given all considerations: cost and shipping and handling.  I go through this stuff like kids go through Oreo's and milk!
 Pros:<br/>Tastes ok, not the best, but not the worst either.<br/>For the most part, gets the job done.<br/>Value - you're getting a good price for the amount you're getting<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Not the highest of quality of Protein (not from organic source)<br/>Contains Acesulfame Potassium, a sweetner that's suggested to be avoided<br/>Contains Artificial Flavoring.<br/><br/>Yes, this stuff may work for you considering you don't have any side effects from consuming it. Any side effects will hinder your progress. However, there are many commercial proteins out there that do the same job, many of which taste better, although may not be as cost efficient. The down fall with this product like many others is that the main source of protein is of 'low grade' and not premium or ultra high or whatever the labels states.  Unless it's from an grass fed cow and all that other good stuff - more than like the whey extract is of poor value.  in addition, Acesulfame Potassium is an artificial sweetner,linked to many side effects like other artificial sweetners. Rule of thumb on Artficial sweetners is that, if it aint natural, it probably shouldn't be consumed. which leads to the artficial flavoring aspect of this product.  AF may be made up of up to 4 dozen ingredients, chemicals made to make your taste buds dance.<br/><br/>Like I said, this stuff will get the job done and it's cheap for the amount you get. But more than likely will cause underlying problems. not really worth it if you ask me.
 Delivery a little slow so don't wait till last min to order but the taste is off the charts great bang for the buck and at the price per serving it's around 81 cents well worth every penny and not loaded with a bunch of fillers like other brands with this you get what you pay for and that's top notch whey isolate protein.
 I thought any flavor of whey could taste barely tolerable at best (Optimum's Chocolate was the least unpleasant, but still). Well, I just received Optimum's Coffee flavor, and it is killer! Even with water, it's so good, I actually feel like having another for no protein-related reason. It was a bit more expensive than the more available flavors of the same brand, but to me the difference is well worth the extra few bucks.<br/><br/>For the record, I purchased the flavor listed as "Coffee", and the bottle I received says "Coffee - Limited Edition Flavor" on the label, while the product image on the Coffee listing reads "Mocha Cappuccino". There's also another flavor listed as "Mocha Cappuccino", with the same product image. They might be different products, though the one I have tastes just like those Starbucks Mocha Cappuccino bottles, so one of them is probably a newer bottle label.
 Not easily dissolved in water. Diluted it in water, drink it, there will be powder left on the wall of cup. If the leftover powder is let to dry, it will be hard to get rid of without excessive labor.
 Out of the,protein powders I've tried I like this one the best tastes good blends well and has a lot of protein which keeps me full right now I have the chocolate flavor which I like,but want to t Rd you the rocky road which I hear,is the best flavor
 Solid flavor, good profile, and affordable. Not much to not like about ON Good Standard really. The flavor is tolerable and does not get old. It doesn't have much fillers and it's a great price. This is a lot of people's go to protein and it is easy to see why really. I will be ordering some more asap actually.
 Love it
 Use it every time after my workout.  This is by far the best wheat protein on the market.  The powder is easy to mix and tastes good.
 I tried this and it just tastes no different than chocolate milk and drinking it didn't get me an ounce of muscle. I'm better off eating beef jerky and steak. Milk isn't really good for the body anyway.
 tastes good
 This protein powder is actually great! I was a little skeptical because it has been so chemically altered, but I have not noticed any bad side-effects from it. A few precautions though:<br/><br/>Your liver is stressed out by high protein intake since it has to break it down and send it to your muscles. Drinking 10 glasses of water a day will help keep your kidneys happy and balanced. Eating something like oatmeal will ensure that your GI tract gets scrubbed clean with fiber, since high-protein diets tend to lack significant amounts of fiber. If you use plain oatmeal and add raisins and honey, instead of buying pre-packaged stuff with tons of added sugar, this shouldn't be a big deal for your diet plan.<br/><br/>With that in mind, protein intake is key to any plan to build muscle. In fact, working out without consuming lots of protein immediately before or afterwards is almost a lot cause, since you are breaking your muscles down without rebuilding them. At $20 for five pounds, this stuff gives you all the protein (24 grams a serving!) you need for your money.<br/><br/>p.s. the taste of the double rich chocolate is totally good, even when mixed with just water. It's not the greatest taste ever, but it just tastes like water-down chocolate milk, nothing too bad.
 I often start feeling depleted in the middle of the afternoon, probably because blood sugar levels are dropping. Rather than spiking those levels with sugary drinks, or eating fat- and carb-laden snacks, I've been mixing a cup of the French vanilla flavor with skim milk. This typically results in higher energy levels within 30 minutes and carries me until dinner.<br/><br/>This is also very good as a remedy for diabetics who may start experiencing hypoglycemia from medication. While orange juice is the standard remedy, this works about as well with longer-lasting effects.
 I'm not going into the depths and complexity of health and nutrition (because to be honest, I have no idea about any of it), but for a teenage guy who lifts weights every other day, I can vouch to say that Optimum nutrition has helped me reach goals faster.<br/><br/>I would also like to say that Optimum Nutrition 100% Gold standard, Extreme Milk Chocolate is the best tasting protein that I have ever had!<br/><br/>Cheap, tasty and effective! What more could you ask for? Don't hesitate. BUY NOW!
 Taste okay plus its my favorite flavor 'french vanilla'.
 I love this flavor!  I mix this with my Creatine powder, water, and a 0 calorie packet of lemonade (Crystal Light or store brand) and it tastes amazing!  There are no chunks in the shaker bottle and it dissolves really well (into water, anyway - I'm not sure about anything else).
 Thank you
 Needed to restock on my protein. Came across this item that was on sale. So I decided to purchase it. Good rich flavor.
 Taste is great for this protein shake.  I drink it after each workout and it really helps me recover from my workouts.  I recommended this to multiple people.  i even had them so a taste test and they also loved it!
 I remember the days when the only way you could mix a protein powder was with an electric blender. This mixes easily in my shaker bottle and tastes pretty good too. I spoon in some creatine powder with it a few times a day and I'm ready to go. Buying the 10 lb bag makes it a great value too. Don't let the fools at GNC trick you into thinking their gold card is a better deal than this!
 Won't really find a better price for the quality of product ON provides. Chocolate tastes great, haven't really tried any other flavor. Great macros. If you want gains, buy this.
 I use this as my main source of protein in my "soylent" diet.  I work out regularly and have gained muscle mass since switching from my "normal food" diet to soylent.  It mixes perfectly in my Ninja blender and tastes great(vanilla ice cream flavor)<br/><br/>link to the recipe I use:   ...]
 if you love chocolate, go for it
 I like the ON proteins.  Easy to blend, good tasting.<br/><br/>I will admit I like the 100% whey isolate better than this mixture.  but it has not stopped me from using it daily.
 Having tried numerous products, we find this brand offers two important advantages over others. It mixes well- spoon and water, leaving almost no traces of the powder in the cup.  Taste- very good chocolate taste.  I mix it with water and find it enjoyable.  Wife uses yogurt and fruits then blends it for (what I feel is a week) for about 30 seconds.  She refuses to try any other brand.
 Love this protein powder. The taste is great, I mix it with milk in the morning. Low calories and low sugar.
 Legit Product, Cheaper than other retailers even with coupons.
 This is the best tasting and most versatile protein powder on the market. I've tried Muscle Milk and a few others and this by far has the best flavor hands down. The quality you get from this product is well worth the cost. I'm a lifetime customer without a doubt.
 New formula is disgustingly sweet. Even worse, the additional sweetness is due to sucralose, an artificial sweetener.<br/><br/>Never buying again. Even if they change the recipe back, I just don't trust these guys anymore.
 If you like the constipation, go right ahead!
 After having used the CVS brand whey flavored cookies and cream, I almost yelled for joy after trying this. The flavor is great!! Doesn't have this overly-artificial sweetener taste, mixes easily and it's actually yummy.  And the price? Beats much of the competition including CVS brand.  So glad to have discovered this product.  Highly recommend!!
 product is fine even tho it taste bad. On my 3rd bad and none of them have ever sealed again once they were opened, why can't a $110 bag of whey be resealable, poor design!
 It was a good protein, I got the white chocolate and hated it in terms of taste.  Easy to mix.
 This is the best brand I have took, I can really see difference in my gains<br/>And I don't feel pain after my workout, and it is perfect for protein shakes as well
 First, I want to say I've used this same product in French Vanilla Creme and it actually tasted good. It is the best tasting protein mix I've ever had, and I've had a few. When I had to replenish my supply French Vanilla Creme was not available but I saw Vanilla Ice Cream. I thought the taste won't be the same but I suspected it would be close. WRONG!<br/>  ON's Vanilla Ice Cream is one of the most vial things I have ever tasted. I can't put into words what this taste is but it certainly isn't Vanilla Ice Cream. There's a thin disgusting flavor left in your mouth after you drink this and the more you drink the more pronounced that flavor becomes. It is possible to gage a serving of this stuff down but after you do you have to consume something else or that taste will linger in your mouth.<br/>  I like ON, and have recommended their products to others, but they have made a huge mistake with this flavor.<br/>  AVOID Optimum Nutrition's 100% Whey Gold Standard, Vanilla Ice Cream.
 90% of people here are praising about its taste and flavour and hardly anyone talking about its result. This product is all about taste and nothing else. I have been using this product for 4 months, doing heavy gym and i have not seen its result so far. I dont understand why people here are praising
 Ok I'm not going to get all detailed or technical about this stuff. Bottom line for me was I got this back when amazon had the 20 dollar coupon so I ended up getting this way cheaper than the standard price. Mixes beyond easy and to me it tastes OK like a beefed up Ovaltean(sp)<br/>Will stick with this brand though because quantity vs. price was to good to pass up. Lets just hope Amazon kicks us another great 20 dollar off coupon!
 Best protein I ever had!!! I only trust this brand for protein. They barely have any filler ingredients. Good for anytime of the day
 Love the brand! This is some of the best tasting, blending, and nutritional whey. I drink it every day.<br/><br/>Stay away from the Cookies 'n Cream flavor - WAY too sweet and leaves me burping the flavor up for hours.
 I recently finished my 5lb bottle of Natural Vanilla Whey by Optimum Nutrition and thought I'd save some money by getting the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor of this product instead.  While the flavor isn't too overwhelming (it does taste like ice cream) it's quite a bit sweeter than the subtle taste of Natural Vanilla product.  I wish I had stuck with the more expensive whey and will switch back when I finally manage to get thru 5 lbs of this ice cream stuff...
 One of my favorite choices for protein. Have been using this for about 4 years now.
 ON's Extreme Chocolate protein has been a nice change to my protein protocol. Though ON is not the best quality and best tasting protein I have ever had it is definitely a good supplement to take and the price cannot be beat. The Extreme Chocolate by itself (with milk or water) is definitely very chalky. If I add a fruit and some natural peanut butter, the taste is superb.<br/>Overall, I am happy with this product.
 Favorite protein powder!<br/><br/>This tastes amazing and about an hour after drinking a shake with this protein, it seems like it is already working to repair my muscles and reduce soreness!
 This is the second tub of whey that I've bought from Optimum Nutrition. The first was the <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Optimum-Nutrition-Gold-Standard-100-Natural-Whey-Chocolate-5-13-Pound-Tub/dp/B000GIQT06/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Natural Whey, Chocolate, 5.13-Pound Tub</a>. In the future I'll go back to buying the 100% Natural version because this one is just too sweet. The 100% Natural had just the right amount of sweetness but was not overwhelming. The first time I tried this one I almost gagged because it was so much sweeter. Now, this is coming from a person who thinks most of today's popular cereals are too sweet. It still tastes very good and packs the same amount of protein. Strictly as a protein I'd rate it a 5, but, with the 100% Natural tasting better, I'm only giving this version 4 stars.
 An excellent product at a great price ... to build muscles and have good health.
 This is my go to brand for whey protein! I'm far from a pro, but this gives me good results and is among the best value for the price.
 product is great  shipping was super fast  ordered with free shipping and arrived next day :)  i was expecting it in a week  taste was a little different than the same flavor at GNC  but in a good way i liked this  more  will purchase again when my supply gets low
 Good value.  Dissolves well enough as long as you pour the powder into the liquid.  Put the liquid into the cup first, then add the powder and stir well.  I like using disposable plastic cups because this stuff is hard to clean off of regular plastic cups.  Real glasses are fine if you soak them after use, then wash them later.
 I've tried numerous protein whey powders in the market and i find myself coming back to this one because of the promising and significant results that i experienced from using it! Plus it's true to it's taste unlike other products.
 I've been a bodybuilder since i finished playing football in College back in 2000. I've used GNC 100% Whey (over priced and gritty) Nitrotech (tasted horrible and way over priced) Arnold's Legend (overpriced, less protein, and too sweet) EAS Whey protein (less protein and too sweet) ON is the best I've ever used and its reasonably priced.  I'm 37 I and weigh 245, bench 445, squat 550, and dead 635.  If I could recommend 1 sup for anyone it would be whey protein especially ON 100% Whey.
 My husband is a repeated buyer of this whey protein, he swears by this product. i think he is using this for last two years before this he used to buy GNC brand one but since he started this, he never looked up to any other brand. its much better and cheaper than anyother brand.
 The beat protein ever
 Can’t get better than this
 Optimum Nutrition makes a great Whet product. I started with the chocolate. Excellent flavor and mixes very well in blender bottle with milk. No bubbles. I then tried cookies n cream flavor and I can honestly say I hold my nose when drinking it. I'm horrified I still have 4lbs of it to go through as I won't waste it. Not only does it taste rancid it doesn't mix well in blender bottle with milk. Leaves a large layer of bubbles. So just get the chocolate.
 There are a lot of great reviews on this product already so read other ones. I'm simply posting to say Rich chocolate(mixed with milk) simply tastes like CHOCOLATE MILK to me.<br/>I was a little nervous ordering 5 pounds after reading reviews saying it tastes bad but using the recommended amount of milk(6-8oz) per scoop it tastes good.
 Great powder only brand my son and I will use.
 I've been taking this protien on and off for about 5 years and still to this date have not found any whey protien that beats the value.  You will find some other powders out there that will taste better, but if you experiment with the amount of water or milk you mix with this, i'm sure you can find a taste you like.  My goal for whey protien in a day is about 100 grams on training days.  I train 5 days a week and this bag lasts me 2 months. So if you are on a budget, this is the best value out there.
 very clean protein with a great chocolate taste that isn't too sweet.  I mix this with unsweetened coconut milk and it is almost like a malted milkshake.
 Best tasting and mixing whey protein for the price. Most of my friends actually think it's chocolate nesquick. I've always had a hard time putting muscle on even with this stuff. I just burn to many calories and don't eat enough. Anyways, I've had a lot of success with keeping my muscle mass even with not weight lifting since I've been busy with jiu jitsu and road biking. Thumbs up from me.
 Well, I was super excited To try this protein supplement. However, after reading some of the reviews on how great it was years ago and now that the formula is changed, I think I will pass.
 There are a few reasons this product stands out among whey protein powders. The main reason is because it's actually whey protein. Other protein powders such as Gaspari Myofusion aren't actually protein, rather a protein blend. This is 100% whey, which definitely makes it authentic and pure. Another reason is the amount of servings you get for the price. For every flavor there are at least 70 servings for the 5 lbs. Other top protein powders such as Syntha 6 and Gaspari Myofusion have less than 60 for 5lbs. 10+ servings is a huge difference when it comes to protein powders. Add in the fact that the price is the same or less than the others gives this a huge advantage. The best protein powder if you are trying to lose weight without losing muscle or gain weight and muscle. It doesn't contain a lot of carbs or fat either.
 This is the whey everyone recommends for a reason. In an ocean of sandy, clumped up, foul tasting products, ON's double rich chocolate is again and again the best. You're unlikely to read anything about whey products (other than ad copy), that won't end up referenceing ON's Gold Standard.<br/><br/>Also, it's hard to maintain the proper meathead image without at least one of these really absurdly large jars sitting on a counter in your kitchen.
 This stuff is just like any other protein powder I've had. The flavor selection is great compared to other brands and they don't taste terrible. I've had the chocolate mint and the strawberry banana and they're both good when mixed with rice or soy milk. My boyfriend and I buy the 5lb size and it lasts a very long time between the two of us.
 ROCKY ROAD!!  this is the best flavor and i have phenomenal results using this quick release product.  i have been on it for about 3 weeks now and it functions as advertised.  coordinate it with some casein and jack3d to complete the sequence.  you can't go wrong with this stuff.  the taste is amazing.
 This is a great product, I am a crossfitter that works out about 5 times a week so I take 4 scoops a day.  What I have seen with this product is that I feel solid, so I have gained lean muscle and my recovery time is much faster.  I have used the AMP GNC before and it was good as well but this product seems to be the same and cheaper.
 I've tried many protein powders over the years and I would rate this one as "okay."<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>It has a good protein to calorie ratio<br/>It mixes well<br/>It tastes okay - I've has some really awful tasting products in the past<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>30 mgs of cholesterol (10% of daily value)! Really?? Why? Many other products have less<br/>It merely tastes okay - IDS whey protein (when it was available) tasted great, so I know it's possible to do better
 Great quality and good price.  Double rich chocolate is paired great with traditional milk, subtle flavor and not too sweet (don't pick up on any fake sweeteners.  Extreme Milk Chocolate is very chemically sweet...pairs better with less flavorful milks in my opinion (I prefer unsweetened Almond).  Was rough trying the Extreme at first, had to cut it with double rich chocolate.  Sticking to DRC from now on, its an extremely safe flavor profile...although Chocolate Almond looks tempting!
 this is for the mocha version. tastes great. use it for breakfast.
 Fantastic!
 I've been using ON 100% Whey for about a year now, and I will continue to use it.  It's a great product, goes down well, and in combination with my 5x per-week lifting routine I've noticed great results.<br/><br/>I've tried chocolate, vanilla, and cookies 'n cream.<br/><br/>They were all pretty good, but my favorite is the chocolate.  While the vanilla one tasted fine, for some reason no matter what I mixed it with (whether it be water or milk) I would always have a TON of foam after mixing it; I would then have to let it sit for a few minutes for the foam to turn back into liquid.  So, beacuse of the foaming issue with the vanilla one, I think I might go back to chocolate.<br/><br/>But still, it's a great product and I will continue to try other flavors as well.
 As expected, this is a great supplement for anyone into athletics or going to the gym. Not much more can be said. The flavor is great and the supplement works amazingly for a great price.
 It's the best around, in my opinion.  Gives me the protein I demand with a taste I enjoy. Rare combination these days…
 I love Gold Standard and I use it as my protein whenever I can. That being said I find this flavor to be a little bland, usually I'm expecting a sweet treat when I get done working out but this just tastes like I didn't put enough Nesquik in my milk, which is why it only gets 4 stars.
 There are other types of protein that I have tried over the years, and this is by far my favorite. With various different flavors to choose from, my personal choice is the Vanilla Ice Cream. With the vanilla base and a blender, you can create fantastic protein shakes by adding strawberries, peanut butter, or even chocolate. Drinking protein shakes every day, I prefer  the option to change the flavors, without buying additional flavors of protein.<br/><br/>This is also an effective protein source that I have had personal success with, and I highly recommend it for anyone wanting to add muscle.
 Without a doubt the best that’s out there!
 Gold standard is always a winner.  If you lift at all, go get some.  always high rated, came very fast.  price rivaled bodybuilding.com at the time... taste is good, mixes easily.
 Bought this product and it works as it does.  I've used about half the tub, drinking 2 scoops post workout.  Taste is on the bitter side but I don't care about taste, results only matter on my boat. The product came in 2 days after purchase, which is average/fast.  Great purchase nonetheless 5/5!
 I had been searching for a new protein powder to supplement smoothies I have for breakfast sometimes. I always find myself in need of a snack by mid-morning (even though I always eat breakfast), but on days that I use this powder, no hunger pangs till lunch! I guess it's a sign that my body needed more protein. I like this one because not only is it reasonable in calories (120/scoop), but also doesn't have a massive amount of protein like some shakes (as a female, I don't need a powder with 50g of protein!). So I tried the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor and mixed it with some unsweetened vanilla almond milk, frozen berries, and a banana, and it was great! Today I tried it with the almond milk, unsweetened cocoa powder, a banana, and a tablespoon of peanut butter and it was AMAZING. Highly recommended.
 It took me a while to find a protein supplement that I could stomach and ON Whey is the best.  The price on Amazon is pretty comparable to many other sites I've ordered from.  If this isn't your flavor, order their sampler box.  It comes with 12 different flavors and most of them are pretty good.
 I've been using GNC Whey Protein Complex Double Chocolate but because of the great reviews I figured I'd give Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Double Rich Chocolate a try.  It smelled great so I was really excited to try it.  Boy, was I disappointed!  It tastes thin and not nearly as much like chocolate as the GNC Whey Protein Complex.  It doesn't mix as well either.  I now have 5 pounds of this that I use only for making homemade protein bars because it's basically not usable on its own.  Seriously, try GNC Whey Protein Complex Double Chocolate, you'll LOVE it.  GNC Whey Protein Complex Double Chocolate is so good, you can just mix it with water and it's great!  Try mixing Optimum Nutrition with just water and try to hold back the gag.  It's seriously that much of a difference.  This is a classic case where smell doesn't translate to flavor at all.  All of those people saying how good this stuff tastes should try GNC Whey Protein Complex Double Chocolate.  Do a double-blind test, try both with just water, try mixing both, no contest.
 I use this in protein shakes, or just recovery drinks.  It's low fat, and high protein.  It does the job and keeps my muscles feeling refreshed.  Make sure you educate yourself on when to take this.  It says on the bottle, but knowing WHY is so much more beneficial and helps make the habit stick.

(Critical for the response to disease – the ‘heart’ of our immune system)<br/>Enlarged liver and kidneys<br/>Atrophy of lymph follicles<br/>Reduced growth rate
 Hands down one of the best whey protein products that I have ever tried or even seen. For the price, this is amazing. The taste is rather good with skim milk or even with water. I usually take this in the morning with breakfast and post workout. With 72 servings, this stuff lasts a while. It mixes really well so there isn't clumping and it cleans up really easily. I'd say this is a must-buy for a post workout.

 I bought Optimum Nutrition Whey protein this time because there was more protein than their competitors.<br/><br/>When I tried  ON protein the first time I found the drink to be thin and runny. but the flavor was good.<br/><br/>This time it is even thinner than before, and the flavor is almost non existent.<br/><br/>I have tried ON whey protein, twice, GNC whey protein, and two others that I will not name because their consistency was like mixing water and sand.<br/><br/>For flavor and consistency so far I MUCH prefer the GNC protein<br/><br/>I recommend you avoid Optimum Whey Protein if taste and consistency are important to you
 Cookies &amp;&amp; cream flavor taste great !!!!!, mixes well also !!! I will be ordering the strawberry soon ! 5/5 .
 it arrived on time. I like the way it tastes and I like that you only have to use one scoop compare to the other protein shakes. Since I've been taking it I noticed my muscle recovery comes faster than usual.
 Quality protien for a great price.  I will definitely be repurchasing after I run out.
 Many other protein products wreak all sorts of havoc on my digestive system, but this product is largely "invisible" to me in those terms.  However, it is very effective in enabling lean muscle health and increasing mass, assuming you put in the work.  I hightly recommend this product.
 I have used this brand for many years. I've tried all sorts of whey from all kinds of brands, expensive and cheap, and this is the one I always go back to. I would get vanilla if you are planning on putting it in smoothies or making pancakes. If not, get an actual flavor! Great protein.
 http://theodysseyonline.com/oklahoma/summary-supplements/65352<br/><br/>This has been a standard issue supplement for my 2 growing sons...they won't drink anything less than Gold standard...My sons link above, he is a big fan of Gold Standard but did not say in his article. please read and share.
 Optimum nutrition is one of the best "marketed" proteins. Constantly they fail on consumer lab testing reports done by independent third party companies that dietitians and nutritionist use. Only time they're known to pass the lab testing sis when the commodity of whey is down on the stock exchange. So unless you're attempting to purchase optimum nutrition protein by lot number I'd suggest just going with other company brands that continually pass. Muscletech proteins, GNC, and vitamin shoppe protein powders came ranked in the top three numerously.
 Just a quick note. I got this at a good sale price. The taste was actually really good compared to the previous protein powders I have used. Whether i blend it with a banana or some cinnamin and splenda, it always goes down good, especially mixed with a hand blender.
 Just a solid and high quality product. Taste is better than any I have every tried. I will not ever use another
 Been a longtime user of this item.... probably about 6+ years.<br/><br/>I've tasted/tested/sampled every Chocolate whey protein powder product out there and this (Optimum Nutrition's Double Rich Chocolate) is by far the best tasting and mixes well with oatmeal or water. There is no artificial sweetener aftertaste like other protein powders. I haven't tried the other flavors as I'm a Chocolateholic.
 This is a very good product, however, a comparable much less expensive alternative is MET-Rx Natural Whey Powder Chocolate -- 5 lbs.
 This is by far the best whey I have found. The Double Chocolate flavor is good, but Rocky Road is superb. I like to mix a scoop of the Double Chocolate flavor whey with a scoop of Cookies and Cream flavored Casein.<br/>It mixes extremely well in a blender bottle. I usually mix it with skim milk, but water works too, although it doesn't taste quite as good. The price is great compared to products with similar nutritional value.
 This actually is a very good product. I'm just a simple guy who goes to the gym 3 times a week to be healthy and of course to try to build a good looking body (without steroids and stuff like that) so honestly i can not say this really help you build body mass fast. But is has decent "good" taste and medically speeking, you do need protein if you are lifting weight, just don't spect magic.
 I'll never see how good this is because I can hardly manage to choke it down after a workout. I've tried it with water and/or milk in a shaker bottle, blended with banana, yogurt, peanut butter, etc...an't make it taste decent. By time I can get it to taste like it's edible, I've mixed so much other stuff in there that I might as well have not even bothered. I got this as a gift from a friend that had a BOGO coupon from a local supplement shop, and I really wish she had the decency to get a good flavor.
 I have tried many different protein powders. My old fave was RTD EAS but I love Optimum Nutrition Double Chocolate, especially with almond milk! It is a great provider of protein and amino acids essential when in training or just trying to cut some weight!
 I got this during Amazon Prime sale and this was a flavor ( DOUBLE RICH CHOCOLATE) I had tried from friends and decided it was alright to buy the 10 pounds during sale. I am currently having the banana and its great. So when I got this and tried it tastes so bad ,absolutely no flavor, I barely taste chocolate and I mix it in exactly 8 oz of water for 1 scoop ratio. It literally tastes like muddy water.<br/><br/>I  regret this purchase so much  because I am stuck with a 10 lbs bag of nothing that I have to find ways to make it better.I honestly get whey for the ease of life and this is anything but.<br/><br/>It says manufactured in 06/15 and batch no# 0000747467 ,anyone else having this issue ?
 The taste is average but the results are extraordinary.
 This is easily the best tasting and most "feel good" effeciant protein's I've ever had. It mixes perfectly in a blender bottle. I prefer using milk, but you can also mix it with water although it wont taste as good imo. The first time I ever bought it, it was the small 2 pound double rich cho. tub and ive never looked back. I now buy the 5 pound tubs of the same exact flavor because if it aint broken don't fix it lol
 This is a great supplement to take for nutrition.  I take a serving after breakfast every morning and it improves my brain function throughout the day.  I also take this before my workouts (usually basketball or weights) providing me with extra energy to exercise longer.  IMO, it's definitely good to have a bottle of this around to get that extra nutrition.  I will always have this stuff around going forward.
 hi,I got this product a few days ago,then,it's the first time to try it yesterday,it taste good,i don't know what will happen if i use it everyday,stronger?hopefully!<br/>on the other hand,i'm from china,hefei,i hope transport should be better,it took me half of day to got this product by myself !!!
 I love this product!! I have stomach issues and this is one of the only proteins I can handle. Good quality!!!!
 Great protein powder. Been using it for years
 An adequately priced, run of the mill whey.  I prefer Biotest's unflavored whey because it's essentially this product but cheaper and just a bit tastier (a very relative term in this case).<br/><br/>This whey has a weird taste thing going on that I can't describe.  It is a good whey though if you're not into Biotest, and I had been using it for about a year with no problems.
 My husband recently started drinking this and he likes it. I should note, he is pretty finicky about what he eats/drinks. Nice value, comes with scoop.
 In my admittedly limited experience with protein powder, I've found many brands to be poor tasting and extremely difficult to blend. While I will leave the more technical analysis of this product to people with more experience with protein powder, I definitely recommend it for its ease in mixing and great taste. Plus it costs about the same amount per pound as other brands I've found.
 One of the best protein powders out there. Excellent taste and no bloating! Good amount of amino acids too. I use it along with ON Serious Mass for some serious gains!
 So yummy and a great price too! I mix it with fat free milk and it tastes just like full fat chocolate milk ;)
 I first tried ON 100% gold standard whey when I first hit the gym. It was good. Then I tried other cheaper brand due to financial constraints,  and realized that it isn't the way to go. Results were inferior, had lots of bloating with other brands. This is the best brand of whey protein for the price. Indeed, it's the gold standard when it comes to mixability, texture, taste.
 Taste is great, and the nutrition mix is as well.  This is probably my favorite ON protein powder so far, except maybe for double rich chocolate.  The price is right on this one lads, so if you're looking for a good protein powder, I'd spring for this.
 Logistics quickly packaged very beautiful
 This is one of the best tasting whey protein powder I ever had in my 20+ years of taking supplements.  However, since it was my first time using it, I have yet to feel the effect of it as compared to a similar product I purchase from Samn's club.  I'll have to order it again and provide better results, if any, at a later date.  To date, it has been only a month since I started using this brand of whey protein.
 Good taste but hate that it has artificial sweeteners! Makes me bloated!
 I use this for my smoothies since it's just straight whey and is not a blend with added fiber or anything.  The flavor is not as good as syntha 6 or combat powder (at least for the flavors I have tried) but it's acceptable.  I use it first thing in the morning, as well as in my smoothies since there are other ingredients that contain fiber in them.  All in all it's satisfactory for what you get.  Just gotta keep in mind that it's a protein powder...not a gourmet steak.<br/><br/>Update 9/29/2016 - After using all of this up, I've switched to BodyTech brand whey.  It's simply a better value for the price than ON.  I still love ON, but they really need to lower their prices and stay competitive with other brands...and not just on whey protein either...
 I've been using this for some time but I found out a much healthier source of protein http://amzn.to/1MnydA0<br/>I highly recommend it!!
 Tried many different brand protein powders this is the best one so far. It dissolves quick no chunks of protein
 I trust optimum. It's good protein powder.
 Pricing is not bad for this protein powder but the taste is so obviously artificial. If you can't endure bad taste, beware. I trust that the whey protein I'm getting is enough for my daily needs. Aside from the taste, I could not complain anymore.
 I have been using this product for the last 4 months and find I have a lot more energy when I work out. I use it mostly post work out.
 As far as whey protein goes this is my favorite. It's great cookies and cream flavor is amazing.
 Bought this for my husband he loves this. He has been using it for at least 2 years. Says its the only protein his stomach can handle without the bloating.
 In my opinion the strawberry  has the best taste I've had. Worth the money. In this world you get what you pay for, do not go for the cheaper brands, cheap usually mean low quality and terrible taste.
 strawberry is so yummy ! good with a banana and milk
 1.) tastes great 2.) best value 3.) seemingly effective.<br/><br/>I don't have any scientific data, but I'm fairly confident that this has been the best isolate I've had.
 Very tasty
 I am fully willing to accept that this might have been a 1-off experience, but I wanted to leave it here for anyone else that maybe had the same experience.<br/><br/>I've been using ON's Whey Vanilla Protein for over a year, specifically the older 2 lbs container that Amazon no longer carried when I went to order it. Instead I got this 5 lbs container.<br/><br/>In the past my experience with ON's Whey Protein was that it tasted very "gentle" -- it was an easy protein powder to mix into anything and not taste. I mixed it with milk or water by itself and would take it before and after a workout.<br/><br/>After I got the new 5 lbs tub, I did my same routine and took my shake before my workout. I was struck with how chalky and noticeable the taste was. The taste of the new protein was much more pronounced. It's not a pungent taste, just a nasty sort of chalky taste.<br/><br/>I went and worked out and came home and had my 2nd shake that was even more pronounced. I couldn't get that taste off my palette for about a day and ended up tossing the entire tub of protein.<br/><br/>I don't know if anyone else has noticed the more pronounced taste, but I've moved to another protein powder just because I personally cannot stand it. If you are using this and continue to notice no taste and everything is fine, it's very possible I just got a bad/unmixed batch of protein or something.<br/><br/>Other than that, it's hard to beat the price of the ON Protein, which is what has always attracted me to it on Amazon.
 It's great!
 Love this stuff. Taste great, mixes well with other powders, and works great. Been using Optimum nutrition for 2 years and prolly won't change my protein choice.
 i think i've found the winning formula, the double rich chocolate flavor blended into a shake with chocolate soy milk.  there are some repulsive soy milks out there, but try it with 8th Continent brand chocolate soy milk; extremely low fat and adds 7 extra grams of protein, bringing your grand total to 31 grams of protein per shake!  and did i mention that the powder makes it thicken up into a delicious chocolate concoction?  give it a try!
 I didn't like the taste at first when I was doing 1 scoop per cup of milk, but I found that more is better.  I like the mixture 2 scoops per 1.25 cups of milk, blended.  Any more and it stops dissolving completely.
 Always my first choice.
 didn't like the flavor too much. and have to be strict to the raitos or the flavor watered down very easily .
 Choc Malt tastes good. Extreme Milk choc taste good too. Mixes beter than other protien powders that I have tried. Still wish it mixed up better.<br/><br/>Extreme Milk Chocolate is the King of all protein
 Really great taste. My new favorite. I used to like chocolate malt but  mocha cappuccino beats that hands down.<br/>I will definitely reorder this product.<br/>Arrival was faster than arrival date I was given.
 Until the last jug of this product arrived, I agreed with all of the five star reviews -- but then the company changed the formulation.  Here's an e-mail I wrote to the company and their boilerplate response:<br/><br/>"BLEH! I've been happily using your Double Rich Chocolate Gold Standard 100% Whey for years but the last jug I bought is awful! At first, I thought there was a mistake in the manufacturing process, and then I noticed that you more than doubled the amount of sodium in the product -- up 117%. Why? Not only is the flavor bad, but many manufacturers are actually reducing the sodium content of products for health reasons. As you must be aware, Americans consume way too much sodium. Surely it's not in your interest to promote hypertension among your customers. I'll be checking out other products the next time I buy."<br/><br/>"Thank you for choosing ON. Yes, you might have noticed changes in sodium and cholesterol levels on the facts panels of Gold Standard 100% Whey. At this time, the formula has not changed, and macronutrient levels of carbs, protein and fats remain exactly the same. Only levels of sodium and cholesterol have changed - and only because we approved new premium raw ingredient suppliers. Optimum has always made a point of accurately reporting the nutrient profile of all protein powders on facts panels. It's part of our uncompromising commitment to superior quality. Making sure that our valued customers are aware of even these small changes is very important to us.<br/>Best Regards!<br/>Rebecca Johnsen<br/>Consumer Affairs Rep<br/>Optimum Nutrition/American Bodybuilding"<br/><br/>The company failed to address the point of concern. The American Heart Association recommends that Americans consume no more than 1500 mg of sodium daily to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease: Using just three scoops of this product daily would equal fully one-quarter of that amount.  (I have a low-sodium diet, but those who aren't may not be put off by the taste of additional sodium.  Nonetheless, few Americans will benefit by having additional sodium added to their diet.)<br/><br/>Note that the company website ( ...]) has not been updated and still shows 60 mg of sodium per serving of the double rich chocolate variety instead of the actual 130 mg.
 The only whey we like to eat.
 This is great protein. Mixes well and tastes great.
 Great Taste. Great deal.
 Everyone knows this is the best
 Always the best protein in regards to results, mix-ability, and taste. I am a little perturbed at the price change as now there is no difference from going to GNC with a gold card.
 I really enjoyed this product.  It has a great taste, not like some of the other products I have tried.  This is my second purchase and as long as they sell it, I'll keep buying it
 Great tasting and  easy to mix.  Best of the best.
 I have tried many different brands of protein. This one is by far the best tasting and I quite easy to get down. This protein powder is wonderful in baking, especially protein bars! Not to sweet and a great all around product. Good gains too! I'm hooked! Try out this product, it proven and well worth your money.
 What more could you ask for? It tastes great (I got the double rich chocolate flavor), mixes easily and is loaded in protein. Low sugar/calories/etc.<br/><br/>The taste isn't so great mixed with water, so I usually mix it with 6oz. of 1% milk. You can use a shaker or just a spoon.<br/><br/>Protein is something a lot of people don't think about while dieting and this is a tasty way to remember it. =) If you don't want to lose your muscle mass along with that fat I'd certainly recommend a protein supplement and this is hard to beat.
 Better get it from here then any other place. the prize is awesome. and this is the best it gets if ur in protein shakes. all you got to do is mix it with banana and it tastes awesome ohh and milk lol dont use water
 This is one of my first protein-powder purchases from the Optimum Nutrition brand. I'm amazed how quickly ON's whey protein powder dissolved in a liquid. I usually add 1 serving of ON (24g protein) to a couple of ice cubes and soymilk or skim milk in a blender to make a delicious protein shake, and it keeps me filled and satisfied for a couple hours. I like its consistency and smooth texture; it doesn't have that extra "stuff" that you can detect and taste in other protein powders, like <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Cytosport-Muscle-Milk-Collegiate-Vanilla-Creme-5-29lbs/dp/B0019VJK0K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Cytosport Muscle Milk Collegiate, Vanilla Creme 5.29lbs</a>. The reason for 4 stars? Although you can smell the vanilla ice cream flavor once the container is open, the vanilla intensity just isn't enough, especially when you mix it with water.
 I wish they used real sugar and not the fake chemicals?  Messes with my stomach. Would not purchase this again.
 My husband LOVES the way it taste. He mixes it with milk, and it really does taste like a vanilla milkshake!
 Not to bad for serving to price.
 Boys love this brand!!
 Great protein powder that is not too sweet and taste like chocolate milk when missed with milk. It is sweetened with acesulfame potassium (Ace K) and is the only disappointment.<br/><br/>It would be perfect if it was made with Truvia (Stevia).
 Tastes great with cold milk. Only use the 4-6oz of milk per the directions and a heaping scoop of the product. Blend and drink. Very chocolaty and rich. None of that "protein shake" aftertaste. I actually consider it a treat. The low sugar and low fat per serving with the high protein count gives you the bang for your buck.
 Best Whey.  Excellent flavor.  I have tried every type of Whey from numerous companies. Mixes well.  Consumer Reports rates it the lowest in all the toxic  heavy metals.  Use to drink Muscle Milk but Consumer Reports reported that Muscle Milk is the highest in Lead, Mercury, Arsenic, cadmium  and extremely toxic if taken three times a day.  I don't work for any company or Consumer Reports.  My three muscular sons all drink this before and after their daily workouts.  Have been using this product for over 5 years.  Can't beat this price.  I also buy the Optimum Nutrition Casein vanilla protein which tastes wonderful and better than vanilla whey.
 Really great price, way cheaper than any store price I've ever seen.
 Stick to the 5Lb tubs. The plastic zipper quality on these is TERRIBLE. Wont zip 80% of the time. And youre left with 10Lbs of protein shake that taste terrible because it was exposed to air for so long. Never getting a 10Lb bag again. Back to 5Lb tubs.
 I nbever thought I would be that guy to take whey protein powder, but sometimes there just aren't enough hours int he day to eat enough food and this helps me to supplement that. So I say yes way to whey
 Awesome Protein!! Some Protein makes you feel like your going to throw up its so thick and heavy. This product mixes and tastes awesome!!! I thought the protein I had before was good..this is way better!
 love it...the taste of this flavor is the best...would keep buying only this
 Has great taste and mixes easily
 It's whey protein powder. The strawberry flavor is always consistent from Optimum Nutrition.
 The only protein powder product that I buy. True to it's taste unlike my previous one that tastes like Lucifer's butt crack
 Optimum nutrition products exceed my expectations every time. This is yet another wonderful protein product. Mixes extremely well, tastes GREAT!!! Very chocolatey, no gritty taste and best of all no after taste. Truly some of the best made products on the market.
 I've been using it for years...tried the others and nothing compares.  Full spectrum of nutrients you need...doesn't punish the GI tract like cheaper brands.  Use the casein too.
 I like the taste but haven't seen any result or change on my body muscles.
 Good whey protein, still is not 100% isolate whey protein and it has some amount of concentrate whey protein. Taste wasn't so good (double rich chocolate). Price was still very low.
 I've tried a lot of whey proteins, but nothing compares to the taste and effectiveness of this product. One of the best and least spiked proteins on the market.
 If you're consuming a lot of protein shakes then you'll save money by buying the 10lb bag. The double rich chocolate flavor is great and mixes easily in a shaker cup.
 Great value. These are usually pretty expensive in the store
 My favorite protein powder and tastes great!
 Contains Sucralose.  CSPI has downgraded this from "Caution" to "Avoid"
 This whey contains Acesulfate Potassium (Ace-K) - an artificial sweetener. Look at the list of ingredients.<br/><br/>Question: Does your mouth taste sweet after taking this whey? for 3 to 4 hours? even after brushing your teeth? If your answer is yes, then something is wrong in your system because of this whey.. a sweet taste lingering in your mouth is not normal.<br/><br/>Please do yourselves a favor and research Ace-K. ...nuff said.
 I mix this with 6 oz of milk, and take it two servings at a time (total of 12 oz of milk).  I wouldn't go as far as to say it tastes like, say, a Nestle chocolate milk or anything, but it's solid.  I still have to take big gulps, but I don't have to chase it with anything after drinking, which is nice.  It tastes solid, and I'd venture to say it's probably as good as chocolate protein gets.  This is my second type of protein, the first being the strawberry flavor from Vitamin World.  I say it's on par with that.
 O.N.'s Whey Gold Standard is the best out there. It's pure, and it can be added easily to your other supplements. I wouldn't buy anything under 5lbs because your going to have to use a few scoops per day for any results. Don't be fooled by many other Whey products that have fillers, like ones you can buy from Walmart. Amazon has the best price for the 5 pound container. Get it.
 The taste is great.  The low sodium content is a huge plus even though I don't currently have high blood pressure.  Low on carbs so add a banana after you work out but great if you just want to have straight up protein.  The only reason it doesn't receive 5 stars from me is because it has 10% of the cholesterol you need dialy.  This is not huge but I wouldn't have more than 1-2 shakes of it a day.  If this product had 5% or less I would pretty much have 3 shakes a day.  But compared to other protein shakes 10% isn't that much.. WORTH A TRY
 I've tried several different brands, kinds, and flavors of protein, and Optimum Nutrition's whey is without doubt one of the highest quality. Mixes great in a shaker, tastes good, and offers a great price per serving. Everything I could ask for.
 So far so good.. love the strawberry banana.. try it with soy millk.. frozen banana and two scoops of this.. damn it is amazing.
 Hard to mix and very bland taste. I wouldn't recommend or purchase this item again. Definitely  try flavors out buying a small portion.
 I've been using this product for a few years...worth every penny and more...
 Competitive price with other health outlets. Great Prime Day purchase
 I got halfway through the bottle and could NOT get myself to finish the rest, it's TOO SWEET. Yeah, they're saving the consumer calories, but the sucralose dosage in this stuff is overkill, highly recommend ON's "Any Whey," it's all natural; "Any Whey" will be my next purchase on Amazon. My only credibility I have is I have lost count of the bottle's of Optimum Nutrition Pro-Complex Whey since first using in 2005.. hope this review helps.
 For me, this product is good, not necessarily because I saw myself bulk up tremedously in the month that I took it, although there were some visible differences, but because it helped me get the amount of protein I needed daily, and it tasted great. I think if I keep taking this I will have nothing but great results.
 Have tried all kinds and and all flavors of whey proteins that are out there. The gold standard whey works great for my digestive system (I am trying to gain and go thru like 13-15 scoops a day). Have seen great results, love the taste, the price and the results. Banana is my fav and I think least 'powdery' of all the other flavors when you are mixing it with water. Be sure to use an electrical blender though.
 Best whey protein in the market in this price segment. Tastes great, easily digestible, I can see the results in just 2 weeks. Don't forget to exercise properly when you take this product.
 MORE SWEETENER THAN WHEY PROTIEN - I usually do not leave negative review but his product deserves one.  When shareholders get greedy, they push the company to increase profits and the way this company decides to increase its profits is by making a more inferior product for the same price.  This product is filled with half sweetener and half Whey protein.  It is disgustingly sweet - the sweetener is used as a filler so that less Whey powder is required to fill the container.
 Bad pun aside, my family has used this whey for a long time and I recommend it as one of the best you can get if you can afford the price premium.
 I liked this, it mixed easy in a small blender (bullet) and the taste was chocolaty.  I only mixed it with skim milk so I don't know how it mixes with water.
 Great stuff, I always you this as my post workout protein.
 This is my second 5 lb tub of Chocolate Malt.  It's delicious (and nutritious!).  I am a woman who lifts fairly regularly and recommend this to anyone.  I also enjoyed White Chocolate flavor, but not as much.  Double chocolate was ehhhhh.  They're all good with milk, but this one works with water just fine (saving the calories).
 I went through 3 x 5lbs in the last 3 years. This is my favorite whey powder. It tastes good and smells even better. It's great amount of protein for the price.
 lets wait and see what happens in 3 months
 Bought this recently for my first time because of high volume of reviews, was disappointed. Got the milk chocolate flavor and it's just laying tatse. Not impressed.
 While I'm not any sort of expert on whey, I tried a couple other kinds before finding this one and it is definitely better. For one thing, when mixed with milk this really tastes good so that's a huge plus, and it also mixes really well. The other whey powder I tried was much more clumpy after being mixed so it was a pleasant surprise to be able to drink this one without chunks of the powder stuff still floating around.<br/><br/>Highly recommended!
 This flavour is the best I have tasted so far....for all the coffee lovers....you'll love it
 i can't believe how delicious it is! i want to get healthy and feel better again and this is my first step towards that goal! thank you amazon.com.
 The container was in one piece and not leaking when it arrived....That's all that really matters. The product works well and tastes great.
 This is the best protein hands down!  Tastes great, has the most BCAA's, 4 grams of glutamine and is easy to digest with lactase.  LOVE THIS STUFF!!!
 This is the besst protein out there.  Great for post workouts and also as a meal replacemmet.  I wish amazon wouldn't have stopped the subscribe and save for this item.  The price is a little high but well worth it for an excellent protein that gets obsorbed into the body quickly.
 Great Whey Protein.  Use it, get results.  Great price, great taste.  I don't blend, I shake in a bottle.  It mixes very easily with water and milk and I haven't found a flavor I didn't like.  I take 20 grams pre and 40 grams post.  Get ON this Whey.
 The Powder is great.  one of the best tasting Whey Proteins I've found, and I've gone through Dozens of them.  Great Rich chocolately taste, but not all the sugar that goes along with some powders.  Give it a try!
 24 grams of protein per serving! Taste good. Does not quite mix as well with a spoon as they claim but is still everything i wanted in a protein powder.
 Old faithful! I've been trying out different protein powders for about 5 years now and I keep coming back to this. Quality all around; flavor, formula and results! Perfect in going up against my grilled cheese addiction!
 Love the protein powder and love the salted caramel flavor.
 Had a very good flavor my son love it so much, I recommend this item
 Great Product. Fast Delivery
 I take some daily for breakfast &amp; some before going to bed. Taste pretty good in water, not delicious but good. I got the vanilla one.
 I put like 1 and a half scoops in a glass of milk and it tastes good.  This product is very helpful for my protein needs.  I'm just a little worried about all that aspartame and artificial sweeteners.  I'd gladly drink it without that stuff even if it tasted bad because if you have the discipline to work hard you should have it for eating healthy.
 Perfect protein powder, been using it for years now. Any chocolate based flavor is delicious. Make you some gaaainnzz man.
 Optimum Nutrition's 100% Whey Gold Standard is the only protein powder I use. There are a few better protein powders on the market, unfortunately they're a lot more expensive. This is the best one you can get for your money. I'm a huge fan of the Banana Cream.
 I have used ON Double Rich Chocolate Gold Standard 100% Whey for a while now and have really been satisfied until my last purchase.  I purchased a new 5.15 lb in May and this container smells almost like spoiled milk and taste the same.  I have contacted Optimum nutrition about it and I am waiting to get a response.  Has anyone else had this problem?  I mix it with water and has been great until this package.  I would ahve rated it higher if not for my problem with this current batch.  I hope I am not out $40!
 Love it!
 I haven't used many protein powders, but this one tastes great and mixes easily.  Seems to have good nutritional value and gets great reviews.
 Favorite Whey Product!!!
 Long time user of the product (which by the way is a great product to begin with), and just found a lot of value in buying it from Amazon and actually have even scheduled a delivery on the same. Great new feature for a discounted price. :)
 I really like the protein powder, The product taste great and I look forward to taking it every day. As a nutritional consultant I can highly recommend this product to my clients. I really like adding in some <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Chia-Seeds-2-Pounds-All-Natural-Black-Chia-Seeds/dp/B009Z5Y3Q8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Chia Seeds 2 Pounds All Natural Black Chia Seeds</a> and mixing them in my shake for a added nutritious punch.
 Best protien for the $$$
 There are already a thousand sites that recommend Optimum, the fact is it works so I'm not going to go over it again.<br/><br/>Of every product i have tried, this one is by far the better tasting (double chocolate is the one i bought).<br/><br/>I think 5lb is the perfect size just because it is easier to store.
 For some reason It never helped me.<br/><br/>I used that protein after cycling to get some better recovery,(maybe) grow muscles, get faster and as I result I wanted better VO2Max and faster recovery. I used 2 cans overall, and I drank 1 shake after every ride. My average ride is about 30-50 miles, 3-4 times a week.  To make it short there was no improvement in any of those things mentioned above. It was waste of money. Not sure what it does to muscles, but it's definitely not good for recovering them.
 Delicious and doesn't clump like others I've tried in the past.
 outside of the fact that the mint flavor is a bit odd . ( Vitamin shops is better tasting!!!)<br/>its a great supplement that mixes easily...<br/>plus nothing beats shopping at Amazon !!!!!!
 Best Whey Protein on the market.
 OP Gold is top of the pack as far as protein powders go.  Mixes well, tastes decent, no giant scoops. Good buy for this on Amazon.
 Ruined Vanilla Ice Cream with Sucralose!!!
 God damn DELICIOUS!
 Best tasting whey I have ever had!  No additonal "stuff" in it I don't need-  GREAT protein drink! Mixes great with no grit -  Will get again!!!
 Doesn't taste like Cake Batter to me at all!! I've had better tasting protein powder. This has a very strong aftertaste.
 Wanted to try a new flavor so I got white chocolate.  A bit too sweet for me.
 This is a really good product. It lasts for quite a while and it tastes so much better than other products I’ve tried. The price is definitely worth it for the taste it has and for how long it lasts, and of course, because it works well. Definitely recommend!
 great flavor!
 This stuff has been a great help to working out. I'm a skinny guy who has a hard time getting enough calories and protein in a day and this stuff has helped immensely.
 I heard about Whey Protein when I started working out at the gym. I could definitely feel the improvement and energy after using this product for a week. The price on amazon was perfect, as it was a lot cheaper than the one in stores and on other websites. I would recommend the "Chocolate Malt" flavor. It tastes awesome.
 I have tried a few others and would say this is the best whey for the money out their cant beat the price.  Good quality and reccomended..
 Thx
 I had used several different protein stuff including Muscle Milk and Nitro Tech.  Muscle Milk became my favorite, sole choice and cannot be compared to other products.  I recently purchased 100% Whey Protein Chocolate and Vanilla just for curiosity.  This product tastes better than Nitro Tech and some other protein products, but it tastes far worse than Muscle Milk while it does not seem to work better than Muscle Milk.  It is true that Muscle Milk has more calories than this product and has small amount of allegedly unfattening fat, but Muscle Milk tastes truly great and has many helpful ingredients including vitamin and creatine.
 Whey good!
 I waited until I used the full container before I decided to review this protein.<br/>The benefits are that it tastes good. It seems to be good quality, and I didn't have any stomach upset problems at all.<br/>Is it that much better than other brands? Not really. It's just a good solid protein powder. I am using it to up my protein<br/>while dieting to get leaner. I am also using <a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Raspberry-Ketones-90-capsules-250mg-100-pure-Natural-weight-loss-and-appetite-suppression-supplement-250mg-per-capsule/dp/B00BFX6LUO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Raspberry Ketones-90 capsules,250mg. 100% pure. Natural weight loss, and appetite suppression supplement. 250mg per capsule.</a>
 I have been a user of Optimum Nutrition's protein powders for many years. They usually have a good flavor, and mix well. I used to really like the dutch chocolate flavor of their "pro complex" formulation, since the early 90's or so.<br/><br/>Well, lately have been trying some new flavors to see how it goes, you get tired of just chocolate and vanilla. Well, just tried this Chocolate Malt, it is good! It tastes like the Whoppers candy does. Good taste, and not aftertaste.<br/><br/>Also very good is the extreme milk chocolate. I like these 2 chocolates better than the "double rich" chocolate, maybe am just getting tired of that one after several years.<br/><br/>Cookies and cream sounds good but is not. Good at first, but odd aftertaste. Same thing with Rocky Road, I just didn't like the taste.<br/><br/>Vanilla ice cream is very good. I like to add protein to some milk and take it with me in my lunch. Also good is the "Cake Batter" - funny name, but tastes good.<br/><br/>My wife says the Caramel Toffee is a good choice too, it smells very good at least.<br/><br/>The strawberry I've tried in the past, that was a good flavor too. Have not tried banana, coconut, etc.<br/><br/>So in summary there are some good flavors Optimum makes, and it is cheaper to order online vs. the retail store. Oh yes - and get a good shaker or too. My favorite is the smaller sized (16 oz?) "Blenderbottle" - it is sturdy, mixes things smoothly, and is easy to wash out. And here on Amazon it is around $6. Order a couple so you have a backup. Also great to take when you travel. Also like the Tupperware shaker bottle, that is around $10.<br/><br/>So I hope this is helpful info to the reader. My newer policy is to try a new flavor in as small a container as you can order. Then if it is crap, you can try to give it away, or throw it away, and you are not out so much $$. :)
 There's no question that ON makes quality protein powders, and most actually taste fantastic. But for anyone who is contemplating taking a chance and trying this flavor for variety sake, I advise against it. It comes off as a little too strong, and tastes like nothing resembling cookies n' cream in my opinion. Stick with good old chocolate or vanilla type flavors.<br/><br/>Aside from the taste, the protein quality was the usual high quality blend, and the consistency of the drink when blended was great.
 This product dissolves quickly and cleanly, I use a small immersion blender to drop into the glass of milk and 10 seconds later, I'm good to drink. No clumps. Tastes great and 2 of these pups per day with my regimen have equaled 3 lbs of lean muscle. Not a bad trade-off. 5lbs of protein ~ 3lbs of muscle.
 This is great protein and I definitely got great results. However, it may a little pricey.
 Great product. I wish they didn't raise the price
 The basics! Pure whey protein, don't need anything fancy.  Been using this since 2005!
 I got this as a gift last Christmas. I want to add to all the good reviews above, it not only gives you quality protein, but is also very easy on the stomach. I noticed this as I switched over from a different product. It tastes great with a fruit(banana), and milk.
 Love it, fast!
 Awesome protein!
 This review is for the French vanilla flavor. I've used many ON products and proteins before, but this one was terrible. If you want vanilla, stick with the vanilla ice cream flavor instead.
 I bought the cookies &amp; cream flavor... the taste isn't that great but it doesn't blend well. Gets really foamy.
 This product is fantastic plus I can re-use the 5lb container for refilling it with Whey Protein.
 this stuff tastes GREAT! if u have to drink it with water, the colder, the better.. otherwise it's kind of gross.. tastes delicious with cold milk tho!
 Best tasting Whey isolated I've tried.  Very happy with the muscle gain while using this product.
 Use milk instead of water. Tastes better. Doesn't take much, maybe a cup or less per scoop!
 This stuff is delicious
 I have tried Syntha-6, Muscle Milk, Muscle Tech, and a couple of other protein drinks. My favorite is ON's Rocky Road. It tastes amazing. I can gulp it down it tastes so good. Tastes like hot cocoa....that is cold.
 The 10# whey is a great value as well as great tasting and great blending. I have used other wheys that do not blend as well and leave some clumps of whey. I put this in a nalgene bottle half milk and half water, volume roughly per directions, and shake. No need for a blender or a shaker. The quality of protein is ok. I prefer the isolate but you can't beat the value
 This item came in great condition and on time.  The taste is a little funky, but as Protein Supplements go, you can't be the nutrition stats or the price.
 The Extreme Milk Chocolate is probably the best tasting Whey out there.  The sweetness is not overwhelming and it does not have the artifical taste of the other flavors.  Taste even better with low fat milk.
 Tastes great and performs great
 While this supplement was not necessarily ineffective or bad-tasting, a bit of research led me to some unsettling findings.  First was that this protein supplement contains trace amounts of cadmium, arsenic, and lead.  Although below the legal limits, there are plenty of supplements that contain NO heavy metals.<br/><br/>For reference:<br/><br/> ...]<br/><br/>As if that weren't enough, there have also been documented side effects to whey supplementation.  I personally experienced bloating and cramps on several occasions after drinking whey.  Whey is also not advised for those with liver problems.<br/><br/>(On a personal note, I was often constipated during my forays into whey.)<br/><br/>Personally, I prefer to play it safe with organic supplements.  Hemp, brown-rice, cranberry-seed, goat-milk, brazil-nut, buckwheat, and pea proteins are all viable alternatives to the traditional whey/casein combo.  Each of the protein's merits and shortcomings can be found here:<br/><br/> ...]<br/><br/>For those who are interested, Nutiva's has two types of hemp powder available, currently around $20-25 for a three-pound bag.  Although it doesn't taste nearly as good as "double chocolate," Nutiva hemp protein powder is easily metabolized, nearly complete in all essential amino acids, high in fiber, and rich in omega-3s fatty acids, which stimulate healthy brain function; a lot more than proponents of whey protein can claim.<br/><br/><a class="a-link-normal" data-hook="product-link-linked" href="/Nutiva-Organic-Hemp-Protein-50-Protein-Per-Serving-3-Pound-Bag/dp/B001OHX1ZY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Nutiva Organic Hemp Protein 50% Protein Per Serving, 3-Pound Bag</a><br/><br/>(On another personal note, the fiber in hemp truly does its job!  And no, you cannot get high or fail a drug test from ingesting hemp; it's 100% legal as a supplement!)<br/><br/>To be fair, whey protein gets the job done.  I did notice an increase in bulk muscle after supplementing my workouts with it, but the fact of the matter is that this product deserves the 3 stars I gave.  Put simply, there are cleaner, safer, and more natural products out there.  Look into organic supplements; your body will thank you!
 Product works excellently. And you can't beat the price for the huge amount of product you receive. Very pleased with purchase!
 very tasty. Had to stir it in with milk slowly in order to avoid clumping.
 I bought double chocolate but it tastes light.
 This product isn't as bland as some reviews make it out to be. I mix it with 8-12 oz of non-fat milk and it dissolves in a shaker perfetly and has a smooth rich taste. Has worked great for me before and after workouts.
 Very good product, helpful for a high protein diets, 25 great of good quality protein powder and zero gr of fat and carbs.
 I tried it, loved the taste, but the effects of the whey protein made me so violently sick I pitched the rest of the can.  If you cannot tolerate Whey or milk proteins in any form, then the best advice is to Fuggedaboutit.  I suggest Sun Warrior ORMUS Organically grown Super Greens and the new Sun Warrior vegetarian source protein drink instead.  People who cannot tolerate milk, or are vegetarian and do not eat meat or products from animals like milk or eggs will find the Sun Warrior Protein Drink just perfect.  Nope, I am not a representative for Sun Warrior, just an avid fan of such a incredibly rich and wholesome, organic source as Sun Warrior.  I do not trust any of these Whey products because they do not tell you if they come from hormone fed cattle, or what.  Certainly most are not organic.
 My go-to whey.
 The best protein I have ever tried!
 Here are my ratings for the flavors that I've tried so far.<br/><br/>Extreme Milk Chocolate: 5/5 stars<br/>French Vanilla: 4/5 stars<br/>Double Rich Chocolate: 4/5 stars<br/>Vanilla Ice Cream: 4/5 stars<br/>Cookies N' Cream: 3/5 stars<br/>Chocolate Mint: 0/5 stars<br/><br/>I'm a chocoholic, and Extreme Milk Chocolate is by far my favorite; I love the taste. Coming in 2nd place is Double Rich Chocolate, Vanilla Ice Cream, and French Vanilla; they are all very good. Cookies N' Cream comes in 3rd place because the "cream" flavor can be a bit too strong; I find it helps when you mix it half and half with one of the other flavors. And Chocolate Mint is last because it has an absolutely horrid bitter aftertaste; avoid it at all costs.<br/><br/>If you are looking for an inexpensive source of protein to meet your daily requirements that tastes good, then I highly recommend this product.
 I love this stuff...excellent product !! I have been using this since Decmber 2012 and I can definitely see results. Low sugar and low carb and more servings than the other protiens.
 The is a great protein. However, their costs have gone up substantially over the last couple years, as with many other whey protein brands. After purchasing it, I actually found a site that sells it for $8 cheaper and lets you choose from all of their flavors.
 Good quality protein with a variety of flavors other protein powders do not carry.<br/>Mixes easily in water or any other liquid!
 I;ve been using this for about for weeks and it's help me to lose belly fat when I started using it my body fat was at 27% im only 5'7 and now it's down to 18% I workout 3 times a week and before taking whey I was getting lower on the fat% be not as fast as with it. LOVE IT.  ps get the Creatine.
 I like this product a lot because of all the quality supplements that are included.  This, however, is not the best tasting flavor.  I bought it so that I wouldn't be tired of the Double Rich Chocolate flavor.  Turns out, I got tired of this flavor way earlier.  Stick with Double Rich Chocolate.
 This stuff tastes pretty good, but you have to mix it strong. I like it with nonfat milk and cinnamon. I bought it becuase it was lower in carbs than alot of other which is nice during low carb non training days.
 This is by far the best protein that I've ever had. It not only mixes well and tastes good, but I instantly noticed results with it. Usually my workouts kill me and even with protein shakes I will be sore the next day. With this protein I was ready for another round!<br/><br/>It's worth noting that I've only been using it for a little over a week, but so far I'm more than satisfied with it.
 This is just mind blowing amazing. Just a little too sweet in my opinion.  Add more milk<br/><br/>WHEY to go!
 Chocolate flavor is delicious.  Mixes fairly well.  A couple of scoops in the morning on my cereal keeps me strong all day.
 Cookies &amp; creme is absolutely disgusting and I'm stick with 5 lbs. of it.  Double rich chocolate also isn't very good but doesn't make me want to gag like cookies &amp; creme.  May try extreme milk chocolate or rocky road next based on other reviews...
 delicious (i'm very picky about flavor) and easily dissolving with a decent amino acid profile. however, a bit pricey even at the bulk sizes.
 all good, excellent product
 I've only used this in smoothies, not by itself.  It mixes completely and gives a great vanilla taste to my smoothie.  AND, I'm getting all the benefits of Whey!
 Best protein powder ever. Even if you drink it once a day it built muscle fast. This was awesome stuff
 I've been using ON products for a little over a year now. For the most part, I've been very pleased. I bought the 10 lb bag back in November because at the time, it was cheaper than the 5 lb tub. Tastes the same but as far as usign it in my shaker cup, this has been very clumpy. Tried some Syntha-6 a month ago and not once did it clump and it tastes much better. Maybe it was a fluke thing with the clumping, but this will be the last ON product I purchase for a long time.
 Protein is expensive, and this is the first time I've bought in bulk.  I don't regret it, as it didn't cost much more than a 5lb jug at GNC but will last twice as long.
 it is the top selling product in it's category on amazon.com and bodybuilding.com for good reason!!! Very good product.  I highly reccomend it!
 I have only tried the Double Rich Chocolate, it mixes well in a shaker and taste pretty good. This is the way to purchase protein, dont waste your time and money going into any of these supplement stores.
 This product seems so far to be a very good source of protein at a reasonable price. It cost a little more initially, but it is not full of fillers so it doesn't take a lot of it per serving to meet your needs.
 Def the best in protein. Never amino spiking or any BS, just the top. Love you optmium.
 This tasted awful
 The taste is acceptable but not perfect, I guess it's a good choice due to the inexpensive price.
 The strawberry protein shake from Optimum tastes great and makes my routine more complete as a post-workout drink.  Highly recommended
 This protein is really great. It uses very high quality fast proteins, mixes really easy, tastes good and is not expensive.  None of the others that I've tried are as good on all counts. I've found that nearly all of Optimum's products are very high quality
 This is the first time I've tried this product, and it is excellent. I especially like the solubility of the mix in milk, soymilk, and water.
 This product is awesome and tastes GREAT! This is a perfect addition for a boost of protein in your diet.
 I drink the protein with milk every time after I came back from the gym. After using this protein for one  month, I found my muscles were growing. The chocolate flavor is acceptable for me
 Good Product
 For quality and quantity you get the best blended protein you can buy that mixes easy, doesn't cause stomach discomfort or excessive gas if you are the normal individual who has no food allergies.  I will continue to buy optimum nutrition as it suits my likings and budget.
 This is one of the best protein powders out there.  It is fairly cheap in price, but not in quality.  The double rich chocolate is the best flavor since it goes well with milk or water.  It has no gritty taste and it mixes very well.  Highly recommended.
 this is a delicious chocolate tasting sports drink. i take one every morning. it is tough to believe that something this healthy can taste like a rich chocolate milkshake. but its true, and its very good.
 I was debating wether to buy this or not but was actually satisfied by the cookies and cream flavor. It mixes excellent and tastes delicious even in water.
 That's just what I want.
 I was a little let down after reading about how amazing it tastes.  It tastes pretty good for protein, but don't believe the people who liken it to a milkshake.  It's protein powder in water/milk.  Don't expect anything more.
 Contains ingredients, (brands of artificial sweeteners) not listed on the pictured label. I tried to list what it was but Amazon refused those reviews. I know that some are not concerned about these ingredients but it still should be disclosed before your purchase.
 Tastes good, easy to mix and has a good protein to carb ratio.  I switched from the cyto sport complete whey, both products are great.
 Excellent product
 Satisfied so far. Was careful this time to incorporate excessive water to avoid indigestion problems that were faced the last time.<br/><br/>Looking forward to try the "Natural" Whey
 The chocolate flavor is not that great but it is ok and the rest is awesome. I like it so much!
 4th time I bought this product..taste very good and mixes very easily..24gr per serving..<br/>The best is the taste..you have to like the taste..some taste like cardboard(not this product)
 This product came highly recommended from my Dad and brother. The cookies n' cream flavor is actually quite delicious and it is easy to mix. Makes a great breakfast after a morning workout. My muscles always fell better.
 Tastes GRRRRRRRRRRREEAT!
 Does what it is supposed to do. Does not taste bad at all. RAWR I'm a dinosaur two words left.
 Amazing ON leads the way!!!! I bought chocolate mint and it taste like thin mint Girl Scout cookies. Highly recommend.
 This is an absolute steal at this price. Much cheaper than you will find in stores. And it tastes great! In fact, it tastes like Cocoa Krispies, LOL. So, if you like them, then you'll like the taste of this shake.
 I see results.. I will back off to the less chocolate version..<br/>Just my personal preference.. Product is great..
 BRO! im so jacked BRO you should see BRO this s*** is good

 I honestly don't mind the taste at all but I was a little surprised when I opened the package only to discover the protective seal was detached from the protein bottle. It makes me question what I actually got :/
 Item shipped quickly. The Whey tastes great even with water. I am pleased with the product thus far and would buy again!
 This is a solid product when it comes to protein. Great flavor and mixes well with milk, even better with water. Definitely sticking with this product.
 I GAINED 15 KG , IN A 2 MOUNTHS. MAKING EXERCISE AND MIXING WITH CREATIN AND GLUTAMINE.<br/>EXCELENT. AND AT BEST PRICE
 I'm very disappointed about this product. I would never purchase this band again.
 I am into many sports and protein isolate is a necessity to me since I consume no beef or chicken. I have been consuming whey protein isolate unflavored for last few years in five and ten pound bags. The price has been going up so I tried to see if there is any product compatible to what I consume a pure whey protein isolate, no additives, no gum, no sweeteners, no additional anything, nothing more than pure protein, no vanilla, no chocolate, just unflavored pure protein.<br/><br/>GOLD STANDARD vs OTHERS:  79% protein by weight vs 95%, that is 16% less and cholesterol 30mg vs 4mg, 7 times more cholesterol, sodium 80 vs 40 and that is twice the sodium.<br/><br/>GOLD STANDARD ingredients:  Protein Blend (Whey Protein Isolate, Whey Protein Concentrate, Whey Peptides), Cocoa, Processed with Alkali), Natural Flavor, Artificial Flavor, Lecithin, Acesulfame, Potassium, Salt.<br/><br/>I do not consume sugar and salt which you can find mainly in processed foods. The question in here is why would anyone pay for salt more sodium, more cholesterol, potassium in supplement form, and artificial flavor in order to get WPI when you can purchase WPI without all those additives. But more importantly I get 81 scoops instead of 70 scoops and 25gr protein...
 bad smell
 good product
 This is excellent whey protein at a great price. I've spent a lot more money on products that are basically the same. This has a great taste and won't leave you bloated.
 Acesulfame Potassium is garbage, doesn't matter how great the other ingredients are. If they add garbage to it, it's garbage PERIOD???...From Global Health Center:<br/>"Artificial sweeteners were designed to be sugar substitutes as a less fattening alternative. You find sugar substitutes in diet sodas, yogurt and such. These artificial sweetener additives mimic the flavor of sugar but with virtually no useful energy. There are five dangerous sugar substitutes that are approved for consumer use: saccharin, neotame, acesulfame potassium, aspartame, and sucralose. Of the five, sucralose and aspartame are the most pervasive and dangerous substitute found in products on store shelves today."
 Best flavour and protein powder we found and at a reasonable price.
 Always love the gold standard products. Flavor is great!
 Probably THE best tasting of protein I have had. The mint flavoring kills any of the "different" taste protein powders normally have. Mixes great too.
 One of the best tasting protein in my opinion. Easy to drink when mixed with water and does not taste bad at all.
 Because I like to stick to a plant-based diet, I use Whey protein as a supplement.  It is high in protein and tasty!
 Great taste- had the vanilla ice cream. Excellent value. Loved the product. Mixes better than other products. Not grainy.
 Woah baby since I started using this protein I am a powerful ripped STUD. This is the only leading protein to contain the highly effective ingredient Muscles-B-huge 867. What Muscles-B-Huge 867 does is increase your bodys Zuwappa levels by a wopping 43.867 percent which caused my bench press to go up from 3 sets of 2 1/2 reps with 43.2 pounds to 55 sets of 800 reps with 676 1/4 pounds. Now I have to put a take a number system on my bedroom door so all the hot chicks can get there turn wit me.
 Decided to try Optimum Nutrition after spending a bit of time researching options online. This came highly recommended. Tastes great, not full of sweeteners, mixes very well.
 Ordered the Strawberry Banana flavor. Made a shake with the powder and when I went to taste it, I thought I was drinking Pepto Bismol. Strawberry Banana is just an awful flavor.
 This is Junk JUNK junk... Loaded with artificial sweeteners! I have no idea why this product has such great reviews.<br/>I purchased this in strawberry and it was way too sweet. I couldn't even work out because I was too lazy from the artificial sugar crash this gave protein gave me. And gas who wants to smell yucky farts all day?
 As many people have said, the OLD label double rich chocolate is fantastic; it tastes just like chocolate milk. However, the double rich chocolate in the NEW label (as pictured above) has a very weird artificial after-taste.... What the heck happened?
 Tastes like a milkshake
 Shipping arrived on time, product tastes just like chocolate milk
 This is the best protein I have ever tried and probably will never change.  Tastes good, mixes well. Excellent.
 I love this stuff, this tastes just like super sugary chocolate milk and mixes really well. Wish I had this as a kid
 Still my protein powder brand of choice after so many years. Thank you for the wonderful service!
 Great product fast shipping.  You get exactly what is stated. It will build muscle mass IF YOU WORK OUT.  Just with anything else, you still have to train to see results.
 this cake batter... it is way too sweet.
 Good flavor and mixability. Whey is best upon waking and after workout. Problem is I got 10 lbs of this stuff. Oh well!
 excellent
 None beats the quality of this Whey Protein product! Gold Standard indeed!
 Over 20 grams of protein in one tiny scoop with practically no sugar and fat, what else could you ask for? I lift about 2-3 times a week and had just switched over from an ON weight gainer powder to this pure Whey and I feel dramatically different, stronger, and healthier. It mixes very very easy with just a few seconds of shaking in water or milk. I've tried also with a blender but it's really not necessary. Taste wise it's great like a milk shake (I ordered Double Chocolate flavor). Side note, I had been adding too much water or milk the first few trys and it tasted "watered down." I then tried again with less milk this time, maybe about 4 or 5 oz, it tasted great and I felt even better. Happy training!
 for me tastes good with just water.. it dissolves easily without any lumps so it's really easy to drink it straight - bottoms-up!
 Can't go wrong with this, by far the best tasting whey protein I've ever had, like chocolate milk-shake yummm
 I received the package in the appropriate amount of time. The product was great and will definitely buy again. Wonderful flavor as well!
 Taste amazing<br/><br/>Lots of it<br/><br/>Damn scoop was in the middle of the can.
 Thanks!
 The flavor of this product isn't as good as Carb Solutions Vanilla product. Plus, it tends to be a lot more "foamy". I won't order it again.
 The product is great in terms of taste and effect...I have tried double chocolate,vanilla ice cream, and cookies n cream...DO NOT GET COOKIES AND CREAM!! it tastes extremely horrible!
 Quite a large tub, but it tastes good, and mixes as wellas any other brand I tried so far. Can't fault it.
 I have some of this with almond milk, after every work out. It tastes great and a good source of protein.
 Looking to build muscle, try this great tasting whey.  The value can't be beat, I looked and couldn't find it cheaper.
 Best protein out in the market
 It tastes alright, but the problem is that it makes me gassy. Try a smaller quantity somewhere local first to see if you get the same reaction!
 Good value and I've seen great results
 The 3 stars are for delivery time... even though I purchased it under amazon's two day delivery it took 11 days so if you need it right away you might want to buy it from a local store.
 no carbs, if you wanna gain weight use a mass builder with a lot of carbs and calories like BSN TRUE-MASS
 fast shipping. didn't expected to be so large a bottle. well, it's 5 pounds. hope it could have a scoop within it.
 Thing is very good, but I feel like I bought the wrong, chocolate is not I like, but the other is very good,
 Ive had the vanilla, chocolate mint, and double chocolate.  this one taste the worst of the three. Protein is probably good for you but this taste really bad.  Ive had the costco brand chocolate protien shake and that taste better than this.
 This has a great chocolate flavor without being too much chocolate. It blends smooth and makes a really great drink in the morning!
 did anyone read the ingredients?<br/>whey isolate, whey concentrate and peptides.  it doesnt make any sense to mix isolate and concentrate.  concentrate is lower quality whey protein (up to 89%).  isolate is better 90%+.<br/>artificial flavors?  why would you buy it?<br/>check out this article:<br/> ...]
 Throwing 5lbs of chocolate malt to the garbage in 3,2,1...
 Switch any bodybuilder's Whey Protein drink with some Optimum 100% Whey Protein and watch as he wants to put a barbell through your head for giving him a McDonald's shake. Once you have convinced him that it is indeed a Whey Protein supplement he will want to see the list of ingredients with the important protein to carbohydrates to fat ratios that will prove its fatty content... only to discover that Optimum 100% Whey Protein just beats all other Whey Protein into submission with its astonishing lack of fats and higher protein content. So automatically the bodybuilder assumes that the stuff is probably twice the price of other Whey Protein supplements with half the amount until you whip out the bottle that is twice the size of other Whey Protein supplements for the same price. The end result is simply - every single bodybuilder is switching to Optimum 100% Whey Protein. The only downside is finding out that it is not available and having to pay up for a Whey Protein supplement that gives you less and does not taste as good. Once you are supplementing with Optimum 100% Whey Protein it is difficult to swallow another brand. This stuff has revolutionized bodybuilding supplementation.<br/><br/>Calories: 120<br/>-Calories from Fat: 10<br/>Total Fat: 1g<br/>-Saturated Fat: 0.5g<br/>Cholesterol: 30mg<br/>Total Carbohydrates: 3g<br/>-Sugars: 1g<br/>Protein: 24g<br/>Calcium: 140mg<br/>Sodium: 60mg<br/>Potassium: 220mg<br/>Enzyme Blend: 25mg<br/>-Aminogen --<br/>-Lactase --<br/><br/>As an added note: I have tried a few tastes, and Chocolate (also known as Double Chocolate) is one of best all round for everybody.

 Just so you know I did a research on Whey products and found in Consumers Reports a report on how much Mercury and Arsenic and Cadmium and Lead is in these products and this was rated, at least the vanilla was, at one of the lowest in these hazardous poisons.<br/><br/>I've attached the char so you can see for yourself. Direct from consumer reports...
 As a fitness enthusiast and a Science guy, I am always curious to find the real value of a supplement. What works and what does not work. More importantly, I believe the analysis of a product should be based on strong scientific knowledge base, combined with good old fashion practical use of the product, and only then one should come down to the final conclusion.<br/><br/>This product review and analysis was conducted based on 3 parameters<br/><br/>A. Constituents: What comes in the box, the real value of the product<br/>B. Assimilation: How does this product goes down in your system, how much of it will your body assimilate<br/>C. Usability  : Long term usability and and effects.<br/><br/>I believe this is one of the best supplements available in the market today. The Question is Why?<br/><br/>1. The Quality of protein. Since its manufactured by Glanbia (who owns Optimum nutrition), this product is coming straight from the manufacturer. This is a BIG factor, 90% of the protein supplement companies source their raw materials from third parties, often importing them from third world countries.<br/><br/>100 grams of Whey protein isolate from one source is NOT equal to the 100 gram Whey protein isolate from another. Inferior resources usually have high level of Heavy metals and cattle Hormones. This has been elucidated from recent tests and published widely in the consumer reports. ON aced this report with minimum levels of such harmful residues. Reason is simple, they make their own whey in a plant which has to abide all regulations under US law.<br/><br/>Just for the point of reference. I am from India, and therefore know first hand how many poorly regulated cheese plants export their whey to Europe and US. So make sure your Whey protein is coming from Whey extracted in the US!!<br/><br/>The Additives<br/><br/>2. Ideally, I will prefer the protein powder with no artificial sweetener. But lets face it, such a product will be hard to sell. However, Golds whey keep artificial sweeter to minimum. If you check Bodybuilding.com forums, lots of consumer complain that its not sweet enough. I request all such folks to realise that is actually good for them, if you feel this product is not sufficiently sweet for you. Its better you use lesser amount of hydrant (Milk, water, juice etc), or add a tiny bit of Honey.<br/><br/>The Profile- The Myth about Isolate vs a Blend<br/><br/>3. This might be hard for some people to digest. However, the truth is 96% people who use Whey supplements, will have no additional benefits of taking an Isolate vs a Blend. Please note, when I use the word blend, I mean a product lile Golds whey which is well balanced with Whey isolate and Whey Concentrate. (not any junk product form the market). If you take the blend, you might get 1 gram of extra fat or 2 grams of extra carbs which is absolutely nothing. You can burn this by adding 1.5 minute to your jog routine or walking for 2-3 minutes. You will get the same result and effect as the Isolate, so its not worth spending extra refined Isolate. The Isolate rumor is just a Hype created by the supplement industry. I will repeat this again, if your blend is as good as Golds whey i.e you are getting 24 grams per 30 gram scoop, you don't need an Isolate.<br/><br/>Who all comprise the 4% population who can benefit from an Isolate. First people who are extremely lactose Intolerant. I have used the word extremely since all good products add enzymes to digest the little amount of lactose residue in the supplement. Lactose is not a a bad thing, its simply the milk sugar. So if you are highly allergic to Lactose, Isolate will help (they have negligible levels of lactose)<br/><br/>Second tier of people who can benefit from Isolates are professional athletes who are pepping up for an upcoming competition. This competitive set is consuming 5-8+ scoops of Whey protein daily and therefore will benefit from reduction in additional fat or carbs.<br/><br/>4. Why go for Whey protein blend when you have specialized protein powders with Whey,egg and Casein.<br/><br/>Its simple science, Whey is just better with the best Biological value*. This means that your body will better absorb and use the protein source from Whey more than any other source, therefore no wastage. Egg is also a great resource, which is just behind Whey. However in real world it lags behind Whey substantially, even the delayed absorption rate cannot compensate much. Scientifically it has been proven that Whey is just better, since it doesn't tax your digestive processes as much as an egg protein.<br/><br/>Question of Casein:<br/>Its true that Casein has an edge when it comes to delayed absorption. Its anti-catabolic properties and slow absorption makes it an ideal night time protein. This said, its best when you take Casein in concentrated from, i.e. if you need Casein, take only Caesin, do not mix it with Whey... Why do I say this, Its a big topic based on metabolism response(will add a different thread later). One last thing 24 grams of Whey protein is NOT equal to 24 grams of Casein as the Biological value of Casein is lower than Whey.However Caesin does have its own benifit of delayed response, provided you actually need it.<br/><br/>*Biological Value: Biological value (BV) is a measure of the proportion of absorbed protein from a food which becomes incorporated into the proteins of the organism's body.<br/><br/>Whey protein concentrate: 104<br/>Whole egg: 100<br/>Cow milk: 91<br/>Beef: 80<br/>Casein: 77<br/>Soy: 74<br/><br/>Last Thoughts:<br/>Always keep a note of how much protein you are consuming from Supplements Vs straight from the food. Ideally one should keep protein sources from supplements under 25%, but if your life style is demanding and you are unable to get hold of good meals rich in protein, you should always keep your protein dependency under 50%. In layman terms, for most of us who are looking for fitness, keep it not more than 2 scoops/day. For those who really pump some heavy Iron keep it upto than 3 scoops/day. (let me know if you wish to know the science behind this)<br/><br/>In the end Supplements are only Supplements. The word Supplement has a lot of Drama attached to it, as if, if you don't take a protein shake within 30 minutes of your work out.. you will never make good gain. Total Crap. This is not a make or break factor(its just beneficial). Baring few exceptions. Supplements adds up only 20 percent of your fitness equation.<br/><br/>In the real world, for over 90% of us. The fitness equation is something like this.<br/><br/>A  Intensity and Regularity of Workout: 30- 35%<br/>B  Lifestyle and Nutritional Choices:  40- 50%<br/>C  Supplements  :  0 - 20%<br/><br/>So the most important thing is to focus on A%B. Once you have maximized A and B, think about C
 I've bought this same product many times from other retailers and it has been great, for some reason, my purchase through amazon (which turned out to be 15$ cheaper when using the subscribe and save discount) has little to no flavor to the powder - it tastes very chemically with a slight hint of chocolate flavor.  very disguisting to drink when compared to my past experiences with a dozen bags or so through the years...
 I guess that you're supposed to know what "Acesulfame Potassium" is before you buy this.  I didn't realize that it was their artificial sweetener before I bought it because this is the FIRST time that I've seen Aspertame listed as "Acesulfame Potassium".  Why would anyone want to purchase a health product that has an unhealthy ingredient in it?  Total waste of a product and $52.  I did get an awesome migraine out of it this morning after tossing some down before I went to work.  Maybe that's worth $52 somehow?  Nope, not for Toxic GARBAGE.
 You might as well as eat rat poison and be done with it rather than consume this garbage. Chemical protein like this is terrible for the body. Your money would better spent on books about nutrition (hint: fresh fruits and vegetables (and eliminate diary and meat)).
 I was let down by the watered down flavor of the "Double Rich Chocolate".  Especially after just finishing a 5 pound container of the Extreme Milk Chocolate, which lived up to its name 100%.
 I've read a few reviews of this product around here but none have actually managed to define this product. So here I am, explaining my first hand experience with this dietary supplement. Please note - this tastes great but if you're looking for taste, I suggest you go and eat a couple of Twix bars, not whey protein. Also, I will not be talking about proteins, isolates or any other technical term.<br/><br/>I avoided taking supplements for a long time because I thought I didn't need them. Then upon being recommended this particular product by my gym instructor, I purchased it. It came at a steep price but now I have a permanent source so it'll be easier for me to obtain it.<br/><br/>So I took this for forty five days during which I used to gym for about 5 days a week and took rests during the weekends.<br/><br/>Pros<br/><br/>- There was no immediate power surge. In fact, I felt more of an upside in my gym'ing temperament. I became more regular and serious about my workouts. When you pay extra, you consciously or unconsciously tend to focus more. I take this as an upside.<br/><br/>- Towards the second week, it started working. My left arm bicep which lacked precise definition started to shape up. Also, now there is no noticeable difference between the size of my right and left bicep. The left seems to be well shaped and the egg is just placed at the right zone.<br/><br/>- No side effects. None whatsoever. In fact, there are a few sexual upsides which you'll know about once you take it.<br/><br/>- The taste is just right and there are no dirty burps after you finish taking. I take my whey with water because I have heard that milk has calcium which softens the body muscle. I use a fork to mix it in a glass containing an odd 400 ML of water. I mix for around 40 seconds. You can also use your mixer and freeze it as per your convenience but then, that's a bit too fancy for my liking, so choose wisely because you have to do this everyday.<br/><br/>- You don't have to take it on Saturdays (or the day you don't work out on that day) Take this after your workout. The effect is maximized if you're regular at the gym.<br/><br/>- Great Packaging. Difficult to duplicate.<br/><br/>- I didn't lose weight but I gained some exceptional muscle in the 45 odd days I did take this supplement. They say one serving contains 24 grams of proteins. That's mighty and I realized that after using my first 2Lb box.<br/><br/>However, I'm not one of those guys who workout to get a wrestler's physique. Maybe not even half of it. I'm an average height gym enthusiast who would like to be very ripped one day. I weight just about right but this particular whey tends to make you look pretty darn good without your tshirt.<br/><br/>- I did notice an eventual increase in my stamina but then, I'm hardly ever "tired" before I'm working out. I workout in the evenings.<br/><br/>To sum the pros up, it has great taste, seemed to work within a week and eventually managed to shape me up in a very short time. I wasn't badly built before but this toned my muscles up to an extent more universally acceptable.<br/><br/>Whey Protein can also give you size besides toning you up. Increase the weight involved. It should be a gradual increase and you will see the result. However, I avoid doing this since I'd look extremely stocky if I try to grow my arms. For people looking to tone their arms, try working with lighter weights &amp; more reps.<br/><br/>THIS ALSO SMELLS GOOD, TASTES MIGHTY IF MIXED WITH MILK(once in a way unless you intend to do that permanently).<br/><br/>Cons - Lack of instruction manual. No information as to where this is made.<br/><br/>Overall, read the above twice and make your mind up. You can post any questions in form of comments. And no, I haven't used any other whey protein and I doubt I will. Just be regular and START with only a 2Lb box to see if it works for you, like it does for me.<br/><br/>P.S - For you taste lovers, this is better than your cough inducing McDonalds shake. Avoid Vanilla. Strawberry,supposedly, tastes way better.
 USE IT EVERYDAY.. Love this, got it on a subscription to save even more money.  Taste isn't the greatest at first, but one gets used to it.  I'm at a point where I feel that it tastes like chocolate..  Its packed with protein, and good for you.  What else is needed to say..  Big tub, I thought it was way smaller.  Works well.
 good stuff... comparing the nutritional label to the CytoSport from the Makers of Muscle Milk 6 lb bag I usually get at Costco for $30's, but the price is creeping up increasingly.  I've also bought EAS Whey which among these 3 I'd rate bottom on taste and mixability, it also gave me a bloaty/gassy feeling.  The ON has a lot less Cholesterol, Fat, and Sodium per serving.  Both of their chocolate flavors taste great.  I work out everyday doing 5-8 mi of running, followed by weight/strength training so I ordered 2 - 10 lb bags w/ Amazon's Subscribe and Save for my morning protein smoothie and my post work out protein supplement.<br/><br/>Price is good/competitive w/ the S&amp;S and cost effective bulk sizing<br/>Nutritional facts are good<br/>Taste is good<br/>Mixes and goes down well even in plain water.<br/><br/>here is the Nutritional facts from the 3 that I've tried.

 Cheap low quality highly refined and process whey full of Aspartame, artificial sweeteners (sucralose), artificial colors which can irritate the small intestines. Low quality because it comes from pasteurized homogenized milk from grain fed CAFO cows that are fed gmo corn and soy (lowers testosterone and interferes with thyroid function) and pumped with antibiotics(which affect gut health) and synthetic growth hormones (which can cause cancerous cells to grow and causes hormonal imbalances in the body). This crap is for the masses that don't know any better. True bioactive and nutritious whey comes from pastured raised grassfed cows that are fed a clean natural diet of non gmo foods. True whey is processed from RAW non homogenized non defatted grassfed organic milk from healthy cows that lived a happy life. This is not a high quality product, it may work, but at the cost of your long term health. I highly recommend WARRIOR WHEY which is real whey. Also when I used this I would get super bloated for 4 or 5 hours because of all the gluten and artificial crap in it. This is not even certified gluten free! Which is important for Celiacs and Gluten intolerant peeps to know before purchasing it. With that being said, I leave this stuff for the dumb low IQ gym "bros" and I get high quality organic whey for myself. Make good choices with food and supplements, know what you are buying. Just like food always strive to buy organically produced whole food supplement from companies with strong ethics and good manufacturing practices. Be an educated consumer. Bye Amazon shoppers.
 I was very disappointed to find antihealth sucralose in a whey product and I intend to return it.
 I had to throw this out when I discovered a poorly tested artificial sweetener named Acesulfame. Acesulfame may stimulate insulin secretion aggravating low blood sugar attacks. Acesulfame produced tumors, leukemia, and respiratory disease in several rodent studies according to the Center for Science in the Public Interest,
 I've used Optimum Nutrition's Whey Protein for many years and always loved it. Occasionally I have tried other brands and always come back. The price is right and the flavors are usually great. Double Rich Chocolate tastes alright. I'm not going to lie, it doesn't have the best taste. It used to taste quite a bit better but over the years the flavor has changed. Not as good as it used to be but the ingredient list has been improved. With 24 grams of protein and 5 BCAA's, yet only 3 carbs, you can't go wrong!<br/><br/>The powder mixes easily in any shaker bottle. I usually mix it with water, but it tastes better if you mix it with milk and/or some fruit. Goes down easy with a few ice cubes.<br/><br/>Again! This is the best protein on the market for the price! Sure Optimum Nutrition Hydrowhey is a more refined product that can be digested a little better, but for the price you can't beat this Gold Standard.<br/><br/>I have also tried a couple other flavors. Double Rich Chocolate was what I used all the time. But the flavor isn't as good as it used to be so I've experimented with some others lately. I still drink it but I like to mix it up and swap flavors now. If you don't like Double Rich Chocolate, try another flavor. You'll eventually find one you will like.<br/><br/>Here is a list of the flavors I have tried and how I rank them (strictly on flavor alone --- 10 = Perfect .... 1 = Bad)<br/><br/>Banana Cream - 9<br/>Strawberry Banana - 5<br/>Delicious Strawberry - 6<br/>Double Rich Chocolate - 7<br/>Extreme Milk Chocolate - 5<br/>Tropical Punch - 6<br/><br/>Protein is not meant to taste perfect. It's meant to be a workout supplement and the taste is just a bonus. Take them for the nutritional benefits and the ability to use them as a meal replacement. ON Gold Standard is simply the best. You can't go wrong!
 Yes it works
 Think but gives expected result. Goes well with low fat milk.
 So far so good. Doesn’t bloat me up and I’m lactose intolerant. Taste isn’t that chocolaty. I do 3-4 scoops in 16oz of water. I tried 3 in 8oz but that made feel to full. Price is fine, packaging was good and delivery was next day. Gotta love it. 4 stars cause it doesn’t taste that chocolaty.
 Very good protein.
 Tastes good (great for people who don’t like drinks to be too sweet), works well, and comes at a reasonable price point! What more could you want in a protein supplement? I would recommend this product 10/10.
 Great taste in milk and in oatmeals also. Great taste.
 Great
 Really did not like the "chocolate" flavor of this. It also made me feel so bloated and gross every time I had it. It's just sitting in my cabinet because it tastes gross and makes me feel gross. I'm never going to use it
 I used it when working out and it seemed to work as advertised. Tasted pretty good with water or milk (but better with milk, as one might expect). Worth the purchase if you're going to the gym regularly.
 I have been using the Optimum Nutrition’s whey protein for a few years now, and I am very happy. It mixes well, even in a blender bottle. The coffee flavor is fantastic, when mixed with milk and eggs it taste just like a milkshake.
 No heavy taste, actually pretty smooth. Easily mixed with water and spoon. Iv no experienced the bloating as with other products. Almost, made the 82% protein mark, close enough. I would recommend
 An effective way to get more protein into your diet without excess fat or carbs, however this is no replacement for a whole food. This should be used with caution and with a good understanding of what your nutritional intake is and what your nutritional needs are. Otherwise, you're either being counterproductive or depriving yourself of important nutrients.
 No complaints.  Very dependable source of protein.  Blends well in a smoothie.  It is not as overwhelming on the stomach as many other protein powders can be.  Strawberry is nice but gets a little boring.  I would recommend Vanilla then you can add you own fruit in a smoothie.
 This is my favorite protein supplement.  I’ve been taking it for years.  It tastes good mixed with certain food and drinks.  I like the strawberry vanilla flavor best.<br/><br/>It arrived on time and the Amazon price was less expensive than what I’d pay at the gym or store for a similar size can.
 Just eat protein powder and only the powder because "we cuttin".
 Flavor isn't bad but it isn't great. Really strong coffee flavor with a weak chocolate undertone.  The brand itself is my favorite budget friendly and good tasting brand.
 the best
 Tried the chocolate and various vanilla versions. The chocolate one is fine, could be too thick so we mix milk and water. The vanilla one taste too artificial. The coffee one is actually pretty good, has a hint of coffee taste without being too strong.
 Double Rich Chocolate:<br/>Its been a while since I used Whey protein (moved on to plant-based) but when I did use this, man it was delicious. By far some of the best protein shakes I ever had in my life.  The taste was fantastic, the texture was very smooth, and I looked forward to drinking it. Not to mention, of course, the gains that it provided.<br/>If you are looking to purchase a Whey protein powder, nothing beats Optimum Nutrition.
 The best protein, I take it for years!
 Tastes just like strawberries.
 This stuff taste amazing. I drink it after every work out and I love it.
 Great taste, maybe a bit overpriced, but otherwise it is what it says.
 Great flavor and mixing
 Great product great taste for me.  I read reviews of the tastes changing, this is my 3rd time and they have all tasted fine.  I don’t know if I’m getting the original or new formulation, but mine have been consistent on taste!
 74 servings of quality whey, it's a bargain at this price
 good stuff good price
 It is very  VANILLA when you open jar. It's like coffee it smells better than it tastes.  It doesn't taste bad it's just not as good as my nose says. I mix with Almond milk and then make a smoothie out of it, a cup at a time, after mixing a 1/2gallon. It gets a bit slimy if mixed to far in advanced.  I may try another flavor.  I already used key lime pie which I like better than the vanilla. I have more to go.<br/>Oh BTW I'm using this to loose weight, it's working I've lost almost 50lbs so far.
 I normally like this product but the flavor I got - French Vanilla Creme - is too sweet and makes me nauseous when I smell it in powder form. Maybe it’s because of my low carb diet and lack of eating sweetened foods but I much prefer the other vanilla flavor. I also wish they used stevia to sweeten instead of the garbage sweetener. I will look for a better alternative next time.
 Vanilla flavor: I really like using whey rather than using shake mixes! Then I choose what to add and take my OWN vitamins! As yet I haven't bought unflavored whey but that will be next! Then I could add to soups and anything, really, to have more protein! I'm really glad I bought this product. Will buy often!
 good
 I had to double check the label on this product to make sure the carb content wasn't sky high, for only 4g of carbs, only two of which are from sugars, this tastes phenomenal.  I bought the white chocolate flavor as I'd never seen it from any other vendor and I figured it would mix well with other flavors if I wanted to mix things up some.  I mix one scoop of this with about 12oz of unsweetened almond milk (2g carbs) and about 5 grams each of Super Food, glutamine and creatine.  This product already has about 4.5g of glutamine per scoop which is pretty high but I've found about 10g right after a workout helps me tremendously with my recovery and I'm currently squatting 3 days a week (stronglifts 5x5.)  This is all part of my recovery after finally getting the okay from my doctor to start lifting heavy again after my CABG (double bypass) 2 years ago.  Low in sugar, high in glutamine and a solid protein supplement on what is a fairly restrictive diet for me.  I highly recommend this product, great value in the 5lb tub and again, fantastic taste, mixes well, doesn't taste like artificial sweeteners and isn't chalky like some brands.
 I'm so excited to try this. My dad loves using this stuff.
 strawberry is good I would like to try more flavores, but I went with chocolate once and it was quite unplesant to drink. Overall, great product.
 I bought this on a lightning deal. It mixes well in a shaker and tastes great. I will likely buy again.
 Works great, but the cookies and cream taste like dehydrated ass 🤢
 Best protein powder I have ever tried HAND DOWN. I am all about the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor but I have also tried a few others. They all taste GREAT and don't cake up.  The low carb count makes it great for keto diet as well!
 you can feel the difference as soon as you take it.absorb very fast. taste good.
 Great flavor.  Not overpowering.  Mixes easy!
 I LOVE it so far!
 Double Rich Chocolate: good<br/><br/>Extreme Milk Chocolate: better<br/><br/>Rocky Road: not sure yet
 Excellent.
 I absolutely love this protein! The nutrition facts are great in terms of calories, protein, and little sugar. The chocolate flavor is amazing - especially when mixed with milk (fat-free, or course!). I mostly use this protein as a post workout. But I occasionally make shakes for breakfast with a scoop of this along with a banana and some spinach. It's amazing!<br/>The price might look intimidating but order the biggest size. It's definitely the best value and will last awhile.<br/>Helpful Hint: This product goes on sale around New Year's for all you resolutionists out there.
 Good product, always a fan
 Didn't come with scoop
 It does what it is supposed to do, pure protein.  I use it after a heavy workout, others use it more often but my feelings is directly after a heavy weight work out.
 really like this,have it in a smoothie almost every morning.there are probably better powders but not for this price.have used it for years and have absolutely no complaints about it.works for me
